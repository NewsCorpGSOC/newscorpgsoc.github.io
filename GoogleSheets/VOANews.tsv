Vietnam raises GDP growth target to at least 8%, approves China rail link	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam's National Assembly on Wednesday approved raising the economic growth target for this year and also voted in favor of major infrastructure projects, including the country's first nuclear power plants and a rail link to China. Lawmakers approved a new growth target for 2025 of at least 8% proposed by the government, an increase from the previous goal of 6.5% to 7.0%. 'With faster economic growth, macro stability must still be ensured while inflation must be kept under control,' the government said in a report to parliament. The report said inflation would be kept between 4.5% and 5.0% this year. Parliament also passed a resolution supporting construction of a new railway, linking a major seaport in northern Vietnam with China. The project is expected to cost $8.3 billion, part of which to be funded by loans from the Chinese government. Vietnam, a regional manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports to drive its economy, has been seeking to ramp up infrastructure investment to boost growth. Lawmakers approved policies to develop nuclear power plants, the first of which is set to be built by the end of 2031. Under the policies, the government can appoint contractors to construct the plants without holding a tender process. Parliament approved rules that would allow Elon Musk's Starlink to provide satellite internet services in the country while maintaining full ownership of any local subsidiary. And a plan to offer financial support to local firms that enter the semiconductor industry was also supported. On Tuesday, the assembly approved a bold bureaucratic reform plan that will slash up to a fifth of government bodies, as it tries to cut costs and improve administrative efficiency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-raises-gdp-growth-target-to-at-least-8-approves-china-rail-link/7980234.html	2025-02-19T00:47:16-08:00	
Immigration, cost of living frustrate voters as German elections loom	LONDON — Germany is set to hold a general election on Sunday, with voter frustrations over migration at the forefront of a heated campaign. The center-right Christian Democrats are leading the polls with about 29% support, with party leader Friedrich Merz the front-runner to become Germany’s next chancellor. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, Party, which domestic intelligence services are monitoring as a suspected extremist organization, is polling in second place, with 21% support ahead of Sunday’s election. 'I am in favor of the principle that we must make a fundamental distinction between asylum and immigration. The state has not done that so far. Everything is mixed up, and we have had illegal migration into our country for 10 years,' AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said during a televised election debate on Monday. The AfD has steadily risen in support over recent months, said political scientist Wolfgang Schroeder, a fellow at the Berlin Social Science Center. 'This party has gained more and more support over time, interestingly to the same extent that it has become more radicalized,' he told The Associated Press. 'And the main driving force behind this success is, on the one hand, its anti-migration policy, which is very popular in Germany, even in the center of the political spectrum. Then there is their fight against the environmental transformation and their positioning in the Russia war.' The AfD has campaigned against sending military aid to Ukraine and advocates a closer relationship with Russia. The party’s policies have caught the attention of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on his social media platform X in December that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' In an opinion article for Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Musk wrote, 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk later hosted a live chat on X with Weidel. Terror attacks Meanwhile, a recent spate of deadly terror attacks in Germany has intensified the debate over migration. 'And this has been one of the main reasons why the election has been really shifted toward focusing around migration,' said Sarah Wagner, an assistant professor at Queen's University Belfast. 'It’s quite different to the election campaigns that we saw back in 2021, where a lot of the parties were talking quite a lot about climate change, for example,' Wagner told VOA. Despite its growing popularity in some parts of the country, the rhetoric of the AfD and its supporters repulses many Germans. Large protests against the far right have been held in Berlin and other cities in the lead-up to the election. Cost of living While immigration is dominating the campaigns, analysts say the cost of living is at the forefront of voters’ minds as Europe’s biggest economy struggles to emerge from an inflation crisis. Germany’s past reliance on cheap Russian energy and Europe’s rapid severing of ties with the Kremlin have seen prices soar. Germany’s powerhouse carmakers are facing stiff competition from China, while the threat of U.S. import tariffs looms over the election, along with U.S. demands for a huge rise in defense spending. Economic pressures led to the collapse of the three-party coalition government in November. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats wants to increase borrowing to fill a $26 billion hole in the 2025 budget and to help fund military aid for Ukraine. Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union, argues that the country shouldn’t take on more debt and should instead seek to stimulate greater economic growth. 'The economy of the Federal Republic of Germany is now bringing up the rear in the European Union. We are in last place,' Merz told lawmakers on Feb. 11. Firewall Polls suggest that the Christian Democrats will win the election but finish well short of a majority. Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, despite relying on their votes to pass a recent motion in parliament calling for tougher immigration controls. Mainstream German parties have sought to exclude the far right from power since the end of World War II by refusing to enter coalitions or relying on their votes in parliament, a policy known as the 'firewall.' The policy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who surprised delegates at the Munich Security Conference on Friday with a speech focusing on a purported democratic backsliding among European allies. 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t,' Vance said before meeting Weidel on the sidelines of the Munich summit. ‘American interference’ Mainstream German parties united in rejecting Vance’s intervention. On Monday, Scholz said, 'When a vice president interferes in the German election campaign and says extreme right-wing parties are not so bad, I say that we think extreme right-wing parties are bad, and we don’t want to work with them.' Merz echoed those concerns. 'The Americans are questioning democratic institutions. And they are interfering quite openly in an election, including in relation to democratic parties and their majorities. And I have to say, it disturbs me,' Merz told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/immigration-cost-of-living-frustrate-voters-as-german-elections-loom/7979704.html	2025-02-19T00:13:38-08:00	
Russian attack injures at least 4 in Odesa	Officials in southern Ukraine said Wednesday that Russian aerial attacks overnight injured at least four people and damaged civilian infrastructure. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that Russian forces carried out what he called a 'massive' drone attack that disrupted power and heat services. He said the damage included a children’s clinic and a kindergarten. Russian attacks overnight also damaged power lines in the Cherkasy region, where Governor Ihor Taburets said debris from destroyed drones damaged eight houses. Ukraine’s military said it shot down 106 of the 167 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Russia’s military said Wednesday it shot down about 30 Ukrainian drones overnight, mostly over the Bryansk region where officials said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Ukrainian forces attacked an oil refinery overnight in the Russian city of Syzran, in the Samara region. Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said on Telegram that the situation at the refinery was under control, and that the attack caused no major damage. Syzran is about 800 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border, making the attack unusual in how far into Russia Ukrainian forces decided to strike. Most Ukrainian attacks take place in regions along the border between the two countries. Oil facilities and military airfields are among the most common targets for the deeper attacks.

Panama says many migrants deported from the US agree to be returned to home countries	PANAMA CITY — Panama's security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the migrants deported from the United States to transit points Panama in recent days had accepted voluntary repatriations to their home countries, largely in Asia or the Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration recently deported the migrants on three flights, part of his crackdown on unlawful migration. The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, Security Minister Frank Abrego said. 'Today I can tell you that 171 of the (migrants) have accepted to return voluntarily,' said Abrego, adding that the others will leave gradually when the U.N. provides them with their return transportation. In the interim, those migrants will likely be transferred to a shelter near the Darien Gap jungle in southern Panama that connects Central America with South America. After talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month, Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino announced that a deal signed in July with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could be expanded so that Venezuelan, Colombian and Ecuadorean migrants could also be repatriated from Panama.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panama-says-many-migrants-deported-from-the-us-agree-to-be-returned-to-home-countries/7980201.html	2025-02-18T22:59:34-08:00	
New Zealand must ‘reset’ Cook Islands ties after China pact, foreign minister says	New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Wednesday his country must 'reset' its relationship with the Cook Islands government after its Pacific neighbor signed agreements with China without consultation. In a speech to the Pacific Island Political Science Association in Wellington, Peters said Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown’s opaque dealings with Beijing was the latest attempt to test constitutional ties with New Zealand. 'While the connection between the people of the Cook Islands and New Zealand remains resolutely strong, we currently face challenges in the government-to-government relationship,' he said. 'We are going to need to reset the government-to-government relationship.' The Cook Islands is a self-governing nation and maintains free association with Wellington, sharing a head of state and citizenship rights. It is permitted an independent foreign policy, but the two countries are required to consult on security, defense and foreign policy issues. Brown’s visit to Beijing this month resulted in a strategic partnership with China spanning education, the economy, infrastructure, fisheries, disaster management and seabed mining. It set off alarm bells in New Zealand due to concerns with China’s growing presence in the region and the potential threats to the country’s national security. While the Cook Islands government has released details of the strategic partnership, Peters said New Zealand had not seen a number of memoranda of understanding also signed with China. 'New Zealand and the Cook Islands people remain, as of this evening, in the dark over all but one the agreements signed by China and the Cooks last week,' Peters said. Brown’s deal with China follows an attempt by the Cooks to create its own passports and citizenship, a proposal New Zealand said would require the islands to become fully independent to do. Separately, Peters also addressed tensions with Kiribati after its government canceled a planned visit by New Zealand officials at short notice. Kiribati has also signed a series of bilateral deals with China in recent years. Peters said Wellington had committed more than $57 million in aid to the Pacific island nation over the past three years and needed to reassess how funds were being used.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-must-reset-cook-islands-ties-after-china-pact-foreign-minister-says/7980196.html	2025-02-18T22:13:20-08:00	
Questions emerge about what may have caused Delta plane to burst into flames and flip over	TORONTO — Investigators will consider the weather conditions, as well as the possibility of human error or an aircraft malfunction as they try to determine why a Delta Air Lines jet burst into flames and flipped upside down as it tried to land in Toronto, aviation experts said Tuesday. Witnesses and video from the scene Monday afternoon shows the plane landing so hard that its right wing is sheared off. It bursts into flames before sliding down the runway and flipping over. Miraculously, all 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport survived. 'It appears from the video that the plane landed so hard that the right main gear collapsed. The tail and right wing began skidding causing the plane to roll over to the right,' Ella Atkins, the head of Virginia Tech’s aerospace and ocean engineering department and a pilot. 'During the rollover, the right wing and tail sheared off, and a fire ignited, likely due to skidding and fuel leakage at least from a right-wing tank.' All but two of the 21 people injured on the flight have been released from hospitals, the airport CEO said Tuesday. 'How grateful we are there was no loss of life, or life-threatening injuries,' Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said during a news conference. 'The crew heroically led passengers to safety.' Crash investigation Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it’s not clear what went wrong when the plane — a Mitsubishi CRJ-900 made by the Canadian company Bombardier — touched down. Aviation experts said investigators will consider conditions on the ground, the pilot's actions before landing, and potential problems with the landing gear. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is leading the investigation with support from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Juan Browne, a commercial pilot who discusses aviation incidents on his popular YouTube channel, said preliminary data suggests the speed and rate of descent, crosswinds and the weather were 'within limits.' But Browne raised concerns about the pilots' actions before landing. 'It appears that the aircraft simply did not flare at all,' Browne said. Flaring slows the aircraft’s rate of descent. 'They just drove it into the runway.' At the time of the crash, Pearson was experiencing blowing snow and winds of 51 kph, gusting to 65 kph, according to the Meteorological Service of Canada. The temperature was about minus 8.6 degrees Celsius. Browne said blowing snow reduces visibility. Michael McCormick, an assistant professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, said investigators would look closely at the landing gear to make sure it was properly locked in place, and would consider staffing on the ground and in the aircraft. 'They will look at the number of people working both on the aircraft and the control towers. And they will look at their schedules,' McCormick said. 'Are they well-rested? Are they well-staffed?' A Canadian investigator refused to comment on preliminary theories. 'At this point, it’s far too early to say what the cause of this accident might be,' TSB Senior Investigator Ken Webster said in a video statement Tuesday, as he stood near the remains of the aircraft. He said investigators will examine the wreckage and runway, and have removed the cockpit voice and flight data recorders and sent them to the lab for analysis. ‘Everything just kind of went sideways’ Peter Carlson, who was traveling to Toronto for a paramedics’ conference, said the landing was 'very forceful.' 'All the sudden, everything just kind of went sideways and the next thing I know, it’s kind of a blink, and I’m upside down, still strapped in,' he told CBC News. That everyone survived the Delta crash is a testament to the safety improvements made by airlines and aircraft manufacturers, including wings that are designed to come off to reduce explosions, well-trained flight crews and seats built to withstand impacts of up to 16 times the force of gravity. 'That seat is your single best resource in order to keep you protected,' McCormick said. 'There’s a reason why the flight attendants walk around the aircraft prior to (landing) ... to make sure everybody has their seat belts fastened.' But is it safe to fly? The crash was the fourth major aviation accident in North America in recent weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And on Feb. 6, 10 people were killed in a plane crash in Alaska. Nevertheless, according to Jeff Guzzetti, an airline safety consultant and a former FAA and NTSB investigator, air travel is 'extremely safe.' 'The odds of getting injured or killed in a commercial airline accident is far less than driving in your car,' Guzzetti said. Still, he worries about layoffs at the Federal Aviation Administration under the Trump administration. ‘’I am concerned that the proposed cuts and changes to the FAA may increase the risk of further accidents,' he said. The Delta flight was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. Audio recordings show the control tower warned the pilots of a possible air flow 'bump' on approach. 'It was windy, but the airplanes are designed and certified to handle that,' said John Cox, CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida. 'The pilots are trained and experienced to handle that.' Carlson said when he took off his seat belt, he crashed onto the ceiling, which had become the floor. He smelled gas, saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew they all had to get out. Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her son out of the plane, then Carlson dropped onto the snowy tarmac. 'All of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/questions-emerge-about-what-may-have-caused-delta-plane-to-burst-into-flames-and-flip-over-/7980194.html	2025-02-18T22:07:15-08:00	
US condemns 'dangerous' maneuvers by Chinese navy in South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines — The United States condemned the 'dangerous' maneuvers of a Chinese navy helicopter that endangered the safety of a Philippine government aircraft patrolling a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, its ambassador to Manila said on Wednesday. In a post on X, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson also called on China 'to refrain from coercive actions and settle its disputes peacefully in accordance with international law.' The Philippines said late on Tuesday it was 'deeply disturbed' by the Chinese navy's 'unprofessional and reckless' flight actions and that it will make a diplomatic protest. Manila's coast guard said the Chinese navy helicopter performed dangerous flight maneuvers when it flew close to a government aircraft conducting surveillance over the Scarborough Shoal, endangering the lives of its pilots and passengers. China disputed the Philippines' account, saying on Tuesday its aircraft 'illegally intruded' into China's airspace and accused its Southeast Asian neighbor of 'spreading false narratives.' Named after a British ship that was grounded on the atoll nearly three centuries ago, the Scarborough Shoal is one of the most contested maritime features in the South China Sea, where Beijing and Manila have clashed repeatedly. 'The Philippines has undeniable sovereignty and jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc,' its maritime council said in a statement, using Manila's name for the shoal. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claims but Beijing does not recognize the decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-condemns-dangerous-maneuvers-by-chinese-navy-in-south-china-sea/7980179.html	2025-02-18T21:08:50-08:00	
Senate advances nomination of Trump FBI pick Kash Patel	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to advance the nomination of Kash Patel to be the director of the FBI, putting a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a critic of the bureau on track to run the most prominent U.S. law enforcement agency. The Senate voted 48-45 along party lines on a procedural measure setting the stage for a final confirmation vote on one of Trump’s most controversial nominees later this week. Patel, a former intelligence and Defense Department official in Trump’s first term, has called for a radical reshaping of the FBI, pledging to expand its role on illegal immigration and violent crime, core Trump priorities. Patel has been among the most vocal critics of FBI investigations into Trump on issues ranging from Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Florida club and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Democrats have called Patel unfit to lead the FBI, pointing to his embrace of false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and FBI agents fomenting the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Patel has attracted broad support from Republicans, who have touted him as a reformer. A Senate panel voted 12-10 along party lines last week to send his nomination to the full Senate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-advances-nomination-of-trump-fbi-pick-kash-patel/7980183.html	2025-02-18T21:00:05-08:00	
Senate confirms Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary	Washington — The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump's hardline trade policies. At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time — along with Jamieson Greer, Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator — managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike. The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy. At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as 'nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs 'country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports. Trump last week announced plans for 'reciprocal'' tariffs — raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump is commandeering the process. The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened — and delayed until March 4 — 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees — 658 people — that day, including Lutnick's brother. Howard Lutnick led the firm's recovery and is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Lutnick has promised to sell off his business holdings. They're complicated. His financial disclosure statement showed that he had positions in more than 800 businesses and other private organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-howard-lutnick-as-commerce-secretary/7980176.html	2025-02-18T20:31:43-08:00	
Ukrainian drone hits oil pumping station	Russia shot down 21 Ukrainian drones late Tuesday, but a drone attack on an oil pumping station in southern Russia reduced oil supplies for Kazakhstan and the global market, Russian officials said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said one of their drones struck and knocked out a North Korean self-propelled howitzer on the eastern front. 'In Luhansk region, fighters of the 412th separate regiment of Nemesis drones struck a very rare M-1978 North Korean self-propelled artillery vehicle with a gun caliber of 170 mm,' the Ukrainian military posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Russian defense ministry said 20 drones in the Bryansk region on the Ukrainian border and another in Crimea were shot down within an hour late Tuesday. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the drone attack on the pumping station reduced oil flows through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium by 30%-40% on Tuesday. 'As a result of the attack, energy equipment, a gas turbine unit, and a substation were damaged,' he said on Russian television. CPC pumps crude from companies that include Chevron and Exxon Mobil, Reuters reported. Novak said repairs might take several months. Earlier Tuesday, a Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people. Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children. The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region.

Brazil's former President Bolsonaro charged with attempting coup	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil's prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge. Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president. 'The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of 'Green and Yellow Dagger,'' Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. 'The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.' Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil's yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement In November, Brazil's Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital. In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, 'contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.' The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial. The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. 'I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,' Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia. 'Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven't. Neither have I,' he added. Fabio Wajngarten, a lawyer for Bolsonaro, did not immediately comment on the charges but said there will be a statement without saying when. As well as participating in a coup d'état, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General's press office. Gonet said the criminal organization he charged 'had, as leaders, the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.' 'Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,' Gonet wrote in his report. The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general's office. The charges are 'historic,' said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year. 'The charges show Brazil's institutions are robust, independent and agile,' Machado said. 'They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.' Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country's top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system. Following Tuesday's charges, Bolsonaro will 'position himself as a victim,' said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office. 'There are polls saying he would be competitive in the 2026 elections against Lula, one of them published today,' said Melo. 'There's going to be political dust, but it will settle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-former-president-bolsonaro-charged-with-attempting-coup/7980166.html	2025-02-18T19:44:51-08:00	
Chinese influence in South Korea a focus in Yoon impeachment hearings, analysts say	WASHINGTON — South Korea’s Constitutional Court is approaching the final phase of proceedings before it decides in March whether to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his brief martial law bid in December. Since its first official hearing on Jan. 14, exactly a month after the National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon, the court has held nine hearings; the last is scheduled for Thursday. China has become a central issue at some of the hearings, with analysts saying that South Korea-U.S. counterintelligence coordination is crucial in deterring Beijing influence operations that threaten both countries. Yoon's attorney, Cha Gi-hwan, raised concerns about what he alleged was China's interference in South Korean politics, elections and media at several proceedings, apparently in defense of Yoon's statement made in December. Yoon had said 'anti-state forces' were operating in South Korea while explaining his decision to impose martial law at the time and highlighted Chinese nationals using a drone to film a U.S. aircraft carrier docked at the port city of Busan. He had said the opposition parties blocked a revision to anti-espionage law, preventing the prosecution of foreign nationals spying on South Korea. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) pushed for an amendment to the law to broaden its scope from targeting 'enemy states' to include 'foreign countries,' citing threats posed by Chinese espionage. The opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) blocked the revision for fear of potential misuse of the law. Cha said at a hearing on Feb. 11 that China has been interfering in South Korean politics by having its companies and people residing in South Korea fund and support pro-China politicians, manipulate public opinion and spread fake news unfavorable to those who oppose pro-China politicians running for election. Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Dai Bing on Feb. 10 denied widespread accusations among Yoon's supporters that Beijing interfered in South Korean politics and elections. He wrote on X that Beijing 'has all along upheld the principle of noninterference in other countries' internal affairs.' Growing threat In testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month, Dartmouth University professor Jennifer Lind said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts malign influence operations that aim 'to bolster authoritarianism, discredit democratic governance and reshape global norms in China's interests.' The Senate hearing was about 'The Malign Influence of the People’s Republic of China' in the U.S. and abroad. Analysts in Washington said if Yoon is removed from the office, China will conduct full-fledged malign operations in the country. 'I would expect Beijing to increase its efforts, as it sees South Korea's political upheaval as ripe for Chinese malicious intervention,' said Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow at the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University. 'China's goal will be to weaken the democracy and to support those in favor of better ties with Beijing at the expense of the U.S. alliance,' said Wilder, who served as the CIA's deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific from 2015 to 2016. 'The key to defeating China's ambition is intense and sustained counterintelligence programs. The United States has a great deal to teach South Korea in this area, and the CIA and the FBI should work with the South Koreans to improve their ability to spot and deter Chinese covert operations,' Wilder added. 'Everything on the Korean Peninsula affects U.S. security,' said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. 'President Yoon is right to call attention to what China is doing. Ideally, it would be wonderful to have a coordinated [U.S.] response with South Korea.' US-South Korea coordination If the court decides to remove Yoon from office, main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is considered a candidate for an election to be held within 60 days. Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said, 'Statements by party chief Lee Jae-myung indicate the party will pursue a more conciliatory policy toward China and North Korea, more antagonistic toward Japan, and place less emphasis on strengthening the alliance with the United States.' Klingner, formerly the CIA's deputy division chief, told VOA on Thursday, 'The Trump administration will look for South Korea and other Indo-Pacific democracies to pursue stronger policies against the multifaceted China threat, including supporting roles in Taiwan contingencies. The [main] Democratic Party of Korea would resist such entreaties, which will cause strains with Washington.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said at a news conference after meeting with NATO defense ministers in Belgium on Thursday that working with Pacific allies South Korea, Japan and Australia will be 'critical' in dealing with the Chinese threat.

66 measles cases reported in US states of Texas, New Mexico	Measles is making a comeback in the United States. Fifty-eight cases of the highly contagious disease were reported Tuesday by health officials in rural West Texas, while eight cases were confirmed in neighboring eastern New Mexico. Texas officials say the outbreak there, the largest in almost 30 years, is mainly confined to Gaines County, with 45 infections, but four other counties account for an additional 13 cases. The Texas measles cases, according to health officials, have occurred mainly among a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community. Authorities say at least three of the New Mexico cases are in counties that border Texas' Gaines County. Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 14 measles cases across the country. Mayo Clinic describes measles as 'a childhood infection caused by a virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine ... measles spreads easily and can be serious, and even fatal, for small children.' Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for two hours. As many as nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. However, in recent years, the necessity and safety of the vaccinations designed to prevent the disease have come under question, with some parents citing a now-discredited study that linked the measles vaccine to autism. Another unfortunate development in the fight against measles happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when many children missed their vaccinations. Los Angeles Cedars Sinai said in a statement in February 2024 that 61 million fewer doses of the measles vaccine were distributed nationwide from 2020 to 2022. Before the MMR vaccination, which addresses not only measles, but also mumps and rubella, was introduced in the U.S. in 1963, there were 3 million to 4 million measles cases every year. Now there are usually fewer than 200 cases per year, but pockets of measles persist in areas that still resist the vaccinations. The shots are first given to toddlers between 12 and 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years of age.	https://www.voanews.com/a/measles-cases-reported-in-us-states-of-texas-new-mexico/7980149.html	2025-02-18T19:04:11-08:00	
Saudi prince proving crucial to Trump efforts to end Ukraine, Gaza wars	WASHINGTON — Top U.S. and Russian officials wrapped up their meetings Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a pathway to end the war in Ukraine, days before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to convene a summit with leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to discuss an Arab response to U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to take over Gaza. The two separate talks reflect the growing role of the prince in Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. On Tuesday, Trump again declared he would swiftly end fighting. 'I have the power to end this war,' Trump said from Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida, dismissing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's concern that Kyiv was excluded from the Riyadh meeting. 'Well, you've been there for three years, you should have ended it,' he said of Zelenskyy in response to a reporter's question. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land.' Trump did not clarify which part of land would remain Ukrainian. Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and now controls parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, and fighting has been ongoing at the borders of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Saudi talks signaled a major détente between Washington and Moscow and an abrupt end of U.S. policy under former President Joe Biden to isolate Russia and support Ukraine 'for as long as it takes.' Instead, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dangled the prospects of 'the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians' on trade and other global issues when the war ends. Arab response to Gaza plan Later this week, Prince Mohammed will bring together leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE to discuss an Arab response to Trump's vow to take over Gaza and create a 'Riviera in the Middle East' by expelling Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries. Trump's plan has angered regional leaders, who are now scrambling to come up with a counteroffer that they will discuss in Riyadh ahead of a broader Arab League gathering in Cairo next week. One of the Arab proposals being discussed is an Egyptian-led plan that involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas and raising up to $20 billion from Arab and Gulf states over three years for reconstruction. As Saudi Arabia makes a play for the diplomatic mainstage, Prince Mohammed is motivated to be proactive rather than reactive, to counsel pragmatism rather than rigidity, said Laura Blumenfeld, a senior fellow and Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. Blumenfeld told VOA that the prince could pair his approach with a language that Trump likes to speak: investments. This week, global financiers and tech executives will gather in Miami, Florida, in a conference hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, a nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund led by the prince. Reuters, quoting several people with knowledge of the event, reported that Trump is scheduled to deliver an address at the meeting. 'Trump is a peacemaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Nobel Prize. [The prince] is a dealmaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Saudi Vision 2030 economic diversification plan,' Blumenfeld added. 'The two men are a match made in transactional heaven.' Prince Mohammed the power broker With his efforts focused on Ukraine and Gaza, the 39-year-old de facto leader of Saudi Arabia has emerged as a power broker that Trump leans on for his foreign policy goals. Prince Mohammed has done this in part by leveraging close ties during Trump's first term, maintaining business ties while Trump was out of office, and further expanding the relationship since the president's inauguration last month. Saudi Arabia was Trump's first foreign trip in 2017, where he signed several deals, including a $110 billion arms deal, which could expand up to $350 billion over 10 years. Trump spoke openly about the transactional nature of the visit, telling reporters days after his second inauguration in January that the reason he chose Riyadh for that first visit was because 'they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products.' Trump suggested on the day of his last inauguration that he would again make Saudi Arabia his first destination in return for Saudi funds, and days later, the prince told him during a phone call that he planned to invest $600 billion or more in the U.S. over the next four years. In 2021, Saudi Arabia invested $2 billion with a firm that belonged to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former aide. The Trump Organization has also expanded its real estate presence in the region, announcing it had leased its brand to two real estate projects in Riyadh in December after launching the Trump Tower project in Jeddah. As Prince Mohammed cultivated his political and business ties with Trump, he maintained a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid Biden's effort to isolate the Russian leader following his 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'The crown prince has been making the argument for the last five years that it's in America's interest that Saudi Arabia maintains very good ties with Russia and China,' said Ali Shihabi, author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia. 'Saudi Arabia was insisting on maintaining a multipolar policy while maintaining very strong ties with the United States,' he told VOA. The prince is poised to host a summit between the two leaders that Trump said he agreed to during his call with Putin last week. The summit, Shihabi said, would be an example of how the prince's gambit has paid off. 'I don't think there are any leaders in the world that have the relationship that the crown prince has with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump,' he said. There is also a practical reason. The kingdom is not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-prince-proving-crucial-to-trump-efforts-to-end-ukraine-gaza-wars/7980148.html	2025-02-18T18:54:02-08:00

Sudanese RSF paramilitaries kill 100s in White Nile state	CAIRO — Attacks by Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force have killed hundreds of civilians, including infants, in White Nile state, Sudanese officials and rights groups said Tuesday. Sudan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the paramilitary group targeted civilians in the past few days in villages in the al-Gitaina area after they were 'overwhelmed by its devastating defeat' by the Sudanese army. The statement put the death toll at 433, while the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors' Trade Union put that figure at 300. Emergency Lawyers, a rights group tracking violence against civilians, said in a statement Tuesday morning that more than 200 people, including women and children, were killed in RSF attacks and hundreds of others were injured over the past three days. 'The attacks included executions, kidnapping, forced disappearance, looting, and shooting those trying to escape,' the group said. Minister of Culture and Information Khalid Ali Aleisir said on Facebook that recent attacks by the RSF in Al-Kadaris and Al-Khalwat villages in White Nile state are the latest 'systematic violence against defenseless civilians.' The Sudanese military said Saturday it had advanced in White Nile and 'liberated more cities and villages,' cutting crucial supply routes to the RSF, a rival group it has battled for control of the country since April 2023. The war in Sudan has killed more than 24,000 people and driven more than 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries. The U.N. on Tuesday said that throughout 2024, its human rights office documented more than 4,200 civilian killings, adding that the total number is likely much higher. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed on Monday for $6 billion for its 2025 humanitarian response in Sudan, to help about 21 million people in the country and the millions who fled the war abroad. 'This is a humanitarian crisis that is truly unprecedented in its scale and gravity,' said U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher in a statement, 'and it demands a response unprecedented in scale and intent.' Meanwhile, Norwegian Minister of International Development Asmund Aukrust denounced the escalation in violence and attacks against civilians. 'I am deeply concerned about the sharp increase in civilian deaths caused by the intensified conflict in Sudan. I am also shocked by reports of indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. Any such attacks must stop immediately,' Aukrust said in a statement published on the web portal for the Norwegian government. The developments on the ground have given the military the upper hand in the war as the paramilitary suffered multiple blows, including losing control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The Sudanese military also regained control of the country's largest oil refinery. The RSF appears to have lost control of the Greater Khartoum area and the cities of Omdurman and Khartoum Bahri. The war has shown no end in sight despite international mediation attempts, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-rsf-paramilitaries-kill-100s-in-white-nile-state-/7980135.html	2025-02-18T18:24:46-08:00

Yazidi woman enslaved by Islamic State relocates to Germany months after rescue	WASHINGTON — A Yazidi woman who survived rape and enslavement by Islamic State and was rescued from Gaza last October in a U.S.-led operation arrived in Germany on Tuesday, February 18. Fawzia Amin Saydo, 21, was kidnapped by IS militants from her hometown of Sinjar, northern Iraq, in August 2014, just a month before her 11th birthday. She endured a decade of suffering, including rape, enslavement and forced marriage to a Palestinian IS fighter in Syria before being sent to Gaza to live with her captor's mother. She was rescued from Gaza on October 1, 2024, during a secret U.S.-led operation that involved cooperation among human rights activists, as well as Israeli, Jordanian, Iraqi and United Nations officials. Saydo arrived about 5 p.m. local time at Hannover Airport in Langenhagen, Germany, where she was received by her lawyer, Kareba Hagemann, a group of relatives and human rights activists. 'She has arrived in Germany safely, and she is very relieved,' Hagemann told VOA. 'The first thing Fawzia said upon her arrival was, 'Please make sure my family can also come join me and live here with me.'' The German consulate in Baghdad on February 10 issued Saydo a visa on a humanitarian basis. Her mother, grandmother and five siblings are still in Iraq. 'Her family, except her two sisters, wanted to go as well, but the German government made it clear that they will only agree to take in Fawzia,' Hagemann said. 'There is no legal obligation to take her, but it is an act of humanity, which is why I was thankful to them to agree to take Fawzia at least.' According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, Germany is the third-largest refugee-hosting country in the world and the largest in the European Union, with 2.5 million refugees from all over the world, including more than 1 million refugees from Ukraine. Since the 2014 Yazidi genocide carried out by Islamic State in northern Iraq, the number of Yazidi asylum-seekers in Germany has risen to more than 200,000. The ongoing debate within German society about deporting refugees, however, has put many asylum-seekers from the religious minority at risk of deportation. This is particularly due to some politicians arguing that the defeat of IS in 2017 has ended group-specific persecution in Iraq — a claim contested by human rights organizations. On Monday, German authorities announced the deportation of 47 Iraqis whose asylum applications had been denied. Among the more than 300,000 Iraqi refugees and migrants living in Germany, refugee organizations estimate that nearly 700 Iraqis were deported in 2024 alone, with about 10,000 currently facing the risk of deportation. Hagemann, who is also a Yazidi, told VOA the uncertainty has taken a psychological toll on many Yazidi asylum-seekers who fled Iraq due to persecution. While the exact number of deported Yazidis remains unclear, she estimated that at least five have been sent back to Iraq and the Kurdistan region. 'Those Yazidis want to build their new life and integrate, even though some of them find it hard to learn a new language because of their trauma,' Hagemann said. 'Unfortunately, most of them are not as lucky as Fawzia to be supported, and [they] decide to come to Germany illegally, where they face deportation and have been held in captivity for years.' In January 2023, the German Bundestag [parliament] passed a resolution that recognized Islamic State's crimes against Yazidis as genocide. Since then, the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein have enacted laws to protect Yazidi asylum-seekers from deportation. Hagemann argued that allowing Yazidi survivors, particularly those who have been victims of rape, to remain in Germany would provide them with a chance to heal — an opportunity, she said, they cannot find in Iraq. 'We have been able to schedule a therapy session for Fawzia on Thursday, just two days after her arrival in Germany, to enable her start a self-determining life again,' Hagemann said. Rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have reported that Yazidi survivors do not get adequate psychological support upon their return to Iraq. Activists from the Montreal-based Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq (CYCI), who assisted Saydo in relocating to Germany, stated that her return from Gaza to Iraq only marked a minor improvement in her life, as she continued to endure neglect and targeting from militants in her hometown of Sinjar. 'She kept saying, 'I have been brought from one hell to another,'' said human rights activist and CYCI member Dawood Jajju, describing Saydo's dire situation in Iraq. Activists say Saydo and her family were threatened by Iraqi militants three weeks after her return to Sinjar after she appeared in a news article in which she praised Israel for its role in taking her out of Hamas-controlled Gaza. Iraqi officials tasked to work on her case were not available to comment. Steve Maman, founder of CYCI, told VOA that Saydo was summoned several times by Iraqi authorities 'who mistakenly believe she is a Zionist and an Israeli-trained agent.' 'Fawzia did not receive any therapy at all. The country has not made any effort or gesture to help her. It seems that Yazidis are second-class citizens in their own country,' Maman said. When Islamic State attacked the Sinjar region in 2014, the group killed nearly 10,000 Yazidis and enslaved more than 6,000 of women and children. Data from the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Region show that some 3,500 Yazidis have been rescued or freed, with some 2,600 still missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-woman-enslaved-by-islamic-state-relocates-to-germany-months-after-rescue/7979829.html	2025-02-18T17:29:29-08:00

Judge won't block Musk, DOGE from federal data, layoffs	WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Tuesday to immediately block billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate questions about Musk's authority but said there isn't evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenging DOGE's authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or confirmed by the Senate. The Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public cheering of the effort, Musk isn't directly running DOGE's day-to-day operations himself. DOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with the blessing of President Donald Trump, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law. Chutkan recognized the concerns of the group of states, which include New Mexico and Arizona. 'DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion,' she wrote. Their questions about Musk's apparent 'unchecked authority' and lack of Congressional oversight for DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them later. Still, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE's work will affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to block specific, immediate harms, she found. Chutkan, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-won-t-block-musk-doge-from-federal-data-layoffs-/7979818.html	2025-02-18T16:35:52-08:00	
Trump signs order to study how to make IVF more accessible, affordable	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro fertilization and make it more affordable. The order calls for policy recommendations to 'protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments,' according to the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court nominees helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to a wave of restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at conception. Trump, who was at his Florida residence and club Mar-a-Lago, also signed another executive order and a presidential memorandum. The second executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more transparency from the government, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who Trump called to the podium to detail the orders. The order called for 'radical transparency requirements' for the government, requiring it to detail the 'waste, fraud and abuse' that's found as the Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by Elon Musk, looks to cut government spending. DOGE has often fallen short of the administration's promises of transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since becoming Trump's most powerful adviser, and he's claimed it's illegal to name people who are working for him. Sometimes DOGE staff members have demanded access to sensitive government databases with little explanation. According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, Trump's IVF order will focus on prioritizing whether there are any current policies 'that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments.' Last year, Trump declared public support for IVF after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. The decision, which some Republicans and conservatives cheered, touched off immediate backlash. Families 'appreciative,' says Trump On the campaign trail, IVF quickly became a talking point for Trump, who said he strongly supports its availability. In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be required. 'I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it,' Trump said in brief remarks on the order, before he took questions on a variety of topics. Trump, who spent the morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, spoke to reporters hours before his first joint TV interview with adviser Elon Musk airs in prime time. Trump and Musk gave their first joint interview to Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel. The interview was taped on Friday at the White House and is set to air as Musk leads Trump's effort to cut federal spending and slash the federal workforce. Musk has drawn criticism from Democrats in Congress and others for the methods he and his team at DOGE are using to cut spending, including foreign aid, and eliminate jobs across the bureaucracy. The Fox News interview also follows Musk's appearance with Trump in the Oval Office last week, when both defended Musk's approach to federal cost-cutting. In an excerpt from the interview that Fox News released on Sunday, Musk said he 'used to be adored by the left' but 'less so these days' because of the work he's doing at Trump's direction. 'They call it Trump derangement syndrome. You don't realize how real this is until you can't reason with people,' Musk said, adding that normal conversations with Democrats about the president are difficult because 'it's like they've become completely irrational.' Event celebrates 'American Exceptionalism' Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club is the setting Tuesday night for an awards program by America's Future, a conservative group led by Mike Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser in the Republican president's first term. The program aims to preserve individual rights and promote American values and traditions, according to its website. The event, called Celebrate American Exceptionalism 2025, will honor one member from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Space Force. The event includes a poolside reception, musical performances and dinner in Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom, where other award presentations are expected from a lineup that includes such names as comedian Russell Brand, singer Ted Nugent and former pro boxer Mike Tyson. It's unclear whether Trump will participate in the event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-study-how-to-make-ivf-more-accessible-affordable/7979778.html	2025-02-18T16:28:35-08:00

US Postal Service head to step down after 5 years	Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts. In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor. 'As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary transformation,' he wrote. 'We have served the American people through an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and sensationalized politics.' DeJoy took the helm of the Postal Service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee. DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to 'uncomfortable' rate hikes as the Postal Service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient. The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery. DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in facilities and making other changes to create 'a Postal Service for the future' that delivered mail more quickly. DeJoy also oversaw the Postal Service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the Postal Service's cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery. DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped the agency's longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some mail was left to be delivered the following day. DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being 'as helpful as possible in facilitating a transition.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-postal-service-head-to-step-down-after-5-years-/7979825.html	2025-02-18T15:48:40-08:00

Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai's 'time is running out,' son says	As pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai spoke in his defense at a Hong Kong court Tuesday, his son Sebastien Lai was in Geneva calling for the United States and other world leaders to help secure this father's release. Speaking on Tuesday at the latest hearing in his national security trial, Lai, 77, denied any intention to incite violence among protesters. He defended an opinion piece published in 2019 in the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper that he founded in which he suggested that pro-democracy protesters establish a leadership structure to weed out those who wished to engage in violence during protests that year. 'By saying they should choose a leadership group, [it means that] they should put down some principle or bottom line for the valiant acts which, basically, is for them to stop the violence,' Lai said in court. The British national has been standing trial for more than a year on charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under Hong Kong’s national security law. Lai rejects the charges, which foreign governments and press freedom groups have said are politically motivated. Hong Kong authorities deny that the trial is unfair and have previously told VOA that the government respects press freedom and the rule of law. Lai has been in solitary confinement since late 2020. Sebastien Lai raised concerns about his father’s health as he advocated for him in Geneva. 'I ask that you join my call to free Jimmy Lai and champion him for all he’s given in the hope of freedom,' the younger Lai said Monday at the annual Human Rights and Democracy summit in Geneva. When Beijing’s national security law was enacted in Hong Kong in 2020, Sebastien Lai said his father knew he would be a target. 'But he refused to leave,' he said. 'Six decades after landing on the shore of this island in pursuit of freedom, he decided to stay and stand with his fellow protesters.' Jimmy Lai was born in Guangzhou, China, and fled to Hong Kong when he was 12. He worked in a garment sweatshop before eventually founding the successful clothing brand Giordano. He later moved into media, founding Apple Daily in 1995. Both the United States and Britain have criticized Hong Kong’s case against him. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump in October said he would '100%' get Lai released, without specifying details. Sebestien Lai said Trump’s comment gave the family 'a lot of hope.' But he cautioned that time is running out for his father, who has diabetes. The publisher’s international legal team says he isn’t receiving adequate medical care, which authorities deny. 'His body is breaking down,' Sebastien Lai told Reuters ahead of the summit. 'Time is running out for my father.' Lai’s international legal team urged global leaders to stand up for press freedom at the U.N. Human Rights Council next week. 'How the world responds will send a vital message to authoritarians across the world,' Caoilfhionn Gallagher, head of Lai’s international legal team, told Reuters. Gallagher and her team at the London law firm Doughty Street Chambers have faced significant harassment for their role defending Lai. On social media and in email, Gallagher has faced threats of death, rape and dismemberment, The Guardian reported. She has also been targeted with hundreds of attempts to hack her bank account. The Bar Council, the representative body for barristers in England and Wales, expressed concern about the harassment.

More than 170 migrants now detained at Guantanamo Bay	WASHINGTON — The United States has more than doubled the number of detainees — both those deemed to be a 'high threat' as well as others slated for deportation — at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As of Tuesday, there were more than 120 of what the administration calls 'criminal aliens' under guard at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, according to a U.S. defense official. Approximately 50 other individuals are also being held at the base's migrant facility, which was being readied to hold nonviolent individuals. Separately, a second U.S. defense official told VOA that as of Monday, the U.S. military had sent a total of 13 flights of undocumented migrants to Guantanamo aboard a mix of C-17 and C-130 military cargo jets. So far, none of the detainees brought to the facilities at Guantanamo Bay have been deported to other countries. Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the military's deportation operation. VOA has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about the growing number of detainees. Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers there were about 68 detainees at the base's prison facility. Admiral Alvin Holsey also told lawmakers that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts are underway to allow it house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. Holsey said that it was too soon to determine how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. 'We're working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said during Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'We're not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' Details about the growing population of detainees at the U.S. naval base in Cuba come just a day after the Department of Homeland Security unveiled what it described as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning migrants not to enter the U.S. illegally. 'If you are considering entering America illegally, don't even think about it,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video targeting an international audience. 'If you come to our country and you break our laws, we will hunt you down,' she said. 'Criminals are not welcome in the United States.' Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of a third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. Last Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS has dismissed the lawsuit's allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens — they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-170-migrants-now-detained-at-guantanamo-bay/7979741.html	2025-02-18T14:23:41-08:00	
Iran charges British couple with spying	A British couple detained in Iran last month has been charged with spying, Iran's state media reported Tuesday. Britain's Foreign Office has identified the couple as Craig and Lindsay Foreman. 'The detained individuals entered the country as tourists and collected information in several provinces of the country,' reported Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan news agency. Iran has accused the couple of having connections with 'hostile countries.' 'We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran,' a British Foreign Office spokesman said Tuesday. 'We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.' The Associated Press reported that Hugo Shorter, Britain's ambassador to Iran, has met with the couple in the southern city of Kerman, where they are jailed, with Iranian government officials in attendance. The Foreign Office said it is providing the couple with consular assistance and is in close contact with their family. The couple's family said in a statement on Saturday, after the couple's arrest, 'This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time.' The family said it is 'united on our determination to secure their safe return.' The two were traveling around the world on motorbikes, according to an AP report, which said that they crossed Armenia's border into Iran on December 30. Iran has long used Western detainees to gain concessions in negotiations with Western countries, a move Tehran denies. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-charges-british-couple-with-spying-/7979677.html	2025-02-18T12:53:46-08:00	
After resolutions on Sudan, DRC at African Union summit, analysts urge swift action	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Regional analysts are calling for the swift implementation of resolutions made at the recently concluded African Union (AU) Summit in Ethiopia. The summit was dominated by discussions on escalating conflicts in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan, as well as concerns over the impact of U.S. aid cuts on the continent. African leaders and delegates from more than 50 countries gathered in Addis Ababa for the 38th AU Summit on Saturday and Sunday. Leaders at the summit called for dialogue to end conflicts in the DRC and Sudan and renewed calls to merge two existing peace processes — the Rwanda Process and the Nairobi Peace Process — to streamline negotiations between the DRC government and M23 rebels. Bankole Adeoye is the AU commissioner for political affairs, peace, and security, expressed concerns about the escalation of the conflict in the DRC. 'We are all very, very concerned about the risk of an open regional war over eastern DRC,' Adeoye said. 'We have reiterated the need for caution and called on the M23 rebels and their supporters to disarm and withdraw.' More than 3,000 people have been killed in clashes between government forces and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group. The rebels have captured large Congolese cities, including Goma and Bukavu. African leaders also condemned human rights violations caused by the nearly two-year conflict in Sudan. But security analyst Senator Iroegbu said African leaders need to match words with action this time. 'If what's happening in DRC is not well managed it will escalate,' Iroegbu said. '[It's] not just issuing a communique at the end of the meeting; it should be followed up with some strategic measures or plans to ensure that they bring some of these issues to the table and set up mediation teams and let’s look for African solutions to African problems.' Beyond security, leaders further addressed the impact of climate change and food security on the continent, while demanding reparations for centuries of slavery and colonialism. John Mahama, president of the Republic of Ghana, said the economic impact of colonialism has been profound. 'The continent lost trillions of dollars in both human and material resources due to colonial exploitation,' he said. 'Today the descendants of enslaved Africans continue to face economic disparities, social inequality, systemic discrimination and racial prejudices. Addressing these challenges [requires] more than just acknowledging them, it demands action.' African leaders also discussed the impact of U.S. aid cuts, urging the continent to focus on self-sufficiency and domestic funding for development projects. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, spoke to Lagos-based Channels Television on the sidelines of the summit. 'Africa we really need to change our mindsets — access to aid I think we can think of it as a thing of the past,' she said. 'We really have to focus on two things — attracting investments and mobilizing our own domestic resources. I think that is the theme that is running through almost all the meetings here at the AU.' Many observers will be watching to see how quickly African leaders move to implement summit resolutions. But analysts warn that delays in securing peace in Sudan and Congo could lead to more casualties and prolonged instability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-urge-swift-action-after-resolutions-on-sudan-drc-at-african-union-summit-/7979599.html	2025-02-18T11:50:45-08:00	
Rubio snubs South Africa's G20 meeting amid diplomatic tensions	Johannesburg — South Africa will host a meeting of foreign ministers from the G20 group of major economies later this week, but the chief diplomat for the world’s largest economy, the U.S., is skipping it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X earlier this month that he would not attend the meeting, taking place Thursday and Friday in Johannesburg, because he objected to the meeting’s agenda, which he described as anti-American. He said South Africa was 'using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality, & sustainability.’ In other words: DEI and climate change. My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.' DEI is short for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and in President Donald Trump’s first week in the White House, he signed an executive order to end DEI policies and hiring practices in the federal workforce. 'I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity, and these sorts of things,' Rubio later told the press. He continued by saying the forum should be focused on issues 'like terrorism and energy security and the real threats to the national security of multiple countries.' The G20 is a group of the world’s 19 major individual economies as well as the EU and African Union. This year marks the first time an African country is in the rotating presidency position of the G20. While Rubio will not attend, the South African government has confirmed the U.S. will still have a presence at the meeting, likely at a lower level. South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation responded to Rubio in a statement saying: 'Our G20 Presidency, is not confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations of the Global South, ensuring an equal global system for all.' Ronald Lamola, minister of international relations and cooperation, told local TV that the meeting’s agenda had been adopted by all members of the G20 and carries on the themes from previous summits, such as the one in Brazil last year. Deteriorating relations Even before the announcement that Rubio would not be taking part in the foreign ministers’ meeting, there had been a swift deterioration in U.S.-South Africa relations under the new administration in Washington. President Trump accused South Africa’s government of engaging in land grabs and mistreating white minority Afrikaners. He cut U.S. financial assistance to the country. While the South African government did pass a controversial land reform law earlier this year, no land has been seized. The white minority is still one of the country’s most privileged communities and owns the majority of private farmland. Response from other G20 members Several other nations were quick to affirm their attendance at the meeting after Rubio said he will not attend. Those included EU members Germany, Italy and France, whose ambassadors to South Africa posted a joint video on X saying they were 'united in diversity' and shared the South African government’s democratic values. Russia also confirmed Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend. 'The priorities stated by the South African presidency are designed to encourage economic growth, reduce inequality and imbalances, and ensure equitable access to financing for countries in the Global South.,' said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. China likewise confirmed its commitment to the meeting, with ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng meeting foreign minister Lamola just after Rubio’s announcement and posting on X: 'I also expressed China's readiness to support South Africa's G20 Presidency.' Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, said in a press briefing, 'China stands ready to work with all parties to make this meeting a productive one, and send a strong message of supporting multilateralism, strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and jointly responding to global challenges,' he said. Analysts weigh in Political analysts said Rubio’s absence could provide space for countries hostile to the U.S. to advance their agendas. 'Will we see the increase of countries like Russia and China pushing their lines, their issues, their perspectives in the absence of the US? That’s entirely possible,' Steven Gruzd, from the South African Institute of International Affairs, told VOA. Brooks Spector, a retired U.S. diplomat, said Rubio’s boycott of the meeting was 'a serious misstep.' 'You get to make your points at a meeting, boycotting it simply means your voice is not heard,' he said. 'Calling the meeting 'anti-American' is a misunderstanding of the nature of bilateral, international and multi-lateral discussions.' However, he said he expected Trump would likely still attend the major G20 summit in South Africa in November. In December, the U.S. will take on the presidency of the G20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-snubs-south-africa-s-g20-meeting-amid-diplomatic-tensions/7979557.html	2025-02-18T11:26:58-08:00	
Pakistan set to host first major cricket event in three decades	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is ready to host the International Cricket Council Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday, with eight teams coming together for a major cricketing event in the country for the first time in three decades. Pakistan last hosted a men’s Cricket World Cup in 1996 under the International Cricket Council. The Champions Trophy will see players from Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand Pakistan, and South Africa compete over almost three weeks, with the final scheduled for March 9. All the teams except India will play in three stadiums across Pakistan. All matches involving India will be staged in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after the Indian cricket board refused to send the team to the archrival country, citing security concerns. Afghanistan’s cricket team faced boycott calls from politicians in England and South Africa, who did not want their cricket boards to play the team because of the Afghan Taliban’s severe restrictions on women’s mobility, education and ability to work. The cricket series begins in Pakistan’s biggest metropolis, Karachi, with the host team playing New Zealand. Long wait for this opportunity International cricket dried up in Pakistan after a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan national team in Lahore injured six players. Six Pakistani police officers and two passersby were killed. The incident deprived Pakistan of the chance to host the 2009 Champions Trophy and the 2011 Men’s Cricket World Cup. International cricket returned with Zimbabwe’s visit in 2015. Since 2019, several major foreign teams have played in Pakistan. For the nation of cricket lovers, attending a large event at home after more than a decade is nothing short of a dream come true. 'It’s the biggest event for us since 2009, so we are very excited,' said Mohsin Ali. Ali told VOA he paid just over $10 for a ticket to see Pakistan face Bangladesh on Feb. 27 in Rawalpindi, near the capital, Islamabad. 'Pakistani team would play overseas, and we would watch it on TV, which wasn’t much fun,' said Ubaid Hassan, who was a child when international teams shunned Pakistan. Hassan, a captain of the cricket team in his village, has tickets to two matches. Tight security for the event Pakistan is deploying almost 20,000 police officials and personnel across Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi for security on game days, with snipers deployed on buildings surrounding the stadiums. The security situation remains poor in Pakistan with near daily deadly militant attacks in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces. However, the country’s eastern province of Punjab and the southern province of Sindh, where the matches will be played, remain largely calm. Still, in Karachi, the capital of Sindh, paramilitary troops and the military will be on standby to respond to security emergencies during the event. Players are receiving state guest-level security. That means a heavy police contingent at hotels where teams are staying, with their travel routes cleared of all traffic. Only personnel with security clearances are allowed to interact with them. Muhammad Waqas, deputy inspector general of operations for the Punjab police, told VOA that since the 2009 attack, 'sports security and security of international events has become very important for us.' 'Even the slightest administrative lapse will cause embarrassment at a very large level, and if we do a good job and manage things efficiently, the same positive impression will go to a billion odd people,' Waqas said. 'That is why it’s extremely important and is being planned and monitored at the highest level.' Fans coming to the stadium will go through several layers of security, including metal detectors and pat downs. Each ticket bears the name and national identity card number of the buyer. Could be good for nation's image While it’s not clear how many visas have been issued to foreign fans, cricket experts in Pakistan say the event will help improve the country’s image, which has suffered partly because of a lack of international exposure. 'When you don’t have tourists, then people will not know how your country is and people will keep thinking poorly of Muslims and Pakistanis,' said Tauqir Zia, former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Although India’s absence from Pakistan’s grounds is a disappointment for many Pakistani cricket lovers who wanted to see the sport’s biggest rivalry play out at home, some say the arrival of other cricketing powers is a vote of confidence. 'Six countries coming to play here is a very big victory for Pakistan. If India doesn’t come, it’s not stopping cricket. The game is still happening,' said cricket journalist Umar Farooq. The final will be played in Pakistan, unless India qualifies to play the last match, in which case the event will take place in Dubai. Pakistan has spent millions of dollars in recent months to upgrade the stadiums in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Former Pakistani cricketer Mushtaq Ahmed said he hopes the arrival of heavyweights will usher in a new era for international cricket in the country. 'It’s the first step,' said Ahmed, who is a spin bowling coach for Bangladesh. 'I am very hopeful that this will open more doors.' VOA Urdu’s Naveed Naseem contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-set-to-host-first-major-cricket-event-in-three-decades/7979480.html	2025-02-18T11:18:13-08:00	
Hamas says it will release 10 more hostages, six of them living	A top Hamas leader says that the militant group plans to release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a recorded statement Tuesday, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the ceasefire deal. In his remarks, Hayya said the 'Bibas family' would be included in the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the captives' plight. Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute 'photos, names and rumors.' Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped separately and released this month. Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15 months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. 'In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman's announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped civilians,' the family said in a statement. 'It is important for us to say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an official update on the matter.' 'Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,' the family said. An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages' release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of the truce. Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in exchange for the hostages. Israelis and Palestinians marked 500 days of the war on Monday. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military, without offering evidence, says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Meanwhile, Israeli troops remained in some areas of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, despite a deadline for their withdrawal as part of a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel withdrew from some villages in the region, but said it was leaving forces in place in five positions that it said were necessary to protect parts of northern Israel. A joint statement from Lebanon’s president, prime minister and parliament speaker on Tuesday called on the U.N. Security Council to demand Israel’s immediate withdrawal. The ceasefire agreement called for Israel to withdraw by late January, with Hezbollah also moving away from the border and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the vacated buffer zone along with the Lebanese troops. An extension pushed the deadline to Tuesday. The U.N. envoy for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission and force commander in Lebanon, Lieutenant General Aroldo Lazaro, said in a joint statement that another delay in implementing the ceasefire deal 'is not what we hoped would happen.' Katz said the military 'will remain in a buffer zone in Lebanon with five control positions and will continue to act forcefully and uncompromisingly against any Hezbollah violation.' The ceasefire, reached in late November, halted more than a year of fighting in Lebanon, which had intensified in the months ahead of the truce, with Israeli troops conducting ground operations inside of Lebanon and repeated airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. The militants launched a cross-border rocket campaign in October 2023, attacking northern Israel a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated by the United States and others as terrorist organizations.

Pakistan claims 30 militants killed near Afghan border	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan reported Tuesday that its security forces killed at least 30 Islamist insurgents during clashes in a volatile region bordering Afghanistan. A military statement attributed the casualties to an overnight 'intelligence-based' operation against a militant location in the tribal district of South Waziristan. The slain people were referred to as 'khwarij,' a local term employed by the government to identify members of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, militant group. The TTP has not commented on the reported clashes, and it is not possible to verify government claims through independent sources in the violence-hit district. The Waziristan region and nearby districts along the Afghan border face almost daily militant raids targeting Pakistani troops, police officers and various government entities, with the TTP claiming responsibility for most of it. The violence has killed dozens of Pakistani security personnel within the first two months of 2025 alone. Military officials claim that retaliatory counterinsurgency operations have killed scores of TTP operatives, including key militant commanders, in recent days. Islamabad alleges that the TTP, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, uses havens and training camps in Afghanistan to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban government in Kabul, which is not recognized by any country, rejects Pakistani allegations. The latest report by the U.N. Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, released last week, highlighted Pakistan's concerns, stating that the TTP has 'significantly increased' its attacks in the country and from Afghan territory. The report noted that Kabul 'continued to provide the TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support.' It added that the militant group 'established new training centers' in the Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika, 'while enhancing recruitment within TTP cadres, including from the Afghan Taliban.' The Taliban government dismissed the U.N. findings as 'inaccurate' and contrary to reality.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-claims-30-militants-killed-near-afghan-border/7979417.html	2025-02-18T10:24:47-08:00	
Pope accepts resignation of Canadian bishop accused of sexual abuse	OTTAWA — Pope Francis on Tuesday said he had accepted the resignation of a Canadian bishop who has been named in a class-action lawsuit against the church that alleges sexual assault. The pope did not give a reason for replacing Jean-Pierre Blais, the 75-year-old bishop of Baie-Comeau in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, and the diocese said the resignation was not linked to the allegations. He also named a replacement: Reverend Pierre Charland, 62, currently a leading member of Canada's Roman Catholic Franciscan order. In a statement, the pope noted that any bishop who turns 75 is automatically requested to offer his resignation. The pope makes a decision on whether to accept the offer 'after he has examined all the circumstances,' the statement said. Blais is mentioned in a list of sexual predators filed as part of a victims' class action against the Archdiocese of Quebec. He has denied any wrongdoing. 'The nomination of a new bishop ... is not linked to the allegations against Bishop Blais,' the Diocese of Baie-Comeau said in an emailed statement, noting the church's policy of requiring all those who hit 75 to offer their resignation. Blais would not be speaking to the media, it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-accepts-resignation-of-canadian-bishop-accused-of-sexual-abuse/7979365.html	2025-02-18T09:53:05-08:00	
Men, women experience near daily floggings in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities publicly flogged six individuals on Tuesday after convicting them of offenses such as adultery, sodomy and eloping. The Supreme Court of the de facto Afghan rulers announced that the punishments were carried out in southeastern Khost and northern Faryab provinces and that the individuals received 39 lashes each, along with varying prison sentences of up to 18 months. Since the beginning of February, at least 61 Afghans, including nine women, have been flogged in sports stadiums packed with ordinary citizens and Taliban officials from the judiciary and administration, according to data from the top court. The individuals were accused of adultery, eloping, sodomy and robbery, with many of them also receiving prison sentences ranging from several months to six years. The United Nations and human rights organizations have condemned corporal punishment in Afghanistan as a violation of international law, urging the Taliban to immediately cease the practice. Despite global outcry, hundreds of Afghan men and women have faced public flogging, and several have been executed under the Taliban’s interpretation of retributive justice, known as qisas. Last week, reclusive Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada defended his governance, including the criminal justice system, saying they were rooted in divine commands. 'The esteemed supreme leader stated that every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad] and represents commands of Allah,' a government spokesman quoted Akhundzada as telling a gathering in Kandahar. Akhundzada, who is based in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, has issued numerous decrees in accordance with his stringent interpretation of Islamic law and principles, resulting in restrictions on freedom of speech and female access to education and employment in the country. The Taliban leader has banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and blocked many women from public and private sector employment. Afghan women cannot travel by road or air without a chaperone and cannot visit public places such as parks, gyms or beauty salons. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan emphasized again on X Tuesday that restrictions on women 'are causing long-term damage' in the impoverished, war-torn country. The chief prosecutor of the Hague-based International Criminal Court last month announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Akhundzada and the Taliban chief justice, holding them 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' The Taliban dismissed the warrants as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' No country has recognized the Taliban as the legitimate governing authority of the country, primarily due to the harsh treatment of Afghan women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/men-women-experience-near-daily-floggings-in-afghanistan/7979256.html	2025-02-18T08:53:25-08:00	
Rubio: US looks for 'fair, sustainable' end to Russian war on Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the United States is working toward a 'fair' and 'sustainable' solution to end Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine, but that both Moscow and Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve peace. Rubio offered his assessment after he and other key U.S. officials met for several hours in Saudi Arabia with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his aides in a first effort toward ending the war and improving the contentious Washington-Moscow relationship. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters, although no Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks. Rubio said he was 'convinced' that Moscow was willing to engage in a 'serious process' to end the war, which Russia started with a full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago next week. Tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, along with Ukrainian civilians, have been killed in the fighting, Europe’s worst conflict since World War II. The U.S. and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible,' State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace. Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the U.S. would have 'extraordinary opportunities … to partner' with Russia on trade and other global issues. 'The key to unlock that is the end to this conflict,' he said. National security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff joined Rubio for the talks. Waltz told reporters that negotiations to end the fighting will focus on territory and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia. 'This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end, as we've seen in the past,' Waltz said. Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory. Moscow controls the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, along with a large portion of eastern Ukraine pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting and lands the Russian military have taken over since the 2022 invasion. As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a negotiated peace settlement. Zelenskyy has said it will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the war. He postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, citing the fact that officials from his country were not invited to Tuesday’s U.S.-Russia talks. The Ukrainian leader suggested that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks and rescheduled the trip for March 10. Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday. Bruce said the Rubio-Lavrov talks, the first extensive discussions between the two countries in more than three years, also laid the groundwork for more talks aside from the negotiations to end the war. She said the two sides would 'establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions.' Bruce said the U.S. and Russia would 'lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities' once the war is ended. The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development for their own security. French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris, where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine. There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-us-looks-for-fair-sustainable-end-to-russian-war-on-ukraine/7979267.html	2025-02-18T08:48:09-08:00	
Uganda under fire for detention of opposition leader	NAIROBI, KENYA — Human rights activists, lawyers and medical practitioners in East Africa called on the Ugandan government Tuesday to release opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who has spent the past three months in military detention. Besigye, who was abducted while on a trip to Kenya in November, was recently rushed to a hospital after going on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment. Reading a statement on behalf of 12 organizations in Nairobi, the head of one of the groups, Khalid Hussein, said they condemn the militarization of justice and escalating government repression in Uganda. 'We call on Ugandan authorities to immediately release Kizza Besigye, Hajj Obeid Lutale, Eron Kiiza and others unlawfully detained,' Hussein said. 'The abduction and rendition of Kizza Besigye and Hajj Obeid Lutale blatantly violated international human rights law and the principles of extradition treaties.' A politician who ran against Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in three elections, Besigye was abducted by unidentified men while on a visit to Kenya in November and taken to Luzira Maximum Security Prison in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. He appeared before a military court, where former Kenyan justice minister and lawyer Martha Karua defended him. He is charged with treason, illegal possession of a firearm and threatening national security. Last week, the 68-year-old fell ill and was taken to a hospital after going on a hunger strike to protest his arrest and the charges. Ugandan lawyer Andrew Karamagi said the treatment of Besigye and other Museveni critics exposes ongoing rights violations in his country. 'The medical union has spoken out and given a scientific medical analysis of Dr. Besigye's health, which is in serious jeopardy,' he said. 'Citizens who have attempted to protest this have as well been detained, and I should add, violently arrested, as some of you might have seen. This is a culmination of years of human rights abuses [and] disregard for the constitution.' On Jan. 31, the Ugandan Supreme Court ruled that the trial of civilians in a military court is unconstitutional and that such cases must be transferred to ordinary courts. But the government rejected the ruling, saying such trials protect the country from criminals. In a statement posted on X, Museveni called on those demanding the release of Besigye to instead demand a quick trial to establish the facts. Otherwise, he said, such demands promote insecurity, which is dangerous for the country. Amnesty International East African regional researcher Roland Ebole said a united voice against human rights violations can help end abuses. 'We are having cross-border repression,' Ebole said. 'We are having a transnational repression where we are seeing abductions happening beyond borders. And these abductions are happening sanctioned or blessed by presidents, blessed by heads of state. And they are taking advantage of the fact that on the ground, we are not as united against them.' Rights groups say they will circulate petitions and reach out to other nations and organizations to demand the release of unlawfully detained Ugandans. The 12 organizations that took part in today’s demonstration have called for people to join a march on Friday to the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi and the parliament building to present a petition for justice and the release of Besigye and those detained alongside him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-under-fire-for-detention-of-opposition-leader/7979156.html	2025-02-18T08:03:11-08:00	
After Toronto plane crash, Delta says 19 of 21 passengers released from hospitals	Delta Air Lines said on Tuesday that 19 of the 21 passengers transported to local hospitals after a Toronto plane crash a day earlier have been released, as officials continue a probe into why the regional jet flipped over upon landing. Investigators from Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) are leading the probe into why the CRJ900 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines' Endeavor Air subsidiary went belly-up on Monday at Toronto's Pearson Airport. It's not yet clear what happened to Flight DL4819 from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Air crashes are usually caused by multiple factors. The 16-year-old CRJ900, made by Canada's Bombardier and powered by GE Aerospace engines, can seat up to 90 people. At least one of the two wings was no longer attached to the plane, video showed after the accident. Toronto Pearson Airport said earlier on Monday it was dealing with high winds and frigid temperatures as airlines attempted to catch up with missed flights after a weekend snowstorm dumped more than 22 centimeters (8.6 inches) of snow at the airport. The Delta plane touched down in Toronto at 2:13 p.m. (1913 GMT) after an 86-minute flight and came to rest near the intersection of runway 23 and runway 15, FlightRadar24 data showed. The weather at the time of the crash indicated a 'gusting crosswind and blowing snow,' the flight tracking website said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-toronto-plane-crash-delta-says-19-of-21-passengers-released-from-hospitals-/7979157.html	2025-02-18T08:01:11-08:00	
Uganda discharges last Ebola patients; No new deaths from contagious virus reported	KAMPALA — Uganda discharged on Tuesday the last eight patients who recovered from Ebola, health authorities reported, and there were no other positive cases in the outbreak declared last month. World Health Organization described the recoveries as a milestone that 'reflects the power of Uganda's quick and coordinated response.' Most of the Ebola patients were treated at the main referral facility in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. The lone Ebola victim was a male nurse who died the day before the outbreak was declared in Kampala on Jan. 30. His relatives are among those later hospitalized with Ebola. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever. Ugandan officials documented at least 265 contacts, and at least 90 of them have completed a period of quarantine during which they were monitored for signs of Ebola, Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told reporters in Kampala. There are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola in Uganda's outbreak. But authorities have launched a clinical study to further test the safety and efficacy of a trial vaccine as part of measures to stop the spread of Ebola. The last outbreak of Ebola in Uganda, which began in September 2022, killed at least 55 people by the time it was declared over four months later. Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists suspect that the first person infected in an Ebola outbreak acquires the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-discharges-the-last-ebola-patients-no-new-deaths-from-contagious-virus-reported-/7979160.html	2025-02-18T07:59:25-08:00	
Leonard Peltier leaves prison after Biden commuted sentence in killing of FBI agents	SUMTERVILLE, FLORIDA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. For nearly half a century, Peltier's imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home confinement was celebrated by supporters. 'He represents every person who's been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school,' said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier's release. But the move just before Biden left office also prompted criticism from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called him 'a remorseless killer' in a private letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press. 'Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,' Wray wrote. The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something Peltier's advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his innocence. Peltier left the prison Tuesday morning in an SUV, according to a prison official. He didn't stop to speak with reporters or his supporters outside the gates. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said Peltier was looking forward to going home. 'We're so excited for this moment,' Jones said. 'He is in good spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.' After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison, Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where he is expected to celebrate with friends and family on Wednesday. Biden commuted Peltier's sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most of his life in prison and was now in poor health. 'We never thought he would get out,' Ray St. Clair, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before Peltier's release. 'It shows you should never give up hope. We can take this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.' Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement, which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination. The group grabbed headlines in 1969 when activists occupied the former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in 1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands including the restoration of tribal land. After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From then on, the group was subject to FBI surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975. Peltier's conviction stemmed from a confrontation that year on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed. According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but he said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences. Two other movement members, co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026. 'Leonard Peltier's release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,' Paul O'Brien, executive director with Amnesty International USA, said in a statement before Peltier's release. 'While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement.' Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the American Indian have called for Peltier's release for decades, and Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner. Prominent supporters over the years included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director Robert Redford, and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson Browne. Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the secretary's position, praised Biden's decision. 'I am grateful that Leonard can now go home to his family,' she said Jan. 20 in a post on X. 'I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this means to Indian Country.' As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse. 'He hasn't really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school,' said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier's release since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. 'So he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/leonard-peltier-leaves-prison-after-biden-commuted-his-sentence-in-the-killing-of-two-fbi-agents/7979095.html	2025-02-18T07:20:30-08:00	
Inclusivity, economic woes, and security challenge Syria post-Assad	Syria’s top diplomat says the country has gained freedom while managing to avoid another civil war, but observers point to major challenges ahead, such as the dire economy, uncertain security, and including Syria's diverse population in decision-making and governance. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani told the Munich Security Conference last weekend that the country’s new leadership will set in place a government that reflects the will of the people. 'The Syrian people freed themselves by themselves. We are now putting the steps and principles to have a system that represents the people to be Syrian-led and Syria-owned. The dictatorship will not be repeated again,' he said. Al-Shibani said the country’s Islamist interim leaders want 'to bring the whole Syrian society with us to prevent any actions that will break this stability and our achievement.' Bassam Said Ishak is president of the Syriac National Council of Syria, based in northeast Syria and representing Syriac Christians. He told VOA it is important for Christians and all minorities in a post-Assad government to be represented and respected. Ishak spoke about a national dialogue conference scheduled for next month. 'My worry is that they wind up with a conference that it does not magnify the real voices of these diverse Syrians. That’s serious because this has been the traditional way. Assad did it this way. We just need a viable representation of everybody, whether it’s a Kurd, Syriac, Druze, Alawi, Ismaili. We just need to hear these voices. We need to hear people who are different, of different opinion and think of real solutions,' he said. Syrian American lawyer Dima Moussa, who is a member of the Syrian National Coalition, an organization that promotes constitutional reforms, said the caretaker government is applying the Islamist principles it enforced when it ruled just Idlib province to the rest of the country. She told the Washington-based Arab Center recently the interim leaders have 'not yet completely come out of that mentality,' but she expressed optimism for the future. 'Inclusivity is probably one of the most important issues on the table today. And if it is not carefully and diligently worked on, especially at the national conference stage, it can set up for the reoccurrence and failure of many problems in the future. There have been some positive steps. They’re getting lost amid the hardships of the living conditions and some incidents in some of the more sensitive areas that historically had sectarian tensions which were amplified during the last 14 years,' said Moussa. Some observers are concerned about a lack of clarity on how the new government will attempt to heal the still-divided country. Questions remain over Syria’s future relations with Russia and Iran, and stalwart Assad supporters, as it pursues reintegration in the Arab fold. Meanwhile, Syria’s economy is in tatters after nearly 14 years of civil war, widespread corruption under the Assad regime and sanctions by the West, including on its banking sector. U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen told the Munich Security Conference the Syrian interim government faces 'enormous humanitarian challenges' as 17 million refugees and internally displaced people try to return home. 'They need to see there if a future in Syria, and they need to see it quickly,' Pedersen warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/inclusivity-economic-woes-and-security-challenge-syria-post-assad/7979055.html	2025-02-18T06:54:15-08:00	
Social Security head steps down over DOGE access of recipient information: AP sources	Washington — The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Acting Commissioner Michelle King's departure from the agency over the weekend — after more than 30 years of service — was initiated after King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to sensitive information, the people said Monday. The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday night saying: 'President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.' Fields added, 'President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long.' King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information. DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to access Internal Revenue Service databases. Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE group. Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the preservation of Social Security benefits, said of DOGE's efforts that 'there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my understanding is that it has already occurred.' 'The information collected and securely held by the Social Security Administration is highly sensitive,' she said. 'SSA has data on everyone who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans, everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied for Social Security’s means-tested companion program, Supplemental Security Income.' 'If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.' The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/social-security-head-steps-down-over-doge-access-of-recipient-information-ap-sources-/7978978.html	2025-02-18T05:55:09-08:00	
Vietnam parliament approves radical government cost-cutting drive	Hanoi, Vietnam — Vietnam will cut one in five public sector jobs and slash billions of dollars from government budgets, after the country's rubber-stamp parliament on Tuesday gave the go-ahead to a radical streamlining drive. The reform are creating unease in a communist country where working for the state long meant a job for life. Described as 'a revolution' by senior officials, the drive will see the number of government ministries and agencies slashed from 30 to 22. The National Assembly voted to pass the government's organizational structure, a statement on the parliament's website said. The ministries of transport, planning and investment, communications and labor have been scrapped, and state media, the civil service, the police and the military will face cuts. As part of the government restructuring, the National Assembly on Tuesday approved two new deputy prime ministers, taking the total to seven. Almost two million people worked in the public sector as of 2022, according to the government, although the International Labor Organization puts the figure much higher. One in five of these jobs will be eliminated over the next five years. The government has said that 100,000 people will be made redundant or offered early retirement, but it has yet to offer clarity on how the much larger target will be reached. Vietnam's top leader To Lam, who half a year ago became Communist Party general secretary following the death of his predecessor, has said that state agencies should not be 'safe havens for weak officials'. 'If we want to have a healthy body, sometimes we must take bitter medicine and endure pain to remove tumors,' Lam said in December. He has also said that the plan had received 'large consensus from the people'. But several workers told AFP they were laid off with little notice and were concerned that decisions about which employees to keep were not based on ability. Thanh, a pseudonym to protect his identity, told AFP his 12-year career as a TV producer was 'aggressively' terminated last month. The state-controlled news channel where he worked was shuttered, one of five broadcasters already closed, and Thanh was given two weeks' notice. 'It is painful to talk about,' said Thanh, a father who has turned to driving a taxi. Business impact Building on stellar economic growth of 7.1 percent in 2024, Vietnam —a global manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports — is aiming for eight percent this year. But anxiety is mounting over the country's potential vulnerability to tariffs under the new Trump administration. A bloated bureaucracy is also seen as a brake on growth, as is a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has slowed everyday transactions. Authorities say savings from the cuts in spending could total $4.5 billion over the next five years, despite costs of more than $5 billion for retirement and severance packages. Streamlining the bureaucracy has been a Communist Party policy for nearly a decade but Lam is pushing the scheme ahead rapidly. Lam has also enthusiastically pursued an anti-graft campaign that has swept up dozens of business leaders and senior government figures, including two presidents and three deputy prime ministers since 2021. Critics accuse him of targeting his rivals through the action, but the drive has proved popular with the public and analysts say Lam may be looking to bolster his legitimacy ahead of the next Communist Party congress in early 2026. The turmoil, however, has threatened the country's reputation for stability and there are fears the bureaucratic reforms could also cause short-term chaos. At a press conference last week, Pham Thu Hang, spokesperson for the foreign affairs ministry, said the drive 'would not affect the investment and business environment in Vietnam.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-parliament-approves-radical-govt-cost-cutting-drive-/7978965.html	2025-02-18T05:54:07-08:00	
Vatican cancels pope's weekend engagements as he battles 'complex' infection	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis, who began his fifth day in hospital on Tuesday for what doctors have described as a 'complex' respiratory infection, will not take part in this weekend's Holy Year events, the Vatican said on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. A planned public papal audience set for Saturday had been canceled 'due to the health condition of the Holy Father,' the Vatican said in a brief statement. A papal mass scheduled for Sunday will still take place, but will be led instead by a senior Vatican official, it added. The Vatican said on Monday that doctors had changed the pope's drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle a 'complex clinical situation.' They described it as a 'polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.' Doctors say polymicrobial diseases can be caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria and fungi. Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed, and in recent times has been prone to lung infections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-cancels-pope-s-weekend-engagements-as-he-battles-complex-infection-/7978833.html	2025-02-18T03:24:09-08:00	
Philippines reports intrusions targeting intelligence data	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines has detected foreign attempts to access intelligence data, but its cyber minister said on Tuesday no breaches have been recorded so far. Attempts to steal data are wide-ranging, said minister for information and communications Ivan Uy. Advanced Persistent Threats or APTs have repeatedly attempted but failed to infiltrate government systems, suggesting the country's cyber-defenses have held firm. APTs are a general term for cyber actors or groups, often state-backed, that engage in malicious cyber activities. 'These have been present for quite some time, and threats come from many actors, but a big majority of them are foreign,' Uy told Reuters. Some of these threats, which Uy referred to as 'sleepers,' had been embedded in systems before being exposed by government's cyber security efforts. 'Why are these things operating in those systems, without even anybody calling it out?,' he said. So far, the government has not seen any cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, he said. 'Hopefully it's because our cyber defenses and cyber security are strong enough,' he said. Uy acknowledged the difficulty of attributing cyber intrusions to specific attackers, as they sometimes leave misleading digital traces. However, the government is working through diplomatic channels and sharing intelligence with the military, including with other countries, to validate threats and strengthen defenses, he said. Last year, the Philippine said it thwarted attempts by hackers operating in China to break into websites and e-mail systems of the Philippine president and government agencies, including one promoting maritime security. Uy described the escalating cyber threats as part of a global arms race, where nations and criminal organizations exploit digital vulnerabilities for financial or strategic gain. 'World War III is happening and it is cyber,' Uy said. 'These weapons are non-kinetic. They are cyber, digital, virtual, but it's happening. The attacks and defenses are happening as we speak, without any physical manifestation.' Beyond cyberattacks, Uy has also flagged a surge in deepfakes and what he referred to as 'fake news media outlets' aiming to manipulate public opinion ahead of the Philippines' mid-term elections in May, and the ministry has deployed tools to combat them. 'Misinformation and disinformation are riskier with respect to democracies like ours, because we rely on elections, and elections are based on personal opinion,' Uy said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-reports-intrusions-targeting-intelligence-data/7978813.html	2025-02-18T02:13:49-08:00	
Israel keeping troops in 5 southern Lebanon locations	Israeli troops remained in some areas of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, despite a deadline for their withdrawal as part of a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel withdrew from some villages in the region, but said it was leaving forces in place in five positions that it said were necessary to protect parts of northern Israel. The Lebanese government, which moved its own troops into areas Israel left, has called on Israel to fully implement the ceasefire deal and leave the country. The agreement called for Israel to withdraw by late January, with Hezbollah also moving away from the border and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the vacated buffer zone along with the Lebanese troops. An extension pushed the deadline to Tuesday. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the military 'will remain in a buffer zone in Lebanon with five control positions, and will continue to act forcefully and uncompromisingly against any Hezbollah violation.' The ceasefire reached in late November halted more than a year of fighting in Lebanon, which had intensified in the months ahead of the ceasefire with Israeli troops conducting ground operations inside of Lebanon and repeated airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. The militants launched a cross-border rocket campaign in October 2023, attacking northern Israel a day after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in their own attack on southern Israel. Israel’s counteroffensive against Hamas has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel said it has killed more than 17,000 militants. The first phase of a Gaza ceasefire is due to end at the beginning of March. So far, the ceasefire has included Hamas releasing 24 hostages and Israel freeing more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, the drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated by the United States and others as terrorist organizations.

Turkish police detain 282 suspects in raids targeting PKK militants	ISTANBUL — Turkish police detained 282 suspected members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, militant group in raids over the last five days, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Tuesday. The raids came as Turkey continues to remove elected pro-Kurdish mayors from their posts over militant ties in a crackdown coinciding with hopes for an end to a 40-year conflict between the PKK and authorities. Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to make a statement on such efforts, four months after an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan urged him to call on the militants to lay down their arms. Police carried out this week's counter-terror raids in 51 provinces, as well as in the capital, Ankara, and the largest city of Istanbul, the minister said on X. The suspects were accused of conducting PKK propaganda, providing financing for the group, recruiting members and joining in street protests, he said. The police seized two AK 47 rifles among other weapons. On Saturday, Turkey removed a pro-Kurdish DEM Party mayor from his post in the eastern province of Van over terrorism-related convictions, taking to eight the number of DEM mayors replaced by state-appointed officials since 2024 elections. The PKK, designated as a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies, launched its insurgency against the state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-police-detain-282-suspects-in-raids-targeting-pkk-militants/7978791.html	2025-02-18T00:30:27-08:00	
Russian drone attack hits central Ukraine apartment building	A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people. Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children. The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed five Ukrainian drones, including four over the Voronezh region and one over Belgorod. Both regions are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are frequent targets of Ukrainian drone attacks. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram there were no reports of casualties or damage.

US, Russian officials to discuss Ukraine war, bilateral relations	Top U.S. and Russian diplomats are set to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia for discussions about relations between their countries and a potential end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Both sides have tempered expectations, describing the talks as an initial step that could lay the framework for direct talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading the U.S. delegation, which also includes national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Wikoff. Russia’s side includes Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and senior Putin aide Yuri Ushakov. Ukrainian leaders said they were not invited to participate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to host U.S. envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg for talks on Wednesday. The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its own future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development in their own security. French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine. There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature. 'We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,' Macron said on X. The French leader said he had spoken with Trump and Zelenskyy after the Paris talks, and that it is important for Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians to work together. Zelenskyy expressed a need for 'robust and reliable' security guarantees, saying that otherwise Russia will just start another war with Ukraine or other nations in Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russian-officials-to-discuss-ukraine-war-bilateral-relations/7978750.html	2025-02-17T21:59:55-08:00	
Japan approves new climate, energy and industry policies through 2040	TOKYO — Japan's government approved on Tuesday new targets to cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions through 2040, alongside a revised energy plan and an updated industrial policy for the same period. The measures, which seek to bolster long-term policy stability for businesses, focus on promoting decarbonization, ensuring a stable energy supply and strengthening industrial capacity to drive economic growth. Under the new climate policy, Japan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% from 2013 levels by 2035 and by 73% by 2040, extending its 2030 goal of a 46% cut. The emissions-cutting target sparked calls for deeper reductions from experts and ruling coalition members when it was first proposed, as the world's fifth-biggest carbon emitter struggles to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Despite more than 80% of 3,000 public comments supporting a more ambitious target, the environment and industry ministries finalized the goal without changes, citing prior deliberations by climate experts. As part of global efforts to combat climate change, Japan plans to submit its new target, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, to the United Nations this month. The revised energy policy aims for renewables to account for up to 50% of Japan's electricity mix by fiscal year 2040, with nuclear power contributing another 20% as the country pushes for clean energy while meeting rising power demand. Japanese utilities have struggled to restart nuclear reactors since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, limiting nuclear power to just 8.5% of Japan's electricity supply in 2023. The new energy plan removes the previous goal of minimizing reliance on nuclear and calls for building next-generation reactors. A new national strategy integrating decarbonization and industrial policy through 2040, aligned with the emission target and energy plan, was also approved by the cabinet. It aims to develop industrial clusters in areas rich in renewable energy, nuclear power, and other low-carbon power sources. However, uncertainties are emerging around Japan's policies, as the domestic offshore wind market, a key driver of renewable energy growth, faces headwinds from inflation and high costs, recently prompting Mitsubishi Corp to review three domestic projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-approves-new-climate-energy-and-industry-policies-through-2040/7978736.html	2025-02-17T20:36:01-08:00	
At AU summit, Tigray demands full implementation of peace deal	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The leaders of Ethiopia’s Tigray region have called for the full implementation of the Pretoria agreement that ended the conflict between Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray rebels in 2022. The bloc released a report about the agreement during the African Union Summit over the weekend in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. The two main leaders of Tigray, who also are political rivals, urged the AU to pay attention to the implementation of the agreement. The AU-brokered agreement, reached in November 2022, required the cessation of hostilities, return of internally displaced people, disarmament, expedition of humanitarian access, and restoration of services in the region. The agreement ended the two-year conflict and prompted the return of some social services. Just over two months ago, the first phase of the Pretoria agreement's disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program, known as DDR, was launched in Tigray. DDR aims to demobilize 371,971 combatants overall in Ethiopia, including 75,000 combatants from Tigray region in its first phase. But the Tigray region’s leaders say there are outstanding issues. Some territories have not yet been returned by the federal government, and internally displaced people have not returned to disputed areas in Western Tigray. The president of the Tigray interim regional administration, Getachew Reda, who signed the agreement on behalf of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF, told AU leaders that 'many contents of the agreement have not been implemented.' 'Most of the focus of the international community on DDR is on the first ‘D,’ the disarmament process, but the most important aspect for us is, where we disarm, should not be the end,' he said. 'Whether we demobilize and reinstate the people who have been the former combatants is something that should be taken into account. The international community, the AU, should take this process seriously, and it should continue to press all of us to focus on this part of the Pretoria agreement.' TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was president of the region at the time of the conflict, said that while the cessation of hostilities has been a 'significant milestone' there have been shortcomings. 'We must acknowledge that critical components such as the constitutional restoration of occupied territories, the withdrawal of non-ENDF forces, and the resettlement of the displaced persons, as well as TPLF legal reinstatement, require accelerated action,' he said. The 'non-ENDF forces' that Debretsion refers to are Eritrean and Amhara region forces that have been allies of the federal Ethiopian National Defense force, or ENDF, during the conflict. Eritrea denies having forces in Ethiopian territory. Regarding the resettlement of disputed Western Tigray, the Ethiopian government's position is that it will be resolved through a referendum. Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gedion Timothewos said the way ahead must be conducted through 'constructive engagement' and in 'strict adherence' to the rule of law. He told the AU that the Ethiopian government is taking steps to implement the agreement and it 'must be fulfilled in the manner specified.' Gedion added: 'With good faith implementation, as provided in the peace agreement, we are convinced that the remaining and outstanding important measures are within our reach and could be fulfilled.' AU chief negotiator and former president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, said that the issues of the DDR program and contested areas should continue to be addressed in a phased manner until they are resolved, and that they should not 'hold back the implementation of the agreement.' He said the Pretoria peace agreement reflected the principle of 'African solutions to African problems.' 'It underscores the capability of African statesmen and institutions to resolve conflicts and foster peace within our continent,’’ Obasanjo said. Rift between Tigray's leaders The two main leaders of Tigray, Getachew and Debretsion, shook hands at Sunday’s AU event, but the duo have been involved in a bitter political dispute that crippled the region’s administration and functions for months. The dispute is rooted in differences over the implementation of the Pretoria agreement. Debretsion accuses his former TPLF deputy chairman of not representing the region's interests, a charge Getachew denies. The two also clashed over the convening of the TPLF party congress and the appointment of local administration. TPLF held a congress in August during which it expelled 15 members including Getachew from the central committee, a move Getachew described as 'null and void.' Getachew accuses the TPLF leadership of orchestrating 'a coup d'état' against his administration and alleges the TPLF leaders are working to dismantle the regional government. The TPLF has made the same accusation against Getachew. Last month, over 200 Tigray security force commanders sided with Debretsion after staying neutral for many months, accusing Getachew of betraying Tigray’s interests. Getachew hit back, saying the use of security forces for the benefit of a particular political faction is unacceptable. On Thursday, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) suspended TPLF from conducting any political activities for three months because it has yet to convene a general assembly. TPLF rejected the suspension, accusing NEBE of meddling. 'Whilst TPLF leadership is dealing and negotiating with relevant stakeholders to amend relations, the National Board of Elections is going out of its way to intervene and taint the party negatively,' TPLF said in a statement on Friday. 'As a signatory of the Pretoria agreement, we make clear our stand that the board is meddling. … We appeal to the federal government that if anything goes wrong, the responsibility lies on the board.' In a statement on his Facebook page Ethiopia’s prime minister recently called on Tigray elites to solve their internal differences in dialogue, and he added that any other differences, be it with other forces or federal government, should be addressed based on the national constitution.

M23 rebels tighten their grip on second major city in eastern DRC	BUKAVU, Democratic Reupblic of Congo — Rwanda-backed rebels tightened their grip on Bukavu on Monday, a day after seizing the second major city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo whose residents appeared resigned to their fate under the new rulers. On Sunday, M23 rebels captured the city of 1.3 million people after it was abandoned by Congolese forces. Bukavu lies 101 kilometers south of Goma, which was captured by the rebels in late January. The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo's trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that's critical for much of the world's technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. The decades-long fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world's largest humanitarian crisis. As the rebels made their way into Bukavu, its streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. A pall of silence set in later as residents and business owners braced for M23's entrance into the city center. On Monday morning, people gradually started coming out again while the rebels patrolled major intersections in the city. 'People are still scared to go out because of the insecurity so it's not business as usual yet,' David Balezi, a shopkeeper in Bukavu, told The Associated Press. Bukavu's border crossing to Rwanda was closed on Monday morning, as were most shops and stores while traffic gradually picked up again. 'Now we thank God that the situation is OK, even if we don't know what's coming. Whatever happens, we will live with it,' David Munyaga, a resident of Bukavu, said. On Monday, Erasto Bahati Musanga, the rebel-appointed governor of North-Kivu province announced that Goma and Bukavu's ports will reopen Tuesday. Navigation on Lake Kivu, one of the largest lakes in Africa, had been banned since late January, during the rebels’ offensive on Goma. In rebel-controlled Goma, hundreds of protesters gathered to call for the departure of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Democratic Republic of Congo, known as MONUSCO, and the withdrawal of troops from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which includes countries ranging from Congo to South Africa. The protestors organized a sit-in in front of the MONUSCO headquarters in Goma, with some brandishing signs and chanting slogans calling for the resignation of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi. 'The war does not end in Congo, why? They have nothing to do here, they should leave,' Bauma Sukali, a protester, said. Another protester, Fiston Nsabimana, said: 'Tshisekedi is not able to ensure peace. Let him leave power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-tighten-their-grip-on-second-major-city-in-eastern-drc/7978719.html	2025-02-17T19:06:52-08:00	
Costa Rica will receive deported migrants from US	San Jose, Costa Rica — Costa Rica announced Monday it would receive migrants from other countries who were deported by the United States, following in the footsteps of Panama and Guatemala. 'The Government of Costa Rica agreed to collaborate with the United States in the repatriation of 200 illegal immigrants to their country,' the Costa Rican president's office said in a statement, adding that 'these are people originating from ... Central Asia and India.' Costa Rica is the third country in Central America to collaborate on repatriating deported migrants from the United States since President Donald Trump assumed office in Washington on Jan. 20. The first set of deportees will arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday aboard a commercial flight, according to the statement, whereupon they will be transported to a Temporary Migrant Care Center near the border with Panama. The statement specified that 'the process will be completely financed' by the U.S. government under the supervision of the International Organization for Migration. Panama and Guatemala had previously agreed to a similar arrangement when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited on a recent tour of Latin America. Panama received its first repatriation flight with 119 migrants aboard last week, originating from China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, according to Panamanian officials. None have arrived yet in Guatemala. Latin America is the original home of most of the United States' estimated 11 million undocumented migrants. Many had made dangerous journeys, braving treacherous terrain, wild animals and criminal gangs for a chance at a better life. Trump, however, took a hard line against undocumented migrants during last year's U.S. election campaign, describing some as 'monsters' and 'animals.' On his first day in office last month, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border and vowed to deport 'millions and millions' of migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-will-receive-deported-migrants-from-us/7978707.html	2025-02-17T18:15:07-08:00	
Argentine judge investigates fraud case against President Milei over crypto promotion	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A judge in Argentina was selected Monday to investigate allegations of fraud against President Javier Milei for his brief promotion of a cryptocurrency whose value collapsed within hours of its launch last week. Milei distanced himself from the scandal and said he acted in good faith. Milei and his office denied involvement with creators of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, saying he initially drew attention to it Friday as an entrepreneurial project that might benefit Argentina but learned more about it later and then withdrew his support. Lawyers in Argentina filed fraud complaints against the libertarian president on Sunday. The case was assigned Monday to Judge María Servini, head of Federal Court No. 1 in Buenos Aires. She doesn't have a deadline to finish investigating the allegations. In a tweet Friday evening that coincided with the launch of the $LIBRA crypto coin, Milei said that it was aimed at 'encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.' It enjoyed a brief spike in value above $4 billion in market capitalization, although its value began to decline amid comments of critics that it could be a scam. Milei deleted the post a few hours later as the value of the cryptocurrency was collapsing in a downturn that caused millions of dollars in losses to many of its new investors. The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase 'Viva la libertad!' that Milei uses to close speeches and messages on his social media. The president's office said in a statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency's development and decided to remove his post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project's launch. 'The president shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol's project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,' the president's office said. After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the details of the cryptocurrency and accused his political opponents of trying to exploit the episode. 'I have nothing to hide and I have no problem coming forward and showing my face,' Milei said Monday in an interview with the Todo Noticias channel. 'Those who entered there voluntarily knew what they were getting into,' he added. 'As volatility traders, they understood the risks involved.' His office said in the statement that the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the executive branch, would investigate the case. Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, said Sunday that the plaintiffs allege that Milei's actions were part of an illicit association to commit 'an indeterminate number of frauds' in the episode. 'Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president's actions were essential,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-judge-investigates-fraud-case-against-president-milei-over-crypto-promotion/7978683.html	2025-02-17T17:22:09-08:00	
Sources: Wagner mercenaries, Mali army accused of killing civilians	DAKAR, Senegal — Around 20 people were killed in northern Mali on Monday when the vehicles they were traveling in came under attack, with local sources telling Agence France-Presse that Wagner mercenaries and Mali's army were responsible. A relative of the driver of one of the vehicles told AFP from the northern city of Gao that the group was bound for Algeria when the deadly attack occurred. 'The driver of the first vehicle is my cousin,' they said on the condition of anonymity. 'They encountered a group of Wagner mercenaries and some Malian soldiers who shot at them. In the first car, everyone died. My cousin too,' they said, specifying that the passengers included illegal migrants and nomads. Mali's army did not provide an official comment on the accusations when approached by AFP on Monday. However, a military source refuted the claims, saying an investigation was underway but 'the army killed no one.' 'What happened is serious. These were civilians who were killed in the two vehicles in the Tilemsi region,' a representative from the Gao region told AFP. 'In total, in the two vehicles, there are at least 20 dead,' he said. The separatist rebel group Front for the Liberation of Azawad (FLA) condemned the continuation of 'ethnic cleansing carried out by the Bamako junta against the Azawad population.' The FLA statement claimed two vehicles 'were intercepted by the terrorist coalition FAMA (Malian Armed Forces)/Wagner.' 'Among the passengers, at least 24 people, including women and children, were coldly executed by the Malian army and Wagner's Russian mercenaries,' the statement continued. Mali, run by a military junta following coups in 2020 and 2021, has spent the past dozen years mired in a security crisis due to violence by groups affiliated with Al-Qaida and Islamic State. The military junta has been supported by Wagner mercenaries since breaking ties with former colonial ruler France. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch in December denounced the 'atrocities' committed against civilians by the Malian army and its Russian ally Wagner, as well as by Islamist armed groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sources-wagner-mercenaries-mali-army-accused-of-killing-civilians/7978672.html	2025-02-17T17:04:38-08:00	
European leaders gather for emergency summit on defense, Ukraine	PARIS — European leaders called for beefing up their defense spending Monday after a Paris summit on Ukraine and the region's security — amid concerns about an aggressive Russia and declining support from Washington. The emergency meeting comes ahead of U.S.-Russian talks on ending the war in Ukraine — which it appears could leave out the Europeans. The summit, called by French President Emmanuel Macron, came as Europeans confront a shift in transatlantic relations under the new administration U.S. President Donald Trump. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said European security was at a 'turning point.' Ahead of the Paris talks — gathering European Union, NATO and British leaders — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described efforts to introduce competition between the European Union and the United States as senseless and potentially dangerous. Ian Lesser, who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund policy institute, said there are two big issues on the agenda for European leaders in the near term. 'It’s all about what can be done for and with Ukraine, in anticipation of the United States doing less, and possibly in anticipation of having to guarantee a settlement or at least a ceasefire,' Lesser said. 'The other long-term question, which is some ways more serious, is how to secure Europe’s defense with the United States potentially absent in the years to come And there, I think, there’s very little consensus, and it’s a very big and expensive and long-term project for Europe.' Top U.S. and Russian officials were to hold talks Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss Ukraine and a possible summit between President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Neither Ukraine nor the Europeans have been invited. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country is willing to send troops to Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Other European leaders say that’s premature. Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Hungary, which is close to both Russia and the Trump administration, said the Paris talks undermine peace. Leaders in Paris also discussed ways to rapidly increase Europe’s own defense capabilities and support for Ukraine. 'Increased spending at home, increased defense production, increased sizes of armies, increased intelligence cooperation, increased training — all of this is to happen, in addition to supplying Ukraine so its front line doesn’t collapse,' said Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House think tank in London. She described a key security conference in Munich last week, which left Europe concerned about Washington’s new priorities, as a wake-up call. 'It’s a different White House and a different team,' she said. 'And Europe was slow to realize that and to find the right words and the right package for this transactional world of America.' The U.S. has long pushed Europe to do more for its own defense. Now — with Russia gaining the advantage on the ground in Ukraine, and Washington calling for NATO members to increase military budgets — Europeans are sensing an urgency to do so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-gather-for-emergency-summit-on-defense-ukraine-/7978663.html	2025-02-17T16:54:17-08:00	
European leaders hold crisis security talks as US signals transatlantic reset	London — European leaders held a crisis security meeting Monday in Paris after a blizzard of diplomatic interventions by Washington in recent days that have raised doubts over the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of European security. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders were among those attending the emergency summit at the Elysee Palace. Starmer spoke to reporters after the meeting. 'At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole and therefore vital for Britain's national interest,' he said. 'It's clear the U.S. is not going to leave NATO. But we Europeans will have to do more. The issue of burden-sharing is not new, but it is now pressing. And Europeans will have to step up, both in terms of spending and the capabilities that we provide.' 'Europe must play its role, and I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement. ... But there must be a U.S. backstop, because a U.S. security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again,' Starmer told reporters in Paris. Scholz, who faces elections at the end of this week, echoed calls for Europe and Ukraine to be part of the peace talks. 'It is now very clear to us that we must continue to support Ukraine. And it must and can rely on us that this will be the case. We welcome the fact that there are talks on peace development, but it must be and is clear to us — this does not mean that there can be a dictated peace and that Ukraine must accept what is presented to it,' Scholz said. Ukraine aid A series of policy shifts by Washington over the past week have transformed Europe’s geopolitical calculations. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO allies last week that Europe must provide the overwhelming share of aid for Ukraine as it fights Russian invaders. 'Now is the time to invest, because you can't make an assumption that America's presence will last forever,' Hegseth said in a Friday speech in Warsaw. 'The reality that returning to 2014 borders as part of a negotiated settlement is unlikely. The reality of U.S. troops in Ukraine is unlikely. The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely,' Hegseth said. Peace talks Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump held a 45-minute phone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, effectively ending Moscow’s isolation since his February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both leaders agreed to begin Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh beginning Tuesday — with Kyiv and Europe excluded from the table. 'That may grate a little bit. But I'm telling you something that's really quite honest … when you looked at Minsk II [peace agreements], there was a lot of people at the table that really had no ability to execute some type of peace process, and it failed miserably. So, we're not going to go down that path,' Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told delegates Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. That approach is unsustainable, said analyst Armida van Rij, who leads the Europe program at London’s Chatham House. 'Given the U.S. has taken itself out of the equation when it comes to … providing security guarantees for Ukraine or monitoring any kind of potential ceasefire that may happen, it’s really up to the Europeans to implement any kind of ceasefire or peace deal. So, you need the Europeans at the table to be able to discuss that, because otherwise, why would they sign up to something that's been discussed over their heads that commits their troops in a potential risk of direct conflict with Russia?' van Rij told VOA. ‘Tectonic shifts’ The diplomatic flurry will have profound consequences for European security, according to Daniela Schwarzer, a political analyst at the Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation in Germany. 'We are witnessing tectonic shifts of the order structures and also of the positioning of major powers. We see that the United States wants to retreat from international organizations, so it is weakening structures of international order,' Schwarzer told Reuters. European leaders should have been prepared, said van Rij. 'We could have seen this coming for a long time, but it hasn't been said that starkly and in such clear terms before, and that was really the wake-up call for many, many Europeans. 'Now it’s crunch time to get this going — particularly in the short term, of course, in terms of not just maintaining but upping support for Ukraine, given it's very clear that the U.S. is not going to play a major role anymore in the way that it has under [former President Joe] Biden. But also for European defense and security in the medium to longer term, what that's going to look like? So, there are huge questions hanging over Europeans,' van Rij told VOA. Only 23 of NATO’s 32 members met the alliance target of spending at least 2% of gross national income on defense in 2024, let alone the 5% recently demanded by Trump. 'That's going to be a really difficult thing for many Europeans who are operating in a fiscally very constrained space,' van Rij said. Democratic values U.S. criticism went beyond questions of defense. At the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice president JD Vance questioned Europe’s democratic values, criticizing mass migration and a perceived attack on freedom of speech in Europe, including the exclusion of far-right parties from power. 'The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values,' Vance told delegates in Munich on Friday. His comments were described as 'unacceptable' by German officials. Europe is reeling from the new tone in transatlantic relations, said van Rij. 'What has come as a surprise is the style in which this has been done. And that's been really breaking all the norms in terms of how diplomacy is conducted, essentially. Reality has hit very, very clearly,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-hold-crisis-security-talks-as-us-signals-transatlantic-reset/7978667.html	2025-02-17T16:51:53-08:00	
Four top New York City officials resign as turmoil ripples over mayor's corruption case	NEW YORK — Four top deputies to New York City Mayor Eric Adams are resigning in the latest fallout from the Justice Department's push to end a corruption case against Adams and ensure his cooperation in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — a bargain that has raised questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to lead the city. In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker. 'I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future,' said Adams, who faces several challengers in June's Democratic primary. 'But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day.' City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor resignations it's clear he 'has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government and New Yorkers.' Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor. Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff in a memo that they were exiting because of 'the extraordinary events of the last few weeks.' They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they and Parker will remain 'for the time being to ensure a seamless transition.' Adams has faced increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department's second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to drop the mayor's corruption case. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote that the case had 'unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' That directive touched off firestorms within the Justice Department and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign. On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the case. Ho has yet to take action on the request. Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican president's objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter after the November election. 'It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,' Reverend Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. 'I have supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even for him — of essentially political blackmail.' Political leaders, including Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado have called on Adams to step down. But Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul has said she's taking a more deliberative approach. 'The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction like a lot of other people are saying right now,' she told MSNBC on Thursday. 'I’ve got to do it smart, what’s right, and I’m consulting with other leaders in government right now.' The drama over Adams' legal case played out as the mayor met with Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased cooperation on the Trump administration's efforts to remove immigrants, including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the city's notorious Rikers Island jail. In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom wrote, 'Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-top-new-york-city-officials-resign-as-turmoil-ripples-over-mayor-s-corruption-case-/7978647.html	2025-02-17T16:26:54-08:00	
Experts push to restore Syria's war-torn heritage sites, including Roman ruins at Palmyra	PALMYRA, SYRIA — Experts are returning to Syria's war-ravaged heritage sites, hoping to lay the groundwork for restoring them and reviving tourism, which they say could provide a much-needed boost to the country's decimated economy after nearly 14 years of war. Once-thriving landmarks like the ancient city of Palmyra and the medieval Crusader castle of Crac des Chevaliers remain scarred by years of conflict, but local tourists are returning to the sites, and conservationists hope their historical and cultural significance will eventually draw international visitors back. Palmyra One of Syria's six UNESCO World Heritage sites, Palmyra, was once a key hub to the ancient Silk Road network linking the Roman and Parthian empires to Asia. Located in the Syrian desert, it is renowned for its 2,000-year-old Roman-era ruins. It is now marked by shattered columns and damaged temples. Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011 and soon escalated into a brutal civil war, Palmyra was Syria's main tourist destination, attracting around 150,000 visitors monthly, Ayman Nabu, a researcher and expert in ruins told The Associated Press. Dubbed the 'Bride of the Desert,' he said 'Palmyra revitalized the steppe and used to be a global tourist magnet.' The ancient city was the capital of an Arab client state of the Roman Empire that briefly rebelled and carved out its own kingdom in the third century, led by Queen Zenobia. In more recent times, the area had darker associations. It was home to Tadmur prison, where thousands of opponents of the Assad family's rule in Syria were reportedly tortured. The Islamic State group demolished the prison after capturing the town. IS militants later destroyed Palmyra's historic temples of Bel and Baalshamin and the Arch of Triumph, viewing them as monuments to idolatry, and beheaded an elderly antiquities scholar who had dedicated his life to overseeing the ruins. Between 2015 and 2017, control of Palmyra shifted between IS and the Syrian army before Assad's forces, backed by Russia and Iran-aligned militias, recaptured it. Fakhr al-Din al-Ma'ani Castle, a 16th-century fortress overlooking the city, was repurposed by Russian troops as a military barracks. Nabu, the researcher, visited Palmyra five days after the fall of the former government. 'We saw extensive excavation within the tombs,' he said, noting significant destruction by both IS and Assad government forces. 'The (Palmyra) museum was in a deplorable state, with missing documents and artifacts — we have no idea what happened to them.' Inside the city's underground tombs, Islamic verses are scrawled on the walls, while plaster covers wall paintings, some depicting mythological themes that highlight Palmyra's deep cultural ties to the Greco-Roman world. Crac des Chevaliers Beyond Palmyra, other historical sites bear the scars of war. Perched on a hill near the town of Al-Husn, with sweeping views, Crac des Chevaliers, a medieval castle originally built by the Romans and later expanded by the Crusaders, was heavily bombarded during the Syrian civil war. On a recent day, armed fighters in military uniform roamed the castle grounds alongside local tourists, taking selfies among the ruins. Hazem Hanna, an architect and head of the antiquities department of Crac des Chevaliers, pointed to the collapsed columns and an entrance staircase obliterated by airstrikes. Damage from government airstrikes in 2014 destroyed much of the central courtyard and the arabesque-adorned columns, Hanna said. The Dead Cities In northwest Syria, more than 700 abandoned Byzantine settlements called Dead Cities, stretch across rocky hills and plains, their weathered limestone ruins featuring remnants of stone houses, basilicas, tombs and colonnaded streets. Despite partial collapse, arched doorways, intricate carvings and towering church facades endure, surrounded by olive trees that root deep into history. Dating back to the first century, these villages once thrived on trade and agriculture. Today, some sites now shelter displaced Syrians, with stone houses repurposed as homes and barns, their walls blackened by fire and smoke. Crumbling structures suffer from poor maintenance and careless repurposing. Looters have ravaged the ancient sites, Nabu said, leaving gaping holes in search of artifacts. Local visitors carve names and messages into centuries-old walls. Sheep enclosures dot the ruins, plastic debris blending with ancient stone. Moustafa Al-Kaddour, a local resident, returned after eight years. Touring the ruins with family members he brought from Quneitra. He said the Assad forces had established a military position in the village, subjecting the ruins to heavy shelling and gunfire. The area was then controlled by rebels, who made the area off-limits to most Syrians and international tourists, unlike Palmyra, which still saw some visitors during the war. The Dead Cities were added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2011 as an open-air museum, said Nabu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-push-to-restore-syria-s-war-torn-heritage-sites-including-roman-ruins-at-palmyra/7978643.html	2025-02-17T16:23:40-08:00	
European leaders hold crisis talks as US signals transatlantic reset	European leaders held a crisis meeting Monday in Paris to discuss Ukrainian and European security.

Taiwan considers multibillion-dollar arms purchase from US, sources say	WASHINGTON/TAIPEI — Taiwan is exploring buying arms worth billions of dollars from the United States, sources briefed on the matter said, hoping to win support from the new Trump administration as China continues to apply military pressure on the island. Three sources familiar with the situation, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters that Taiwan is in talks with Washington. The package is meant to demonstrate to the United States that Taiwan is committed to its defense, one of the sources said. A second source said the package would include coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rockets. 'I would be very surprised if it was less than $8 billion. Somewhere between $7 billion to $10 billion,' the source added. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz has said he wants to speed delivery of weapons to Taiwan. Taiwan's defense ministry declined to comment on specific purchases but said it is focused on building its defenses. 'Any weaponry and equipment that can achieve those goals for building the military are listed as targets for tender,' it said. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan strongly objects to China’s sovereignty claims and says only the island’s people can decide their future. Trump-Taiwan relations U.S. President Donald Trump unnerved chip powerhouse Taiwan on the election campaign trail by saying the island stole American semiconductor business. This month, he threatened tariffs on chip imports. But his administration maintained diplomatic support for the Chinese-claimed island. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba issued a joint statement on Feb. 7 opposing any attempt to change the current situation in the Taiwan Strait through force or coercion. The U.S. State Department also removed language on its website that it does not support Taiwan independence, a move praised by the island's government. China has urged the U.S. to 'correct its mistakes.' Taiwan plans to propose a special defense budget that prioritizes precision ammunition, air-defense upgrades, command and control systems, equipment for the reserve forces and anti-drone technology, a third source familiar with the matter said. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump established regular arms sales to Taiwan, including multibillion-dollar deals for F-16 fighter jets. The Biden administration continued these sales, though often with smaller price tags. Taiwanese officials see encouraging signs from Trump's administration even as tariff threats weigh on that optimism. Taiwan does not believe Trump is looking to make a 'grand bargain' with Chinese President Xi Jinping to sell out Taiwan's interests, one of the sources said. Trump is more concerned with putting tariffs on semiconductors, the source said. In another sign of U.S. commitment to Taiwan, the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Raymond Greene, will retain his post, three sources told Reuters, even as other U.S. diplomatic postings undergo major reshuffles. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Greene remains director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial U.S. Embassy in Taipei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-considers-multibillion-dollar-arms-purchase-from-us-sources-say-/7978401.html	2025-02-17T16:00:17-08:00

Weekend clashes claim 14 lives in drug violence-torn Ecuador	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Clashes between rival criminal groups claimed the lives of 14 people over the weekend in Ecuador's port city of Guayaquil, the epicenter of a bloody power struggle between narco gangs, police said Monday. In one incident, gunmen on motorcycles fired into a crowd gathered outside a grocery store, killing a minor and six adults, police chief Santiago Tuston said, warning of possible 'reprisals' to follow. Social media videos of the aftermath of the attack showed shocking images of bodies lying on the street in northern Guayaquil. Tuston said the massacre — the exact motive of which was not divulged — brought to 14 the number of people killed in Guayaquil over the weekend. He did not provide details of the other killings. Guayaquil is the capital of the southwestern Guayas province, where a state of emergency has been in place since January as authorities battle to curtail spiraling violence in the once-peaceful South American country. Ecuador is home to an estimated 20 criminal gangs involved in trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, wreaking havoc in a country of 18 million that is squeezed between the world's biggest cocaine producers, Peru and Colombia. In recent years, the nation has been plunged into violence by the rapid spread of transnational cartels that use its ports — particularly in Guayaquil — to ship drugs to the United States and Europe. Homicides have risen from six per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018 to a record 47 in 2023. Under a state of emergency and military crackdown launched by President Daniel Noboa, in office since November 2023, that figure dropped to 38 per 100,000 last year, according to official data. Last Friday, hitmen gunned down a colonel who had been in charge of anti-drug operations in a different part of the port city. Noboa is seeking a new term in elections that will go to a runoff in April after an inconclusive first round last Sunday saw him narrowly pip challenger Luisa Gonzalez. Over the weekend, the president replaced his interior minister with retired police general Fausto Buenano, who has years of experience fighting narco gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/weekend-clashes-claim-14-lives-in-drug-violence-torn-ecuador/7978377.html	2025-02-17T14:59:57-08:00

Bus crash in Bolivia kills over 30 people	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA — A bus crash in Bolivia on Monday killed at least 31 people and wounded over a dozen more, according to local police. The driver of the bus likely lost control of the vehicle, causing it to drop nearly 800 meters (2,625 feet) off a precipice in the southwestern municipality of Yocalla, said a police officer speaking from the local hospital. 'There are at least 30' deceased who have been counted already and are being transferred from the crash site to the morgue, Colonel Victor Benavides told AFP. Of those injured in the crash, 10 adults and four children had been hospitalized, with several in intensive care, an official from the hospital said in a video. The mountainous route is full of twists and turns, the police officer said, adding that the speed the bus was traveling at could have been a factor in the crash. Some information in this story came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bus-crash-in-bolivia-kills-over-30-people/7978338.html	2025-02-17T13:57:18-08:00	
Trump begins firings of FAA air traffic control staff just weeks after fatal DC plane crash	Washington — The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Probationary workers were targeted in late night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement. The affected workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told the Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief statement Monday it was 'analyzing the effect of the reported federal employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system and our members.' Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in 2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program that was in part funded by the Department of Defense. It's one of several programs that the FAA's National Defense Program manages that involve radars providing longer-range detection around the country's borders. Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one of the employees in that branch who was terminated. The Hawaii radar and the FAA National Defense Program office working on it 'is about protecting national security,' Spitzer-Stadtlander said. 'I don't think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, ‘oh no big deal, he just works for the FAA.’' Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said. The firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements. In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport. Just days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports. Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones. The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firings were first reported by CNN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-begins-firings-of-faa-air-traffic-control-staff-just-weeks-after-fatal-dc-plane-crash/7978308.html	2025-02-17T13:21:41-08:00	
Delta plane flips on landing at Toronto airport, injuring 8	A plane crashed at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday, officials said, with CBC television reporting the plane flipped on landing. CBC and CP24 television both reported eight people were injured. Toronto's Pearson Airport said it was aware of an incident involving a Delta Air Lines’ regional flight arriving from Minneapolis and that emergency teams were responding. All passengers and crew were accounted for, the airport said in a statement on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. 'Emergency teams are responding,' the post added. Other social media posts appeared to show the jet upside down on the tarmac in Toronto, Ontario. Representatives for Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'There is a plane crash. However, we don't know the circumstances surrounding it at this point,' said Constable Sarah Patten of the Peel Regional Police in Ontario. 'It is my understanding that most of the passengers are out and unharmed but we're still trying to make sure so we're still on scene investigating,' Patten said. Airport staff told local media, CTV News, that the airport shut down arrivals and departures for the time being. Reuters was unable to confirm this with Pearson Airport officials, but the airport’s website shows multiple delays impacting arrivals and departures. Peel police say paramedics on the scene have set up a staging area off the runway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delta-plane-flips-on-landing-at-toronto-airport-injuring-8/7978293.html	2025-02-17T13:11:08-08:00	
Syria arrests 3 men suspected of links to 2013 Tadamon massacre	TADAMON, SYRIA — Security forces in Syria said Monday that they arrested three people involved in the execution of hundreds of civilians by government forces in Damascus in 2013, two years after the country’s 13-year civil war began. Dozens of police and security trucks lined the streets of Tadamon, a Damascus suburb near the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, where they carried out the arrests in the same streets that once bore witness to mass executions. Masked, rifle-wielding men moved through hollowed-out buildings, remnants of a war that turned the district into a front line between government forces and opposition fighters. In 2022, a leaked video dated April 16, 2013, appeared to contain harrowing footage of the executions. The near seven-minute clip showed members of Syria’s notorious Military Intelligence Branch 227 leading a line of about 40 blindfolded prisoners, their hands tied behind their backs, into an abandoned building in Tadamon. One by one, the gunmen pushed or kicked the prisoners into a trench filled with old tires, shooting them as they fell. One of the three men arrested was Monzer Al-Jazairi, a resident of the Zahira neighborhood and a former operative with the military security that operated before the fall of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. 'We used to bring detainees arrested at checkpoints, put them under the buildings here and execute them, and then after we’re done, explode the buildings over them,' Al-Jazairi told The Associated Press. It was unclear whether Al-Jazairi, flanked by security men as he spoke, was speaking under duress or voluntarily. 'Every batch constituted around 25 [people],' he said, adding that 'around one week' passed between one batch and the next. He estimated that he and his colleagues killed 'around 500' people. Damascus Security Chief Lt. Col. Abdul Rahman Al-Dabbagh corroborated the number, citing additional confessions from those arrested. 'Many of those killed used to be collected at checkpoints and security (detention) centers, brought to Tadamon neighborhood, where they were executed,' Al-Dabbagh told the AP. The two other arrested suspects were identified as Somer Mohammed Al-Mahmoud and Imad Mohammed Al-Mahmoud. Years after the Syrian war’s worst massacres and mass disappearances, most alleged crimes have not been investigated and remain unpunished. Since Assad's ouster, Syrian security forces, under the new leadership led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have been tracking down and arresting remnants of the former government and military across the country. 'The operation is ongoing to apprehend all those involved in violations and massacres against Syrians,' Al-Dabbagh said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-arrests-3-men-suspected-of-links-to-2013-tadamon-massacre/7978208.html	2025-02-17T11:46:22-08:00	
Getting Cyprus natural gas to market via Egypt hailed as milestone	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — A pair of agreements outlining how sizable natural gas deposits inside Cypriot waters will get to market via processing facilities in Egypt are a milestone for energy cooperation, Cyprus' president said Monday. President Nikos Christodoulides said the cooperation between Cyprus and Egypt is helping to define the regional energy map, calling the agreements 'game-changers' that are 'pivotal for our strategic partnership.' The first agreement between Egypt, Cyprus and a consortium made up of energy companies Total of France and Italy’s Eni foresees piping natural gas from a deposit known as Cronos to Egyptian facilities where it will be liquefied and processed for export to markets including Europe. The Eni-Total consortium, which holds exploratory licenses for four of the 13 areas or blocks inside Cyprus’ offshore economic zone, will make a final decision on how it will extract and convey the gas before the summer this year. Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi called the agreement a decisive step toward creating an energy hub in the eastern Mediterranean. Officials haven't disclosed how large the Cronos deposit is, but it's believed to hold more than the Aphrodite deposit — the first gas field discovered inside Cyprus' exclusive economic zone in 2011 — that's estimated to contain 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The second agreement between Egypt, Cyprus and a consortium composed of Chevron, NewMed Energy and Shell sets out the framework under which the Aphrodite deposit will be developed and monetized. The Aphrodite deal comes three days after the Cypriot government and the Chevron-led consortium approved a revised development and production plan for the deposit that includes a floating platform that processes extracted natural gas as well as a pipeline link to Egypt. Cypriot Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said last month the options of whether to use Aphrodite gas for Egypt’s domestic energy needs or to process it for export are still being weighed. Christodoulides also held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the two countries' next energy cooperation goals as well as regional developments. Christodoulides also met on the sidelines of Egypt’s energy exhibition EGYPES 2025 with ExxonMobil’s Vice President for Global Exploration John Ardill. ExxonMobil and partners Qatar Petroleum — which hold exploration licenses for two Cypriot blocks — are currently drilling a new well near the existing Glaucus deposit, which is estimated to contain 5 to 8 trillion cubic feet of gas. Papanastasiou has said there are 'positive' indications of natural gas quantities at the new Elektra well, also in Cypriot waters, with preliminary results expected in early April.	https://www.voanews.com/a/getting-cyprus-natural-gas-to-market-via-egypt-hailed-as-milestone/7978170.html	2025-02-17T11:17:00-08:00	
World Bank: Afghanistan's economic recovery precarious	ISLAMABAD — The World Bank reported Monday that the economic recovery in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan remains precarious, beset by persistent challenges, including policy uncertainty, financial isolation, reduced foreign aid and fragile trade relations with neighboring Pakistan. The bank assessed in its latest report that persistent high poverty levels, unemployment, limited resources, and weak purchasing power continue to leave millions of Afghans vulnerable in a country reeling from years of conflict and natural disasters. The World Bank report revealed that Afghanistan’s trade deficit surged by 54% in 2024, reaching $9 billion, which represents 45% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report attributes this decline to a 5% drop in exports, totaling $1.8 billion, primarily due to a reduction in coal and textile exports. In August 2021, the Islamist Taliban regained control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of all U.S.-led Western forces from the country, marking the end of nearly two decades of foreign presence. The Taliban takeover led to the suspension of international aid and the imposition of sanctions on the financial and banking sectors. These measures were implemented in response to terrorism concerns, as key Taliban leaders were designated as global terrorists by the United Nations for directing years of insurgent attacks on U.S.-led foreign troops. 'Coal exports saw the steepest decline, plunging 64 percent to USD 92 million as Pakistan shifted to its traditional suppliers,' stated the World Bank. The report highlighted an 11.5% increase in Afghan revenue collection, primarily driven by non-tax revenue and taxes levied at the country’s borders. 'Revenue collection remained strong in the first ten months of FY2024-25 (March 22, 2024 – January 21, 2025), totaling AFN 190.5 billion ($2.5 billion), or 12 percent of annual GDP,' stated the report. The local currency, the Afghani (AFN), continued its depreciation trajectory for the third consecutive month, falling 12% from November 2024 to January 2025. The report explained that the central Afghan bank suspended U.S. dollar auctions from Sept. 4 to Dec. 9, contributing to the depreciation of the local currency. The auctions resumed in January 2025, with the bank injecting more than $100 million. The World Bank noted that Afghanistan, a landlocked nation, is compelled to diversify its export markets due to its precarious trade relations with Pakistan. Consequently, Iran, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan each account for approximately 3% of the overall volume of Afghan exports. 'However, Pakistan remains the largest export destination, accounting for 45%, followed by India at 34%,' the report stated. Afghanistan relies on Pakistani overland routes and seaports for bilateral and international trade. Allegations that militants on Afghan soil are responsible for the rise in terrorist attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan have strained ties, affecting economic cooperation between the countries. Pakistani officials have also complained that the Taliban have imposed high taxes and duties on bilateral trade, demanding significantly higher coal prices than international rates, resulting in a decline in mutual trade. Furthermore, Islamabad asserts that de facto Afghan authorities are delaying the signing of trade-related agreements, thereby hindering the advancement of bilateral economic cooperation. No countries have recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan, primarily due to restrictions on freedom of speech and female rights to education and employment. The Taliban attribute the difficulties in achieving economic recovery in the country to Western financial sanctions and the freezing of more than $9 billion in Afghan central bank assets held in the United States and other Western nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-afghanistan-s-economic-recovery-precarious/7978106.html	2025-02-17T11:08:59-08:00	
Chinese official tours Thai-Myanmar border, highlights crackdown on scam centers	Bangkok — Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appeared to gain momentum Monday as a top Chinese security official visited both sides of the Thai-Myanmar border ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry. The visit by Liu Zhongyi, China’s vice minister of public security and commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, was part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem, Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters. Areas of Myanmar bordering Thailand have been serving as havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people from Southeast Asia and elsewhere who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Such scams have cost victims around the world tens of billions of dollars, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery. Last week, some 260 people from 20 nations, including many from Africa, crossed from Myanmar into Thailand after they were reportedly rescued from scam centers. Thailand and China coordinate crackdown on scam centers On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China’s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks. Just ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border, citing national security and severe damage that Thailand has suffered from scam operations. The repatriations of foreign workers from Myanmar have been organized by the Border Guard Force in Myawaddy, a militia of the Karen ethnic minority that exercises control over the area. However, critics have accused it of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers. The group's leader, Saw Chit Thu, denied in a news conference Monday that his group was involved in scam activities, but acknowledged business links to some properties hosting the centers, which he said initially operated simply as resorts. Thai media reported last week that Thailand's Department of Special Investigation was considering seeking arrest warrants for Chit Thu and others for alleged human trafficking. Thousands of workers employed by scam networks Thai officials have said as many as 7,000-10,000 more people may be repatriated, but Phumtham cautioned that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their home countries. The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that an initial batch of about 600 Chinese nationals from scam centers are expected to be flown back to China on chartered flights when Liu concludes his visit. Liu visited the border areas in Thailand’s Tak province Monday and appeared in Myawaddy in Myanmar, apparently at a location where hundreds of people believed to have been rounded up from several scam centers are being held awaiting repatriation. The video of Liu’s visit showed hundreds of people there sitting on the ground with their belongings in a large open-walled hall. 'China is actively conducting bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries, taking comprehensive measures to address both the symptoms and root causes, and working together to block criminals from committing crimes in relevant countries,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing. 'This is part of our joint efforts to eradicate the scourge of online gambling and telecom fraud, and to maintain the safety of people’s lives and property and the order of exchanges and cooperation among regional countries.' Stories of Chinese trapped in Myanmar hurt Thailand's reputation Dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Thailand only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar spread widely on social media in China, causing alarm and denting Thailand's reputation as a safe destination for Chinese visitors. Among those trapped was Chinese actor Wang Xing, who arrived in Thailand on a promise of getting a job and was abducted to Myanmar. He was quickly rescued after the incident circulated on social media. An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023, after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations along its border in Myanmar’s northern Shan state. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-official-tours-thai-myanmar-border-highlights-crackdown-on-scam-centers/7978011.html	2025-02-17T09:43:40-08:00	
Top Greek scientist: Santorini earthquake outlook remains uncertain	ATHENS — The Greek government’s chief seismologist says the frequency of earthquakes affecting Santorini and nearby islands has eased in recent days, but that the outlook for continued tremors in the coming weeks remains uncertain. 'Unfortunately, for now, we must wait. These seismic sequences do not end quickly. They follow their own timeline,' seismologist Costas Papazachos told state-run ERT radio Monday. 'Hopefully, this particular sequence will surprise us in a positive way and resolve itself sooner rather than later,' he said. A state of emergency has been declared on Santorini and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi after a swarm of undersea earthquakes this month – sometimes felt every few minutes – prompted thousands of residents and workers to move to the Greek mainland. Schools on the islands remain closed for a third week, while security services have set up rescue teams and backup power generators as part of precautionary measures. The government announced Monday that an emergency port facility was being established on Santorini in case of a wide-scale evacuation. Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at the University of Thessaloniki, currently serves as the representative of two emergency committees that include scientists and officials from government, the military, and emergency services. He said Santorini, a volcanic island shaped by catastrophic eruptions, did not face danger from its dormant volcano, but noted that magma was affecting the tremors. 'The root cause of the activity is the interaction of tectonic and magmatic processes,' he said. 'That does not mean that the molten material – the magma – will manage to break through 8 kilometers [5 miles] of crust and reach the surface, causing a new volcanic eruption.' Scientists were developing a clearer picture after gathering data from multiple sensors, he said. 'We are monitoring not only seismographs but also numerous other systems that track ground deformation, gas emissions, and satellite data,' he said. 'At this moment, I can honestly say we do not have a definitive forecast, as it is too early to assess the current slight de-escalation of seismic activity. We have encountered many surprises.' Earthquakes of up to magnitude 5.1 were recorded Monday in the undersea area bordered by the four islands which remain under a state of emergency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-greek-scientist-santorini-earthquake-outlook-remains-uncertain-/7977959.html	2025-02-17T09:02:02-08:00	
American arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges freed	Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S. official. The move appears to be an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. According to media reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he had attempted to smuggle a 'significant amount' of drugs into the country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling, punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years. Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released to the embassy late Sunday evening. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive matters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response to a question about Byers that Moscow expects 'to discuss restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations' at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, 'so certain events can be viewed in this context.' It wasn't immediately clear whether Byers' fiancee was also released. Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges. Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to those Byers had faced. Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the U.S., returned to Russia. The release of Fogel and Byers come as tensions between Russia and the U.S. appear to ease. President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Russia's President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-arrested-in-moscow-on-drug-smuggling-charges-freed/7977934.html	2025-02-17T08:41:08-08:00	
Somali officials: US airstrike against Islamic State kills 16 militants	Washington — U.S. airstrikes killed 16 militants affiliated with the Islamic State terrorist group in northern Somalia, officials there said Monday. A spokesperson for security operations in the Puntland region, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, disclosed the death toll in an interview VOA’s Somali Service. 'The strike carried out by our international security partners killed at least 16 militants including two senior members identified as the group’s bomb-makers, and a bomb factory was destroyed,' Ahmed said. He said local officials are working to verify the names and nationalities of the bomb-makers. Ahmed said that the United Arab Emirates played a role Sunday’s attack. 'The United States government and the United Arab Emirates, both our partners supporting us in the fight against terrorists, were involved [in] the strikes on Sunday night,' he added. Ahmed said the strikes targeted Godka Kunle and Xankookin, two villages in the Cal Miskaad mountain range in Puntland’s Bari region. Ahmed said during the airstrikes, the militants launched drone attacks on the bases of the Puntland security forces in the area. 'Trying to hit back the bases of our security forces, the militants used seven drones. Puntland forces shot down five of them and two others, apparently with explosives, went off,' Ahmed claimed. Somali and U.S. authorities have been working to root out Islamic State groups that established hideouts in mountainous parts of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in northern Somalia. The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in a statement Monday that it conducted an airstrike against ISIS-Somalia in the country’s northeast Sunday, killing two terrorists, according to an initial assessment. AFRICOM said no civilians were harmed in the operation and said it would continue to evaluate the results and provide updates as necessary. Speaking in Mogadishu, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud commended the U.S. airstrikes. 'The latest U.S. precision strikes against terrorist elements in Puntland reaffirms the strong partnership between Somalia and the United States in the fight against terrorism,' Mohamud said in a statement posted by the Somali National News Agency (SONNA). Sunday’s airstrike is the second the U.S. military carried out in Somalia this month. A similar operation on Feb. 1, which targeted senior ISIS-Somalia leadership in a network of cave complexes in Puntland’s Golis Mountains, killed approximately 14 ISIS operatives, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who the U.S. identified as a key recruiter and financier responsible for coordinating jihadi movements into the U.S. and Europe. Puntland authorities recently launched a military offensive against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. Puntland claims to have since killed more than 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-officials-us-airstrike-against-islamic-state-kills-16-militants/7977846.html	2025-02-17T07:36:02-08:00	
1st openly gay Muslim imam killed in South Africa; ‘hate crime’ suspected	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A man regarded as the first openly gay Muslim imam has been fatally shot while sitting in a car in South Africa in what many are calling an assassination because of his teachings. Muhsin Hendricks was killed Saturday in the southern city of Gqeberha after being ambushed by two men in a pick-up truck. Police said the men involved in the killing had their faces covered. A security video of the shooting shows one of them jumping out of their vehicle, running up to the car Hendricks was in and firing a pistol multiple times through a side window. Police have not established a motive for the killing, but political parties and LGBTQ+ organizations say Hendricks was targeted because he started a mosque in Cape Town for gay people and called for members of the LGBTQ+ community to be welcomed into Islam. Homosexuality is forbidden in the Islamic religion. South Africa's Justice Ministry said it was investigating claims that Hendricks was the target of an assassination. Hendricks was known internationally and spoke at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's conference in South Africa last year. The ILGA family 'is in deep shock at the news of the murder of Muhsin Hendricks and calls on authorities to thoroughly investigate what we fear may be a hate crime,' said Julia Ehrt, executive director of ILGA. 'He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith.' The ILGA said Hendricks had spoken of how some people were calling for the closing of his mosque and had branded it the 'gay temple.' The Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second biggest political party, said 'the nature of the killing strongly suggests a professional hit.' Hendricks came out publicly as a gay imam in the mid-1990s and started a support network and later a mosque for gay Muslims. He advocated for their inclusion through his Al-Ghurbaab Foundation and referred to himself as 'the world's first openly queer imam.' 'When I was looking at the way queer Muslims were negotiating this dilemma between Islam and their sexual orientation and identity, I felt compelled to do something about it,' he said, explaining his beliefs. 'And I thought, for me to help would probably be for me to be authentic with myself and come out. I think it's possible to be queer and Muslim or queer and Christian.' In a message on its official Facebook page, the Al-Ghurbaab Foundation said Hendricks was 'a great father and a guardian of many. Continue resting with angels.' The Muslim Judicial Council of South Africa said that while it had consistently stated that Hendricks' position was incompatible with Islamic teachings, 'we unequivocally condemn his murder and any acts of violence targeting members of the LGBTQ community or any other community.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/st-openly-gay-muslim-imam-killed-in-south-africa-hate-crime-suspected-/7977802.html	2025-02-17T06:40:30-08:00	
Doctors change pope's treatment to tackle 'complex' situation, Vatican says	Vatican City — Doctors have changed treatment for Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection to tackle a 'complex clinical situation' and he will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican said on Monday. 'The results of the tests carried out in recent days and today have demonstrated a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract, which has led to a further modification of the therapy,' said a brief statement. 'All tests conducted up to today are indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an appropriate hospital stay,' it said. The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pontiff was 'in good spirits.' He did not specify whether the pope was suffering from a bacterial or viral infection, but said a further update on the pope's condition would be issued later on Monday. While a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down their fever or help their body fight the infection. A polymicrobial infection is one caused by two or more micro-organisms, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The Vatican said on Monday that the pope's planned weekly audience in St. Peter's Square, set for Wednesday, had been cancelled 'due to the continued hospitalization of the Holy Father.' The pope's doctors had earlier ordered complete rest, and Francis was unable to deliver his regular weekly prayer on Sunday to pilgrims in St Peter's Square or lead a special Mass for artists to mark the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year. 'Quite worried’ by pope’s absence Pilgrims visiting the Vatican on Monday offered their hopes that Francis would recover soon. 'We certainly wish for him to get better very quickly,' said Rev. Tyler Carter, a Catholic priest from the United States. 'He is our father and our shepherd, and so we want his continued health and blessing.' Manuel Rossi, a tourist from Milan, Italy, said he was 'quite worried' when the pope cancelled his appearance on Sunday. 'I am 18 years old so I have seen few popes in my life, and am very close to him,' said Rossi. 'I hope he recovers as soon as possible.' While in hospital over the weekend, the pope continued his recent practice of making phone calls to speak with members of a Catholic parish in Gaza, Italian broadcaster Mediaset reported on Monday. One of the parish members said Francis had called on both Friday and Saturday and was in 'good spirits' but sounded 'a bit tired.' 'Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you accompany me in these days,' a post on the pope's X account said on Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-change-pope-s-treatment-to-tackle-complex-situation-vatican-says/7977788.html	2025-02-17T06:32:47-08:00	
Global benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump	Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves. France's CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59, while Germany's DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain's FTSE 100 edged up 0.1% to 8,742.97. U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at 39,174.25. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation’s products and services. In other regional markets, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,537.10. South Korea's Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83. Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade war. His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and other countries to negotiate. The Federal Reserve's goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is to keep inflation at 2%. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-benchmarks-trade-mixed-as-investors-continue-to-eye-trump/7977753.html	2025-02-17T06:05:53-08:00	
Life-threatening cold' expected in some parts of US after deadly weekend flooding	Louisville, Kentucky — Harsh weather moved west on Monday as a polar vortex was expected to grip the Rockies and the northern Plains after winter storms pummeled the eastern United States over the weekend, killing at least 10 people, including nine victims in Kentucky who died during flooding from heavy rains. The National Weather Service warned of 'life-threatening cold' into Tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern Montana predicted to dip as low as -42.7 degrees Celsius (45 degrees below zero) with wind chills down to -51 degrees Celsius (60 below). Meteorologists said several states would experience the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that the death toll rose to nine. 'I am sad to share some more tough news tonight, Kentucky. We just confirmed another weather-related death out of Pike County, bringing our total loss to 9 people.' Beshear had said earlier Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued. President Donald Trump approved Kentucky's request for a disaster declaration, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts throughout the state. Beshear said most of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. 'So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,' he said. Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,' Oravec said Sunday. In Alabama, the weather service in Birmingham said it had confirmed an EF-1 tornado touched down in Hale County. Storms there and elsewhere in the state destroyed or damaged a handful of mobile homes, downed trees and toppled power lines, but no injuries were immediately reported. A state of emergency was declared for parts of Obion County, Tennessee, after a levee failed on Saturday, flooding the small community of Rives, home to around 300 people in the western part of the state. 'There will be mandatory evacuations in effect for the residents in Rives due to the rising water, no electricity, and freezing temperatures creating a life-threatening situation,' Mayor Steve Carr said in a statement Sunday. In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures as low as minus 45.6 (50 degrees below zero) were expected in most of North Dakota, which remained under an 'extreme cold warning' along with large swaths of South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the weather service. Severe flooding Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia over the weekend. Flood warnings extended throughout Tennessee and Arkansas. The mother and child were swept away Saturday night in Kentucky’s Bonnieville community, Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, county Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. There was a total of four deaths in Hart County, Beshear said. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it had closed its emergency department and transferred all patients to two other hospitals in the region due to a nearby river flooding. High winds brought down trees and power poles across Albemarle County, Virginia. The Charlottesville Police Department said Sunday on social media that officers’ response times could be delayed due to 'an overwhelming number of weather-related calls for service.' Police urged residents to stay off the roads. Power outages were reported along much of the eastern seaboard, from New York south to Georgia. In West Virginia, 13 southern counties were under a state of emergency for flooding and some areas were cut off to vehicle traffic Sunday. Several volunteer fire departments dealt with flooding in their own buildings while answering rescue and evacuation calls. Parts of US hit with snowstorms, polar vortex on the way Ice and snow made road travel treacherous in large swaths of Michigan, which remained under a winter weather advisory until Monday afternoon. Michigan State Police reported 114 crashes Sunday around the Detroit area since snow started falling Saturday. 'Fortunately, most were one-car spin outs and there were no serious injuries,' Michigan State Police said on X. Authorities in Colorado reported eight people were killed in fatal vehicle crashes since Valentine’s Day and warned drivers to be cautious as the weather made driving more difficult. The causes of the fatal crashes weren’t immediately known. Also in Colorado, three state patrol cruisers that had pulled over along roadsides were struck by other vehicles, including one on Sunday where a trooper had stopped as officials prepared to close a road because of ice. In each case the troopers were out of their cruisers at the time and were uninjured. Avalanche warnings were issued for numerous areas of the Rocky Mountains stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with the danger rated highest in Utah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/life-threatening-cold-expected-in-some-parts-of-us-after-deadly-weekend-flooding/7977727.html	2025-02-17T05:57:11-08:00	
China aims to improve ties with EU amid transatlantic tension	Taipei, Taiwan — China has launched a new round of diplomatic outreach to European countries amid rising tension between the United States and its European allies. While top U.S. officials and European leaders clashed over issues such as values, democracy and Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi held bilateral meetings with several top European officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. 'There is no fundamental conflict of interest or geopolitical conflicts between China and the EU,' Wang said during his meeting with Kallas on Saturday, adding that Beijing 'supports all endeavors conducive to peace and backs Europe in playing a significant role' in the peace negotiation process regarding the war in Ukraine. The EU response was somewhat more reserved, with Kallas saying the EU was ready to 'continue with dialogue and cooperate in selected areas, such as trade, economic affairs, and climate change.' He urged Beijing to halt exports of dual-use goods to Russia, which she said fuels Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Wang’s remarks were in stark contrast to U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s criticism of European countries. Instead of highlighting the threats posed by Russia and China, Vance accused European government of censoring right-wing parties and failing to control migration. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,' he said in a defiant speech that stunned European officials in Munich. Several European leaders quickly rejected Vance’s remarks, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius saying the U.S. vice president’s characterization of European policies was 'unacceptable.' The rare open clash between the U.S. and European countries came as top U.S. officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff flew to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for talks about the Ukraine-Russia war with Russian diplomats. To the surprise of many European leaders, U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said in Munich that European countries wouldn’t be part of any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, which would be mediated by the U.S. Analysts say China’s effort to strengthen engagement with Europe is part of Beijing’s plan to take advantage of divisions between Washington and its European allies. 'China’s posture is about exploiting the perceived mistakes of any U.S. administration,' said Mathieu Duchatel, director of international studies at the French policy group Institut Montaigne. He told VOA by phone that the current tension between the U.S. and European countries has created an opportunity for Beijing to 'weaken the transatlantic alliance on China policy.' Given that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on European countries, other experts say the growing tension in transatlantic relations could force the EU to moderate its policies towards China. 'Since Europe can't afford to wage two trade wars at the same time, it will be difficult for the EU and EU member states to maintain critical policies toward China,' Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA in an interview in Taipei. In recent weeks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has pushed the EU to adopt more assertive policies against China, has repeatedly said the bloc is open to improving relations with China. Europe 'must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest,' she said during a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. US-European ties expected to hold While European countries may consider adjusting their China policies, some European analysts say it’s unlikely for these attempts to turn into a fundamental shift of European policies towards China and the U.S. 'The U.S. and Europe are each other’s most important trading partners, so I don’t think there will be a [complete] transatlantic break,' said Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. European countries 'are testing the grounds and seeing what can be done, but at the same time, European officials have said whatever happens with China, it must be fair,' she told VOA by phone, adding that these factors will prevent the EU from 'walking back' their earlier positions on China entirely. Additionally, Duchatel at Institut Montaigne said Beijing’s decision to appoint former Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye, a prominent 'wolf warrior diplomat,' as its special representative for European affairs means China is unlikely to make major concessions in its relations with the EU. 'Lu’s appointment represents inflexibility on everything that matters,' he told VOA, adding that some European diplomats said the new Chinese special envoy would 'turn any diplomatic meeting into some sort of ideological confrontation that leads to no common position' between Beijing and European countries. While China and the EU’s fundamental differences over issues such as Beijing’s partnership with Russia and the trade imbalances remain unresolved, some Chinese academics say the growing tension between the U.S. and European countries still offers an opportunity for Beijing and Europe to 'increase mutual trust.' 'The growing tension in transatlantic relations has created a new environment for China to moderate relations with the EU, but it doesn’t mean European countries will reduce their criticism over Beijing’s partnership with Russia or China’s human rights record,' Shen Ding-li, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-aims-to-improve-ties-with-eu-amid-transatlantic-tension/7977635.html	2025-02-17T05:25:00-08:00	
Rubio visits Saudi Arabia as Israel, Hamas move closer to end of first phase of ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday as part of a tour of the region that includes a focus on the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Rubio was expected to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman amid objections from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza. Trump has suggested the Palestinians would go to neighboring countries, with the United States taking over Gaza and redeveloping the territory. Such a plan would seemingly eliminate Trump’s hopes of getting Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, a move Saudi officials have said will not happen unless there is a pathway for a Palestinian state. The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' With the first phase of the ceasefire set to expire in two weeks, Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in Jerusalem that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants. The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on February 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-visits-saudi-arabia-as-israel-hamas-move-closer-to-end-of-first-phase-of-ceasefire-/7977580.html	2025-02-17T03:54:08-08:00

Militant attack kills 6 Benin soldiers, army spokesperson says	COTONOU, Benin — A militant attack on an army position has killed six soldiers in northern Benin, where government troops are trying to curb cross-border assaults by armed Islamist groups, an army spokesperson said. The encounter on Saturday also left 17 militants dead, spokesperson Ebenezer Honfoga told Reuters late on Sunday, without giving further details. The attack follows the killing of dozens of soldiers in a January assault in the northern department of Alibori, which shares a border with insurgency-plagued Niger and Burkina Faso. Benin and coastal neighbor Togo have both suffered attacks in recent years as groups linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda expanded their presence beyond West Africa's central Sahel region to the north.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militant-attack-kills-6-benin-soldiers-army-spokesperson-says/7977503.html	2025-02-17T01:18:37-08:00	
State media: Cairo building collapse kills 10	Cairo, Egypt — A building collapse in the Egyptian capital killed 10 people and injured eight more on Monday, with several others believed to be missing under the rubble, state media reported. Ambulances were dispatched to the scene in the working-class neighborhood of Kerdasa, where civil defense teams searched for people thought to be missing under the rubble, according to the Al-Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper. Eyewitnesses told the state-owned outlet that 'a gas cylinder explosion' caused the collapse, and a police investigation was underway. Building regulations are unevenly enforced in the sprawling metropolis of Cairo, home to over 26 million people. The city has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent years, both due to the dilapidated state of some and, at times, failure to comply with building regulations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-media-cairo-building-collapse-kills-10-/7977495.html	2025-02-17T00:55:46-08:00

China urges US to 'correct its mistakes' after State Department removes Taiwan web reference	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China on Monday urged the United States to 'correct its mistakes' after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said was part of a routine update. The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington's opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own. But as well as dropping the phrase 'we do not support Taiwan independence,' the page added a reference to Taiwan's cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan's membership in international organizations 'where applicable.' Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as encouraging Taiwan's separate status from China. The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White House. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department's website were a big step backwards and 'sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan independence separatist forces.' 'This is yet another example of the United States' stubborn adherence to the erroneous policy of 'using Taiwan to suppress China'. We urge the United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,' Guo said. The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. 'As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,' a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time responding to questions on the updated website wording. 'The United States remains committed to its one China policy,' the spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position on Taiwan's sovereignty and only acknowledging China's position on the subject. 'The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,' the spokesperson said. 'We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.' On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the 'support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that only the island's people can decide their future. Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, who set up the People's Republic of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-us-to-correct-its-mistakes-after-state-department-removes-taiwan-web-reference/7977487.html	2025-02-17T00:17:14-08:00	
China's Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S. Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi's Lei Jun, BYD's Wang Chuanfu, Unitree's Wang Xingxing, and CATL's Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed. Meituan's Wang Xing, China Feihe's Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed. Tencent's Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma. The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said. The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development. But China's efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities. 'It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,' said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. 'The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.' Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing. 'Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,' said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. 'Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-holds-rare-meeting-with-business-leaders-amid-slowing-economy-us-tensions/7977476.html	2025-02-16T23:33:34-08:00	
France hosting European talks on Ukraine	French President Emmanuel Macron is set to host a group of European leaders for talks Monday focused on the situation in Ukraine amid a shift in the U.S. approach to the conflict and suggestions by U.S. officials that Europe would not have a role in peace talks. Among those expected to attend were leaders from Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark. NATO chief Mark Rutte, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also due to participate. European leaders have in recent days pledged continued support for Ukraine, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying his government was ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force. 'I do not say that lightly,' he wrote Sunday in the Daily Telegraph. 'I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way.' Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from further aggression. Costa said last week’s Munich Security Conference showed the clear message that the security of Ukraine and the European Union 'cannot be separated.' 'There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the European Union.' U.S. officials said Sunday they were heading to Saudi Arabia for talks in the coming days with Russian diplomats about ending the war, which began in February 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace negotiations, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' in an interview that aired Sunday, 'A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing.' 'We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, in a way that is sustainable and fair,' Rubio said. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The shape of the talks remained uncertain. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. 'Nothing's been finalized yet,' he said, adding that the hope was for an opening for a broad conversation that 'would include Ukraine and would involve the end of the war.' Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with Zelenskyy later saying that there should be 'no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once 'real negotiations' begin, then Ukraine 'will have to be involved.' In an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said, 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.' Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace. 'I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.'' The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win. Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult' to defeat Russia. 'And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.' Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014, the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured after that, and areas Russian forces have taken since February 2022. Some information for this article came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-hosting-european-talks-on-ukraine/7977462.html	2025-02-16T22:29:25-08:00	
US says strike in Syria killed Al-Qaeda affiliate official	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said Sunday it killed a member of an Al-Qaeda affiliate organization in a precision airstrike in Syria. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said it conducted the strike Saturday 'in Northwest Syria targeting and killing a senior finance and logistics official in the terrorist organization Hurras al-Din (HaD), an al-Qaida affiliate,' according to a statement on X. CENTCOM did not identify its target. The strike was conducted 'to disrupt and degrade efforts by terrorists to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against civilians and military personnel' from the United States and allies, the statement continued. On Jan. 30, CENTCOM killed another senior operative in Hurras al-Din, Muhammad Salah al-Zabir, in an airstrike. The U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group said Hurras al-Din was founded in February 2018. It did not publicly confirm its allegiance to al-Qaida until its dissolution announcement last month. The United States designated Hurras al-Din as a terrorist organization in 2019 and has offered financial rewards for information on several of its members. 'We will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists in order to defend our homeland, and U.S., allied, and partner personnel in the region,' CENTCOM General Michael Erik Kurilla said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-strike-in-syria-killed-al-qaeda-affiliate-official-/7977430.html	2025-02-16T19:37:48-08:00	
New downloads of DeepSeek suspended in South Korea, data protection agency says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's data protection authority on Monday said new downloads of the Chinese AI app DeepSeek had been suspended in the country after DeepSeek acknowledged failing to take into account some of the agency's rules on protecting personal data. The service of the app will be resumed once improvements are made in accordance with the country's privacy law, the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) said in a media briefing. The measure that came into force on Saturday aims to block new downloads of the app, the agency said, though DeepSeek's web service remains accessible in the country. The Chinese startup appointed legal representatives last week in South Korea and had acknowledged partially neglecting considerations of the country's data protection law, the PIPC said. Italy's data protection authority, the Garante, said last month it had ordered DeepSeek to block its chatbot in the country after failing to address the regulator's concerns over its privacy policy. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked about earlier moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law. The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-downloads-of-deepseek-suspended-in-south-korea-data-protection-agency-says/7977429.html	2025-02-16T19:31:16-08:00	
Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter open the 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary celebration	NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th anniversary special celebrating 'Saturday Night Live' with a duet of his song 'Homeward Bound.' The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on 'SNL' since its earliest episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack. He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment, Carpenter. 'I sang this song with George Harrison on 'Saturday Night Live' in 1976,' Simon said. 'I was not born then,' Carpenter said, getting a laugh. 'And neither were my parents,' she added, getting a bigger laugh. Fifty seasons of 'Saturday Night Live' sketches, songs and special guests are being celebrated for the special's landmark anniversary in a Sunday night special. The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen Wiig. Many of those stars were on hand for 'SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration,' airing live from New York, of course. 'I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it's lived with me my whole life,' Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from 2001 to 2008,' said on Sunday ahead of the show's start. 'We have a show to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing privilege.' The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of 'Saturday Night Live,' which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner. 'After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it all for us,' Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the show. 'They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies. We worshiped their movies. And that's all. What we wanted to do is just kind of continue that sort of stuff.' It's become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered television viewing, 'SNL' sketches, host monologues and short comedy films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of views on YouTube. While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise. On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who's hosted 'SNL' the most times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paul-simon-and-sabrina-carpenter-open-the-saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-celebration/7977425.html	2025-02-16T18:46:39-08:00	
North Korea's Kim makes rare visit to father's tomb	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has paid his respects at a family mausoleum to mark the birthday of his late father and former leader Kim Jong Il, state media KCNA said on Monday. Kim Jong Il's birthday, which falls on Feb. 16, is widely celebrated as a major holiday in North Korea, called the Day of the Shining Star. But it was the first time in four years that the young Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of Sun in the capital Pyongyang, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather, for the anniversary. Accompanied by Kim Yo Jong, his sister and a senior ruling Workers' Party official, among other aides, Kim Jong Un paid homage 'in the humblest reverence,' KCNA said. 'He expressed his solemn will to devote himself to the sacred struggle for the eternal prosperity of the country, the security of the people and the promotion of their well-being,' it said. The Kim dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War II and has sought to strengthen their grip on power by building cults of personality around them, though Kim Jong Un has shown signs of increasingly trying to stand more on his own feet without relying on his predecessors. In another dispatch, KCNA said Kim attended a groundbreaking ceremony on Sunday for the final phase of his pet project to build 50,000 new homes in Pyongyang. The ambitious initiative was launched in 2021 as part of Kim's five-year plan to boost the economy and designed to distribute at least 10,000 new apartments in Pyongyang each year, though some analysts have questioned its feasibility amid international sanctions and economic woes. During the ceremony, Kim lauded construction workers and officials for achieving nearly 400% progress last year compared to 2020 and pledged another plan to continue expanding the city. The project would 'usher in a new era of prosperity of Pyongyang in which the ideal streets of the people to be proud of in the world are built every year,' KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-makes-rare-visit-to-father-s-tomb/7977418.html	2025-02-16T18:32:49-08:00	
Trump administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head	President Donald Trump's administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S. agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal battle involving Trump's actions to the nation's highest judicial body since he took office in January. The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal judge's Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump's removal of Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the court. The federal judge's action blocking the termination is an 'unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,' Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said in the filing. 'This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will,' Harris wrote. Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger's five-year term was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7 informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role, 'effective immediately.' Dellinger's lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' The Special Counsel's 'ability to protect the civil service and investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever,' Dellinger's lawsuit said. 'Over the preceding three weeks, an unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections have been terminated without cause.' U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his position pending a further, preliminary order. Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that the effort to fire him without identifying any cause 'plainly contravenes' the Special Counsel's job protections under federal law. 'This language expresses Congress's clear intent to ensure the independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being buffeted by the winds of political change,' Jackson wrote in the order. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the administration's appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was premature, given that Jackson's order was only temporary. The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees. The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a reason.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-turns-to-us-supreme-court-in-bid-to-fire-agency-head/7977407.html	2025-02-16T18:13:40-08:00	
Two Kenyans allegedly abducted in broad daylight, held for 32 days	Nairobi — Since June 2024 — when a series of mass protests took place in Kenya — 82 cases of alleged forced disappearances were recorded by the Kenyan National Human Rights Commission. Rights groups say some of those alleged victims have been lucky to reunite with their loved ones, but 29 are still missing. While many accuse the police of perpetrating such acts, it's yet to be confirmed who’s behind the abductions. VOA requests for comments from the National Police Service were not answered. Aslam Longton and his brother, Jamil, told VOA they were abducted near their home in the Kitengela Town neighborhood, about an hour from central Nairobi. Earlier that day in August, Aslam said, he felt uneasy and noticed unfamiliar people watching his every move. The brothers were riding together by car when things unraveled. 'At the first corner, there was a Toyota Vitz parked there and opened all the doors, so I couldn't pass there. I reversed the car and came to this place [where VOA was conducting the interview]. When I entered this place, there was a Subaru that came and blocked me here and a Toyota Axio blocked me behind there,' Aslam recalled. The brothers alleged they were approached by heavily armed men they described as appearing to be police officers and told to switch off their car. Aslam then said 'they opened the car, removed me at the steering [wheel], took me very fast in the Subaru. So, my brother started asking them, who are you? Why are you taking my brother?' Jamil Longton said he was not meant to be taken away that day, but when he pressed the officers, even suggesting to call the neighborhood police station, they refused to identify themselves. 'I kept on asking them who are you, why are you taking my brother? I must go with my brother wherever you are taking him. I told them I’ll call the OCS [Officer Commanding Station] at the Kitengela police station to ask him if he’s aware of what you are doing. ... When I attempted to call the OCS, my phone was confiscated by them. I was slapped, my phone switched off and I was also bangled [bundled] into the Subaru,' he also recalled. The brothers say they were handcuffed, blindfolded, taken to a location, and held there for 32 days. Amnesty International and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights confirm the accounts by the two men and say it’s similar to the treatment of other abductees. 'They were telling us they were denied food. They were kept in handcuffs for days. They were stripped naked and were made to lie on concrete floors for days,' KNHRC’s Ernest Cornel told VOA. Aslam said he was abducted because of to his participation in the nationwide, youth-led, GenZ protests last year against a proposed bill that would have increased taxes. The protests expanded into a call for an end to corruption and for the president to resign. The bill was eventually withdrawn. Aslam’s brother did not take part in the protests, but they said they were both repeatedly questioned about its funding source during their captivity. Rights groups accused the Kenyan police of using excessive force against protesters, in some cases abducting government critics. Police deny the allegations. The police also said they had credible evidence criminal gangs had infiltrated the protests and planned to take advantage. About 60 people died and hundreds were arrested. Since last June, 82 people have gone missing and about 29 are still not accounted for, the rights organization said. In December, following more protests in Nairobi to demand the police produce the missing people, President William Ruto condemned the spike in disappearances, saying 'any criminality must be investigated. Whether undertaken by citizens, criminals or undertaken by the police, it must be investigated, and we must get to the bottom of any criminal activity in Kenya.' Meanwhile, at a recent press conference convened by KNHRC, some of the victims, including Aslam and Jamil, said that after their release, they still are being intimidated and called for international investigations. 'They are saying that when they go to [for a] run in the morning, they can see the car following them. They can see cars parked outside of their homes with their engines running and with their lights on and when they confront the occupants of the car, they sped off,' Cornel says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-kenyans-allegedly-abducted-in-broad-daylight-held-for-32-days-/7974876.html	2025-02-16T17:12:56-08:00

China condemns sailing of Canadian warship in Taiwan Strait	Beijing — China's military on Monday condemned the sailing of a Canadian warship in the Taiwan Strait, saying its air and naval forces had monitored and warned the ship, a mission that came just a few days after U.S. Navy ships made a similar mission. The U.S. Navy, and occasionally ships from allied countries like Canada, Britain and France, transits the strait around once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, also says the strategic waterway belongs to it. Canada's actions 'deliberately stirred up trouble' and undermined peace and stability in the strait, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. 'Theater forces maintain a high level of alert at all times and resolutely counter all threats and provocations,' it added. The Canadian military declined immediate comment. Both the Chinese and Taiwanese governments identified the ship as the Ottawa. Taiwan's defense ministry said on Sunday that the ship had sailed in a northerly direction, adding that Taiwanese forces also kept watch. Taiwan's foreign ministry welcomed the sailing. 'Canada has once again taken concrete actions to defend the freedom, peace and openness of the Taiwan Strait and has demonstrated its firm position that the Taiwan Strait is international waters,' it said on Sunday. Last October, a U.S. and a Canadian warship sailed together through the strait, less than a week after China conducted a new round of war games around the island. Taiwan's democratically elected government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-condemns-sailing-of-canadian-warship-in-taiwan-strait/7977389.html	2025-02-16T16:41:00-08:00	
Argentine lawyers charge President Milei with fraud over cryptocurrency promotion	Montevideo, Uruguay — Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press. On Friday, Milei posted on X about $LIBRA, a coin that he said was aimed at 'encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.' He deleted the post a few hours later and the value of the currency collapsed, causing millions of dollars in losses to its brief investors, according to financial site Dexscreener. The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase with which Milei closes speeches and messages on his social media. The President's Office said in a Saturday statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency’s development and decided to remove the post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project’s launch. Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, told the AP that they saw an illicit association to commit 'an indeterminate number of frauds' in the episode. 'Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential,' he said. Baldiviezo signed the petition with Marcos Zelaya, another lawyer; the engineer Maria Eva Koutsovitis; and the economist Claudio Lozano, who presided over the Argentine Central Bank during former president Alberto Fernandez’s administration. Criminal justice is expected to assign a judge to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation Monday. The plaintiffs saw in Milei’s action an operation known in the crypto world as 'rug pull.' This occurs when a developer launches an attractive token to lure investors but later abandons it after funds become overpriced, making the tokens worthless. Baldiviezo also added that Milei violated the Public Ethics Law. 'The President shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol’s project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,' the President's Office said. After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the currency's development and blamed his political opponents for trying to exploit the episode. 'I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet),' he said. The President's Office said the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, would act immediately. The administration also acknowledged that Milei and members of his administration recently met with representatives of KIP Protocol at the presidential office. 'All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime,' the Milei administration said in the Saturday statement. Hayden Mark Davis, one of KIP Protocol's representatives who met with Milei, blamed the president for the crypto currency's collapse in a video posted on his social media Saturday. 'Despite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media,' Davis said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-lawyers-charge-president-milei-with-fraud-over-cryptocurrency-promotion/7977382.html	2025-02-16T16:20:18-08:00	
Scientists race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires	Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire. The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded. 'It was just heartbreaking,' said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles. As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more. Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea. 'We haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water,' Quinn said. Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply. The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears. When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit. Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, 'not like a nice campfire.' Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain 'a lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,' said Dias, as well as 'heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.' Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase. Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things. Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds. They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment. County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water. Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up. Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said. 'Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,' she added. 'This is really bad for people so it's probably also very bad for the marine organisms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-race-to-discover-depth-of-ocean-damage-from-los-angeles-wildfires/7977145.html	2025-02-16T14:55:56-08:00	
Turkish delegation meets with Kurdish leader in Iraq amid peace efforts	Baghdad — A Turkish opposition party delegation arrived in Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region Sunday against the backdrop of peace efforts between Ankara and a banned Kurdish separatist movement in Turkey. The delegation led by Sirri Sureyya Onder and Pervin Buldan, two senior officials with the pro-Kurdish People’s Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, in Turkey, met with Masoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party — the dominant Kurdish party in Iraq — in Irbil Sunday. Barzani’s office said in a statement that they discussed 'the peace process in Turkey' and that the Turkish delegation conveyed a message from Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of Turkey’s banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Barzani 'stressed the need for all parties to intensify their efforts and endeavors to enable the peace process to achieve the desired results' and reiterated 'his full readiness to provide assistance and support to the peace process in Turkey and make it a success,' the statement said. The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey and rights for the country’s Kurdish population, and to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan. Ocalan, 75, founded the PKK, in 1978, which began an armed insurrection for an autonomous Kurdish state in Turkey’s southeast in 1984, costing tens of thousands of lives. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. The central Iraqi government in Baghdad announced a ban on the group, which maintains bases in northern Iraq, last year. Captured in 1999 and convicted of treason, Ocalan has been serving a life sentence on Imrali Island in the Marmara Sea. The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has traditionally had an antagonistic relationship with the left-wing DEM party, frequently ousting its elected officials on charges of ties to the PKK and replacing them with state appointed officials. However, this icy relationship began thawing last October, when Erdogan’s coalition partner, far-right nationalist politician Devlet Bahceli suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole, if his group renounces violence and disbands. The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power for unlimited terms. The Turkish Constitution doesn't allow Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister and later as president, to run for office again unless an early election is called — something that would also require the support of the pro-Kurdish party. Even as the latest peace efforts are underway, Erdogan’s government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state appointed officials, the latest this Saturday, when the mayor of Van municipality in eastern Turkey was removed from his post and replaced with the state-appointed governor. Meanwhile, conflict is ongoing between Turkish-backed armed groups and Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria. Turkey views the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed military Kurdish alliance in Syria, as an extension of the PKK. The SDF is in negotiations with the new government in Damascus following the ouster of then Syrian President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive. While most former insurgent groups have agreed to dissolve and integrate into the new Syrian army, the SDF has refused so far. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that the government would reconsider its military presence in northeastern Syria if that country’s new leaders eliminate the presence of the PKK in the area. Also Saturday, Kurds in northeastern Syria staged a mass protest to demand Ocalan's release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-delegation-meets-with-kurdish-leader-in-iraq-amid-peace-efforts/7977143.html	2025-02-16T14:46:58-08:00	
US Presidents Day: How did it evolve from reverence to retail	Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king. And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president Monday, 293 years after he was born. The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning. Historian Alexis Coe, author of 'You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,' has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name. 'It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?' she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. 'Jefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.' Here is a look at how things have evolved: Washington's birthdays were celebrated, sometimes Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia. Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days. Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work. 'If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,' Coe said. 'Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that’s about it.' Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly. Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson. 'One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,' Coe said. The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday in 1782. After his death, a market for memorabilia is born Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year. Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven. 'Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,' said Bruggeman, whose books include 'Here, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.' Making it official with parades and festivals It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national 'parades, orations and festivals,' according to the Congressional Research Service. Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia. The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12. A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day. But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s Birthday. A shift to consumerism By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue magazine. Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue. Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers 'would have been deeply worried' by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests. 'They were very nervous about corporations,' Bruggeman said. 'It wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.' Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions. 'There’s no moment of reflection,' Coe said. Given today’s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection 'would probably be a good idea.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidents-day-how-did-it-evolve-from-reverence-to-retail/7977137.html	2025-02-16T14:32:22-08:00	
Uganda government offers to drop military trial of hunger-striking opponent	Kampala, Uganda — Uganda's government said Sunday it would drop a military trial against opposition figurehead Kizza Besigye, urging him to give up his hunger strike in jail, a minister said. The pledge was promptly rejected as 'suspicious' by Besigye's wife, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima. Besigye, a former ally turned rival of longtime President Yoweri Museveni, went on a hunger strike on February 10 in protest at his detention. Charging him with treason for allegedly threatening national security, the government has vowed to try him in a military court, despite a Supreme Court ruling that such a move against a civilian is unconstitutional. Now, however, 'the government is fast-tracking the transfer of Besigye's case from the court martial to the civil court,' Cabinet spokesperson and information minister Chris Baryomunsi told AFP. 'As a government, we are complying with the ruling of the Supreme Court.' The minister said in an earlier message on X that he had visited Besigye in prison Sunday 'in the presence of his personal doctors' and 'asked him to resume taking food' pending the transfer. The army, which has not yet commented on the announcement, had previously dismissed the Supreme Court ruling and insisted the military trial would go ahead. Besigye appeared in court for a hearing in a separate case Friday looking frail, prompting outrage from his supporters. Baryomunsi declined to say whether Sunday's pledge was prompted by the outcry. Byanyima told AFP on Sunday that she was 'very worried' about her husband's condition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-government-offers-to-drop-military-trial-of-hunger-striking-opponent/7977116.html	2025-02-16T13:19:53-08:00	
Colombian superstar Shakira cancels concert in Lima after being hospitalized	Lima, Peru — Colombian superstar Shakira canceled her Sunday concert in Lima after being hospitalized with an abdominal condition, the singer said. Shakira shared a statement on her Instagram and X accounts Sunday afternoon, saying she is currently hospitalized and that doctors informed her she was not in condition to perform. 'I am very sad that I will not be able to take the stage today. I have been deeply emotional and excited about reuniting with my beloved Peruvian audience,' she said. The singer arrived in Peru Friday evening, where she was scheduled to perform Sunday and Monday. The country is the second stop on her Latin America tour, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, following two nights in Brazil last week. Latin fans have given Shakira a warm welcome, with crowds gathering at airports to greet her. 'Thank you for such an emotional welcome, Lima!' she posted Saturday on Instagram. In her statement, Shakira said she hopes to recover soon. 'My plan is to perform this show as soon as possible. My team and the promoter are already working on a new date,' she said. The singer is touring in support of her latest album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, in which she channels her highly publicized divorce into music. The record includes the global hit 'Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53' and won Best Latin Pop Album at the 2024 Grammy Awards earlier this month. Shakira’s tour continues across Latin America before heading to Canada and the U.S. in May for a series of concerts through June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-superstar-shakira-cancels-concert-in-lima-after-being-hospitalized/7977108.html	2025-02-16T13:09:50-08:00	
Mauritius ex-PM freed on bail in money-laundering probe	Port Louis, Mauritius — A court in Mauritius on Monday released on bail the island's former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth in a money-laundering probe after seizing suitcases of cash in raids on his alleged accomplices' homes. Police detained the 63-year-old along with his wife Kobita Jugnauth on Saturday and questioned them for several hours, police sources told AFP. Kobita Jugnauth was later released and Pravind Jugnauth was placed under formal arrest in the early hours of Sunday. In court in the capital Port Louis, the ex-premier denied the accusations. The judge released him pending a bail payment of 150,000 rupees ($16,000), in a written ruling seen by AFP. Police and court documents detailed searches at the homes of two other suspects who run a local leisure company. They said officers seized documents bearing the names of the Jugnauths, as well as luxury watches and suitcases of cash. Chagos Islands talks Prime minister from 2017 to 2024, Pravind Jugnauth is a member of one of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius, a stable and relatively prosperous Indian Ocean island nation, since it became independent from Britain in 1968. He oversaw a historic deal with Britain for Mauritius to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute. He and his Militant Socialist Movement suffered a crushing defeat in tense elections in November. He ceded office to center-left rival Navin Ramgoolam, who became prime minister for the third time. Ramgoolam's government reopened the Chagos negotiations, reportedly seeking greater financial compensation and to renegotiate the length of the proposed lease for a joint U.K.-U.S. military base. Under the Chagos deal, Britain will retain a lease for the base on the island of Diego Garcia. Both Mauritius and Britain have said that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration will have a say on the final terms of the agreement. The base is currently leased by Britain to the United States and has become one of its key military facilities in the Asia-Pacific. During the election campaign, both camps promised to improve the lives of ordinary Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-ex-pm-freed-on-bail-in-money-laundering-probe/7977107.html	2025-02-16T13:03:36-08:00	
US, Ukrainian officials head to Saudi Arabia as talks loom on ending Russia's war	Kyiv, Ukraine — A Ukrainian delegation has arrived in Saudi Arabia for meetings in preparation for a possible visit by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a Ukrainian minister said Sunday, at a time of intense speculation over planned U.S.-Russia talks in the kingdom to end Moscow's war on its neighbor. It also comes as a top U.S. envoy revealed that he and a fellow negotiator appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump were heading to Saudi Arabia. Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who also serves as first deputy prime minister, didn't clarify whether there is a link between Zelenskyy's possible trip and the previously announced U.S.-Russia talks. In a Facebook post, she said that the Ukrainian delegation's focus is on strengthening economic ties, as Kyiv 'prepares to sign important economic agreements with countries in the region.' Svyrydenko didn't say anything about when Zelenskyy might go to Saudi Arabia and who he might meet with. No further details were immediately available. Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, said earlier Sunday that there was no possibility of Ukrainian and Russian representatives meeting directly in the immediate future. In a Telegram post, Yermak said the Ukrainians weren't planning to do so 'until we develop a plan' to end the war and bring about a 'just peace.' Mykhailo Podolyak, another Zelenskyy adviser, on Saturday denied that Ukraine will participate in any planned U.S.-Russia meetings in Saudi Arabia. 'There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,' Podolyak said on Ukrainian television. But Svyrydenko's remarks came within hours of an announcement by Steve Witkoff, Trump's close ally and special envoy to the Middle East, that high-level meetings were imminent in Saudi Arabia to discuss a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to Fox News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' program, Witkoff said that he and national security adviser Mike Waltz will be 'having meetings at the direction of the president,' and hope to make 'some really good progress with regard to Russia-Ukraine.' Witkoff didn't specify who they would be meeting and what they would discuss, but he said that he was leaving for Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening. Following a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Trump noted that they 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' on ending the fighting. The president appointed Witkoff and Waltz to lead those talks, alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Earlier this week, Russian officials and state media took a triumphant tone after Trump jettisoned three years of U.S. policy and announced that he would likely meet soon with Putin to negotiate a peace deal in the almost three-year war in Ukraine. Trump's announcement created a major diplomatic upheaval that could herald a watershed moment for Ukraine and Europe. Zelenskyy said that he wouldn't accept any negotiations about Ukraine that don't include his country. European governments have also demanded a seat at the table. Putin has been ostracized by the West since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. In 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader. Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy, didn't directly respond to the question about whether Ukraine would have to give up a 'significant portion' of its territory as part of any negotiated settlement. 'Those are details, and I'm not dismissive of the details, they're important. But I think the beginning here is trust-building. It's getting everybody to understand that this war does not belong continuing, that it should end. That's what the president has directed us to do,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ukrainian-officials-head-to-saudi-arabia-as-talks-loom-on-ending-russia-s-war/7977072.html	2025-02-16T11:50:07-08:00

Conclave' leads the pack, 'Emilia Perez' faces test at Britain's BAFTA film awards	London — Stars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothee Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs. The prizes are closely watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 3, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season. They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem 'I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).' The best film contenders are 'Conclave,' 'Emilia Perez,' Brady Corbet’s 215-minute architecture epic ' The Brutalist,' the James Mangold-directed Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown' and Sean Baker’s Brighton Beach tragicomedy 'Anora.' 'Anora,' about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, is emerging as a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards. 'The Brutalist' has nine BAFTA nominations, while 'Anora,' the sci-fi epic 'Dune: Part Two' and musical 'Wicked' have seven each. 'A Complete Unknown' and Irish-language hip-hop drama 'Kneecap' received six nominations apiece. Nominees in the category of outstanding British film include Andrea Arnold’s 'Bird,' Steve McQueen’s 'Blitz,' Ridley Scott’s 'Gladiator II' and animated adventure 'Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl,' which won the award for best family and children's film. The leading actor favorite is 'The Brutalist' star Adrien Brody, who faces stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in 'A Complete Unknown.' The other male actors nominated are Grant for his creepy role in the horror film ' Heretic,' Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama ' Sing Sing ' and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice.' Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was 'incredibly validating' to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong. 'We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,' Stan said, describing the movie as a 'fair' depiction of the president. Whoever takes the best actress award will be a first-time BAFTA winner. Nominees are Gascon, Demi Moore for body-horror film ' The Substance,' Mikey Madison for 'Anora,' Ronan for 'The Outrun,' Erivo for 'Wicked' and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama 'Hard Truths.' Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would be the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA. British stars on the red carpet had high praise for Jean-Baptiste's blistering performance as a woman beset by depression, and for Moore, already a Golden Globe winner for 'The Substance.' 'I’m very excited for Demi Moore tonight,' said 'Game of Thrones' and 'Severance' star Gwendoline Christie. She said Moore's 'visceral' performance 'transcends so many different boundaries.' What's new and where to watch Britain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. Most winners are chosen by members of the 8,000-strong U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a short list of nominees. This year's contenders are performers Mikey Madison, Marisa Abela, Jharrel Jerome, David Jonsson and Nabhaan Rizwan. 'Willow' and 'Return of the Jedi' actor Warwick Davis will receive the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry. BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for 'The Last Showgirl,' was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work. Co-star Pamela Anderson will accept the prize for Curtis if she wins. The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate, is attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children. The show will include a performance by grown-up boyband Take That, whose 2008 hit 'Greatest Day' features on the 'Anora' soundtrack. 'Wicked' wizard Jeff Goldblum will play piano during the ceremony’s tribute to people who have died in the past year. The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom and BritBox in North America and started at 1900 GMT (2 p.m. EST).	https://www.voanews.com/a/conclave-leads-the-pack-emilia-perez-faces-test-at-britain-s-bafta-film-awards/7977060.html	2025-02-16T11:30:01-08:00	
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend	Captain America: Brave New World' infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday. It’s Marvel's first major release since 'Deadpool & Wolverine' broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for 'The Marvels.' Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, 'Brave New World' is also a major transition for the 'Captain America' brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk. But 'Brave New World,' directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% 'rotten' on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — 'Eternals' has a 47% rating and 'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania' has a 46% — but the latest film is on the very low end of the spectrum. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, 'a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.' Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The 'verified audience score' from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience. The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: 'Dog Man' held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch. And 'Brave New World's' showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Thor: The Dark World.' It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion. After only one Marvel movie in 2024, 'Brave New World' is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by 'Thunderbolts(asterisk)' in May and 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' in July. 'The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Second place at this week's box office went to 'Paddington in Peru,' the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run. Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact. Sony and Screen Gems' slasher 'Heart Eyes' landed in third place with $10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to 'Dog Man' with $9.7 million. The Chinese blockbuster 'Ne Zha 2' rounded out the top five. It opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall, the box office is up 20% from last year. This weekend also saw the release of a new 'Bridget Jones' movie, subtitled 'Mad About the Boy,' which went straight to Universal’s streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and Ireland, it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing 'Captain America: Brave New World.' Universal Pictures International reported $32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories. The final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $88.5 million. 2. 'Paddington in Peru,' $13 million. 3. 'Heart Eyes,' $10 million. 4. 'Dog Man,' $9.7 million. 5. 'Ne Zha 2,' $7.2 million. 6. 'Love Hurts,' $4.4 million. 7. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $4.2 million. 8. 'One of Them Days,' $3 million. 9. 'Companion,' $1.9 million. 10. 'Becoming Led Zeppelin,' $1.8 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/captain-america-brave-new-world-soars-toward-100-million-holiday-weekend/7977044.html	2025-02-16T10:49:32-08:00	
Lebanon says woman killed as Israeli forces fire on returnees to southern Lebanon ahead of ceasefire deadline	BEIRUT — A woman was killed and several other people wounded Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on a group of residents attempting to return to the village of Houla in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese state-run news agency reported. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the incident, which comes two days before the deadline for implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in late November. It includes a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. The original deadline was in late January but Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. Hours before they agreed to the extension on Jan. 27, hundreds of protesters attempted to enter villages still occupied by the Israeli army to demand its withdrawal, and Israeli forces opened fire in several locations, killing more than 20 people. Israel blamed Hezbollah for sending 'rioters.' It remained unclear whether Israel will fully withdraw from Lebanese territory on Tuesday. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a televised speech Sunday that Israel 'must withdraw from all of the Lebanese territory that it has occupied' on Feb. 18. 'There can be no excuses, no five points or other details under any pretext or any title. This is the agreement,' he said. Kassem was referring to a proposal put forward by Israel that its forces would remain in five border points after the deadline. Lebanese officials have so far rejected this. Kassem said it was 'the primary and exclusive responsibility of the Lebanese state at this stage to apply all political pressure' to ensure that Israel withdraws fully. Internal tensions have risen in Lebanon in recent days ahead of the deadline and after Lebanese authorities revoked permission for an Iranian plane that had been set to travel from Tehran to Beirut, leaving dozens of Lebanese passengers stranded. The decision came after Israel had alleged that Iran was sending cash to Hezbollah via civilian flights and said it would 'use all available means' to stop it. The outgoing deputy commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was injured Friday when protesters attacked a convoy taking peacekeepers to the Beirut airport. Kassem said Hezbollah was 'against the attack on UNIFIL' but also criticized the Lebanese army for tear gassing protesters who gathered 'peacefully' on Saturday. Kassem criticized the Lebanese government for banning Iranian flights, a decision that he said came after Israel threatened to strike the runway if the Iranian plane landed at Beirut airport. 'The problem is not that [Lebanese authorities] are ensuring the safety of civilians at a difficult time,' Kassem said. 'The problem is that this is the implementation of Israel's command. We are facing a real problem. Where is the national sovereignty? Are we employees of Israel, implementing the demands of the occupation?' Also on Sunday, Lebanon's National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike hit a bulldozer that was attempting to open roads that had been blocked by the Israeli military near the village of Marwahin. No casualties were reported. The Israeli army said in a statement that it had conducted 'precision, intelligence-based strikes on a number of military sites in Lebanese territory containing rocket launchers and weapons, where Hezbollah activity had been identified.' The Lebanese army, which has taken control of areas that the Israeli forces have withdrawn from, in a statement warned citizens not to try to enter areas where Lebanese troops have not yet deployed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-says-woman-killed-as-israeli-forces-fire-on-returnees-to-southern-lebanon-ahead-of-ceasefire-deadline/7977040.html	2025-02-16T10:48:31-08:00	
US ‘border czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests	U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'border czar' said Sunday he is 'not happy' with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by immigration agents and deported to their home countries. Tom Homan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show that 14,000 migrants had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said, 'We’ve got to do a lot more.' Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, while some have been released to live in the United States pending court proceedings. The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency to find and deport 'millions' of them. Officials say that the first arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation could be targeted. Homan said the number being deported is 'a lot higher' than under the former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, 'We’ve got to get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.' The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration issues. In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a day.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-border-czar-unhappy-with-pace-of-migrant-arrests/7977021.html	2025-02-16T10:16:46-08:00	
UK's Starmer to press Egypt for release of hunger-striking mum’s son	London — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told a mother who has been on hunger strike for 140 days that he will press the Egyptian government to release her son. In a statement Sunday, Starmer confirmed that he met Laila Soueif and said he will do 'all that I can' to secure the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a British-Egyptian dual national who has spent more than five years in an Egyptian prison, accused of 'spreading false news' on social media. 'We will continue to raise his case at the highest levels of the Egyptian government and press for his release,' Starmer said. A representative of the family said the meeting took place Friday morning inside the prime minister's offices at 10 Downing Street and that it was the first time the pair had met. Soueif, 68, has been on a hunger strike since Sep. 29, the day her son was supposed to be released, consuming nothing but herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts. After more than four months, Soueif has lost around 25 kilograms (55 pounds). She took her campaign directly to the Foreign Office in December, camping out in front of it every weekday to make sure officials notice her. When that yielded no results, she switched in mid-January to the gates of Starmer’s office — the famous black door of 10 Downing Street. 'The great majority of mothers are prepared to die for their children; it just takes different forms,' she said earlier this month. 'Most mothers, if their children are in actual danger, you’re prepared to die.’’ One of Egypt’s most prominent pro-democracy activists, the 43-year-old Abd el-Fattah has spent most of the past 14 years behind bars since taking part in the 2011 uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. His most recent crime was 'liking' a Facebook post describing torture in Egyptian prisons. Abd el-Fattah has been in custody since September 2019 and was sentenced to five years in prison after a trial before an emergency security court. But when his release date came up last September, Egyptian authorities refused to count the more than two years he had spent in pre-trial detention and ordered him held until Jan. 3, 2027. Thousands of critics of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi have been locked up under dire conditions after unjust trials, human rights groups say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-to-press-egypt-for-release-of-hunger-striking-mum-s-son/7977019.html	2025-02-16T10:13:19-08:00	
Pope is stable as he recovers from respiratory infection, Vatican says	Rome — Pope Francis had breakfast, read the newspapers and followed Mass on television Sunday after a second night sleeping well at the hospital where the 88-year-old pontiff is being treated for a respiratory tract infection, the Vatican said. Francis' condition was stable, as he continues his unspecified drug therapy, alternating in the afternoon between reading and resting, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. The Argentine pope, a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his many ailments, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health. Doctors confirmed that the pope had a respiratory tract infection and prescribed 'absolute rest' alongside unspecified drug therapies. Francis skipped his traditional Sunday noon blessing, declining to even come to his hospital window to wave to a small crowd below that had gathered in hopes of cheering him on. The @Pontifex social media account, which isn't written by the pope himself, thanked people for their prayers on Sunday. 'Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you are accompanying me in these days,' the post read. Francis had part of one lung removed after a lung infection when he was a young man and is prone to respiratory infections. In 2023, he spent three days at Gemelli to be treated for what he later revealed was an acute case of pneumonia. Despite his Feb. 6 bronchitis diagnosis, Francis had kept up a frenetic pace of late, packing his days with private and public audiences, while taking on the added obligations of steering the Catholic Church through its Holy Year. The Vatican has canceled his events through Monday at least. On Sunday, a Holy Year Mass he was supposed to preside over for visiting artists was instead celebrated by the Vatican culture minister. The Vatican hasn't specified what type of respiratory tract infection the pope has. Sometimes bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs' air sacs. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids — and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-is-stable-as-he-recovers-from-respiratory-infection-vatican-says-/7977015.html	2025-02-16T10:03:37-08:00	
VOA immigration weekly recap, Feb. 9-15	Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com. Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports. US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports. With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in Mexico When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. The Associated Press reports. US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the administration of President Donald Trump takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 'Yesterday, a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,' President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly news briefing. He said migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries were on board. The Associated Press reports. Chicago nonprofit helps undocumented migrants afraid to leave home Amid nationwide immigration raids, a community organization in Chicago is helping undocumented migrants who say they are afraid to leave their homes for fear of being detained. Veronica Villafane narrates this report by Enrique Garcia Fuentes. Arrests for illegal border crossings fall in Texas An idled Border Patrol bus sat empty this past week, on standby for any migrants surrendering near the southern tip of Texas. Agents in two speedboats zipped by pockets of sandy shores, known landing spots for people entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico on inner tubes, but saw nothing suspicious. Once-busy river landings near the Texas border city of Mission were barren of the migrants who previously crossed there, although the riverbank was littered with clothes, plastic bracelets issued by smugglers and a teddy bear on an unusually cold Thursday morning. The Associated Press reports. New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations. The Associated Press reports. VOA60 Africa - Nigeria: Thousands of refugees return from Chad Thousands of Nigerians who fled to Chad to escape jihadi violence in Nigeria’s northeast have returned after more than a decade.

US: Hamas ‘must be eradicated’	The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated. Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop. While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a 'common strategy' for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants. Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza. Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario. Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Hamas described the attack as a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7976953.html	2025-02-16T08:44:10-08:00	
Flooding in US Southeast leaves 2 dead while snow, ice and wind cause winter misery elsewhere	LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Much of the United States faced another round of biting winter weather on Sunday, with torrential rains causing intense flooding in Kentucky and resulting in at least two deaths. The northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. In Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, WKYT-TV reported. Clay County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry confirmed the fatality but did not provide additional details. Severe storms also swept through parts of Florida and Georgia, where tornado watches were in effect early Sunday, the National Weather Service said. Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains with low temperatures into the minus 30s F near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit) to minus 45.6 C (minus 50 F) are expected. Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph (60 mph) and create 'hazardous whiteout conditions,' the NWS said. Kentucky faces severe flooding The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife said there was an investigation into a death and a rescue operation was under way in Hart County, WNKY-TV reported. The station reported a youth died and a second victim was missing in flooding Saturday evening. The Fish and Wildlife department and the Hart County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from The Associated Press. Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. Flash flooding hit some roads in Bowling Green and parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) of rain. 'We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,' Beshear said on social media. Beshear later used social media to update residents on areas in danger of flooding, including Jackson County, and said Kentucky State Police officers were performing wellness checks while shelters were opening in Pike County and Jenny Wiley State Resort Park in Prestonsburg. Beshear said in a post late Saturday that he had written to the White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for impacted areas. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters (14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said. Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. New England faces snow, then sleet Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations, possibly 30.5 centimeters (a foot) or more, were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England. 'Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,' the weather service warned. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees C (14 degrees F) over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. California struggles with mudslides Dry weather returned to southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-in-us-southeast-leaves-2-dead-while-snow-ice-and-wind-cause-winter-misery-elsewhere/7976927.html	2025-02-16T07:55:08-08:00	
Russian troops intensify attacks on Ukrainian forces in east, military says	KYIV — Russian troops have sharply stepped up their attacks in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv's military said on Sunday, as a NATO official predicted Moscow would increase the pace and intensity of its assaults with talks to end the war approaching. The main attacks were concentrated near the imperiled logistics hub of Pokrovsk, Kyiv said, with U.S. and Russian officials expected to hold talks in the coming days in Saudi Arabia and U.S President Donald Trump pushing for peace. Kyiv's military reported 261 combat engagements with Russia over a 24-hour period on Saturday, easily the largest number recorded this year and more than double the roughly 100 per day it reported in previous days. 'Today was the hardest day of 2025 at the front,' the Ukrainian DeepState military blog wrote late on Saturday. Moscow's troops advanced steadily in the east for much of the second half 2024, announcing the capture of village after village, though the intensity of the fighting dropped in January this year, according to Ukrainian military data. Russian forces have seized a swathe of territory to the south of Pokrovsk and are now pushing upwards to its southwest, threatening a main supply route into the outpost, the capture of which could open up more lines of attack for Russia. Despite being on the backfoot, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported a 'good result' in the east on Thursday and a military spokesman said Kyiv's forces had recaptured the village of Pishchane, about 5 km to Pokrovsk's south. 'It isn't so much the result of something collapsing for the Russians or some kind of magical weapon being delivered to Ukraine, no. Certain organizational actions were taken to help Ukrainians act more effectively,' Viktor Trehubov, a military spokesman, told Reuters. Ukraine has been using drones for deep strikes on Russia in an effort to inflict pain and strengthen its overall position. Russia has continued to conduct regular drone and missile strikes, while making advances on the ground in the east. 'I would expect a much stronger push. I would expect that we would see ... a lot of Russian efforts to advance,' a NATO official who requested anonymity told Reuters. Though Ukrainian officials are careful to praise Trump, his push to engage directly with the Russians without first consulting with Kyiv and to leave out the Europeans entirely is a cause for alarm in Ukraine and Europe. Kyiv has said it was not invited to take part in the talks in Saudi Arabia and that in any case it wants to devise a joint strategy with its U.S. and European allies before meeting Russian officials. France said on Sunday it would host a summit of European leaders on Monday to discuss the Ukraine war and European security as the continent scrambles to respond concretely to Trump's unilateral approach to the conflict. Zelenskiy gave figures for Russian strikes with aerial bombs and missiles that appeared to suggest they had increased in size in the last week. He said Russia had fired about 1,220 aerial bombs, more than 850 drones and 40 missiles at Ukraine, compared with 1,206, bombs, 750 drones and 10 missiles the week before.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-intensify-attacks-on-ukrainian-forces-in-east-military-says-/7976838.html	2025-02-16T06:05:33-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels reach center of east Congo's 2nd major city	BUKAVU, CONGO — Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo's second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday morning and took control of the South Kivu province administrative office after little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled the rebels' advance. Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region's major city of Goma 101 kilometers away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors. The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N. It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels' reach in their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power. Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels' advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic. Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was 'briefly' invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday. Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo's forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa. Burundi's president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that 'those people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.' The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to 'defending the people of Bukavu' in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. 'We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,' Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance's spokesperson, said in a statement. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-reach-center-of-east-congo-s-2nd-major-city/7976749.html	2025-02-16T02:50:22-08:00	
Austrian city in shock after a deadly knife attack as migration comes in spotlight	VIENNA — The city of Villach in southern Austria is in shock after a man stabbed six passersby in broad daylight, killing a 14-year-old boy and wounding five others, as police tried to establish a motive that put migration in the spotlight. Residents began placing candles at the site of the attack in the city of about 60,000 inhabitants. A group of young people, who knew the boy who died in Saturday's attack, gathered at the crime scene on Sunday morning to mourn and tearfully light candles, local media reported. The 23-year-old suspect, who was detained shortly after the stabbing, is a Syrian with a residence permit in Austria. A 42-year-old man, also a Syrian working for a food delivery company, witnessed the attack from his car. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent the situation from escalating, police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio told Austria's public broadcaster ORF. Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen called the attack 'horrific.' 'No words can undo the suffering, the horror, the fear. My thoughts are with the family of the deceased victim and the injured,' he posted on X. The Free Syrian Community of Austria issued a statement on Facebook distancing itself from the attack and expressing its deepest condolences to the victims' families. 'We all had to flee Syria, our home country, because we were no longer safe there — no one left their country voluntarily. We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,' the association said. 'Finally, we would like to emphasize: Anyone who causes strife and disturbs the peace of society does not represent the Syrians who have sought and received protection here,' the statement concluded. Dionisio said that a motive for the attack was not immediately known and police were investigating the suspect's background. Carnival procession canceled as police gather evidence Villach, a popular tourist destination near the borders of Italy and Slovenia, is known for its laid-back atmosphere, which blends Mediterranean and Alpine traditions. The city hosts annual carnival processions in March and an event on Saturday was canceled in the wake of the attack. The Austrian Ministry of Interior activated a platform for witnesses to upload videos or photos related to the attack. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner is expected in Villach on Sunday for a press conference. Local authorities said a crisis response team will be available to support pupils when schools open on Monday. The victims were all men, with two seriously wounded and two sustaining minor injuries, police said. Later Saturday, police said a fifth person was also injured. Peter Kaiser, the governor of the province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old. 'This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values,' he said. Calls to strengthen migration rules Far-right leader Herbert Kickl wrote on X that he is 'appalled by the horrific act in Villach' and called for a rigorous crackdown on asylum. 'At the same time, I am angry — angry at those politicians who have allowed stabbings, rapes, gang wars and other capital crimes to become the order of the day in Austria. This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,' Kickl said. 'From Austria to the EU — the wrong rules are in force everywhere. Nobody is allowed to challenge them, everything is declared sacrosanct,' he said, adding that his party had outlined what he viewed as necessary changes to immigration laws in its election platform. Conservative party leader Christian Stocker said on X that the attacker 'must be brought to justice and be punished with the full force of the law.' 'We all want to live in a safe Austria, adding that this means political measures need to be taken to avoid such acts of horror in the future,' he said. The leader of the Social Democrats, Andreas Babler, said, 'Crimes like this one simply should not happen in our society.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-city-in-shock-after-a-deadly-knife-attack-as-migration-comes-in-spotlight/7976746.html	2025-02-16T02:40:56-08:00	
White South Africans gather in support of Trump and his claims that they are victims of racism	PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own government. Hundreds of protesters held placards that read 'Thank God for President Trump' and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority. Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa's Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land. The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump's claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions. Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the order referred to as 'racially disfavored landowners' — when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South Africa's white minority. In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. 'The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,' Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good. The Trump administration's criticism and punishment of South Africa has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed the Black majority. According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country's population. White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people. Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa — has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s affirmative action criteria. While race has long framed South African politics, the country has been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are working together.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-south-africans-gather-in-support-of-trump-and-his-claims-that-they-are-victims-of-racism/7976735.html	2025-02-16T01:27:56-08:00	
Iran's early recordings revive forgotten sound heritage	TEHRAN, IRAN — In a century-old building in Tehran, Saeed Anvarinejad turned the dial of a vintage radio to tune into some of Iran's earliest recorded sounds, some serving as reminders of the seismic changes that shaped the country's history. Along with a team of fellow enthusiasts, he spent months tracking down the earliest recordings of Iranian music, speeches, interviews, theatrical plays, radio broadcasts and even the hum of daily life from more than a century ago up to the present day. 'Sound is a phenomenon we pay little attention to ... although it's very important,' said Anvarinejad, one of the organizers of the 'SoundScape' exhibition. And 'the era of early sound recording in Iran is a very important time in the socio-political history of the country.' He highlighted the emotional power of early voice recordings, saying they captured 'in a very raw and pure way ... the feeling that people have at that moment,' unlike written records. According to Anvarinejad, the oldest surviving sound recordings from Iran date back to 1898 and 1899, during the reign of Mozaffar al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty, which reigned over the country from the late 18th to the early 20th century. His rule saw the unfolding of the Constitutional Revolution, a pivotal moment in Iran's political transformation that established a parliament and constitutional monarchy. 'It was a time when ... a new order was taking shape in the Iranian mind and very important things were happening politically, socially and culturally,' he added. 'We thought it would be good to have a new approach to the sound (from that time) and engage audiences with it.' Upon tuning the wooden-framed antique radio, a chilling broadcast announced the overthrow of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, who had pushed for the nationalization of Iran's oil industry sparking a coup d'etat orchestrated by the United States and Britain. 'This is Tehran! Good news! Good news! People of the cities of Iran, be awake and alert, the traitor Mosaddegh has fled!' crackled the voice of a radio anchor. 'Mysterious void' Other audio included Iran's first recorded call to prayer in either 1912 or 1913, and the 1959 report on the death of Qamar, the first woman singer to perform in public in the country. One striking installation at the exhibition involved a mechanical device mounted on a concrete wall with gears, chains, wheels and a lever which played old recordings of the stringed tar instrument through retro telephone handsets. Another, Mowj Negar, featured printed sound waves arranged in three rows on one wall, with a metal device which moved along the waves. When moved, the device activates melodies from the Qajar and early Pahlavi (1925-79) eras that once echoed through Iran's grand palaces and bustling city streets. Nearby stood a wooden cabinet named 'The Silent Closet,' displaying a series of photos from the World War I -— but without a single accompanying sound. 'There are no sound recordings from Iran during this period, not because technology was unavailable, but likely because the country was in such turmoil that recording sound was not a priority,' said Atabak Axon, another exhibition organizer. 'There was a 12-year silence that remains a mysterious void in Iran's auditory history.' For centuries, sound has played a central role in Persian culture, connecting belief with poetry and identity. For 21-year-old Sarvin Faizian, visiting the exhibition with friends was a deeply moving experience 'as if I was experiencing my parents' past.' Similarly, Fatemeh Sadeghi described feeling overwhelmed by nostalgia, while 63-year-old Kamran Asadi found the exhibition unexpectedly personal. 'It is a very good and intimate atmosphere for me,' he said, lingering on an old song playing in the background. 'It is good for the younger generation to learn where Iran's heritage of music and art came from.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-early-recordings-revive-forgotten-sound-heritage/7975972.html	2025-02-15T23:26:52-08:00	
Breakfast is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg prices?	It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem. Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year. Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy's reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs. Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019. In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds — including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen. The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment. But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024. Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs. Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said. The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank. U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows. 'Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you're making something with eggs, you know it's fresh,' Earnest said. Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is available, they were down to 249 eggs per person. Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal rights concerns, McDonald's and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments. 'It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,' Earnest said. The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door. Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association. First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them. First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said. Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it. 'Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,' Richardson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices-/7975967.html	2025-02-15T23:26:12-08:00	
US man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip	A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides. Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations. The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says. 'We're doing this because this should never have happened,' said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. 'There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating.' Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews. The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter. The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides. 'It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful,' Gould said. 'I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.' He added, 'My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components.' Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses signed for the trip. In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety measures were implemented before the attack and 'repeated warnings' were issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle 'during the incident.' Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that 'the statement is an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.' Gould declined to comment. The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after the attack and joined Chiawa's owner in ensuring that 'everything possible was being done to support the family and all those involved. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone else involved in this tragic incident.' The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are 'inherently dangerous activities' because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe. The suit alleges that African Portfolio 'encouraged and/or permitted' the Manderses to be exposed to an 'avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.' It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience. African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges. Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 3,200 kilograms. Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500. Lisa Manders suffered 'significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish' before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says. The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness. 'He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life,' Slager said. 'And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-man-sues-travel-company-after-hippo-kills-wife-on-zambia-trip-/7974670.html	2025-02-15T23:25:22-08:00	
With metal detectors, treasure hunters unearth pieces of British history	LONDON — When Malcolm Weale saw the tiny, dirt-covered object he'd unearthed in an English field, he knew it was something special. In his hand was a silver penny minted during the reign of Guthrum, a Viking commander who converted to Christianity and ruled eastern England in the ninth century as Athelstan II. For Weale, finding the first silver coin minted by a Viking ruler in Britain was the pinnacle of decades of hunting with his metal detector in the fields and forests near his home in eastern England. 'I was shaking,' Weale said at the British Museum, where the coin was displayed Tuesday alongside other items unearthed by amateur history hunters in 2023 and 2024. 'I knew that it was a life-changing, incredible, historical find. 'I'd watched the series 'Vikings' on Netflix, and about a week later I've got the Guthrum penny in my hand,' he said. The thrill of finding fragments of history beneath our feet drives detectorists like 54-year-old Weale, who was introduced to the pastime at the age of 7 and 'was hooked.' His find was on show as the museum released its annual report on the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a government-funded project that records thousands of archaeological discoveries made by the public each year. The coin sat alongside a set of 3,000-year-old bronze metalworkers' tools, a seventh-century gold and garnet necklace, and a gold signet ring with an intriguing link to Queen Elizabeth I. They have been officially classed as 'treasure' by a coroner, meaning they will be independently valued and offered to local museums. Discoveries by detectorists, as well as beachcombers and mudlarkers — who search for items on riverbanks — shine new light into corners of British history. The necklace of glittering gold and garnet pendants found in Lincolnshire, central England, reveals the sophistication of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship, and is surprisingly global. Archaeologist Helen Geake, who serves as a 'finds liaison officer' for the antiquities program, said that it was likely made in England — 'English craftsmen were by far the best in Europe' — with garnets from Sri Lanka. Andy Akroyd, 49, also struck gold when he was out metal detecting near his home in Bedfordshire, central England. 'When I first saw it, I thought 'Oh it's a coin.' Then I saw it's a ring, I was thinking 1980s, cheap sovereign ring,' Akroyd said. It turned out to be a 16th-century signet ring engraved with a phoenix, a mythical bird symbolizing rebirth that was associated with Elizabeth I. Found in an area used as a royal hunting ground in Elizabethan times, it was likely worn, and lost, by one of the queen's supporters. 'When you find it, your journey is just beginning,' Akroyd said. Then come the questions: 'What is this, how is it here?' When items are declared treasure, their value is split between the finder and the owner of the land where it was found. Detectorists occasionally strike it rich — last year, a hoard of 1,000-year-old coins found in southwest England sold for 4.3 million pounds ($5.3 million). But the vast majority are in it for the thrill of discovery, not the money, Weale said. 'You could be a multi-multi-millionaire, but you could never buy that feeling that you feel when you find something,' he said. Both he and Akroyd say that they will soon be back out tramping the fields, in the mud and — this is England, after all — the rain. 'You always find the best stuff when the weather's terrible,' Weale said. Both men extol the mental health benefits of the methodical, slow-paced hobby, popularized to a wider audience by the gentle BBC sitcom 'Detectorists.' 'All I'm thinking about when I'm out metal detectoring is history,' Weale said. 'Kings, queens — I'm totally in the zone. I'm not worried about bills, or even keeping warm. Sometimes I forget to eat.' Akroyd said that some days he just sits, watching hares leap and birds of prey soar in the sky. 'I lost my dad last year. I'll have a chat to my dad when I'm out in the field. 'Come on, Dad — what way now?'' Akroyd said. 'He never finds me anything.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-metal-detectors-treasure-hunters-unearth-pieces-of-british-history-/7974646.html	2025-02-15T23:24:36-08:00	
Photos lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care	LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. 'This storm has taken so much,' she said, 'and it's so jarring to see the photos of the horrible devastation.' So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something about the wide-scale loss. While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and school portraits. 'These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what they were,' said Schenker, 27. 'It stuck with me.' To reclaim the search phrase 'photos from Helene,' she created an Instagram for 'something positive, which is reuniting people with their memories.' She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos — or what she calls 'little needles in a haystack.' When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. Then, sitting in her car, she cried. Photos found amid muck We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away abruptly. Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had lived for almost 40 years. 'It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those pictures. I just couldn't even speak,' Moss said. 'You don't expect something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.' Months later, they've received some FEMA assistance and found a temporary home, which they're gradually furnishing with church donations. But some things are irreplaceable. 'This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff in there. But what's been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy,' she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. 'It's those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can't replace.' As Schenker later understood it, 'When they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed.' 'It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people's lives,' she said. 'They've literally lost everything and they can't ever recreate those childhood photos.' In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he's playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas. 'It is just breathtaking,' Moss said. 'This is one thing that the river didn't get to take — or didn't get to keep.' Smoke, water, ash, soot More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners. After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. 'Someone has to do this ASAP,' she remembers thinking to herself. 'And I realized it had to be me — because nobody else was doing it.' Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, 'driving particles deeper into the material.' Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate. In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children's art in nearby parks, neighbors' front yards and a golf course. 'The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos everywhere you look,' she said. 'It's just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit.' Finding the photographed people Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz. She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. 'It's funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,' Schwartz said. 'She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her photos.' Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is otherworldly and changed. 'It looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn't look like home.' Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. 'The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,' said Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. 'We were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one.' Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. 'When you're picking up people's heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic — even if they're not yours,' he said. When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. 'Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,' Moss said. 'You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn't lose the most important thing. That's lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-photos-lost-in-american-disasters-find-their-way-home-with-a-little-help-from-people-who-care-/7974676.html	2025-02-15T23:23:55-08:00	
Navalny supporters risk reprisals with memorial events a year after death	MOSCOW — A year after Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny died behind bars, his supporters were set to hold memorial events on Sunday, with some risking reprisals by visiting his grave in Moscow. Remembrance events will take place as Russia's opposition movement -- driven into exile by unprecedented repression -- has been plagued by infighting and badly weakened since the loss of its figurehead. Exiled in various countries, its leading members have tried to revive the fight against Vladimir Putin's long reign, including in Russia where criticism of authorities is severely punished. Navalny -- Putin's main opponent -- was declared an 'extremist' by Russian authorities, a ruling that remains in force despite his death in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024. In Russia, anybody who mentions Navalny or his Anti-Corruption Foundation without stating that they have been declared 'extremist' is subject to fines, or up to four years in prison for repeated offenses. Navalny's former top aide Leonid Volkov wrote on Telegram that 'Alexei's supporters will hold memorial events all around the world.' 'In some places there will be rallies or marches, in others showings of the documentary Navalny, in others, memorial services,' he added. Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, is set to share memories of her husband at an event in Berlin, where many Russian opposition supporters have settled. 'Wherever you are, in Russia or abroad, we hope very much that you will meet like-minded people on February 16,' Volkov wrote, giving opening hours of Moscow's Borisovskoye cemetery where Navalny is buried. But Russian pro-Kremlin Telegram channels warned supporters against going to the cemetery. 'Big Brother' warning 'We give brief advice to those who plan to go there but are not yet sure -- don't go!' said a post shared by pro-Kremlin journalist Dmitry Smirnov and other channels. The message warns of 'Big Brother and his ever-watchful eye,' with a photo of a security camera sign at the cemetery gates. Russia has not fully explained Navalny's death, which came less than a month before a presidential election that extended Putin's more than two-decade rule, saying that it had happened as he was walking in the prison yard. Until his death, the 47-year-old continued to call for Russians to oppose the Kremlin and denounced Moscow's Ukraine offensive, even from behind bars. 'I took the decision not to be afraid,' he wrote in his autobiography, published after his death in several languages. Russia has branded Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the regional offices Navalny set up as 'extremist organizations.' Participation in an extremist group is punishable by up to six years in prison and many who campaigned in support of Navalny have been jailed or fled the country. Supporters also risk fines or stints in police cells for publicly displaying 'symbols' of an extremist organization, which has been applied to photos of Navalny or just his name. Four independent journalists are currently on trial for 'participating in an extremist group,' accused of preparing photos and video materials for Navalny's social media channels. Last month, Russia sentenced to several years in prison three lawyers who defended Navalny on an extremism charge for passing on his messages from prison, prompting international condemnation. Call for death probe Yulia Navalnaya has blamed the Kremlin for her husband's death -- which Moscow has denied. Amnesty International has called for an 'investigation conducted by independent and impartial international experts' into his death. Navalny was arrested in 2021 after returning to Russia following medical treatment in Germany for poisoning with Novichok nerve agent. In December 2023 he was transferred to a remote penal colony above the Arctic Circle. After Navalny's death, it emerged that talks on his inclusion in a prisoner exchange had been underway. Putin said in March 2024 that 'a few days' before Navalny's death, he was told of an 'idea to exchange' the prisoner. A White House official later confirmed such talks. Navalny made his name with rousing speeches at huge opposition rallies in Moscow in 2011-13. While Russia's opposition has never had an overall leader, he became its most prominent figure. Navalny faced an avalanche of legal action and received multiple sentences after establishing a network of regional offices and the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which made widely watched video exposes about officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/navalny-supporters-risk-reprisals-with-memorial-events-a-year-after-death/7976720.html	2025-02-15T23:22:17-08:00	
Fistfights, anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash	MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday. An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of the North American rivals -- which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries -- erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre. The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd. With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing U.S. borders. Then came three fights in nine seconds. 'I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players,' U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. 'There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries. 'For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred -- I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game.' Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not prearranged. 'It wasn't planned,' Cooper said. 'That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' -- none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets.' At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice. Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box. The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight. 'Jacked up' Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move. 'These guys care very much about winning,' he said. 'Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways. 'It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.' Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. 'It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half,' Cooper said. The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period. But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fistfights-anthem-boos-in-stormy-us-canada-ice-hockey-clash/7976716.html	2025-02-15T22:34:09-08:00	
18 dead in India stampede to catch trains to Hindu mega-festival	NEW DELHI — At least 18 people died during a stampede at a railway station in India's capital late Saturday when surging crowds scrambled to catch trains to the world's largest religious gathering, officials and reports said. The Kumbh Mela attracts tens of millions of Hindu faithful every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj and has a history of crowd-related disasters -- including one last month, when at least 30 people died in another stampede at the holy confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The rush at the train station in New Delhi appeared to break out Saturday as crowds struggled to board trains for the ongoing event, which will end Feb. 26. 'I can confirm 15 deaths at the hospital. They don't have any open injury. Most [likely died from] hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,' Dr. Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi told AFP. 'There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopedic injuries,' she said. Broadcaster NDTV reported three more dead from the stampede quoting an official of another hospital in the city. Those dead were mostly women and children. 'I have been working as a coolie since 1981, but I never saw a crowd like this before,' the Times of India newspaper quoted a porter at the railway station as saying. 'People started colliding and fell on the escalator and stairs' when platform for a special train departing for Prayagraj was suddenly shifted, the porter said. Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said a 'high-level inquiry' had been ordered into the causes of the accident. Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was 'distressed' by the stampede. 'My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery,' he wrote on X. The governor of the capital territory Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and 'all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.' The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month. More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-stampede-to-catch-trains-to-hindu-mega-festival/7976713.html	2025-02-15T21:39:44-08:00	
US, South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North Korea	MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their 'resolute' pledge to seek the 'complete denuclearization' of North Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released Saturday. The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. 'The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),' it said. 'They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address together the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military cooperation with Russia,' it added. The three sent a 'strong warning' that they 'will not tolerate any provocations or threats to their homelands,' and vowed to maintain and strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang. They also said they were committed to 'the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war as well as the issue of separated families.' Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for years. President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a 'smart guy.' Despite Trump's diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January that its nuclear program would continue 'indefinitely.' Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any 'provocation' by the United States after Rubio called it a 'rogue state' in a radio interview. It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval base in South Korea this month as a 'hostile military act.' A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-south-korea-japan-reaffirm-pledge-to-seek-denuclearization-of-north-korea/7976702.html	2025-02-15T19:18:02-08:00	
US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly. The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials, including Mary Cheng, the agency's acting director. Sirce Owen, the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden administration. Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fires-20-immigration-judges-from-backlogged-courts-/7976698.html	2025-02-15T18:31:22-08:00	
US East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest	LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley. The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters of rain. Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. 'We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,' Beshear said on social media. Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan County, Virginia, where the sheriff's office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening. The National Weather Service called the expected rain a 'major, potentially historic, flash flood event.' Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England. 'Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,' the weather service warned. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just north of Denver. The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota. People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to shelter livestock and other animals. California struggles with mudslides Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-east-faces-flooding-as-snow-forecast-for-northeast-cold-in-midwest-/7976695.html	2025-02-15T18:01:40-08:00	
Mali gold mine accident kills at least 48, officials say	BAMAKO, MALI — At least 48 people were killed in the collapse of an illegally operated gold mine in western Mali on Saturday, authorities and local sources told Agence France-Presse. Mali is one of Africa's leading gold producers, and mining sites are regularly the scene of deadly landslides and accidents. Authorities have struggled to control unregulated mining of the precious metal in the country, which is among the world's poorest. 'The death toll is 48 following the landslide,' a local police source said. The victims are mainly young women, including one who was carrying her child on her back. Boubacar Keita, from the Kenieba gold prospectors' association, also counts at least 48 deaths. 'It is an illegal site. There is a lot of complicity in the exploitation of this type of site in the region,' the head of a local environmental organization told AFP, adding that the search for victims was ongoing. Saturday's accident took place at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, sources told AFP. In January, a landslide at a gold mine in southern Mali killed at least 10 people and left many others missing, most of them women. Just over a year ago, a tunnel collapsed at a gold mining site in the same region as Saturday's landslide, killing more than 70 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-gold-mine-accident-kills-at-least-48-officials-say-/7976692.html	2025-02-15T17:51:56-08:00	
Chad officials seal schools as measles epidemic hits poor district	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad health officials have sealed several dozen schools, sent thousands of children and their teachers home, and restricted movements to and from the Bologo district — 400 kilometers south of the capital, N'djamena — to contain a measles epidemic. Officials blame vaccine hesitancy for the rapid measles spread within the past two weeks. State TV reports that thousands of children in Chad's Bologo district have been ordered to stay home for a week as their schools remain closed to prevent measles from spreading. Many churches and mosques in the district are closed too. About 50 cases of measles were confirmed within the past two weeks, said Oumar Mahamat Traore, chief health official in Bologo, appointed by Chad's central government in N'djamena. He said the situation is very concerning because all seven of the hospitals in Bologo district have at least five children receiving treatment for measles. He said parents should make sure all children having high fever, runny nose, red and watery eyes and rashes on their faces and bodies accompanied by small white spots inside the mouth are immediately rushed to the nearest hospital, where they will receive free treatment. Traore spoke to VOA on Saturday by telephone. He said it is difficult to know the number of children affected by the measles epidemic because more than 80% of civilians in Bologo prefer African traditional medicine and go to conventional hospitals only in critical circumstances. Hospitals have not reported any deaths, but some affected children are in critical condition, according to government officials. Chad's government said health workers have been dispatched to Bologo and surrounding towns and villages to educate civilians against popular beliefs that the viral disease is divine punishment for wrongdoing and can be treated only by offering traditional sacrifices to the gods. Health workers are raising awareness that measles can be treated with conventional medicine. The United Nations reports that measles is one of the main causes of death among children in Chad. Outbreaks occur often because vaccination coverage remains low throughout the central African state. Chad’s Health Ministry says vaccine hesitancy is to blame for millions of children not being inoculated against childhood diseases including measles. In 2023, Doctors Without Borders reported that more than 1.3 million children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years old were inoculated against measles. Chad said there were plans with its international partners to inoculate at least 4 million children in the country of close to 18 million people. But armed conflicts and tensions triggered by elections to end a three-year transition that followed the death of President Idriss Deby Itno in 2021 made it impossible for humanitarian agencies to continue vaccination drives. Officials hope that with peace returning and constitutional order reestablished — with the election of Mahamat Idriss Deby as president and the new parliament — more vaccine campaigns will be organized. Measles is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory system that can lead to severe complications and death. The U.N. says it is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. In the absence of specific treatment, vaccination is the most effective medical tool against measles, the World Health Organization said. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-officials-seal-schools-as-measles-epidemic-hits-poor-district/7976693.html	2025-02-15T17:45:11-08:00	
Nun takes top Vatican job running city state administration	ROME — An Italian nun is taking over a top management job in the Vatican: Sister Raffaella Petrini was named Saturday as president of the Vatican City State, making her essentially the governor of the 44-hectare (108-acre) territory in Rome that is home to the Catholic Church. Petrini, 56, had previously been the secretary general of the Vatican administration, which among other things is responsible for the city state's infrastructure and the Vatican Museums, a major source of revenue for the Holy See. She moves into the top job on March 1, following the retirement of Cardinal Fernando Vergez Alzaga, who turns 80 that day. Pope Francis had previously announced Petrini's promotion, part of his effort to place women in decision-making roles in the Vatican to serve as models for the rest of the church. The Vatican officially published the appointment Saturday while the pope was hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection. Last month, Francis named the first woman to head a major Holy See office, appointing another Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never before have women been named to the top jobs of the Holy See Curia or Vatican City State administration. Catholic women have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons. But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%. Critics complain that making women managers of the church doesn't compensate for the continued ban on ordaining them as ministers. In addition to her job running the Vatican City State administration, Petrini also serves as one of three women who are members of the Vatican office that vets bishop nominations. When they were named in 2022 it marked the first time women had had a formal role in the Vatican process of selecting bishops. A member of the Meriden, Connecticut-based Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist religious order, Petrini otherwise keeps a relatively low public profile. But during a 2023 Women's Day speech at Rome's Pontifical Holy Cross university, she acknowledged that her nomination as secretary general of the Vatican City State had raised eyebrows, 'more than I expected in my ingenuity.' 'Even in non-ecclesial organizations, resistance is part of the process of change,' said Petrini, who has also been a professor of welfare economics at Rome's Pontifical Angelicum University.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nun-takes-top-vatican-job-running-city-state-administration-/7976682.html	2025-02-15T17:38:45-08:00	
IRS to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and the cuts could happen as soon as next week. The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. It's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected. Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a 'deferred resignation program' to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30. However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees. It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment. Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency. Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to 'delete entire agencies' from the federal government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities. Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access sensitive government data and exercise 'virtually unchecked power' in a lawsuit filed Thursday. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/irs-to-lay-off-thousands-of-probationary-workers-in-tax-season/7976685.html	2025-02-15T17:13:15-08:00	
US, Russia officials to meet in Saudi Arabia to start talks on Ukraine	MUNICH/WASHINGTON — U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a U.S. lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, U.S. Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia. Rubio spoke by phone on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. The phone call was held at the initiative of the U.S. side, it added. 'The two sides expressed their mutual willingness to interact on pressing international issues, including the settlement around Ukraine, the situation around Palestine and in general in the Middle East and other regional directions,' the ministry said in a statement. On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting that included Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin 'to finally bring peace and end this conflict.' A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zelenskyy said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deals reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement. Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting. Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process. Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv. Keith Kellogg, special envoy for Ukraine-Russia talks, told the Munich conference that the U.S. would act as an intermediary in the talks, with Ukraine and Russia as the two protagonists. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen.' At a later event at the conference, Kellogg sought to reassure Europeans by declaring this did not mean 'their interests are not considered, used or developed.' But European leaders said they would not accept being shut out of the talks. Zelenskyy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials during those visits. Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia. Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow. The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for U.S. funding for Kyiv. The U.S. and Ukraine are negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to U.S. investment. Three sources said the U.S. proposed taking ownership of 50% of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskyy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed. Also on Saturday, France discussed with its allies holding an informal summit of European leaders to discuss Ukraine, a French presidency official said on Saturday, and four European diplomats said the meeting was likely to go ahead on Monday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call reconnaissance through battle. You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. The Dutch news agency reported that Prime Minister Dick Schoof would go to Paris on Monday for the summit. It was unclear whether Zelenskyy would be invited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russia-officials-to-meet-in-saudi-arabia-to-start-talks-on-ukraine-/7976665.html	2025-02-15T16:48:42-08:00	
Europe will not be part of Ukraine peace talks, US envoy says	MUNICH — Europe won't have a seat at the table for Ukraine peace talks, Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy said on Saturday, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump shocked European allies this week by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting them or Kyiv beforehand and declaring an immediate start to peace talks. Trump administration officials have also made clear in recent days that they expect European allies in NATO to take primary responsibility for the region as the United States now has other priorities, such as border security and countering China. The U.S. moves have stoked fears that Europeans may be cut out of a peace deal that would also impact their own security, particularly if it is seen as too favorable to Russia. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg told a global security conference in Munich that the U.S. would act as an intermediary in the talks, with Ukraine and Russia as the two protagonists. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen.' Kellogg said that talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine could focus on territorial concessions from Russia and targeting Putin's oil revenues. 'Russia is really a petrostate,' he said, adding that Western powers needed to do more regarding effectively enforcing sanctions on Russia. At a later event at the conference, Kellogg sought to reassure Europeans by declaring this did not mean 'their interests are not considered, used or developed.' But European leaders said they would not accept being shut out of the talks. 'There's no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine's future or European security structure, without Europeans,' Finland's President Alexander Stubb told reporters in Munich. 'But this means that Europe needs to get its act together. Europe needs to talk less and do more.' Stubb said the questionnaire the U.S. sent to Europeans 'will force Europeans to think.' A European diplomat said the U.S. document included six questions with one specifically for European Union member states. 'The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,' one diplomat said. France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine to discuss these matters, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said on Saturday. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said it would take place on Monday. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also urged Europeans to get their act together. 'And to my European friends, I would say, get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up (defense) spending,' he said in Munich. In a sign that there is still some degree of international cooperation in the new Trump era, G7 foreign ministers, including the U.S., agreed on Saturday on a statement in which they pledged to continue working together to get a durable peace deal for Ukraine with robust security guarantees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-will-not-be-part-of-ukraine-peace-talks-us-envoy-says-/7976497.html	2025-02-15T16:23:15-08:00	
Lebanon says 25 arrested after attack on UN peacekeepers	BEIRUT — Lebanese authorities said Saturday that more than 25 people have been arrested following an attack on a United Nations convoy that wounded two peacekeepers, including the force's outgoing deputy commander. U.N. and Lebanese officials have condemned Friday's attack, which came as Hezbollah supporters blocked the road to the country's only international airport for a second night over a decision by Lebanon to bar two Iranian flights from landing. On Saturday, an AFP correspondent said tear gas was fired to disperse a crowd that again blocked the road to the airport after the Iran-backed group called for a sit-in. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar told reporters that 'more than 25 people have been arrested by Lebanese army intelligence,' with another person detained by the security services. 'This does not mean these detainees carried out the attack ... but the investigations will show who is responsible,' he said, adding that violations would be treated 'with all seriousness.' The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon has demanded a 'full and immediate investigation' after one of its vehicles was set on fire in the attack, which wounded outgoing deputy force commander Chok Bahadur Dhakal, who was heading home to Nepal after completing his mission. UNIFIL deputy spokesperson Kandice Ardiel told AFP a second Nepalese peacekeeper was also wounded. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the attack. President Joseph Aoun vowed 'the attackers will receive their punishment,' and said 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace.' It remains unclear who was responsible for the attack. Senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa said 'what happened with UNIFIL ... is unacceptable.' 'Hezbollah has nothing to do with this matter,' he told Beirut-based pro-Iran broadcaster Al-Mayadeen. Transport Minister Fayez Rasamny said that the government was trying to bring home citizens stranded in Iran on Lebanese flag carrier Middle East Airlines, but Tehran had not provided the necessary permissions. Iran said it was ready for 'constructive talks' with Lebanon on restoring flights, during a telephone call between the two countries' foreign ministers, an Iranian foreign ministry statement said. Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using Beirut airport to transfer weapons from Iran, claims Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have denied. Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Thursday it had 'temporarily rescheduled' some flights, including from Iran, until February 18. The date coincides with the deadline for Israel to complete its withdrawal from south Lebanon and for Hezbollah to vacate its military positions in the region under a ceasefire deal that began in November and was later extended. On Saturday, the Israeli military carried out an airstrike on south Lebanon that it said targeted a senior militant from Hezbollah's aerial unit. 'The terrorist was targeted after repeatedly violating the understandings between Israel and Lebanon over the past few weeks, including his role in leading the launch of UAVs (drones) towards Israeli territory,' the military said. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were killed and four wounded in the strike on a vehicle in the Iqlim al-Tuffah area. Both sides have accused each other of repeated ceasefire violations since the truce went into effect late last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-says-25-arrested-after-attack-on-un-peacekeepers-/7976488.html	2025-02-15T15:17:58-08:00	
1 dead, 4 injured in stabbing spree by Syrian suspect in Austria	VIENNA — A 23-year-old man stabbed five passersby in southern Austria on Saturday in what police said was a random attack that left a 14-year-old dead, and four others injured. The suspect was detained in the city of Villach, where the attack took place, police said. He is a Syrian national with legal residence in Austria, they said. Two victims were seriously injured and two victims sustained minor injuries, police said. Police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio said a motive was not immediately known. He added that police were investigating the attacker's personal background. 'We have to wait until we get secure information,' he said. A 42-year-old man who works for a food delivery company witnessed the incident from his car, police said. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent things from getting worse, Dionisio told Austria's public broadcaster ORF. Peter Kaiser, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old victim. 'This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values.' Erwin Angerer, a lawmaker for the far-right Freedom Party, said his party had been warning about the situation in Austria as a result of the country's 'disastrous asylum policy.' Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner was expected in Villach on Sunday morning. Police said it wasn't clear whether the suspect acted on his own and continued to search for potential additional suspects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-4-injured-in-stabbing-spree-by-syrian-suspect-in-austria/7976471.html	2025-02-15T14:31:44-08:00	
15 dead in India stampede to catch trains to Hindu festival	NEW DELHI, INDIA — At least 15 people died during a stampede at a railway station in India's capital late Saturday when surging crowds scrambled to catch trains to the world's largest religious gathering, a medical official told AFP. The Kumbh Mela attracts tens of millions of Hindu faithful every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj and has a history of crowd-related disasters — including one last month, when at least 30 people died in another stampede at the holy confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The rush at the train station in New Delhi appeared to break out Saturday as crowds struggled to board trains for the ongoing event, which will end on February 26. 'I can confirm 15 deaths at the hospital. They don't have any open injury. Most (likely died from) hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,' Dr. Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi to AFP. 'There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopedic injuries,' she said. Defense minister Rajnath Singh said he was 'extremely pained by the loss of lives due to stampede' at the New Delhi railway station. 'In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy [recovery] of the injured,' Singh said in a social media post. The governor of the capital, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and 'all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.' Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees. The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month. More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest death tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-stampede-to-catch-trains-to-hindu-festival-/7976466.html	2025-02-15T14:08:23-08:00	
Central African Republic soldiers kidnapped by mercenaries, advocates allege	BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC — Human rights advocates and politicians in Central African Republic claim soldiers who disappeared after being detained last month were kidnapped by mercenaries backed by Russia. The Kremlin has in recent years deepened ties with the gold- and diamond-rich country's military and government. Celestin Bakoyo and Elie Ngouengue — two soldiers who led a Wagner Group-aligned militia fighting rebels in the country's southeast — were reportedly detained on January 24 at a police station in the country's capital. Ernest Mizedio, a politician from the region, told The Associated Press that the two soldiers were among a group arrested earlier by Russian mercenaries tasked with training militia members and incorporating them into the army. 'We searched without success for where they took them,' he said, noting that supporters had inquired with both law enforcement and Russian security contractors about their whereabouts. 'They said they had nothing to offer us and knew nothing of their situation.' Mizedio, a member of one of Central African Republic's opposition parties, said there had been marches and protests decrying the arrests in the country's southeast. Neither Wagner nor the military responded to AP's requests for comment on the disappearance. However, a police officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said mercenaries were gradually vying for position and replacing officers on the ground in conflict zones. Before going missing, the two had come to the capital to open new bank accounts to access their earnings after being integrated into the army. The backlash against their disappearance comes as Russia expands its military and economic presence throughout Africa, using mercenaries to quell rebellion and fight extremists. Joseph Bindoumi, president of Central African Republic's League for Human Rights, denounced the disappearances, called them kidnappings and said even if the soldiers were accused of crimes, their whereabouts should be known. 'We have the right to know if standard procedures are being followed. We have the right to see people to ensure their well-being and to ensure their parents, advocates and lawyers can visit them,' he said. Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries became active. Amid years of conflict between government forces and predominantly Muslim rebels, citizens and officials credited the Russian mercenaries with fighting back armed groups who tried to overtake Bangui in 2021. Yet they've been dogged by reports of recklessly disregarding human rights and civilian welfare. A 2023 investigation from the U.S.-based watchdog group The Sentry found that mercenaries train the army on torture tactics and as part of the fight against armed groups opposed to the government had carried out killings, torture and rape.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-african-republic-soldiers-kidnapped-by-mercenaries-advocates-allege-/7976454.html	2025-02-15T13:55:16-08:00	
US braces for flooding; parts of California face mudslides	SIERRA MADRE, CALIFORNIA — Much of the Eastern United States braced for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with thunderstorms and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to eight inches of rain. 'This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event,' the NWS said. Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS said. In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as high as 72 kilometers per hour (45 miles per hour) late Saturday and Sunday. 'Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS said. California struggles with mudslides In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by wildfires. Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire, which destroyed 15 homes in the community. In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot. Southern California reported 2.5 to 7 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 7.6 to 15.2 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) across the coastal slopes Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the weather service. The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation. A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. More winter weather descending Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week. In Denver, Colorado, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between the shelters across the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-braces-for-flooding-parts-of-california-face-mudslides-/7976445.html	2025-02-15T12:57:47-08:00	
Carafano: 'A free, independent Ukraine is in America's best interest'	WASHINGTON — James Carafano, senior counselor to the president and national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, spoke with VOA's Ukraine Service about the Trump administration's goals and considerations in the negotiation process to achieve peace in Ukraine. He explained that while not a vital interest, a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself is in America's best interests, and he outlined how to achieve this goal. Voice of America: How do you and The Heritage Foundation see ending the war in Ukraine, and what is the strategy behind it? James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation: It is in America's best interest that there be a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. And the reason for that is the United States. The United States is a global power with global interests and global responsibilities. A peaceful Europe, whole, free and at peace, that is a vital American interest. The transit Atlantic community is important to us. And the number one threat, physical threat to that is the destabilizing actions of Russia. And the most concerning and destabilizing action is the security of the Eastern front of NATO and Ukraine, that is free and independent, that can defend itself is an obstacle to the Russians, whether it's in NATO or not. Now, to be honest, it's not a vital interest in the United States. For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine's occupied by Russia. Now having said that, are we way better off? I mean, way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is 'absolutely.' At this point, what is in America's interest is that the war stops and that there is a ceasefire that is both from a strategic perspective to preserve Ukraine, and that we have to be realistic about Ukraine's capacity to recover territory that's been occupied. But also from a humanitarian perspective, and I think this is very deeply reflected in our president. More Ukrainians dying is never going to reconquer all of Ukrainian territory. A war of attrition is never going to create a stronger Ukraine. I think everybody is focused on what the deal looks like. I think the deals are relevant. Stopping the war is the objective. The real question is, what do we do the day after the war to ensure there's a free and independent Ukraine in the future? VOA: The defense secretary said we don't want Minsk 3.0. Are we falling into the trap of Munich 2.0, where we appease the dictator, give away territories, embolden the aggressor, and end up in a world war? Carafano: I don't think that's the peace that the U.S. envisions. So, I'll tell you what appeasement would be. Appeasement would be giving the Russians something at the negotiating table that they didn't win on the battlefield. That's appeasement. Recognizing that the Russians have territory they have and the inability of the Ukraine [forces] to retake that territory — maybe they trade territory, I don't know — that's called being realistic. VOA: If Russia is allowed to keep its spoils of war, what message would it send to other would-be aggressors? Carafano: That Russia has failed. Russia's goal was to conquer and destroy Ukraine. It failed. Russia's goal was to have NATO fall apart. It failed. If Russia is stopped in Ukraine, and look what they have achieved, they've achieved some marginal territorial gains at the cost of destroying the Russian army, crippling the Russian economy, and making themselves a global pariah. If that's a victory, it's a kind of really weird Pyrrhic victory. VOA: Then, why would [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth articulate these concessions? Carafano: They're not concessions. They are statements of reality. We all know it's true. If you give Putin something at the negotiation table that he wasn't able to take on the battlefield, that is a concession. So, if for example you said, Ukraine has to give up the sovereignty of its territory even its occupied territory, I would say that's a really bad deal. That's a concession. We have never ever forced any country to actually give up the sovereignty of its territory.' VOA: What about [Ukraine`s membership] in NATO? Here is a counterargument: Why Russia should have a veto power over NATO? Carafano: First of all, Hegseth has never said Russia should have a veto power over the entry of Ukraine into NATO. Hegseth has said, 'This is not going to be part of the negotiation and Ukraine is not going to get into NATO now.' That's no different from the Biden policy and that's actually just a reflection of reality. NATO is a consensus organization. Every member has to agree. Every member does not agree. So, we all know, the Russians know, we know, everybody in NATO knows, Ukraine is not going to get NATO membership now.' VOA: What about the future? Carafano: He didn't say that Ukraine shouldn't join NATO in the future. He just said that NATO membership is not going to be part of the negotiation. VOA: So, the main issue here is security guarantees. Carafano: That's also wrong. Somehow that we're going to say something that's going deter Putin in the future. That's nonsense and ridiculous. What's going to deter Putin in the future is, does Ukraine have the capacity to defend itself? VOA: So how do we deter the Russians? Carafano: We have a Ukraine as a country that can defend itself and that is free, and its economy grows, and it builds a defense industrial base. And we strengthen NATO because that will equally deter the Russians. And we do the other things, which by the way Donald Trump is going to do already, whether there's a peace deal or not. Donald Trump is going to put a lot of pressure on the Russians. He's going to lower the price of oil. He's going to increase sanctions. He's going to [do] a lot of things that are going to hamstring the Russian economy. Russia is going to be weaker. He's going to do a lot of things to go after the Iranians. So, the Iranians are going to have a lot less capacity to support the Russians. He's going to do a lot of things to put a lot of pressure on the Chinese. The Chinese are going to be less able to support the Russians. Donald Trump can do a lot to North Korea. Regardless of what happens in the actual peace deal in Ukraine, Trump is going to do a lot to the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians that really diminishes their capacity to sustain this war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/carafano-a-free-independent-ukraine-is-in-america-s-best-interest-/7976425.html	2025-02-15T12:39:11-08:00	
US citizen detained in Russia, accused of drug smuggling	MOSCOW — A Moscow court has ordered a U.S. citizen suspected of drug smuggling held in pre-trial detention for 30 days, the Moscow courts press service said Saturday, days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward ending the fighting in Ukraine. The U.S. citizen, whom Saturday's statement named as Kalob Wayne Byers, was detained after airport customs officials found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle a 'significant amount' of drugs into the country, the Interfax agency reported, citing Russia's Federal Customs Service. The agency said the American was detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after flying in from Istanbul on February 7. Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, said the U.S. citizen faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. The Washington-Moscow prisoner exchange this month saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, returned to Russia in exchange for American Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania who was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school. Fogel had been serving a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. President Joe Biden's administration designated Fogel as wrongfully detained in December. President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine, saying he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-citizen-detained-in-russia-accused-of-drug-smuggling-/7976409.html	2025-02-15T11:44:02-08:00	
US counterterror official warns of growing global threat	WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. counterterrorism official is cautioning that the threat from global jihadists has expanded significantly, although the resources to counter them have declined. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and senior director for counterterrorism, on Feb. 11 told a Washington conference organized by the American Foreign Policy Council that he based the current threat assessment on several factors. 'Number one, jihadist groups are more geographically dispersed than ever before, with networks extending across the Sahel, Central and East Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia,' he said. 'To cite just one example, West African countries like Benin and Togo, that once had little exposure to jihadi threats, are now seeing jihadi Sunni actors in their territory and elsewhere, affecting their national sovereignty.' Benin and Togo have reported attacks by al-Qaida, an expansion of the violence the terror group is carrying out in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Gorka said militant groups are increasingly capable and using new forms of technology to execute their deadly missions. Gorka said that militants 'remain highly adaptive entities.' 'If you look at their use of social media, especially encrypted apps to communicate, these individuals have acclimatized to the new technological environment,' he said. One of Trump’s main campaign promises in last year’s election was to tighten security along the U.S. border and deport migrants without legal status. He signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the border. Gorka argued that border vulnerabilities give militants an advantage. 'The global jihadi actors are poised to capitalize on global security vulnerabilities, especially the fact that, for four years, we have had no southern border,' Gorka said. Former President Joe Biden defended his immigration policies during the 2024 presidential election campaign and blamed the Republicans for walking back on a bipartisan immigration bill. Biden said Trump was involved in sinking the bill. The Middle East Gorka said militant groups in the Middle East, including Hezbollah and Hamas, which the United States, Britain and other Western nations have designated as terrorist groups, have been severely marginalized. 'Let's just be blunt — since the heinous, tragic massacre of more Jews than have ever been killed since the end of the Shoah [Holocaust] in 1945, since Oct. 7, our friends in Israel have literally redrawn the map of the region,' he said. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. 'As a result, groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have been radically degraded,' Gorka said. This has paved the way for what? The collapse of the [Bashar al-] Assad regime in Syria, which together represent devastating blows to the greatest global sponsor of terrorism as a nation-state — Iran's capability to hurt our interests and the interests of our friends and partners.' US airstrikes in Somalia Gorka also gave more details about the airstrikes on Feb. 1 that targeted Islamic State group militants in Somalia’s northeastern region of Puntland. The strikes were carried out by the U.S. Africa Command and authorized by Trump and coordinated with Somalia. 'We told the president, ‘There is a cave complex in northern Somalia full of ISIS,' he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. 'We have been surveilling it for years, but the last administration refused to take action.' According to the Africa Command, 14 militants were killed, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who was described as a 'recruiter, financier and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Somali officials said he is from Oman, although the U.S. has not commented on his nationality. 'The person you saw in the footage is not just a foot soldier,' Gorka said as video of the airstrike was played. 'He is a recruiter, trainer and financier for ISIS, one of the guys who is hard to replace. We had been surveilling him for months.' The strikes were carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, which was in the Red Sea at the time. Trump confirmed ordering a precision military airstrikes on the same day. Somali forces in Puntland this week reported success against the militants. Scores were killed after Puntland forces repelled a complex attack from the militants in the early hours of Feb. 11. The U.S. has been training elite Somali forces known as Danab, which means 'lightning.' So far, there has been no publicly known change of US security support to Somalia.

Stars galore celebrate 'Saturday Night Live' in concert	NEW YORK — By the time Cher sang 'If I Could Turn Back Time,' it seemed as if time had indeed been turned back and every single 'Saturday Night Live' musical guest of 50 years had magically found their way to Radio City Music Hall. Of course, it was only a smattering. But 'SNL50: The Homecoming Concert' boasted an epic lineup. It was an evening of memorable solo performances and often fascinating, one-time-only collaborations. The concert, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, was only one element of what has become an enormous celebration of the show’s 50 years in existence, leading up to Sunday’s 'SNL50: The Anniversary Special,' live from Studio 8H. But Friday night was all about music. Return of the 1990s If a decade can win the night, let’s hear it for the 1990s. A classic performance from that decade was most likely to get the Radio City audience on its feet, singing along and pulling out their phones to record. The Backstreet Boys proved irresistible when they broke into 'I Want it That Way.' Snoop Dogg may have sung 'Gin and Juice,' but he was trailed by enough smoke to give nearby audience members a contact high. Wearing a gigantic coat befitting a winter night, Lauryn Hill commanded the stage with Wyclef Jean, and the crowd melted at the first notes of 'Killing Me Softly.' Some comics can do music Naturally, some former 'SNL' cast members reprised old characters, with varying levels of success. The Culps, the stuffy music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer, hit harder and funnier than they ever did on the show. Their attempts at being current were hilarious and they even worked in a few verses of 'Not Like Us,' with a plea for harmony between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell’s 'Lazy Sunday' was welcome, but too short. Lady Gaga was a good sport, replacing Justin Timberlake to sing about a Christmas gift whose title can't be repeated here. But Bill Murray’s lounge singer 'foursome' routine with Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and Cecily Strong fell a bit flat. They love Michaels 'SNL' creator Lorne Michaels didn’t perform, but he was referred to all night long. 'I love you, Lorne Michaels,' declared Miley Cyrus, dedicating her hit song 'Flowers' to the show's founder. Raitt, finishing 'I Can’t Make You Love Me,' thanked Michaels for having her on the show so many times. 'Let’s give it up for Lorne,' said former cast member Adam Sandler, introducing a collaboration between Post Malone and Nirvana. 'We love you buddy.' And Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the British folk band Mumford & Sons, said he was there to represent Michaels' admirers from across the pond. Creative collaborations The night featured fascinating collaborations that brought together musicians of all kinds. Cyrus teamed with Brittany Howard to sing Queen’s 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love.' Arcade Fire joined with David Byrne, St. Vincent and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to perform David Bowie’s 'Heroes.' Byrne later also collaborated with Robyn, in matching khaki suits, for 'Dancing on My Own' and 'This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).' And for Raitt's second song, she sat down with Chris Martin, the Coldplay frontman becoming her pianist for 'I Can’t Make You Love Me.' In another collab of sorts, the B-52s were joined on 'Love Shack' by former and current SNL cast members Fred Armisen, Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, singing the 'bang bang' lyrics. Lady Gaga collaborated with herself, singing both parts of 'Shallow' and bringing down the house. Most valuable player Questlove is more associated with the 'Tonight' show, but he is proving to be the MVP of these 'Saturday Night Live' anniversary festivities. Not only did the drummer produce the splendid documentary on the 'SNL' musical legacy, but he effortlessly kept the beat with The Roots, his legendary hip-hop group and 'Tonight' show house band, as they covered every style imaginable, from Snoop to Eddie Vedder to Brandi Carlile. Byrne bowed in appreciation. A second Nirvana reunion For the second time in as many weeks, the surviving members of Nirvana reunited. Rather than the quartet of women who fronted the band for the Fire Aid concert, Malone took Kurt Cobain’s place Friday. Their version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was fierce, a reminder of why the song packed such a wallop when it was first heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stars-galore-celebrate-saturday-night-live-in-concert/7976367.html	2025-02-15T10:42:28-08:00	
G7 ministers link future Russia sanctions to good-faith talks	MUNICH — G7 foreign ministers agreed Saturday to continuing working together to get a strong peace deal for Ukraine with robust security guarantees and linked future sanctions on Russia to good-faith negotiations by Moscow. 'Any new, additional sanctions after February should be linked to whether the Russian Federation enters into real, good-faith efforts to bring an enduring end to the war against Ukraine that provides Ukraine with long-term security and stability as a sovereign, independent country,' the statement, which includes U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said after a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. The G7, which also includes France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, Britain and the EU, underscored its commitment to help achieve a durable peace and 'the need to develop robust security guarantees to ensure the war will not begin again.' Possible informal Ukraine summit Meanwhile, France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said Saturday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President [Donald] Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call ‘reconnaissance through battle.’ You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. 'And I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris tomorrow, and I expect them to relate to this in a very serious fashion.' The French presidency official said that if there were to be any such summit, it would not be held Sunday. 'I am glad that the Prime Minister @donaldtusk will go on Monday at the invitation of the President @EmmanuelMacron to a meeting of European leaders. We need to show our strength and unity,' Sikorski later said on X, referring to Polish leader Donald Tusk. It was not clear whether the invite would be sent only to European Union member states or more broadly and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be invited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-ministers-link-future-russia-sanctions-to-good-faith-talks/7976347.html	2025-02-15T10:16:53-08:00	
New African Union leader elected as two major crises rage	The leaders of Africa Union countries on Saturday chose a new chief for the branch that runs the organization’s daily operations, as conflicts persist in two of the largest three countries on the continent. At their annual summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the organization’s members elected Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf as the next chair of the African Union Commission in a secret ballot. Youssouf, who celebrated his 60th birthday a week ago, defeated Kenya’s former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and former Foreign Minister of Madagascar Richard Randriamandrato. The selection took several rounds of voting. Youssouf was a close second in the first and second rounds behind Raila. In the following four rounds, Youssouf took the lead until he became the sole candidate in the seventh round, with an unassailable 33 votes needed for victory in the final. He replaces Moussa Faki Mahamat of Chad, who served two terms as AU commissioner. Youssouf, who has been minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Djibouti since 2005, is the longest-serving foreign minister on the continent. All 55 member states, with the exception of six countries that were suspended from membership, are taking part in the summit. An Ethiopian Foreign Ministry source speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that 29 presidents, three vice presidents, four prime ministers and a king are in attendance. New chief inherits crises The election of the new chief comes as the conflict in Africa’s second-largest country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, escalates following recent territorial gains by M23 rebels. The M23 forces approached the second-biggest city in eastern DRC, Bukavu, two weeks after seizing the main city of Goma. The DRC accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels, although Rwanda denies supporting M23. The continent’s leaders called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and the reopening of main supply routes and Goma airport. Sudan is another major focal point of conflict that leaders are discussing. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is at the summit, called on warring parties in Sudan to cease hostilities and protect civilians, including humanitarian workers. Guterres appealed for $6 billion to address the needs of about 26 million Sudanese who need emergency assistance. In an interview with VOA Horn of Africa last year, Youssouf vowed to work on 'silencing the guns' on the continent. 'Silencing the gun, you know, preventing conflicts, resolving those wars and internal crises ... that we are faced with already is one of the priorities,' he said. 'Of course, this is something that we need to work on, and I'll make sure that the commission will concentrate on that particular program.' Youssouf also said he will work to reform the organization, recruit the most qualified and skilled Africans, and make excellence, merit and competence the key principle. 'If you have a good staff at the commission, it will be much easier for all of us to implement the reforms that have already been enacted by our leaders,' he said. Meanwhile, Angolan President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco took the rotating African Union chairmanship, replacing Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-african-union-leader-elected-as-two-major-crises-rage/7976339.html	2025-02-15T09:57:51-08:00	
Vatican: Pope spent quiet night in hospital, continues drug therapy	ROME — Pope Francis slept well during a quiet first night in the hospital after being admitted with a respiratory tract infection and was up eating and reading Saturday, the Vatican said. Francis, 88, ate breakfast Saturday morning and read the newspapers while continuing his drug therapy, spokesperson Matteo Bruni said. The Argentine pope was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health. Preliminary tests showed he had a respiratory tract infection and a slight fever. The Vatican canceled his audiences through Monday at least. Francis, who is prone to respiratory infections in winter, was diagnosed with bronchitis Feb. 6 but had continued to hold daily audiences in his Vatican hotel suite. He had presided at an outdoor Mass last weekend and attended his general audience Wednesday. But he has been handing off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing. Francis had part of one lung removed as a young man and has battled other health problems. He had 33 centimeters of his large intestine removed in 2021 because of a narrowing of the colon. He had further abdominal surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin. Francis is being treated at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, where popes have a private suite on the 10th floor. He revealed that during a 2023 hospitalization, he was diagnosed with 'an acute and strong pneumonia, in the lower part of the lungs.' Sometimes bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs’ air sacs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-pope-spent-quiet-night-in-hospital-continues-drug-therapy/7976297.html	2025-02-15T09:09:14-08:00	
Iran orders probe into killing of university student during robbery	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran’s vice president ordered a probe Saturday into the killing of a university student after a protest at Tehran University, state media reported. A report by the official IRNA news agency said First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref ordered security officials to probe the case 'immediately.' The move came a day after angry students gathered in protest at a Tehran University dormitory seeking more safety measures. The protest briefly turned violent, and police deployed forces to the gate of the dorm, according to videos on social media. The Associated Press could not independently verify the footage. Protesters, chanting 'Shame on you,' demanded more safety measures at the dorm and its neighborhood, complaining about occasional robberies. On Wednesday, 19-year-old business administration student Amir Mohammad Khaleghi was stabbed by two unknown robbers who stole his backpack in front of the dorm. Khaleghi died in the hospital. Peace returned to the dorm late Friday after authorities vowed to pursue the case with a 'special' order. Although the protest was not politically motivated, such events can ignite unrest as Iranian people under U.S. economic sanctions are dealing with the high price of meeting their daily needs, as well as widespread mismanagement. Iranian universities have a history of protest over the past decades. Most recently, in 2022, universities were major sites of protest over the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after she was detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing the Muslim headscarf correctly. The protests that followed Amini’s death started first with the chant 'Woman, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters’ cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against the incumbent theocracy. The monthslong nationwide protests, which shook the establishment, ended in early 2023 after a security crackdown during which more than 500 people were killed and over 22,000 detained. In 1999, student protests in Tehran over the government’s closing of a reformist newspaper and a subsequent security force crackdown saw several people killed, hundreds wounded and more arrested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-orders-probe-into-killing-of-university-student-during-robbery/7976244.html	2025-02-15T08:06:19-08:00	
Chaos, looting break out as rebels push toward major DRC city	GOMA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Panic swept through eastern Congo’s second-largest city on Saturday as residents fled by the thousands, scrambling to escape the looming advance of Rwanda-backed rebels. Amid chaos and looting, Bukavu braced for what comes next. A day after M23 fighters entered the outskirts of Bukavu — a city of about 1.3 million people that lies 101 kilometers south of rebel-held Goma — some streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. Most people waited in their home, shocked by what filled the vacuum left by Congolese soldiers who abandoned their posts. 'They set fire to the ammunition they were unable to take with them,' said Alain Iragi, among the residents who fled in search of safety on Saturday. Reports and social media videos showed the region's factories pillaged and prisons emptied while electricity remained on and communication lines open. 'It’s a disgrace. Some citizens have fallen victim to stray bullets. Even some soldiers still present in the city are involved en masse in these cases of looting,' a 25-year-old resident of a neighborhood being looted told The Associated Press. The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, blamed Congolese troops and their allies from local militia and neighboring Burundi for the disorder in Bukavu. 'We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,' Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance's spokesperson, said in a statement on Saturday. Rebels push south M23, a militia backed by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo’s mineral-rich east. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. While the United Nations and United States consider M23 a rebel group, DRC considers it a terrorist organization. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict, and several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive. Congolese authorities and international observers have accused it of sexual violence, forced conscription and summary executions. M23's southward expansion encompasses more territory than rebels had previously seized and poses an unprecedented challenge to the central government in Kinshasa. The rebellion underway has killed at least 2,000 people in eastern Congo and stranded hundreds of thousands of displaced. At least 350,000 internally displaced people are without shelter, the U.N. and Congolese authorities have said. The rebels on Friday also claimed to have seized a second airport in the region, in the town of Kavumu outside Bukavu. The AP could not confirm who was in control of the strategically important airport, which Congolese forces have used to resupply troops and humanitarian groups to import aid. The Congo River Alliance claimed on Saturday that M23 had taken control of the airport to prevent Congolese forces from launch airstrikes against civilians. Government officials and local civil society leaders did not immediately comment, although Congo's Communications Ministry said the rebels had violated ceasefire agreements and attacked Congolese troops working to avoid urban warfare and violence in Bukavu. The reports of looting and disorder come a day after residents told AP that soldiers in Kavumu — the airport town north of Bukavu — had abandoned their positions to head toward the city. The chain of events mirror what transpired last month in the lead-up to the M23's capture of Goma. Congo’s military, despite its size and funding, has long been hindered by shortcomings in training and coordination and recurring reports of corruption. Fears of spreading conflict International leaders are expected to discuss the conflict at the African Union summit in Ethiopia this weekend as DRC President Felix Tshisekedi continues to plead with the international community to intervene to contain the rebels from advancing. However, little progress has been made since the government dismissed a ceasefire that M23 declared last week unilaterally as false. 'Regional escalation must be avoided at all costs,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Addis Ababa. 'The sovereignty and territorial integrity of [Congo] must be respected.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chaos-looting-break-out-as-rebels-push-toward-major-drc-city/7976234.html	2025-02-15T07:49:52-08:00	
Serbia's striking students, president hold parallel rallies	KRAGUJEVAC, SERBIA — Serbia’s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic were holding parallel rallies Saturday as both marked the country's Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages. The student-led protest is the latest in a nationwide anti-graft movement that reflects mounting calls for fundamental political changes in the Balkan state, triggered after a concrete canopy on a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1, killing 15 people. The rally in the central industrial city of Kragujevac drew tens of thousands of people demanding justice over the accident and respect for the rule of law. The movement has been seeking to root out rampant endemic corruption. Students chose Kragujevac for Saturday's rally because of its history. In 1835, Serbia was still part of the Ottoman Empire, and people in Kragujevac announced a new constitution that sought to limit the powers of the then-rulers. The date is now celebrated as Statehood Day. People from all over the country streamed into Kragujevac for Saturday’s gathering. 'I am here to support this student rebellion, which has grown into a civil rebellion, and to fight for the rule of law and justice in this society, so that Serbia becomes a country where life is dignified,' said a woman from Belgrade who identified herself only by the name Teodora. The students arrived Friday to cheers from the residents. Ahead of the protest, they organized marches in various parts of the country, encouraging people to converge in Kragujevac. Some walked; others ran or cycled. Along their journey, people greeted them with food and refreshments and offered accommodation, many crying and expressing hope for change. The president's rally Meanwhile, in Sremska Mitrovica, a small town northwest of Belgrade, Vucic is expected to recycle a traditional nationalist theme, warning that the West wants to unseat him by force and that this could lead to the breakup of the country. Serbian authorities were set to bus in thousands of supporters from throughout the country as well as neighboring Bosnia. Some opposition activists have said they will try to prevent their arrival. Vucic said on Instagram that his supporters wish to 'defend and save Serbia from those who want to destroy it.' The anti-graft movement is Vucic's biggest challenge in recent years. The president — who has ruled Serbia with a firm grip on power for more than a decade — and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been previously accused of stifling democratic freedoms, publicly discrediting opponents and rigging elections, according to international vote observers. The canopy disaster, widely believed to have happened due to government corruption, has become a flashpoint for wider discontent with the authoritarian rule, with university students at the forefront of the anti-graft uprising. Their determination, youth and creativity have struck a chord among people widely disillusioned with politicians. Prosecutors have charged 13 people over the canopy fall, and protests have forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister. But students have said their protests will continue until their demands for full accountability are met. In the past three months, the president has shifted between accusing the students of working for foreign powers to offering concessions and claiming he has fulfilled each of their demands. But during a trip to the Serb-controlled part of neighboring Bosnia this week, Vucic has reiterated claims about an alleged plot from abroad to overthrow him and his government. The authorities, Vucic said, 'couldn’t believe how much money has been invested to bring down the government in Serbia.' He offered no proof for the claims. Vucic's trip to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia was apparently designed to stress Serbian unity with the Serbs in Bosnia, where a bid to create a pan-Serb state in the 1990s’ was widely blamed for triggering a bloody war that killed more than 100,000 people killed and displaced millions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-striking-students-president-hold-parallel-rallies/7976209.html	2025-02-15T07:31:55-08:00	
US defense secretary's Europe debut irks allies, wins Trump's nod	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's attention-grabbing overseas debut may have irritated some key Republicans and alienated allies in Europe, where his statements on Ukraine and NATO went down like a lead balloon. But his forceful comments gained him a nod from one key listener: U.S. President Donald Trump. And Hegseth — who on Saturday wraps up a weeklong trip to Belgium, Germany and Poland — delivered a message at the heart of Trump's 'America First' agenda. Speaking at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth said that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was unrealistic, and that the Trump administration does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution to the war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion. Trump broadly backed Hegseth's remarks on Thursday on NATO membership, saying, 'I think probably that's true,' because, he said, Putin would not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance. 'I thought his comments were good yesterday, and they're probably good today,' Trump said. Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican who leads the Pentagon's main oversight committee in the Senate, had championed Hegseth's nomination throughout a bruising confirmation review in which Democrats united against the nominee and three Republicans joined them, as questions were raised about Hegseth's qualifications, temperament and views about women in combat. Asked whether he spent a lot of political capital getting Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News personality, confirmed, Wicker said: 'I surely did, yes.' Republican Congressman Mike Turner said issues like the future of NATO membership for Ukraine should not be taken off the table. 'We don't need members of the Cabinet, President Trump's Cabinet, to be defining those in the public,' Turner said Friday on CNN. Republican Congressman Don Bacon responded to Hegseth's comments by saying that there should be moral clarity on who started the war. 'There are consequences of rewarding the invader even if its leader foolishly led over 700,000 of its citizens to slaughter,' Bacon said on social media platform X. Uncle Sam or Uncle Sucker? Trump has played down any tensions. On Friday, he said he had not seen Wicker's comments but would reach out to him and Hegseth. 'Roger's a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he's been doing a great job,' Trump said. Hegseth, in what some analysts saw as walking back his remarks, clarified on Thursday that Trump was the one who would ultimately decide what was on or off the table in the Ukraine talks. Calling Trump the world's best negotiator, Hegseth said it would not be appropriate for him to 'declare what President Trump will do or won't do, what will be in or what will be out.' He also delivered a message that resonates with Trump and his 'America First' agenda: Europe has been taking advantage of the United States. Hegseth spoke about Europe's reliance on costly U.S. military deployments for its defense. Trump has criticized Europe over what he sees as its unfair tariffs against American goods. The United States and European Union have the world's largest commercial relationship, trading $1.55 trillion of goods and services in 2023. Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters, Hegseth said: 'Make no mistake: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into 'Uncle Sucker.'' In Trump's first term, NATO was seen as a red line for his Pentagon chiefs. Jim Mattis, his first defense secretary, resigned in part because of Trump's skepticism toward NATO. America's European allies were critical of Hegseth. 'I think that was clumsy. I think that was a mistake,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said, also criticizing Trump. European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas went further. 'It is appeasement. It has never worked,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-secretary-s-europe-debut-irks-allies-wins-trump-s-nod/7976197.html	2025-02-15T07:06:03-08:00	
Pakistan clashes result in 4 dead soldiers, 15 militants	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that counterterrorism operations in two volatile northwestern districts resulted in the deaths of four soldiers, including an officer, and 15 insurgents during the ensuing clashes. A military statement said the deadly violence erupted when its forces carried out 'intelligence-based' raids on militant locations in Dera Ismail Khan and North Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan. The statement identified the slain militants as 'khwarij,' a term employed by the government for individuals affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, a globally recognized terrorist organization. Local security sources reported that the soldier fatalities occurred during clashes in the Waziristan area. The official claims about militant casualties could not be verified by independent sources. The TTP did not comment on the reported clashes in the districts, where the militant group routinely attacks security forces and their installations. Pakistan maintains that TTP leaders and fighters use sanctuaries in Afghanistan to orchestrate cross-border terrorism with the help of the neighboring country’s Taliban government, which has not yet received official recognition from any country. The allegations have strained Islamabad's relationship with de facto Afghan leaders in Kabul, who consistently have denied the presence of the TTP or any other foreign terrorist organizations within their territory. 'One of the key issues bedeviling our relations remains the sanctuaries enjoyed by terrorists belonging to the TTP on Afghan territory,' Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told a weekly news conference on Friday. 'We continue to remain engaged with Afghanistan and also make them realize that the long-term potential of the region, the bilateral cooperation and what it can bring for the benefit or welfare of the two countries will remain unmet unless this problem is resolved.' UN backing The latest report by the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, released earlier this week, highlights Islamabad’s concerns, stating that the TTP has 'significantly increased' its attacks in Pakistan and from Afghan territory. The report stated that Taliban authorities in Afghanistan 'continued to provide the TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support.' It added that the group 'established new training centers' in the Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika 'while enhancing recruitment within TTP cadres, including from the Afghan Taliban.' The U.N. assessment also emphasized the growing terrorism threat from al-Qaida and the regional Islamic State affiliate operating in Afghanistan since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. 'The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,' the report said. It stated that Afghanistan 'remained the main hub' for the regional Islamic State affiliate, known as Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), primarily 'for its recruitment and facilitation.' The spokesperson for the Taliban government dismissed U.N. findings on Friday as 'inaccurate' and contrary to reality. 'The Islamic Emirate [Taliban government] does not allow any foreign, rogue group to operate in Afghanistan, and such groups are not present here,' Zabihullah Mujahid told the local TOLO news channel. 'Unfortunately, some countries and intelligence circles, through organizations like the United Nations and the Security Council, are tarnishing public opinion and waging propaganda and campaigns against Afghanistan,' Mujahid stated, without elaborating.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-clashes-result-in-4-dead-soldiers-15-militants/7976188.html	2025-02-15T06:47:55-08:00	
US Justice Department asks court to dismiss charges against NYC mayor	NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department asked a court Friday to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with a top official from Washington intervening after federal prosecutors in Manhattan rebuffed his demands to drop the case and some quit in protest. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the department’s second-in-command, and lawyers from the public integrity section and criminal division filed paperwork asking to end the case. They contend that it was marred by appearances of impropriety and that letting it continue would interfere with the mayor’s reelection bid. A judge must still approve the request. The filing came hours after Bove convened a call with the prosecutors in the Justice Department’s public integrity section — which handles corruption cases — and gave them an hour to pick two people to sign onto the motion to dismiss, saying those who did so could be promoted, according to a person familiar with the matter. After prosecutors got off the call with Bove, the consensus among the group was that they would all resign. But a veteran prosecutor stepped up out of concern for the jobs of the younger people in the unit, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the private meeting. The three-page dismissal motion bore Bove's signature and the names of Edward Sullivan, the public integrity section’s senior litigation counsel, and Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the department’s criminal division. No one from the federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan, which brought the Adams case, signed the document. The move came five days into a showdown between Justice Department leadership in Washington and its Manhattan office, which has long prided itself on its independence as it has taken on Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. At least seven prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington quit rather than carry out Bove’s directive to halt the case, including interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and the acting chief of the public integrity section in Washington. The Justice Department said in its motion to Judge Dale E. Ho that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later. Ho had yet to act on the request as of Friday evening. 'I imagine the judge is going to want to explore what his role is under the rules,' said Joshua Naftalis, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor who is not involved in Adams’ case. 'I would expect the court to either ask the parties to come in person to court or to file papers, or both.' Bove said earlier this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s permanent, appointed Manhattan U.S. attorney, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, can decide whether to refile the charges after the November election. Adams faces a Democratic primary in June, with several challengers lined up. His trial had been on track to be held in the spring. Bove said that continuing the prosecution would interfere with Adams’ ability to govern, posing 'unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies,' the dismissal motion said. Among other things, it said, the case caused Adams to be denied access to sensitive information necessary to help protect the city. Adams pleaded not guilty in September to charges he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. Although critical in the past, Adams has bonded at times with Trump recently and visited him at his Florida golf club last month. The president has criticized the case against Adams and said he was open to giving the mayor, who was a registered Republican in the 1990s, a pardon. Bove sent a memo Monday directing Sassoon, a Republican, to drop the case. He argued the mayor was needed in Trump’s immigration crackdown and echoed Adams’ claims that the case was retaliation for his criticism of Biden administration immigration policies. Instead of complying, Sassoon resigned Thursday, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington. A day earlier, she sent a letter to Trump’s new attorney general, Pam Bondi, asking her to meet and reconsider the directive to drop the case. Sassoon suggested in her letter that Ho 'appears likely to conduct a searching inquiry' as to why the case should be dismissed. She noted that in at least one instance, a judge has rejected such a request as contrary to the public interest. 'A rigorous inquiry here would be consistent with precedent and practice in this and other districts,' she wrote. Seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon’s 'commitment to integrity and the rule of law.' On Friday, Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who worked for Sassoon and had a leading role in Adams' case, became the seventh prosecutor to resign — and blasted Bove in the process. Scotten wrote in a resignation letter to Bove that it would take a 'fool' or a 'coward' to meet his demand to drop the charges, 'But it was never going to be me.' He told Bove he was 'entirely in agreement' with Sassoon’s decision. Scotten and other Adams case prosecutors were suspended with pay on Thursday by Bove, who launched a probe of the prosecutors that he said would determine whether they kept their jobs. Scotten is an Army veteran who earned two Bronze medals serving in Iraq as a Special Forces troop commander. He graduated from Harvard Law School at the top of his class in 2010 and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. In her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of offering what amounted to a 'quid pro quo' — his help on immigration in exchange for dropping the case — when they met with Justice Department officials in Washington last month. Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a 'total lie.' 'We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,' Spiro said in an email to reporters. On Friday, Adams added: 'I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never.' Scotten seconded Sassoon’s objections in his letter, writing: 'No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives.' The prosecutor, who appeared in court for various hearings in the case, said he was following 'a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake.' He said he could see how a president such as Trump, with a background in business and politics, 'might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal.' But he said any prosecutor 'would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-asks-court-to-dismiss-charges-against-nyc-mayor/7976083.html	2025-02-15T03:58:04-08:00	
Zelenskyy calls for creation of ‘Armed Forces of Europe’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the creation of a unified European military force, saying the continent must be self-reliant amid a persistent threat from Russia and uncertainty about U.S. support -- a situation he described as 'this new reality.' 'We must build the Armed Forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans and decisions about Europe are made in Europe,' Zelenskyy said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Amid concerns in Kyiv and Brussels that they could be sidelined in efforts to end Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a deal favoring Moscow, he repeated that Ukraine and Europe must be involved in any negotiations. 'Ukraine will never accept deals behind our backs without our involvement,' Zelenskyy said. 'The same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine -- no decisions about Europe without Europe.' 'We must act as Europe, not as some separate people,' Zelenskyy said. Speaking almost three years after Russia launched the full-scale invasion, he said he would 'not take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table' and said Kyiv would not agree to any ceasefire without real security guarantees. 'If not NATO membership, then conditions to build another NATO in Ukraine,' he said. He questioned the U.S. commitment to Europe, saying: 'Does America need Europe? As a market, yes, as an ally -- I don't know.' Zelenskyy's address came a day after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a 'durable, lasting peace' in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants 'security guarantees' from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war. The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers earlier this week that it's 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again. Speaking in Warsaw on Feb. 14, he again warned that America's European NATO partners would have to do far more for their own defense and to secure a future Ukraine peace. Hegseth also argued that you 'don't have to trust' President Vladimir Putin to negotiate with Russia. Two days earlier U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a 'lengthy and highly productive' phone call with Putin and said they agreed that their teams should begin negotiations immediately. Zelenskyy responded by saying he wouldn't accept any deals made without Ukraine's involvement. Asked in an interview with NBC on Feb. 14 if he believed that Ukraine would be vulnerable in another few years if a ceasefire were reached, Zelenskyy said: 'Yes, I think this can be.' He said Putin wanted to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a cease-fire deal to lift some sanctions on Russia and allow Moscow's military to regroup. 'This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire,' Zelenskyy said. Vance, who is representing Trump at the high-profile gathering of world leaders and foreign policy experts, said the United States wants 'the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.' There have been a number of 'good conversations' with Ukraine, and more would follow 'in the days, weeks and months to come,' Vance said. Zelenskyy agreed, calling the meeting with Vance 'a good conversation' and said Kyiv wants to work toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, but added that 'we need real security guarantees.' Some information for this report came from NBC News.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-calls-for-creation-of-armed-forces-of-europe-/7976068.html	2025-02-15T02:38:08-08:00	
No need for one country to control chip industry, Taiwan official says	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — There is no need for one country to control the semiconductor industry, which is complex and needs a division of labor, Taiwan's top technology official said on Saturday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the island's chip dominance. Trump repeated claims on Thursday that Taiwan had taken the industry and he wanted it back in the United States, saying he aimed to restore U.S. chip manufacturing. Wu Cheng-wen, head of Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, did not name Trump in a Facebook post but referred to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's comments on Friday that the island would be a reliable partner in the democratic supply chain of the global semiconductor industry. Wu wrote that Taiwan has in recent years often been asked how its semiconductor industry had become an internationally acclaimed benchmark. 'How did we achieve this? Obviously, we did not gain this for no reason from other countries,' he said, recounting how the government developed the sector from the 1970s, including helping found TSMC, now the world's largest contract chipmaker, in 1987. 'This shows that Taiwan has invested half a century of hard work to achieve today's success, and it certainly wasn't something taken easily from other countries.' Each country has its own specialty for chips, from Japan making chemicals and equipment to the United States, which is 'second to none' on the design and application of innovative systems, Wu said. 'The semiconductor industry is highly complex and requires precise specialization and division of labor. Given that each country has its own unique industrial strengths, there is no need for a single nation to fully control or monopolize all technologies globally.' Taiwan is willing to be used as a base to assist 'friendly democratic countries' in playing their appropriate roles in the semiconductor supply chain, Wu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-need-for-one-country-to-control-chip-industry-taiwan-official-says/7976061.html	2025-02-15T02:11:13-08:00	
Lebanon president vows punishment for attackers of UN peacekeeper	BEIRUT — Lebanese President Joseph Aoun vowed to punish the perpetrators of an attack on a United Nations peacekeeping convoy, with authorities set to hold an emergency meeting Saturday. The U.N. and Lebanese authorities have condemned Friday's attack, which came as Hezbollah supporters for a second night blocked the road to the country's only international airport over a decision barring two Iranian planes from landing there. Aoun 'emphasized that the attackers will receive their punishment' and said 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace,' according to a statement from the presidency on X. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has demanded an investigation after one of its vehicles was set on fire during the incident, which wounded Nepalese outgoing deputy force commander Chok Bahadur Dhakal as he was returning home. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam strongly condemned the 'criminal attack' and promised to arrest the perpetrators during a conversation with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and UNIFIL Commander General Aroldo Lazaro. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar has called an emergency security meeting on Saturday at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) and said he visited two injured UNIFIL officers in hospital, emphasizing 'the Lebanese government's rejection of this attack.' The presidency's statement said Aoun had also checked on the deputy commander's condition and emphasized that the incident 'cannot be allowed to be repeated.' Aoun also 'followed up on developments regarding roadblocks, setting fires and riots, and issued directives to the army and security forces to put a stop to these practices,' the statement said, adding that the judiciary 'has begun investigations on the ground.' There was no immediate official comment from Hezbollah. However, the group's ally the Amal movement, led by powerful parliament speaker Nabih Berri, said 'the attack on UNIFIL is an attack on south Lebanon' and that 'blocking roads anywhere is an assault on civil peace.' 'Absolutely unacceptable' The army said Friday that several areas around the airport had seen 'demonstrations marked by acts of vandalism and clashes, including assaults on members of the armed forces and attacks against vehicles.' Videos circulating on social media showed demonstrators, some hooded and carrying Hezbollah flags, attacking a man in military garb and another in civilian clothes near the torched UNIFIL vehicle. U.N. chief Antonio Guterres condemned the incident, a spokesperson said Friday. 'Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable ... The safety and security of UN personnel and property must be respected at all times,' the statement from spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. 'Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law ... and may constitute war crimes,' the statement said, adding that 'UNIFIL must be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Lebanon in the implementation of its mandated activities.' Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using Beirut airport to transfer weapons from Iran, claims Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have repeatedly denied. The Iran-backed group has a large popular base in Lebanon, though a year of hostilities with Israel and the ousting of the group's ally Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria have left it weakened. Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Thursday it had 'temporarily rescheduled' some flights, including from Iran, until Feb. 18 as it was implementing 'additional security measures.' The date coincides with the deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon and for Hezbollah to vacate positions there, under a ceasefire deal that began on Nov. 27.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-president-vows-punishment-for-attackers-of-un-peacekeeper/7976054.html	2025-02-15T01:57:07-08:00	
Ukraine would have ‘low chance to survive’ without US support, Zelenskyy says	Ukraine would have a 'very, very difficult' time surviving without U.S. military support to fend off Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a interview broadcast the night before he is scheduled to address the Munich Security Conference. 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, you know in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,' he told NBC News. 'But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.' Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has increased its war production but not enough to make up for what it would lose if it did not have U.S. backing. Zelenskyy on Feb. 14 took part in a day of meetings and news briefings at the Munich Security Conference as efforts to seek a resolution to the war ramp up. The Ukrainian president is scheduled to deliver a speech on diplomacy and prospects for Ukraine's future at the conference on Feb. 15. He will take the spotlight after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a 'durable, lasting peace' in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants 'security guarantees' from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war. Zelenskyy said in the interview that he doesn’t want to think about Ukraine not being a strategic partner of the United States because it would damage Ukrainian morale, but added, 'We have to think about it.' The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers earlier this week that it's 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict.

China, Cook Islands sign strategic partnership pact	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China and the Cook Islands on Friday signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, but the lack of transparency around the details has alarmed New Zealand, the South Pacific state’s closest democratic ally. While details of the agreement remain unclear, public statements from Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown and the islands’ Seabed Minerals Authority signaled that the Cook Islands and China would look to deepen cooperation in areas such as deep-sea mining, infrastructure enhancement, climate resilience, and economic cooperation. The signing of the agreement is part of Brown’s seven-day diplomatic tour to China, during which he visited several Chinese research institutions and met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in the northern city of Harbin. Li said Beijing is willing to 'deepen political mutual trust and expand practical cooperation with the Cook Islands,' while Brown said his country will 'strengthen multilateral coordination on climate change and in other areas, and push for the sustained, in-depth development of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership.' Analysts say the agreement is Beijing’s latest effort to increase its influence in the Pacific region amid growing tension between some Pacific countries, including the Cook Islands and Kiribati, and such democratic allies as New Zealand and Australia. 'China benefits from friction between longstanding partnerships in the Pacific as it seeks to position itself as an alternative partner,' said Anna Powles, an associate professor in security studies at Massey University in New Zealand. New Zealand has expressed serious concerns about the deal between the Cook Islands and China, criticizing the South Pacific country for lack of transparency and consultation with Wellington over the details. The Cook Islands has a free association agreement with New Zealand, which allows it to manage its foreign affairs while requiring it to consult Wellington on issues related to foreign policy. 'Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, matters of defense and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,' New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference Monday. Despite New Zealand’s concerns, Brown has characterized conversations around the deal as 'guided by what is best for the Cook Islands' and said 'there is no need' for Wellington to get involved in the negotiation of the agreement with China. Meanwhile, China said its relationship with the Cook Islands 'does not target any third party, and should not be disrupted or restrained by any third party.' In addition to the lack of transparency and consultation, some experts say the China-Cook Islands agreement could also contain 'dual civil-military use technology and infrastructure.' 'This directly affects New Zealand and Cook Islands’ security and defense,' Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in by email. Tensions between Kiribati and democratic allies Tension is also rising between New Zealand and Kiribati, another South Pacific state. After failing to secure a meeting with Kiribati President Taneti Maamau in January, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wellington would review development funding to Kiribati following the diplomatic snub. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree on joint priorities for our development program and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' Peters’ office said in a statement issued late last month. In addition to Peters, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles did not secure a meeting with Maamau during a trip to Kiribati last month, but he stuck with the original plan by delivering a patrol boat to the Pacific Island country. Powles in New Zealand said Maamau’s decision not to meet with Peters and Marles may reflect a shift in Kiribati’s diplomatic focus. 'Kiribati’s primary bilateral relationships appear to be Fiji, Nauru, and China, and the lack of engagement with partners such as New Zealand reflects this,' she told VOA by email. Other experts say that while Kiribati and the Cook Islands are not necessarily looking to abandon their partnership with New Zealand, China will be looking to 'capitalize' on recent events. 'China would seek to undermine those relationships and say ‘the West is paternalistic and colonialist and doesn’t genuinely have your interests at heart as China does,’' Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told VOA by phone. Beijing’s attempts to increase diplomatic efforts in the Pacific also come as the United States freezes funding for foreign aid and New Zealand threatens to review development funding for Kiribati. Since most Pacific Island countries rely heavily on foreign aid, Johnson said a potential lack of funding from democratic allies could force countries in the Pacific region to seek support from China. 'China can be responsive when it wants to fill those [funding] gaps,' he said. To counter China’s attempt to increase diplomatic presence in the Pacific region, Parker Novak, a nonresident fellow at the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said democratic countries, including Australia and the United States, should continue to provide support to Pacific Island countries. Australia, the U.S., and other like-minded countries should continue 'to foster positive, consultative relationships that help Pacific Island countries meet their development needs and provide a credible alternative to PRC inducements,' he told VOA by email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cook-islands-sign-strategic-partnership-pact/7976033.html	2025-02-14T23:51:09-08:00	
Research finds ancient Egyptian mummies smell nice	LONDON — At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: Sniff the essence of an ancient corpse. But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good. 'In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,' said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. 'We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.' 'Woody,' 'spicy' and 'sweet' were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy-sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming. The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report's authors. Archaeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject — for good reason. Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process that used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility, and pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities, while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay. Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms. 'We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn't the case,' said Matija Strlic, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. 'We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum is actually quite good in terms of preservation.' Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies 'tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,' Strlic said. 'We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.' Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany, who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations. 'However, the research also underscores a key challenge: The smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,' Huber said. 'Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.' Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as 'Scent of Eternity,' for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark. Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop 'smellscapes' to artificially re-create the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers. 'Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,' Bembibre said. 'Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don't get to smell them. We don't get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/research-finds-ancient-egyptian-mummies-smell-nice/7975974.html	2025-02-14T22:54:04-08:00	
Why is Trump pausing US anti-bribery law?	washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week pausing almost all enforcement of a decades-old U.S. anti-bribery law. The law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, makes it illegal for both U.S. firms and foreign companies with a U.S. connection to bribe foreign officials. Transparency advocates have credited the U.S. Justice Department's vigorous enforcement of the law over the past two decades with curbing foreign corruption. Critics, including business leaders, however, have long complained that the law puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in international markets where certain business practices are common. Trump, a longtime critic of the FCPA, voiced those concerns during the Oval Office signing ceremony on Monday. 'It sounds good on paper, but in practicality it's a disaster,' Trump said. 'It means that if an American goes to a foreign country and starts doing business there legally, legitimately or otherwise, it's almost a guaranteed investigation, indictment, and nobody wants to do business with the Americans because of it.' Here is a breakdown of the law and the implications of the executive order for foreign bribery and U.S. business. What is the FCPA? The FCPA is a U.S. law that prohibits companies from providing cash payments or valuable gifts to foreign officials for business advantages. While the law exempts certain 'facilitation payments,' it prohibits the use of third parties to make bribes. The FCPA was enacted in 1977 following post-Watergate investigations that revealed widespread foreign bribery by U.S.-based multinational corporations. Congress, concerned about the impact on U.S. foreign policy and international standing, responded by criminalizing such practices, imposing prison terms and substantial penalties on violators. Though initially focused on American companies, the law's jurisdiction has expanded substantially. It now extends to any foreign business or individual with connections to the U.S. This broad reach enables prosecutors to pursue cases against foreign firms — for example, a Dutch company with a subsidiary based in Ohio accused of paying off Chinese officials through another subsidiary in Thailand. The law has had a significant impact on the development of anti-corruption laws around the world. In 1997, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used the FCPA as a model for its Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 member countries. While enforcement of FCPA was negligible in the decades following its enactment, the early 2000s marked a significant shift. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two agencies responsible for enforcing FCPA’s provisions, ramped up enforcement, driven in part by emerging business scandals and new congressional requirements for corporate governance and financial reporting. How has the law been used in recent years? In recent years, U.S. foreign bribery law enforcement has been robust, with the Justice Department and the SEC opening nearly 174 investigations between 2018 and 2021. Last year, the Justice Department alone filed 17 enforcement actions under the law. Latin America has emerged as a particular hot spot for U.S. investigators in recent years. In 2016, two Brazilian companies agreed to pay a combined $3.5 billion after pleading guilty in a sprawling international foreign bribery case. U.S. authorities investigated the case in part because the illicit payments were made through U.S. bank accounts. In 2020, Airbus SE, the European aircraft maker, agreed to pay nearly $4 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges brought in the U.S., Britain and France. Airbus admitted using intermediaries to bribe government officials and airline executives to win lucrative contracts in China and other countries. In January 2024, SAP SE, a German software company with offices in the U.S., agreed to pay $220 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to South African and Indonesia officials. In December, AAR Corp., an Illinois-based aviation services company, agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to government officials in Nepal and South Africa. Several cases have involved India. In November, prosecutors charged three former employees of a Canadian institutional investor in connection with a bribery scheme involving Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and two other executives. Why is Trump pausing FCPA enforcement? Trump, a real estate tycoon-turned-president, has been a vocal critic of the law since well before his first term. In 2012, he called it a 'horrible' and 'ridiculous' statute that impeded U.S. companies’ ability to do business abroad. Despite his criticism, FCPA enforcement actually surged during his first term in office, with 2000 marking a record-breaking year, according to the Morrison Foerster law firm. The executive order frames the pause in enforcement as part of the president's broader agenda to 'advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad.' The order says the FCPA's scope has been 'stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States.' A White House fact sheet on the order released Monday says the 'overenforcement' of the law harms U.S. companies and 'infringes on the President's Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs.' This concern about aggressive enforcement isn't new, said Mike Koehler, a law professor and leading authority on the FCPA, who noted that both Republicans and Democrats have raised similar issues over the past two decades. 'There has been a focus on the quantity of enforcement actions compared to the quality of those enforcement actions,' Koehler told VOA. 'Enforcement has in many cases has gone so far off the rails that this law is being enforced in ways that do put companies at a competitive disadvantage.' Transparency advocates, however, warn that suspending enforcement could deal a significant blow to global anti-bribery efforts. 'This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business actors around the world who until now feared U.S. criminal pursuits,' Transparency International said in a statement calling on other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members to increase their enforcement following the U.S. shift in policy. What are the implications for investigating foreign bribery? The executive order imposes a six-month freeze on foreign bribery investigations by the Justice Department. Almost all FCPA cases will be suspended while Attorney General Pam Bondi conducts a review and revises enforcement guidelines. The executive order gives Bondi discretion to extend the pause for an additional six months. Bondi, however, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize FCPA cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations. And corporate lawyers were quick to caution clients that the executive order doesn't give them free rein. 'Bribery is still illegal,' attorneys at the Arnold & Porter law firm wrote in an analysis of the executive order. 'The FCPA remains on the books; Congress has not repealed it. And many other state, federal and foreign laws still prohibit bribery.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-is-trump-pausing-us-anti-bribery-law-/7976000.html	2025-02-14T22:52:12-08:00	
Goodyear Blimp at 100: 'Floating piece of Americana' still thrives	DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA — Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd. Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it's nostalgic. For others, it's a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon. At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday — roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually — to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour. Even though remote camera technologies — drones, mostly — are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2½-mile super speedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event. 'It's great to show the pack racing,' Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday's race. The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It's been at every Daytona 500 since 1962. During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers. Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn't much different than traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph — well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track. 'It's an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,' blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. 'There's nothing like it in the world.' The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp's street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled 'It Was A Good Day.' But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only, even though phones at blimp headquarters — the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio — ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride. As part of the blimp's 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear's airship hangars. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt. The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps. Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania. But will the blimp survive another 100 years? Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers. But given the blimp's longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come. 'Despite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,' Kervern said. 'It's just an iconic symbol for our nation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/goodyear-blimp-at-100-floating-piece-of-americana-still-thrives-/7974664.html	2025-02-14T22:51:25-08:00	
With doors closed to the US, asylum-seekers turn a new life in Mexico	MEXICO CITY — When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. 'Like almost all Cubans, our objective was to go to the United States,' she said. 'It wasn't in our plans to stay, but now we have to face reality.' Amid a clampdown on asylum under Trump and tightening restrictions in recent years under the Biden administration, Delgado is among a growing number of migrants from across the world to ditch — or at least pause — their ambitions of reaching the U.S., and focus instead on building a life in Mexico. Migrants trying to apply for asylum in Mexico in January more than tripled compared to the monthly average from the previous year, according to an international official with knowledge of the numbers who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Mexico's refugee agency has not yet published figures for January. 'All of these policies Trump is pushing are leading more people to seek international protection in Mexico,' said Andrés Ramírez, former director of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Aid, which processes asylum cases. Delgado was among hundreds of migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan and other countries gathering outside the refugee agency in Mexico City after Trump unleashed executive orders last month meant to slash access to asylum and militarize the border. The Associated Press spoke to around a half-dozen people who had asylum appointments in the U.S. through the Biden-era app, CBP One, that Trump canceled on Inauguration Day. They were left stranded on the Mexican side of the border, their dreams of a legal pathway into the U.S. snuffed. Many more said they now intended to seek asylum in Mexico, citing increasingly harsh restrictions in recent years in the U.S. or what they said was anti-immigrant sentiment there. 'Now, it's the Mexican dream,' said a Mexican man helping Haitian friends try to get an appointment this month to apply for asylum in Mexico following the Trump executive orders. Delgado, her partner and many others had put their hopes on pathways opened by the Biden administration to legally seek asylum in the U.S. They said they had no intention of hiring a smuggler to enter the U.S. illegally. They said the risks of returning to Cuba were too great following a government clampdown on protests in recent years. 'Crossing illegally isn't an option for us. We'd rather stay here' in Mexico, Delgado said, adding that if they crossed illegally into the U.S. and were caught 'they'll deport us and they'll send us back to Cuba.' Delgado, who is an architect, and her partner, a doctor, aren't able to work in their fields in Mexico because their training in Cuba is not recognized there, she said. So for now she's washing dishes in a market. Mexico has long opened its doors to refugees and exiles, but asylum applications have soared in recent years, growing from 1,295 in 2013 to a record 140,982 in 2023. That number dipped to 78,975 in 2024, as the CBP One app allowed migrants in southern Mexico to apply for appointments for entry into the U.S. before heading to the northern border. The rise in petitions for asylum in Mexico may not result in an immediate uptick in refugees there as only a couple hundred applications can be processed each day, fueling criticism about Mexico's capacity to take on the burgeoning asylum demand. Amid criticisms over the backlog, President Claudia Sheinbaum has sharply boosted funding for Mexican agencies handling migration and asylum. Venezuelan asylum-seeker Harry Luzardo, 37, said life in Mexico is an improvement after scrambling for years to scrape by in Ecuador and Chile. Ecuador, Chile, Peru and Colombia were once the epicenter of the exodus of 8 million people from Venezuela, fleeing spiraling economic and political crises. But with little international aid and an array of their own economic and security crises, Chile was among countries that began closing their doors to migrants. 'In Chile, you don't receive any kind of support,' Luzardo said, waiting patiently in line earlier this month to make an asylum petition request in Mexico City. 'In Chile, there's nothing for migrants.' Luzardo left Venezuela four years ago, but unable to get legal status to stay and work in Chile, he decided he'd try his luck at reuniting with family in the U.S. Now, with that door closed, Mexico is his plan B. 'For now, I feel good here,' he said. Still, he conceded, he'd rather be in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-doors-closed-to-the-us-asylum-seekers-turn-a-new-life-in-mexico/7974697.html	2025-02-14T22:50:35-08:00

Southern California slammed with debris flows, mudslides	After days of heavy rain, the strongest storm of the year brought dangerous debris flows and rock- and mudslides across Southern California on Friday, including in several areas that last month were ablaze with devastating fires. Some areas in the region received as much as 12 centimeters of rain this week, the National Weather Service said. 'There are plenty of reports of debris flow,' meteorologist Scott Kleebauer of the weather service said Friday. The scorched earth left behind by the fires is now particularly vulnerable to the water-fueled rock- and mudslides, as the vegetation that once anchored the soil was burned away. While this week’s rain is beginning to ease, that does not mean the slides will stop. The drenched soil can continue to move even after the rain subsides. Parts of the iconic Pacific Coast Highway were shut down Thursday because of flooding and mudslides. In Pacific Palisades, a highway intersection was under a meter of sludge. Photographs posted on social media showed parked cars in Pacific Palisades covered in mud up to their windows. Bulldozers have been assigned to the area to clean up the muck. In one harrowing experience Thursday, a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was driving along the Pacific Coast Highway when a debris flow swept his vehicle into the ocean. Erik Scott, a spokesperson for the fire department, said the driver was able to get out of his vehicle and reportedly suffered only minor injuries. In Sierra Madre, a city of 10,000 that was the site of last month’s Eaton Fire, a boulder-strewn mudslide damaged several homes. 'It happened very quickly but it was very loud, and you could even hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,' Bull Duvall, who has lived in Sierra Madre for 28 years, told The Associated Press. City officials issued an evacuation order warning residents that emergency responders would not enter locations with active mud and debris flows. The National Weather Service confirmed Friday that a weak tornado hit a mobile home community Thursday in Oxnard, California. There were no reports of deaths or injuries at Country Club Mobile Estates, but property damage included ripped roofs and downed power lines. The rain was badly needed in the region, much of which is still suffering from drought. In nearby Nevada, Las Vegas was glad to see rain Thursday, after enduring more than 200 days without precipitation. A National Weather Service Las Vegas post said, 'Las Vegas has officially measured 0.01 inch of rainfall this morning, effectively ending our dry streak of 214 days without measurable rain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-california-slammed-with-debris-flows-mudslides/7975988.html	2025-02-14T18:42:01-08:00	
US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama	PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the Trump administration takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 'Yesterday a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,' President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly press briefing. He said there were migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries, aboard. The president said it was the first of three planned flights that were expected to total about 360 people. 'It's not something massive,' he said. The migrants were expected to be moved to a shelter in Panama's Darien region before being returned to their countries, Mulino said. Asked later Thursday why Panama was acting as a stopover for these deportations, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Ruiz Hernandez said that it was something the U.S. government had requested. He also said the U.S. government was paying for the repatriations through U.N. immigration agencies. The migrants who arrived Wednesday had been detained after crossing the U.S. border and did not have criminal records, he said. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in Panama. While U.S. President Donald Trump's demands to retake control of the Panama Canal dominated the visit, Mulino also discussed Panama's efforts to slow migration through the Darien Gap and he offered Panama as a bridge to send U.S. deportees back to their countries. Rubio secured agreements on the trip with Guatemala and El Salvador as well, to accept migrants from other nations in what was seen as the laying groundwork for expanding U.S. capacity to speedily deport migrants. Migration through the Darien Gap connecting Panama and Colombia was down about 90% in January compared to the same month a year earlier. Since Mulino entered office last year, Panama has made dozens of deportation flights, most funded by the U.S. government. Ruiz said Thursday that Panama 'has been completely willing to participate and cooperate in this request they have made of us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deports-119-migrants-from-several-nations-to-panama-/7975954.html	2025-02-14T18:00:59-08:00

Helicopter crew might not have heard tower's instructions before crash, say investigators	WASHINGTON — The crew of the Army helicopter that collided in midair with an American Airlines jet near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and also may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers to move behind the plane, investigators said Friday. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew without an understanding of how it should shift position just before the January 29 crash, in which all 67 aboard the two aircraft were killed. 'That transmission was interrupted — it was stepped on,' she said, leaving them unable to hear the words 'pass behind the' because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment. The helicopter pilots also may have missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different runway, she said. Homendy said the helicopter was on a check flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being investigated. 'We're only a couple weeks out' from the crash, she said. 'We have a lot of work to do.' The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground. William Waldock, professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said stepped-on transmissions — where a pressed microphone key blocks incoming communication — is a well-known problem in aviation. 'It's an old story and it's one of the problems oftentimes with radio communications,' he said. The collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet, investigators have said, which would put the Black Hawk above its 200-foot limit for that location. Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, Homendy said, with the helicopter's pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot saying it was 400 feet, Homendy said. 'We are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,' she said. That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters – one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter's black box captures its radio altitude. The radio altitude at the time of the impact put the Black Hawk at 278 feet, Homendy said. 'But I want to caution, that does not mean that's what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,' she said. Waldock said the helicopter pilots, with their night vision goggles interfering with their peripheral vision, may have wrongly focused on a plane that took off just before the collision. 'If they did indeed lock onto that departing airplane and assume that's the traffic they were supposed to be avoiding, they didn't see the other airplane coming,' he said. The Army has said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and accustomed to the crowded skies around the nation's capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/helicopter-crew-might-not-have-heard-tower-s-instructions-before-crash-say-investigators/7975930.html	2025-02-14T16:39:19-08:00	
Intelligence agencies close in on Islamic State caliph	WASHINGTON — A growing number of countries think they have unmasked the man running the Islamic State terror group’s global operations. A report issued this week by the United Nations Sanctions Monitoring Team, based on U.N. member state intelligence, said there is 'growing confidence' that the IS caliph is Abdul Qadir Mumin, who also heads the terror group’s branch in Somalia. The importance of Mumin to IS’s global operations has not been in doubt. Previous U.N. intelligence reports suggested he had been elevated to lead the Islamic State's general directorate of provinces, essentially giving him control over the group’s African affiliates. But by late last year, officials with U.S. Africa Command told VOA they assessed reports that Mumin was the group’s emir to be credible. That assessment seems to be gaining traction, with many U.N. member states agreeing that IS is trying to adapt to realities on the ground in Iraq and Syria that make moving key officials and functions elsewhere advantageous. 'It may signify a deliberate pivot toward a more decentralized operational structure, further from the core conflict zone,' the report said. Not all countries that contributed intelligence for the report are in agreement. Some remain unconvinced that the terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh, would readily forsake its core territory in Iraq and Syria. Others question whether IS would allow itself to be led by someone who cannot credibly claim to be descended from the Prophet Muhammad, a criterion applied to past leaders. Survival, however, may be more important. Since the deaths of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 and his successor in 2022, the terror group has sought to protect its leaders by hiding their identity and by minimizing public appearances. The group has publicly referred to its current leader only by his nom de guerre, as Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, which signifies he has the required lineage. 'Maybe they have now got so used to the fact that the emir, or the caliph, is never seen or heard,' said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former U.N. counterterrorism official who is a senior adviser for the Counter Extremism Project. 'Maybe they say Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi is the name we are giving to the caliph,' Fitton-Brown told VOA. 'Nobody will ever know that he's Somali. Nobody will ever hear an African accent. Nobody will ever see an African person.' Already, Abu Hafs has outlasted his direct predecessor, who died after ruling for about six months. And if Abu Hafs is Somalia’s Mumin, he also has managed to survive at least one attempt on his life — a U.S. airstrike in May 2024. This week’s report from the U.N. said that since that strike, Mumin has 'taken measures to limit the group’s exposure to unnecessary external attention.' It also described Mumin’s base of operations, Buur Dhexaad, as a series of caves and defensive structures in the Cal Miskaad range of Somalia’s Golis Mountains, which are thought to provide protection from Western airstrikes. That assumption is being put to the test as Buur Dhexaad appears to be the same area targeted by a new round of U.S. airstrikes earlier this month. U.S. officials said those strikes successfully killed Ahmed Maeleninine, a key external operations leader, and 13 IS operatives. IS-Somalia The U.N. report warned that IS-Somalia, under Mumin’s leadership, has continued to gain influence while strengthening its finances. Intelligence shared from member states indicated IS-Somalia expanded its extortion activities in parts of Somalia under its control and has, in turn, invested the money in improving its military capabilities, including unmanned drones for surveillance and suicide attacks. But the affiliate, which saw its forces surge thanks to an influx of foreign fighters, has seen its growth slow of late. The report said IS-Somalia saw a spike in defections due to 'difficulties in integrating fighters into narrow clan-based structures, cultural barriers and the severity of conditions.' Efforts to intercept would-be foreign fighters before they can reach Somalia also have taken a toll. Syria and Iraq Key members of IS’s leadership may be seeking refuge in Somalia, but there are no indications the terror group has given up its designs on retaking territory in Syria and Iraq. The U.N. report said the terror group still maintains about 1,500 to 3,000 fighters across the two countries, with most operating out of Syria. There are also indications that IS has found ways to take advantage of the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this past December. Some U.N. member states’ intelligence agencies said some IS operatives leaped into action even as the lead Syrian insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched its assault on the Assad regime. One IS operative, they said, infiltrated the al-Hol displaced-persons camp in northeastern Syria and sneaked out experienced IS fighters by replacing them with teenage boys. The same operative is thought to have reactivated an IS brigade at al-Hol 'tasked with intelligence-gathering, training young people for operations, recruiting and managing funds.' Additionally, the report warned of IS launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. IS in Iraq has been weakened by Iraqi counterterrorism pressure, including an operation in August that killed the group’s deputy wali (governor) and 13 other leaders. But the U.N. report said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Afghanistan presence U.N. member states continue to raise concerns about the IS affiliate in Afghanistan, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. The report called IS-Khorasan 'the most serious threat' to Afghanistan, noting the group’s ability to infiltrate the country’s Taliban rulers and exploit dissatisfaction, especially among poppy farmers and ethnic Tajiks, with the Taliban’s rule. U.N. member states assessed IS has about 4,000 to 6,000 operatives across Afghanistan, and that it is also building capabilities while seeking to bring in more fighters from Central Asia. To make the journey easier, IS-Khorasan set up smuggling routes into Afghanistan through Turkey and through Iran, according to the report. The report noted the ability of IS-Khorasan to reach into Europe and recruit minors. 'The increasing frequency of foiled plots underscored the group’s determination and capacity to conduct attacks of high lethality on European soil, primarily against soft targets and large crowds,' it said. Harun Maruf, Mohamed Olad Hassan and Carla Babb contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/intelligence-agencies-close-in-on-islamic-state-caliph-/7975753.html	2025-02-14T16:03:38-08:00	
Whale swallows, then releases kayaker in Chilean Patagonia	PUNTA ARENAS, CHILE — A humpback whale briefly swallowed a kayaker off Chilean Patagonia before quickly releasing him unharmed. The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral. Last Saturday, Adrian Simancas was kayaking with his father, Dell, in Bahia El Aguila near the San Isidro Lighthouse in the Strait of Magellan when a humpback whale surfaced, engulfing Adrian and his yellow kayak for a few seconds before letting him go. Dell, just meters away, captured the moment on video. 'Stay calm, stay calm,' he can be heard saying after his son was released from the whale's mouth. 'I thought I was dead,' Adrian told The Associated Press. 'I thought it had eaten me, that it had swallowed me.' He described the 'terror' of those few seconds and explained that his real fear set in only after resurfacing, fearing that the huge animal would hurt his father or that he would perish in the frigid waters. Despite the terrifying experience, Dell remained focused, filming and reassuring his son while grappling with his own worry. 'When I came up and started floating, I was scared that something might happen to my father, too, that we wouldn't reach the shore in time, or that I would get hypothermia,' Adrian said. After a few seconds in the water, Adrian managed to reach his father's kayak and was quickly assisted. Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured. Located about 3,000 kilometers (1,600 miles) south of Santiago, Chile's capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction in the Chilean Patagonia, known for adventure activities. Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways. Although it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) and highs rarely exceeding 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and strandings have become a recurring issue in the last decade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/whale-swallows-then-releases-kayaker-in-chilean-patagonia-/7975746.html	2025-02-14T15:48:35-08:00	
Argentina court issues international arrest warrant for Myanmar military leader	washington — A court in Argentina has issued an international arrest warrant for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar’s military, for his role in the 2017 genocide against the Rohingya. The court’s decision, announced Thursday, also lists two civilian leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and 22 other military officials. Min Aung Hlaing, who leads Myanmar's military junta after seizing power in a 2021 coup, is at the center of the warrants issued by the court in Buenos Aires. The charges against him include aggravated murder, torture and sexual violence linked to the military’s brutal crackdown on the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, located in western Myanmar bordering with Bangladesh. The Myanmar junta has yet to officially respond to the warrants from the Argentine court. However, in response to VOA's inquiry, junta spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun dismissed Argentina’s legal authority over Myanmar. 'Does Argentina even know Myanmar? The Myanmar government knows Argentina. If Argentina wants to legally criticize Myanmar, it must have judicial authority in the country. I suggest you focus on filling your own vacant judicial positions first,' the spokesperson said in response to a VOA inquiry on the junta’s Viber press group. Since the case was filed in 2019 under the principle of universal jurisdiction, the junta has consistently rejected Argentina’s involvement, maintaining that foreign courts have no authority to prosecute Myanmar’s leaders over the Rohingya issue. The principle of universal jurisdiction allows national courts to prosecute individuals for serious crimes that violate international law. Legal efforts, court decision The Burmese Rohingya Organisation U.K. (BROUK), which filed the initial complaint in 2019, praised the court's ruling as a victory for justice. 'This is a victory for the Rohingya and for international justice,' said Tun Khin, president of BROUK, according to a Friday press statement. 'It shows that no one is above the law, not even the military leaders who have committed genocide.' In 2017, Myanmar’s army launched a brutal offensive against the Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine State, which is located on the country’s western coast off the Bay of Bengal. The offensive followed attacks on police outposts by insurgent groups. The military’s response involved mass killings, sexual violence and widespread destruction of villages, forcing more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The United Nations and human rights organizations have described the military’s actions as a genocide. Late last year, the International Criminal Court also issued an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity. While the warrant from Argentina for Min Aung Hlaing is a major development, the court's decision on other leaders has sparked debate. In December 2023, BROUK requested arrest warrants for military officials only, presenting evidence related to their roles in the genocide. No evidence was submitted for Aung San Suu Kyi, who served as state counselor and de facto leader of Myanmar during the 2017 military offensive against the Rohingya, or for former civilian President Htin Kyaw. However, in June 2024, the Argentine prosecutor included them in his request. BROUK then asked the court to reconsider issuing warrants for these civilians, given Burma's political context, but the court dismissed the request. Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned since the military took power in the 2021 coup. Implications of warrant Tomas Quintana, an Argentinian human rights lawyer and former U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar and a key figure in the case, explained the court's stance. 'We felt that at this stage in the investigation, it was not appropriate to seek arrest warrants for civilian leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi,' he told VOA’s Burmese Service in an exclusive interview. 'But the court sided with the prosecutor, deciding to include civilians in the warrants.' Quintana said the ruling was based on legal strategy and evidence available at the time. Aung San Suu Kyi’s role in the genocide is still under investigation by the Argentine court. While the court initially focused on the direct perpetrators of the violence — the military leaders, including Min Aung Hlaing — it later sided with prosecutors to explore the civilian leaders’ responsibility as well. 'This decision marks a shift in international accountability,' Quintana said. 'It is the first time Burma [Myanmar] has been held accountable in a court of law for crimes against the Rohingya.' The investigation, which has spanned four years, was supported by survivor testimonies and documentation from the United Nations Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. The Argentine court’s decision is expected to lead to an Interpol 'red notice,' which would request the detention of Min Aung Hlaing and other Myanmar military leaders worldwide. While the arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing is a significant step, Quintana said there are still challenges ahead. 'Myanmar’s military regime controls the country, so executing these warrants remains difficult,' he said. He called for international cooperation to ensure that officials were held accountable. 'The United Nations and the global community must work together to enforce these decisions.' Despite the setback in including Aung San Suu Kyi in the arrest warrant, the warrants are a powerful symbolic ruling for the Rohingya people, Quintana said, adding that it is also a crucial step in the long process of justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-court-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-myanmar-military-leader/7975748.html	2025-02-14T15:38:01-08:00	
M23 rebels advance into eastern DRC's 2nd major city of Bukavu, residents say	GOMA, CONGO — M23 rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo entered the region’s second-largest city of Bukavu on Friday, local and civil society leaders said, the latest ground gained since a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces. The M23 rebels entered the city's Kazingu and Bagira zone and were advancing toward the center of the city of about 1.3 million people, according to Jean Samy, vice president of the civil society in South Kivu. He reported gunfire in parts of the city. Videos posted online appeared to show rebels marching toward the Bagira area. In one of the videos, a voice in the background shouted: 'They are there ... there are many of them.' Hours earlier, the rebels had claimed to have seized a second airport in the region following a dayslong advance, while the U.N. warned that the recent escalation of fighting with government forces has left 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter. Local sources said M23 rebels surrounded the area around Kavumu national airport. They also recounted seeing scores of soldiers fleeing the town as the fighting raged on. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm who was in control of the airport, which is located about 30 kilometers from the city of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. Government officials and civil society leaders did not immediately comment. Kavumu airport became a target after the M23 rebels seized the region’s largest city of Goma, including the international airport there, in late January. Goma is a critical trade and humanitarian hub that hosted many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced in the conflict, the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on social media platform X that the rebels took over Kavumu airport and its surroundings to 'eliminate the threat at the source.' 'The airport posed a danger to the civilian population,' he said. Congo's Communication Ministry issued a statement criticizing the rebels for violating a ceasefire that regional leaders have called for. The rebels were 'imposing an urban war by attacking the positions of the FARDC [Congolese military], who are keen to avoid bloodshed in Bukavu,' the ministry said. The crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC, continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict. Several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-advance-into-eastern-drc-s-2nd-major-city-of-bukavu-residents-say-/7975711.html	2025-02-14T15:10:14-08:00	
At Munich conference, Vance warns European allies of ‘threat from within’	U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned European leaders at the security conference in Munich, Germany, of the 'threat from within,' arguing that their governments are censoring far-right speech and failing to control migration.

New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail	NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations. The Democrat said ICE agents would be focused on assisting the corrections department's intelligence bureau in criminal investigations, particularly those focused on violent criminals and gangs. 'As I have always said, immigrants have been crucial in building our city and will continue to be key to our future success, but we must fix our long-broken immigration system,' Adams said in a statement. 'That is why I have been clear that I want to work with the new federal administration, not war with them, to find common ground and make better the lives of New Yorkers.' Opponents dismissed the move as a 'needless concession' and 'legally dubious.' 'ICE's presence on Rikers serves no legitimate purpose and opens the door to unlawful collusion between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials in violation of our city's well-established sanctuary protections,' Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. Trump's border czar, Thomas Homan, argued that having an ICE presence at local jails is crucial to removing violent criminals who have entered the country illegally. 'For the naysayers, the city council who wants nothing to do with ICE, they need to understand: If we arrest the bad guy at Rikers Island, then the alien's safe, the officer's safe, the community's safe,' he said in an interview with NewsMax after the meeting. Troubled relationship Homan met with Adams at a federal office building in Manhattan as the Republican administration pushes for more help detaining and deporting people accused of crimes. ICE has long had a contentious relationship with New York, which has rules and laws limiting police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Immigration officials, for example, aren't able to request that city jails hold people wanted for civil immigration law violations past when they would ordinarily be released from custody, under city policy. New York City also has passed measures that curtail ICE's access to public schools and other city properties. Adams, who faces a Democratic primary in June, has said he favors loosening these so-called sanctuary policies, but he doesn't have the broad power to do so as mayor. Adams said he talked with Homan about ways to embed more New York police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and criminal activity, as well as allowing ICE agents to participate in regular meetings with law enforcement agencies in the city. 'We walked away with some real tangible things we can do together, and I'm looking forward to aligning with him and other federal partners to remove dangerous people from our streets,' he said in a radio show interview after the meeting. Mayor under pressure The Democrat is under unique pressure to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to dismiss corruption charges against Adams so he could focus on assisting the president's immigration agenda. As of Thursday, the criminal charges remained in place. If the case is ultimately dropped, the Justice Department says it will conduct a review after the November mayoral election to assess whether it should be reinstated. Immigration advocates worry Adams might feel pressure from the Trump administration to disregard or rescind some of the city's sanctuary protections, which come from a patchwork of state and city laws and mayoral executive orders, some stretching back decades. Adams has already ordered city officials to lawfully cooperate with Trump's agenda around immigration and other issues, though the administration's instructions have sparked confusion among some city workers and contractors. Adams confirmed later that he also discussed with Homan restoring more than $80 million meant to defray the city's costs for sheltering homeless migrants that the Federal Emergency Management Agency unexpectedly clawed back Wednesday. 'I'm not happy about losing $80 million, and we had a conversation on that,' he said during a local television interview. The Adams administration has leased several hotels and vacant buildings and repurposed them as migrant shelters as the city has tried to house an estimated 230,000 people who have arrived from the U.S. southern border in recent years. Adams reflects on challenges In a local radio interview after the meeting, Adams also reflected on the week's turn of events with a mix of relief and defiance. 'I did nothing wrong. No American should endure what I had to endure,' he said on WABC, referring to the 'humiliation and embarrassment' of the monthslong federal corruption probe. As he gears up for a bruising primary fight, Adams said he wants New Yorkers to see his resiliency. 'We've all gone through some hard times,' he said. 'No matter what you're going through, have faith in yourself, faith in God, faith in your family, faith in your country, and you will navigate through it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-mayor-to-allow-ice-agents-at-rikers-jail-/7975704.html	2025-02-14T14:56:04-08:00	
HHS to lose thousands of workers under probationary job cuts	U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday under the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting. In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might be spared. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, according to audio shared with The Associated Press. Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — roughly one-tenth of the agency's workforce. The Atlanta-based agency's leadership was notified of the decision Friday morning. The verbal notice came from HHS officials in a meeting with CDC leaders, according to a federal official who was at the meeting. The official was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Some portion of the affected employees are supposed to receive four weeks paid administrative leave, according to the federal official and the recording. HHS officials did not answer questions about the specifics of the layoffs. In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, the department's director of communications, wrote: 'HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.' HHS employs more than 80,000 people and runs 13 supporting agencies. Besides the CDC, they include the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration. The department also provides health coverage for nearly half the country through Medicare and Medicaid. Its staff includes scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials. It oversees research of vaccines, diseases and cures. It regulates the medications found in medicine cabinets and inspects the foods that end up in cupboards. With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees, including more than 2,000 staffers working in other countries. Historically CDC has been seen as a global leader on disease control and a reliable source of health information, boasting some of the top experts in the world. The staff is heavy with scientists — 60% have master’s degrees or doctorates. Those being fired included all first-year officers — about 50 in total — in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, according to two agency employees who communicated with some of the affected staffers. The two spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The EIS, as it is known, was established in 1951 to recruit young doctors and researchers to join the agency for two-year stints as disease investigators. The laid-off first-year officers represent a little less than half the service's current staff. EIS officers often are sent to different states and countries to become primary investigators of outbreaks and emerging health dangers. Many EIS graduates have gone on to leadership jobs at the CDC and at other public health organizations. It’s not only new employees who are subject to probation. Probationary periods also are applied to veteran staffers who, for example, were recently promoted to a new job in management. The layoffs are part of a broad effort by President Donald Trump and billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk to reduce the number of workers across the entire federal government. The job cuts also came one day after Robert F. Kennedy was sworn in to oversee HHS. Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said many of the probationary-status CDC employees are filling vital roles. 'It’s essentially assuming that they are not in a job that is crucial for the success of keeping everyone safe — just because they’ve been there for less than a year or less than six months,' said Barocas, speaking Friday morning during an Infectious Diseases Society of America call with reporters. In a Thursday interview on Fox News, Kennedy was asked if half the HHS staff would be losing their jobs. 'I don’t know anything about 50% of people being cut,' Kennedy said. 'I would be surprised if there were 50% cuts.' He added: 'If you’ve been involved in good science, you have nothing to worry about. If you care about public health, you have nothing to worry about. If you’re in there working for the pharmaceutical industry, I’d say you should move out and work for the pharmaceutical industry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hhs-to-lose-thousands-of-workers-under-probationary-job-cuts/7975696.html	2025-02-14T14:23:01-08:00	
Up to 2,000 workers laid off at US Department of Energy, sources say	WASHINGTON — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has laid off about 1,200 to 2,000 workers at the Department of Energy, including employees at a power grid office, the nuclear security administration and the loans office, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. Democratic lawmakers also said the layoffs include workers at national labs, hydroelectric plants and Cold War legacy nuclear sites that pose safety risks. The DOE has about 14,000 federal employees and 95,000 contractors. The layoffs of probationary workers come after three people representing billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at the agency last week. Some 325 workers have been let go from the department's National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and works to secure radiological materials around the world, two of the sources said. But those layoffs at NNSA have been 'partly rescinded' to retain essential nuclear security workers, one of the sources said. It was unclear how many of the 325 firings were rescinded. The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'It's been chaotic for the staff,' one source at NNSA said. 'We just want to focus on national security stuff, and this has distracted us from our work.' The losses at the NNSA occur at a time when nuclear power plants have been at risk in Russia's war on Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. The NNSA is still working to secure radiological materials in the region, one source said. 'Not … in the public interest' A copy of a letter seen by Reuters and sent to some DOE employees says: 'DOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest. For this reason, you are being removed from your position with DOE and the federal civil service effective today.' The department withdrew laid off workers' access to government-issued laptops and phones just after midnight Eastern Standard Time on Friday, which left many with no way to receive the notifications and no knowledge they had been fired, one source said. Some 45 workers were let go from the Loan Programs Office, which has hundreds of billions of dollars in loan authority for clean energy, nuclear and clean vehicle projects, one source said. Another seven laid off in the Office of General Counsel had been supporting work in clean energy demonstration projects. In addition, 18 of 148 people were let go at the Grid Deployment Office, which seeks to modernize the power grid, making it resilient to extreme weather and able to transmit power from clean energy and fossil fuel-fired power plants. In Washington state, at least a dozen workers at the Hanford nuclear site — a 1940s site for plutonium and uranium production for atomic bombs, now decommissioned but highly contaminated — were laid off, including safety engineers who clean up and monitor the site, according to Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington. 'These reckless firings will slow down critical cleanup work and make workers less safe. Trying to run Hanford with a skeleton crew is a recipe for disaster that could have irreversible impacts,' she said. 'These layoffs will hurt companies, workers and their families across Eastern Washington.' Murray said there were layoffs at other DOE-run facilities in the Pacific Northwest, including the Bonneville Power Administration hydroelectric facility and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which carries out research on everything from nuclear energy to battery storage. Murray's office reported layoffs of more than 600 electricians, scientists and cybersecurity experts at BPA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/up-to-2-000-workers-laid-off-at-us-department-of-energy-sources-say-/7975631.html	2025-02-14T13:29:05-08:00

13 people arrested in Croatia for illegally disposing of hazardous waste	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Thirteen people suspected of illegally importing and disposing of hazardous waste have been arrested in Croatia, the European Union’s law enforcement agency said Friday. The main suspects, two Croatian nationals, are considered high-value targets by Europol, said an agency statement. They are believed to have orchestrated the illegal hazardous waste imports from Italy, Slovenia and Germany to Croatia. Rather than being properly treated, the waste was simply dumped and buried, Europol said. The statement added that at least 35,000 metric tons (38,580 U.S. tons) of waste were illegally disposed of resulting in a profit of at least $4.2 million. The waste was declared as recyclable plastic waste but was 'legally considered dangerous waste,' Europol said. Croatian authorities believe the criminal network also illegally buried and dumped medical waste from Croatian companies, it said. Croatian anti-corruption authorities said in a statement of their own Friday that they have launched an investigation into 10 people and four legal entities suspected of criminal conspiracy, crimes against the environment, tax evasion and money laundering. They said they will seek to keep seven people detained, the state-run HRT television said. The Croatian office tasked with fighting organized crime and corruption said illegal waste disposal has inflicted damage on the environment, including changes in the land configuration that affected plant and tree growth, release of toxic particles in the soil and air, and potential negative effect on people's health. Croatia has suffered 'considerable ecological damage' and still unspecified material damage, the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime said in a statement. Europol said the suspects abused the infrastructures of legal businesses. They would first offer lower prices for disposal and then falsify documentation to transport their cargo to Croatia, allegedly for recycling. Waste trafficking enables criminal networks to obtain huge profits while often causing irreparable damage to the environment, the agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-arrested-in-croatia-for-illegally-disposing-of-hazardous-waste/7975458.html	2025-02-14T11:22:43-08:00	
The danger zone: In Colombia’s Catatumbo region, reporting is risky business	WASHINGTON — In a vehicle with his two bodyguards, Cristian Herrera talks about the dangers he faces covering Colombia’s Catatumbo region as he heads to his latest assignment. An independent reporter, Herrera has always worked in this region, the Norte de Santander department. His beat includes coverage of robberies, extortions, kidnappings, corruption, drug trafficking, criminal gangs and illegal armed groups. Since 2014 those assignments have come with a security detail, a necessary addition after constant threats. 'They call me, they send me voice messages, they leave pamphlets or people tell me,' Herrera says. The latest — a voicemail on his phone — said: 'I’m looking for a reporter with a big tongue. We’ll have to cut his tongue.' Often, it is hard to tell who is making the threat. 'We cover so many stories that I don’t know who it is from,' Herrera says. Coverage of the region has always brought risks. As well as illegal armed groups, he tells VOA, 'There is drug trafficking; there are coca crops, coca leaf crops; there are cocaine labs.' Added to those dangers is a flare up in clashes between two rival armed groups: the National Liberation Army and a group known the Central General Staff (Estado Mayor Central-EMC), a group of dissidents from the guerilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The fighting has left more than 56 people dead and more than 54,000 displaced, according to figures released this month by the Norte de Santander government. But just as residents in this region of more than 194,000 need access to news about the fighting, it is becoming harder for media to report safely. The regional media freedom group Fundacion para la Libertad de Prensa, or FLIP, warns that the Catatumbo region conflict silences local reporters. 'The situation in Catatumbo is critical, as it is in the entire department of northern Santander, which unfortunately is becoming the most dangerous place to practice journalism in the country,' Jonathan Bock Ruiz, executive director of FLIP, tells VOA. Few reporters inside the region are able to report about the violence, and for those who live near or in Catatumbo, coverage is extremely dangerous. 'I think as reporters, we are just receiving information of 20% of what is happening,' says Herrera. Journalists 'can't talk about anything' Colombia overall has been improving in media freedom rankings, with a 20-point improvement on the World Press Freedom Index. But it is also still considered one of the riskiest countries for journalists. And one of the most dangerous regions is Catatumbo. Two journalists were killed there last year. On the border with Venezuela, the Catatumbo region is just under 300 kilometers from Cucuta, the capital of Norte de Santander. With numerous national resources and a key coca leaf production region, it has long been a base for criminal groups, paramilitaries and guerrillas. Before FARC demobilized in a peace accord in 2016, militants controlled who gained access. Now things are different. 'You don’t know who’s in charge,' says Herrera. 'There are some organizations that are mixed with migrants who are used as instruments to commit crimes. 'Furthermore, it is an area that has been very abandoned by the state, and so those who exercise control in this region are these illegal armed groups,' he says. Often the safest option is to stay quiet. '[Journalists] can’t talk about the armed conflict, what happens there. They can’t talk about the deaths. They can't talk about drug trafficking. They can't talk about anything,' Herrera tells VOA. 'You have to publish it' Another problem comes from guerrillas or criminal groups that coerce media to serve as spokespersons — and saying 'no' is not an option. 'There is a very serious collective problem, information is used as a weapon of war, as a weapon to make propaganda, to better install the narratives of the different groups, as a way of citizen control,' says Ruiz. Herrera says the media strategy of illegal armed groups is to spread information through social media. 'It happens in El Catatumbo and in Cucuta, illegal armed groups have a digital strategy. They send their messages and start sharing them through social media; they send it to us, and sometimes with threats,' he says. 'They say, ‘You have to publish it,’ and if you say no, they declare you as a military target.' The combination of physical risk, self-censorship and control by armed groups leaves audiences with limited access to independent news. 'This has already happened in the Catatumbo at different times, where community journalists decide to turn off their radio stations. They decide to stop reporting ... where self-protection protocols are not enough to do their work safely with the number of threats and the lack of protection given by the state,' explains Ruiz. In his 20-year career, Herrera has come up against multiple threats, including three kidnap attempts. At times, he left Colombia to ensure his safety. So, security is a priority.

Russian- and Soviet-born coaches still shaping US figure skating's future	The tragic deaths of Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov in a plane crash late last month in Washington have shone a spotlight on the role of Russian- or Soviet-born coaches in the world of competitive figure skating. Their influence has shaped a generation of American skaters, raising the question: Why have these coaches been so successful in the U.S.? Maxim Adams has the story.

IAEA confirms drone attack damaged outer wall of Chernobyl dome	The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Friday that a drone attack damaged an outer wall of the protective dome containing the remains of the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, starting a fire. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident is considered the worst in history. Ukraine blames Russia for the attack on the site located about 130 kilometers north of Kyiv, which Moscow denies. In a statement on the IAEA website, the agency’s team based at the site reported hearing an explosion at 1:50 a.m. local time. They said smoke and fire were visible from the team’s on-site dormitory. Ukrainian officials informed the team a drone struck the New Safe Confinement (NSC) structure built to prevent a radioactive release from Chernobyl’s damaged reactor and protect it from external hazards. The team reported that firefighters and vehicles arrived at the scene within minutes to begin extinguishing the blaze, which, they said, could be seen intermittently for several hours afterward. The team said it observed a breach in the outer layer of the containment structure caused when the drone exploded on impact. Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory officials Friday confirmed the outer covering of the protective dome sustained damage, and investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of the damage to the interior. The IAEA said radiation levels inside and outside the NSC building remain normal and no casualties were reported. But agency Director-General Rafael Grossi said the incident was 'deeply concerning,' and said it 'underlines the persistent risks to nuclear safety during the military conflict.' An explosion and fire in April 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant destroyed the reactor building and released large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. A U.N. report said 31 people died immediately from the explosion, and while the exact number of people who died from subsequent radiation exposure is in dispute, the U.N. reports nearly 8.4 million people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were exposed to radiation due to the widespread radioactive fallout. Speaking to reporters Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied Russian involvement saying Russia does not conduct strikes on nuclear infrastructure. He called Ukraine’s claim’s 'a provocation.' Fighting around nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, located near the battle zones in southeastern Ukraine, has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-confirms-drone-attack-damaged-outer-wall-of-chernobyl-dome/7975283.html	2025-02-14T09:51:03-08:00	
At Munich Conference, US VP Vance warns European allies of ‘threat from within’	Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the security conference in Munich, Germany, against 'the threat from within,' arguing that European governments are exercising extreme censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on 'out-of-control migration.' 'The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' he said Friday. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of presidential election results over evidence of Russian disinformation. 'If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,' he said. 'I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.' He also appeared to voice support for right-wing parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe, saying, 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls.' Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S. 'there is nothing more pressing than migration.' He blamed the 'series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world,' and he highlighted the Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd, injuring at least 30 people. The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The vice president only made a passing remark on the issue. The Trump administration is 'very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine,' Vance said. 'And we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.' Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies. 'If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions ... that is not acceptable.' Vance’s remarks are 'an effort to flip the script,' on Europe’s concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North. 'There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine. Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy days before the German election,' she told VOA. Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio are set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, on the sidelines of the conference. De-isolating Russia President Donald Trump spoke this week with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and the Russian president have 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' to end the war. Speaking to reporters Thursday at the White House, Trump called Kyiv’s NATO membership bid 'impractical' and its desire to win back Russian-occupied territories 'illusionary.' His comments mirror remarks made by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed. Hegseth also called Ukraine's desire to regain territory that it lost to Russia an 'unrealistic objective.' Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. 'I'd love to have them back,' Trump said, adding that he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations' and added that they would 'probably' meet in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow. 'I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,' Senior lawmaker Alexei Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday. European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a potential settlement of the conflict. 'A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the United States,' warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the conference. 'I will be very clear. First, I see the order of meetings and decisions is the United States, Europe then Russia. We’re not against everything but we are supporting this,' Zelenskyy said. Ukraine said that at the Munich meeting, its delegation will present its position on ending the war and explain its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine. America first The Munich Security Report released ahead of the conference noted that this year’s gathering takes place in the context of an international order that appears to be in flux under Trump’s 'America First' foreign policy. 'Donald Trump’s presidential victory has buried the U.S. post-Cold War foreign policy consensus that a grand strategy of liberal internationalism would best serve U.S. interests,' said the report. It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even 'military tools' if it refuses to agree a deal ensuring Ukraine's long-term independence. Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that Palestinians should leave Gaza, and the U.S. will take over the enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence during the busy three-day conference.

Philippines increases defense efforts amid ongoing tension with China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The Philippines is increasing efforts to strengthen defense cooperation with several like-minded democracies amid ongoing tensions with China in the disputed South China Sea. Manila is trying to conclude major defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand and explore possibilities of expanding joint military drills with the United States, its main defense partner. Analysts say the development is part of Manila’s effort to counter China’s aggressive maritime activities near several disputed reefs in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost the entirety as its territory. 'The Philippines is trying to boost their capabilities to sufficiently deter China by putting a lot of emphasis on the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States while broadening the net of cooperation to other like-minded democracies,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. described the defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand as part of Manila’s efforts to 'build and strengthen' alliances with like-minded countries. 'The status of visiting forces agreement with New Zealand is an important part of … both countries’ and multilateral countries’ initiatives to resist China’s unilateral narrative to change international law,' he told journalists on the sideline of an event on Feb. 6. Meanwhile, the Canadian ambassador to the Philippines, David Hartman, said at a press event on Feb. 7 that the visiting forces agreement would enable Canada to 'have even more substantive participation in joint and multilateral training exercises and operations with the Philippines and allies' in the Indo-Pacific region. Some Philippine analysts describe the signing of the agreements as part of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s efforts to 'reset' the country’s long-term strategic interests. As China continues to challenge different countries’ territorial claims across the Pacific region, 'the Philippines’ efforts to consolidate more agreements with allies fits Manila’s need to defend its maritime territories and safeguard the freedom of navigation in the region,' Joshua Espena, a resident fellow at the Philippine-based International Development and Security Cooperation, told VOA by phone. Since about one-third of global trade passes through the South China Sea, Koh in Singapore said other democratic countries view signing defense agreements with the Philippines as a way to safeguard their strategic and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. While the Philippines’ efforts to strengthen defense cooperation with other democracies may not fundamentally change China’s behaviors in the South China Sea, 'it is still a concern for China when you have so many partners being militarily involved with Manila,' Koh told VOA by phone. Apart from negotiating defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand, the Philippines is also looking to expand joint military exercises with the United States. During a call on Tuesday, the Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. and U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown talked about the 'military modernization initiatives, Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites and increasing the scope and capacity of joint exercises in the Philippines,' according to U.S. Joint Staff Spokesperson Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey. In addition to the discussions, the Philippines has conducted a series of joint drills with the U.S. and Canada since last week, a development that China said undermines 'peace and stability in the South China Sea.' While countries around the world are bracing for uncertainties extending from the foreign policy of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, some experts say recent developments suggest the U.S. may continue to uphold its defense partnership with the Philippines. 'The people [that] the Trump administration has put into key security roles are mostly China hawks, so they see the China threat as being very real, and the Philippines remains on the front line [of that threat,]' said Raymond Powell, director of Stanford University’s Sealight project, which tracks Chinese maritime activities across the Indo-Pacific region. He said the Philippines may 'stand to gain' from the Trump administration’s foreign policy direction. Manila 'may have one of the strongest arguments' to convince the U.S. to shift resources to the Indo-Pacific region because 'they are on the front line,' Powell told VOA by phone. As the U.S. and the Philippines continue to uphold their defense cooperation, China has described the partnership as 'extremely dangerous.' 'China will not sit idly by when its security interests are harmed or threatened,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a regular press conference on Wednesday. To counter the Chinese coast guard’s aggressive operations in the South China Sea, Brawner Jr. said Wednesday that the Philippines hoped to buy two more submarines and BrahMos missiles in India. The Reuters news agency reported that New Delhi is expected to sign a $200 million missile deal with Manila in 2025. Powell said the additional missiles could strengthen the Philippines’ deterrence against China, while Manila may need to put a lot of effort into familiarizing its military forces with the submarines. Despite Philippine President Marcos Jr.’s recent attempt to 'offer a deal' to reduce tension in the South China Sea, Powell said Beijing’s aggressive posture will make it hard for the proposal to materialize. 'We're seeing much heavier [Chinese] Coast Guard and militia activity around Scarborough Shoal, and I don’t see a lessening of tension there,' he said, adding that tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea will likely 'plateau' in the near future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-increases-defense-efforts-amid-ongoing-tension-with-china-/7975137.html	2025-02-14T07:49:26-08:00	
Taiwan pledges chip talks and investment in bid to ease Trump’s concerns	TAIPEI — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged on Friday to talk with the United States about President Donald Trump’s concerns over the chip industry and to increase U.S. investment and buy more from the country, while also spending more on defense. Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he aimed to restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and repeating claims about Taiwan having taken away the industry he wanted back in the United States. Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the National Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said that the global semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in which the division of work among various countries is important. 'We of course are aware of President Trump's concerns,' Lai said. 'Taiwan's government will communicate and discuss with the semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we will come up with good proposals and engage in further discussions with the United States,' he added. Democratic countries including the United States should come together to build a global alliance for AI chips and a 'democratic supply chain' for advanced chips, Lai said. 'While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors, we also see it as Taiwan's responsibility to contribute to the prosperity of the international community.' Taiwan is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, and a crucial part of the developing AI industry. TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump's first administration. TSMC's Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday, underperforming the broader market, which ended off 1.1%. A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if TSMC judged it was feasible to increase its U.S. investment, Taiwan's government would help in talks with the United States. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The official added that communications between Taiwan and U.S. economic, security and defense officials at present was 'quite good' and 'strong support from the United States can be felt'. US support The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the democratically governed island's most important international backer and arms supplier. Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan statement following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to Washington called for 'maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait' and voiced support for 'Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations.' But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors. Lai said that the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign investment destination, and that Taiwan is the United States' most reliable trade partner. Trump has also previously criticized Taiwan, which faces a growing military threat from China, for not spending enough on defense, a criticism he has made of many U.S. allies. 'Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves,' Lai said, adding his government is working to propose a special budget this year to boost defense spending from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%. His government is involved in a standoff with parliament, where opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the budget, including defense spending. 'Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed concern to us, worried whether Taiwan's determination for its self-defense has weakened,' Lai said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-pledges-chip-talks-and-investment-in-bid-to-ease-trump-s-concerns-/7974979.html	2025-02-14T05:50:24-08:00	
Lebanon blocks Iranian passenger flight to Beirut, analysts cite Israeli pressure	Lebanon blocked an Iranian airliner from flying into Beirut Thursday after Israel accused Iran a day earlier of using civilian flights to deliver cash to Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. The chief executive of Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Saeed Chalandri, told Iranian state news agency Mehr that the Mahan Air flight to Beirut was canceled before takeoff because Lebanon had not granted it permission to land. In a video posted on X by an Iran-based journalist and deemed credible by VOA Persian, the passengers could be seen waiting in a departure hall designated for religious pilgrims, with one man shouting in frustration at being stuck there. In a Thursday statement published by Lebanon’s National News Agency, Beirut’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said the government was asking some airlines to 'temporarily reschedule' flights to Lebanon while it implements 'some additional security measures.' The civil aviation office did not immediately respond to a VOA request, emailed Friday, for comment on which airlines had been asked to reschedule and how many flights were affected. The statement said Lebanon also was working with its national carrier, Middle East Airlines, to send a plane to Tehran to bring the stranded passengers home. The moves followed a Wednesday Arabic statement by Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee, accusing Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force of exploiting civilian flights to Beirut airport to smuggle cash to its main proxy, Hezbollah, without oversight by the Lebanese government. Iran’s U.N. Mission in New York did not immediately respond to a VOA request, emailed on Thursday, for comment on the Israeli allegation. Mahan Air is sanctioned by the United States as part of a long-running U.S. effort to target entities that fund and arm Hezbollah. Researcher David Daoud of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies told VOA he has tracked 26 Mahan Air flights from Iran to Beirut since December 1. He said Thursday’s cancelation was the first time Lebanon blocked one the airline’s flights since letting it resume service to Beirut following a November 27 ceasefire in a yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah initiated the conflict with Israel in October 2023 in solidarity with Palestinian terror group Hamas, before agreeing to the ceasefire under pressure from an Israeli offensive that had begun in September 2024 and killed its top leaders. Adraee said Israel provided information to a U.S.-led group monitoring the ceasefire to try to stop Iran flying cash to Hezbollah, which he said already had received some of the funds. But the Israeli military refused to comment on whether it had contacted the ceasefire monitoring group to urge Lebanon to block Thursday’s flight. The ceasefire obliges the Lebanese government to assert sovereignty over the country and prevent Hezbollah and other armed groups from receiving 'arms and related material' through border crossings and attacking Israel. It does not explicitly mention deliveries of cash to Hezbollah. Israel also is obligated to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon as Lebanese government forces deploy in the region. Adraee said the Israeli military 'will not allow [Hezbollah] to build up its forces and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire understandings and ensure the security of [Israel's] citizens.' It was the strongest statement that Israel has made on Iranian cash deliveries to Hezbollah since the recent conflict began. Daoud said Adraee's warning 'put the Lebanese on notice that the Israelis are watching the Beirut airport and know funds for Hezbollah are coming through these Iranian flights.' 'Suddenly, there is movement at the Beirut airport,' he said, in reference to Lebanese authorities denying landing rights to the Mahan Air flight. 'This is part of a pattern in which the Israelis call out them out, and the Lebanese do something that makes them look like they are acting. But the issue is consistency.' Daoud said Lebanon could demonstrate consistency if it bans Mahan Air from flying to Beirut. Short of that step, he said Lebanon also could subject the airline's passengers and cargo to sustained high scrutiny on arrival. Matthew Levitt, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in a VOA interview that the Mahan Air flight cancelation is 'welcome news.' 'This is how the Lebanese government will reassert sovereignty over the country, if it continues to move in this direction. And that is not a guarantee,' he said. This article was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-blocks-iranian-passenger-flight-to-beirut-analysts-cite-israeli-pressure-/7974835.html	2025-02-14T04:54:07-08:00	
Pope Francis taken to hospital for bronchitis treatment	ROME — Pope Francis was taken to hospital on Friday morning for tests and to continue treatment of his ongoing bronchitis, the Vatican said. 'This morning, at the end of his audiences, Pope Francis was admitted to the Policlinico Agostino Gemelli for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue his treatment for bronchitis, which is still ongoing, in a hospital environment,' it said in a statement. Francis, 88, has been pope since 2013 and has suffered from influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. Earlier this month, Francis told pilgrims at a weekly audience that he was suffering from a 'strong cold,' which the Vatican later described as bronchitis. The pope has been keeping up his daily schedule of appointments despite his illness, taking meetings at the Vatican residence where he lives. Before going to hospital on Friday, the pope had an official meeting with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Francis suffered two falls recently at his Vatican residence, bruising his chin in December and injuring his arm in January. Rome's Gemelli hospital, the largest in the city, has a special suite for treating popes. Francis spent nine days there in June 2023, when he had surgery to repair an abdominal hernia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-taken-to-hospital-for-bronchitis-treatment/7974812.html	2025-02-14T02:52:02-08:00	
Roadside bomb kills 11 coal miners in southwest Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province said Friday that at least 11 coal mine workers were killed and six injured when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. The early morning incident occurred near a coal mine in the Harnai district of the insurgency-hit province, which is rich in natural resources. 'The terrorists involved in this incident will be brought to justice soon,' an official statement quoted Provincial Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti as saying. In Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he expressed sorrow over the deaths of miners and said his government 'is actively working to eliminate terrorism.' No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Balochistan, where ethnic Baloch militants frequently stage insurgent attacks against security forces and workers associated with public and private mining projects. The Baloch Liberation Army, particularly its suicide bomber unit known as the Majeed Brigade, has claimed responsibility for nearly all recent attacks in Balochistan, resulting in the killings of scores of civilians and security forces. At least 18 Pakistani paramilitary troops were killed Jan. 31 when BLA militants assaulted their bus in the province’s Kalat district, marking one of the deadliest days for security forces in recent months. The U.N. Security Council noted in its latest international terror threat assessment report released this week that BLA has been behind 'several high-casualty attacks' in Balochistan. The report quoted two U.N. member states as saying that the 'Majeed Brigade maintained connections with TTP, ISIL-K and ETIM/TIP, including collaborating with the latter in its operational bases in Afghanistan.' TTP stands for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a globally designated terrorist group that carries out almost daily attacks in Pakistan, particularly in its northwestern districts near or on the Afghan border. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, or ISIL-K, is the Afghan branch of the transnational Islamic State terrorist network. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, is an anti-China militant group operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. Balochistan is on Pakistan’s borders with Iran and Afghanistan and has experienced years of attacks attributed to BLA, TTP, and Islamic State loyalists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/roadside-bomb-kills-11-coal-miners-in-southwest-pakistan/7974788.html	2025-02-14T01:22:55-08:00	
Russian drone attack damages Chernobyl nuclear plant's shelter, Zelenskyy says	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian drone attack caused significant damage to the radiation shelter of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant overnight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday. Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civil nuclear catastrophe when one of its four reactors exploded in 1986. That reactor is now enveloped by a protective shelter, known as a sarcophagus, to contain the lingering radiation. The Russian drone struck the shelter of the destroyed power unit at the plant, causing a fire that has since been extinguished, he said. 'As of now, radiation levels have not increased and are being constantly monitored,' Zelenskyy said, adding that an initial assessment had found significant damage. 'The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today’s Russia,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-damages-chornobyl-nuclear-plant-s-shelter-zelenskyy-says/7974778.html	2025-02-14T00:31:43-08:00	
Hamas expected to name 3 Israeli hostages for release this weekend	The militant group Hamas is expected to release the names of three hostages it will exchange for Palestinian prisoners this weekend, after it expressed its commitment to a ceasefire with Israel. The next release of hostages was cast in doubt after Hamas accused Israel of violations of the agreement and threats of a return to war. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation [Israel] adheres to it fully,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said. Qanoua also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. The Israeli government later reiterated that Hamas must release three hostages this weekend. 'If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end,' Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire, and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States wanted to hear new proposals from Arab states on Gaza after Trump’s plan received backlash. 'If they’ve got a better plan, now’s the time to present it,' Rubio said on a conservative radio show. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has freed 21 hostages, and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Both Israel and Hamas stand accused of committing war crimes. The United States on Thursday sanctioned the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court over the ICC’s investigations targeting U.S. officials and alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-expected-to-name-3-israeli-hostages-for-release-this-weekend/7974759.html	2025-02-13T23:39:16-08:00

VOA Kurdish: Mass grave of Kurdish fighters killed by IS found in disputed Iraqi province	Local officials confirmed to VOA on Thursday that a mass grave containing the remains of 17 people has been found in Hawija town, west of Iraq's disputed province of Kirkuk.

VOA Mandarin: China’s 2024 lottery sales hit 40-year high	China's 2024 lottery sales reached a record of 620 billion yuan ($84.8 billion), averaging more than 2,000 yuan per person as China is estimated to have about 300 million lottery players. Some observers believe the lottery has become a means for many poor people to dream of getting rich overnight. However, others said that sales of China's sports lottery are the biggest contributor, accounting for 66% of the total lottery sales.

As Germany election looms, far-right German party continues to gather support	German voters head to the polls this month for an election that will determine who the country’s new chancellor will be. The Feb. 23 poll is a snap election, following the collapse of center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government last year. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, founded in 2013, appears to be gathering strength and support across the country and has emerged as a factor in the election. The party’s popularity has been fueled by dissatisfaction with the large numbers of immigrants in the country. While AfD has evolved to focus its attention on other issues, including the immediate lifting of sanctions against Russia, immigration remains its central theme. Alice Weidel, AfD’s first candidate for chancellor, is a staunch supporter of so-called 'remigration,' a term used to describe the mass deportation of immigrants. Political analysts say Weidel has little chance of becoming chancellor, but as AfD’s popularity has risen, it has forced politicians to rethink their conversations and debates about immigration. AfD won its first parliamentary seats in 2017, with 12.6% of the votes. In 2021, the party had only 10.3% of the votes. It has supporters across the country and its politicians have been elected to 14 of Germany’s 16 state legislatures. Its emergence as a political force occurs at the same time that other far-right parties are rising in Europe, including Austria's Freedom Party and the National Rally in France.

Category 5 cyclone nears Western Australia coast	sydney — Category 5 Cyclone Zelia swirled toward Australia's minerals-rich western coast Friday, with predicted gusts of up to 290 kilometers per hour sparking emergency warnings and port closures. Forecasters said the slow-moving, severe tropical cyclone was moving south toward Port Hedland — one of the world's busiest iron ore loading ports — with landfall expected in the afternoon. 'Very destructive winds of up to 290 kilometers per hour (180 miles per hour) are likely close to the center of the cyclone as it crosses the coast,' the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said. It warned residents of a possible dangerous storm tide as the cyclone made landfall. 'Tides are likely to rise significantly above the normal high tide mark with damaging waves and dangerous flooding of some low-lying areas close to the shoreline,' it said in an update. The cyclone was forecast to land near Port Hedland — about 17 hours' drive north of the state capital, Perth — before tracking inland across sparsely populated mining and cattle country. Initially arriving as a Category 5 cyclone, Zelia was expected to weaken to a Category 4 later in the evening. Pilbara Ports said it had cleared vessels and shut down operations at major minerals export centers Port Hedland and Port Dampier as well as the oil and gas shipping port of Varanus Island. Emergency services in Western Australia told people still in the cyclone's path to shelter in the strongest part of their homes, warning it was now too late to attempt to leave. The northwest coast of Western Australia is the most cyclone-prone region in the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It also has 'the highest incidence of cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere.' The region holds significant deposits of iron ore, copper and gold, and is home to some of Australia's largest mining operations. Mining group Rio Tinto said its ships and trains had been cleared from ports in the area. 'It is too early to say how long port and rail operations will be closed and what the impact will be,' it said in a statement Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/category-5-cyclone-nears-western-australia-coast/7974677.html	2025-02-13T18:37:12-08:00

France's Macron urges Syria's interim government to join US-led coalition fighting extremists	PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron urged Syria's interim government to cooperate with a U.S.-led coalition fighting against extremist groups in that region as he hosted a conference Thursday on the Mideast country's future. Macron's comments come amid uncertainty over the United States' commitment to the region. Thursday's conference in Paris among European and Arab nations was the third on Syria since the repressive government of Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December and was attended by Syria's interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani. 'Syria must very clearly continue to fight against all the terrorist organizations that are spreading chaos,' Macron said. 'If Syria decides to offer cooperation' with the international coalition, France would support the move, he added. The Paris conference of foreign ministers and other officials from participating countries was meant to coordinate efforts to support a peaceful transition, as the new government in Damascus underlines its desire to improve relations with the West. Integration of Kurdish-led forces Macron also called on the Syrian interim government to 'fully integrate' the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) into the Syrian transition, calling them 'precious allies.' 'I think your responsibility today is to integrate them and also to allow these forces to join in,' he said. On Thursday, Syrian organizers of a conference in Damascus to chart the country's political future said those talks will include all segments of Syrian society except for the Kurdish-led administration in the northeast and Assad loyalists. Most of the country's former insurgent factions have agreed to dissolve and join the new Syrian army and security services, but the Kurdish-led SDF so far has refused to do the same. SDF forces have been clashing with Turkish-backed groups in northern Syria, and the Kurds are concerned about losing political and cultural gains they have made since carving out their own enclave in the northeast during the country's civil war. Discussions are ongoing between the SDF and the government in Damascus. Billions in aid needed More aid is crucial to achieve a peaceful reconstruction during the post-Assad transition. The country needs to rebuild housing, electricity, water and transportation infrastructure after nearly 14 years of war. The United Nations in 2017 estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion, while some experts now say the number could reach at least $400 billion. With few productive sectors and government employees making wages equivalent to about $20 per month, Syria has grown increasingly dependent on remittances and humanitarian aid. But the flow of aid was throttled after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The effects were particularly dire in the country's northwest, a formerly rebel-held enclave that hosts millions of people displaced from other areas by the country's civil war. Many of them live in sprawling tent camps. The freeze on USAID funding forced clinics serving many of those camps to shut down, and nonprofits laid off local staff. A workshop bringing together key donors from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, the United Nations and key agencies from Arab countries will be held alongside the conference to coordinate international aid to Syria. Doubts about US military support Uncertainty also surrounds the future of U.S. military support in the region. In 2019 during his first term, Trump decided on a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the northeast of Syria before he halted the plans. And in December last year, when rebels were on their way to topple Assad, Trump said the United States should not 'dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.' Now that Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is trying to consolidate his power, the U.S. intentions in the region remain unclear. A U.S. official attended Thursday's conference in Paris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-urges-syria-s-interim-government-to-join-us-led-coalition-fighting-extremists-/7974614.html	2025-02-13T17:22:11-08:00	
Russian Vinnik back in Moscow after prisoner swap, news agency says	Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national convicted of cybercrime and released by U.S. authorities as part of a prisoner swap, arrived in Moscow on Thursday and thanked President Vladimir Putin and others for arranging the exchange, state news agency RIA said. Vinnik, who pleaded guilty in May 2024 to charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, told RIA in a dispatch issued after midnight that he was at home with his family. He said he had flown on a U.S. plane that stopped in Poland and not in Turkey as his lawyer had said. Quoted by RIA, Vinnik thanked Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russian diplomats and special services, his lawyers 'and especially my family.' He added: 'What can I say? And I can also thank [U.S. President Donald] Trump. On the whole, without him, things would probably have been difficult.' Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, told the Tass news agency that Vinnik's return home was 'yet another victory for Russian diplomacy and all services and agencies associated with his liberation.' Unlike previous instances of Russians returning home after a prisoner swap, there was little fanfare around Vinnik's arrival. Vinnik operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funneling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity. He was freed by the United States from prison in return for Moscow's release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who returned home on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-vinnik-back-in-moscow-after-prisoner-swap-news-agency-says-/7974639.html	2025-02-13T17:17:12-08:00	
Trump administration lays off probationary employees, plans 'large-scale' cuts	washington — The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection — potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming. The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly. It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for 'large-scale reductions in force.' Elon Musk, whom Trump has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the country to 'delete entire agencies' from the federal government. 'I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,' Musk said as he spoke via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 'If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.' 'Vast unraveling' Paul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor emeritus of public service at New York University, said it seemed like the administration was 'inventing new methods for destroying government capacity.' By laying people off, the government will be able to accomplish fewer things. 'It's a vast unraveling of what federal agencies do,' he said. Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, there were 220,000 workers with under a year on the job as of March 2024, the most recent data available. The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week, and it has included workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education. At least 39 workers were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials. The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the capital region. Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to pay people until September 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program on Wednesday. However, the number of workers who took the offer was lower than the administration's target, and Trump has made it clear that he would take further steps to lay people off. Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions in the workforce, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss it. The National Science Foundation was told to expect a 25% to 50% reduction in force within two months, while the Housing and Urban Development Department was told to plan for a 50% reduction, the person said. Employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were also bracing Thursday for reductions in their workforce. The order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring would be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-lays-off-probationary-employees-plans-large-scale-cuts/7974612.html	2025-02-13T17:10:27-08:00	
Trump takes tit-for-tat trade action with tariffs	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday took what could become his most consequential action involving international trade early in his second administration. Trump, who signed a memorandum calling for reciprocal tariffs, told a group of reporters in the Oval Office that 'if you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs.' The goal is to bring down America’s budget deficit, estimated to be approaching $2 trillion. The president added that the action 'is fair to all. No other country can complain.' Trump ordered Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, his picks for commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative, respectively, to lead teams to calculate new import taxes on America’s trading partners. To assess the amounts, they are to take into consideration other countries’ tariff rates, subsidies to industry, value-added taxes — which are common in the European Union — regulations and undervaluing of currencies. The EU value-added tax is the 'poster child' for unfair trade, Peter Navarro, the president’s senior counselor for trade, told reporters on Thursday. Modi visit Trump put his signature on the edict just hours before welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House. India is expected to be one of the countries most affected by the action. India has relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers on numerous American exports. It has faced pressure from Washington to reduce its 100% tariff on walnuts, the 70% levy on apples and the 60% import tax on dairy products. Other sectors include smartphones, pork and poultry, and medical devices. India reduced a 100% tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles — an iconic brand deeply embedded in the economy of the Midwestern state of Wisconsin — to 50% in 2018. The two countries announced on Thursday an energy agreement to make the United States the primary supplier of oil and gas to India. Trump, alongside Modi, at a Thursday evening news conference said he would pave the way for the United States to sell F-35 Stealth fighter jets to India and the two leaders would work to make tariff cuts in order to reduce America’s nearly $50 billion trade deficit with India. 'Prime Minister Modi and I agreed we would begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities,' Trump said. Modi said he and Trump have set a 'target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.' In response to a reporter’s question about the reciprocal tariffs, Trump confirmed India would also be targeted. 'Whatever India charges, we’re charging them,' he said. Some high-ranking government officials in New Delhi have suggested finding a way to appease the U.S. president amid concern that he could negotiate a sweeping trade deal with India’s neighbor and rival, China, according to Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia. If Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, were to forge a sweeping trade pact, 'India could face a double challenge — on the trade/economic front and the strategic big picture front,' Pande told VOA on Thursday. 'India is a country that Trump has railed against in the past, although I don't think it's a particular obsession of his in the way that China is, because China is a major strategic competitor to the United States. Or the way Canada and Mexico are, because they are the bordering countries,' according to Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Since being sworn into office on Jan. 20 for his second nonconsecutive term as president, Trump has moved quickly on the trade front. He imposed, and then put on hold amid further negotiations, across-the-board 25% tariffs on nearly all products from America’s two continental neighbors, Canada and Mexico. He placed a flat 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which prompted Beijing to respond with countertariffs of 10% to 15% on crude oil, liquefied natural gas, farm machinery and some other U.S. products. Economists say the tariffs cover about $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, while the Chinese tariffs hit $15 billion to $20 billion in American products. Trump characterized his actions as a way to pressure those three countries into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. He also has blamed Canada and Mexico for being lax in preventing migrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Trump earlier this week announced that effective in March, all steel and aluminum imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, an action analysts predict could significantly raise sticker prices at automotive dealerships in North America. 'Stagflationary shock' Analysts say Trump’s tariff actions will hurt the growth of the U.S. economy this year. 'Tariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,' according to a report issued Thursday by financial services provider Wells Fargo. 'The U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.' Peter Harrell, who was jointly appointed to the White House National Security Council and National Economic Council in the previous administration of President Joe Biden, said Trump 'promised us he would be a ‘tariff man’ and he is certainly delivering.' 'I think this is only part of the tariffs we are likely to see or at least threatened' over the coming months, Harrell said Thursday morning on 'The Capital Cable,' a livestream program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Korea Chair. These actions or the threat of them give the Trump administration leverage by having 'a tariff bazooka ready to fire,' said Harrell, currently a Carnegie nonresident fellow. On the same livestream, Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economic program, warned that Trump’s 'Fortress America' will result in Americans paying 'really high costs' due to retaliatory actions by Washington’s trading partners. If the president’s goal is to use such trade actions partly to increase the cash coffers, tariff revenue is approximately 1.5% of government revenue, 'so it’s tiny,' Luck said. The United States is in a dominant position as the largest economy and well-integrated into the global trading system, giving it leverage built up over an 80-year period, but Trump’s actions could squander that goodwill, Luck said. 'We’ve been a reliable partner for a long period of time,' he noted, with the United States traditionally setting tariffs through negotiations involving international groups such as the World Trade Organization. 'There’s a lot of anxiety, bordering on panic in [South] Korea,' because Trump, immediately in his second term, is using tariffs for noneconomic reasons, said Yeo Han-Koo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics 'U.S. policymakers really need to see the strategic angle' amid the regional competition with China and how they can collaborate with Tokyo and Seoul, suggested Yeo, who as South Korea’s trade minister coinciding with Trump’s first term was at the negotiating table across from American officials. Shipbuilding, civil nuclear power and biopharmaceuticals are three sectors where the United States, Japan and South Korea could cooperate to help counter Beijing’s rising trade and military influence, Yeo suggested.

Jailed Georgian journalist: 'I will not bow to this regime'	WASHINGTON — 'I will not bow to this regime,' writes Mzia Amaglobeli from pre-trial detention in the city of Batumi in Georgia. The 49-year-old journalist has been in custody since January 11 and on a hunger strike since January 12 over her detention. Amaglobeli was attending a protest where demonstrations were calling for fresh elections and objecting to the government's suspension of Georgia's EU accession plans. At first, police detained Amaglobeli for putting a sticker on a wall. She was released, only to be arrested later that day for slapping a police officer. Georgia's prime minister and other government officials have said that Amaglobeli should end her hunger strike and apologize for her actions. But media watchdogs believe her arrest is connected to her journalism. Journalist previously threatened Amaglobeli is the founder of the websites Batumelebi and Netgazeti, which focus on political news, investigations and corruption. Both Amaglobeli and her media group have come under pressure and threats previously for their work. Amaglobeli's health has declined after being on a hunger strike for a month, and she is being held in a private clinic under a doctor's supervision, but she remains in custody. Nestan Tsetskhladze, a friend and colleague, told VOA that the journalist plans to remain on her hunger strike until March 4, when she is due to appear in court. 'She is on hunger strike in protest, to show that she won't tolerate this regime,' Tsetskhladze told VOA. 'She is not going to live by this regime's agenda. That is her goal.' Amaglobeli has also written of her position in a letter last month to colleagues that was shared with media. 'Today it is me, tomorrow it could be anyone who dares to dream of a just, democratic European Georgia, untouched by Russian influence, unshaken by oppression,' wrote Amaglobeli. 'I will not bow to this regime. I will not play by its rules.' Hundreds arrested The journalist is one of hundreds of people to be arrested since parliamentary elections in October resulted in nationwide protests. The country's ruling Georgian Dream party officially won the election with around 54% of the vote, but the results were challenged by then-President Salome Zourabichvili and opposition parties, who claimed the elections were rigged. Observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said there were reports of voter irregularities. At the time, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, called on Zourabichvili to turn over any evidence of rigging to authorities. He said he believed she did not have such evidence. A fresh wave of protests started on November 28, when Kobakhidze announced a suspension of all negotiations with the European Union on Georgia's EU accession until 2028. Police have responded to the protests with force, using water cannons against demonstrators, hundreds of whom have been detained, beaten and treated inhumanely, according to Transparency International Georgia. In Amaglobeli's case, the journalist's legal team says she was mistreated after her second arrest. They say that the police officer whom she slapped was trying to physically abuse her, that he spat in her face and did not let her use the restroom for several hours. Additionally, lawyers were not allowed to see the journalist for three hours. Amaglobeli faces charges of assaulting a police officer. If found guilty, she could face up to seven years in prison. Transparency International Georgia has said a video of the interaction shows the slap 'lacked sufficient force to cause harm,' and doesn't meet the standard for a formal charge. Gulnoza Said of the Committee to Protect Journalists told VOA that it is a 'very serious press freedom violation that she is in detention.' Rachel Denber, deputy director of the Human Rights Watch Europe and Central Asia division, said that, so far, no investigations have taken place into cases of riot police using excessive force or alleged mistreatment of protesters in custody. 'Suddenly, this is where the authorities are putting all of their time and resources and vigor — to punish one person who is a journalist and who has a record of being outspoken,' Denber told VOA. Tsetskhladze, the journalist's friend, believes the government's treatment of Amaglobeli is meant to be a warning for other independent media outlets and journalists in Georgia. 'They are punishing not only Mzia, who slapped a police officer, but also the media outlets she funded, the media in general, journalists and all critical, free people in this country,' he told VOA. At least 50 journalists have been attacked, obstructed and beaten during the protests. Some were hospitalized and their equipment was damaged, according to the Mapping Media Freedom platform.

Federal judge pauses Trump order restricting gender-affirming care for trans youth	BALTIMORE — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's recent executive order aimed at restricting gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19. The judge's ruling came after a lawsuit was filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has been compromised by the president's order. A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of many lawsuits opposing one of the many executive orders Trump has issued. Judge Brendan Hurson, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden, granted the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore. The ruling, in effect for 14 days, essentially puts Trump's directive on hold while the case proceeds. The restraining order could also be extended. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing federally run insurance programs to exclude coverage for gender-affirming care. That includes Medicaid, which covers such services in some states, and TRICARE for military families. Trump's order also called on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice. The lawsuit includes several accounts from families of appointments being canceled as medical institutions react to the new directive. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue Trump's executive order is 'unlawful and unconstitutional' because it seeks to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because it violates anti-discrimination laws while infringing on the rights of parents. Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, the lawsuit also alleges the policy is discriminatory because it allows federal funds to cover the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition. Some hospitals immediately paused gender-affirming care, including prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy, while they assess how the order affects them. Trump's approach on the issue represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people. Trump has used strong language in opposing gender-affirming care, asserting falsely that 'medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex.' Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to gender-affirming care.

Prosecutors quit after being ordered to end case against New York mayor	NEW YORK — The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan resigned Thursday after refusing a Justice Department order to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Two senior Justice Department officials also quit after the department leadership in Washington moved to seize control of the case. Danielle Sassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email to her staff. The move was confirmed by a spokesperson for the office. Adams' case has yet to be dropped. After Sassoon declined to dismiss the case, the department's public integrity section in Washington was asked to take over, according to a person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. The exits came days after a high-ranking Justice Department official directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams, a Democrat who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said in a memo Monday that the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple challengers. Bove had directed that be done as soon as 'practicable,' but there have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she would 'look into' why the case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges remained in place. In the email to her staff, Sassoon did not give a reason for her resignation. In the note, the contents of which were obtained by The Associated Press, she said she had just submitted her resignation to Bondi. 'As I told her, it has been my greatest honor to represent the United States and to pursue justice as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York,' Sassoon wrote. The Justice Department did not ask Sassoon to resign, according to a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The department declined public comment on Sassoon's exit. A message seeking comment was left for Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government's decision to end the Adams case because of political considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence, alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from long-standing norms. The directive from Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer, was all the more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been brought — particularly in an office as prestigious as that U.S. attorney's office. Bove's memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law. Sassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who stepped down after Trump's election victory in November. Sassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on January 21, the day after Trump took office. Her role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the Senate. That has not happened yet. The Southern District of New York is among the largest and most prominent prosecutor's offices in the U.S., with a long track record of tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that has earned it the nickname 'the sovereign district.' During Trump's first term, the office prosecuted both the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and his strategic adviser, Steve Bannon, in separate cases. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance charges. Trump ended the federal fraud case against Bannon by pardoning him, though nearly identical charges were then brought by state prosecutors. This is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership turnover. In 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump's attorneys general during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump would not be disturbed. Sassoon joined the U.S. attorney's office in 2016. In 2023 she helped lead the fraud prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. More recently, she had served as the office's co-chief of criminal appeals. Adams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse. The indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building open in time for a planned visit by Turkey's president. Prosecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law, foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns. As recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to 'uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.' Bove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington hadn't evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be dropped — at least until after the mayoral election in November. Federal agents also had been investigating other senior Adams aides. It was unclear what would happen to that side of the probe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-quit-after-being-ordered-to-end-case-against-new-york-mayor/7974287.html	2025-02-13T14:37:30-08:00	
Trump wants denuclearization talks with Russia and China, hopes for defense spending cuts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defense budgets in half. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hopes to gain commitments from the U.S. adversaries to cut their own spending. 'There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons. We already have so many,' Trump said. 'You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.' 'We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,' Trump said. While the U.S. and Russia have held massive stockpiles of weapons since the Cold War, Trump predicted that China would catch up in its capability to exact nuclear devastation 'within five or six years.' He said if the weapons were ever called to use, 'that’s going to be probably oblivion.' Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once 'we straighten it all out' in the Middle East and Ukraine. 'One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi [Jinping] of China, President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.' Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear arms reduction talks when the U.S. and Russia were negotiating an extension of a pact known as New START. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty during the Biden administration, as the U.S. and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans or replace their Cold War-era nuclear arsenals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-hopes-for-defense-spending-cuts/7974285.html	2025-02-13T14:19:45-08:00

Chinese diplomat visits UK, restarts dialogue	WASHINGTON — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Britain for the first time on Thursday, marking the restart of a diplomatic dialogue mechanism that has been paused for nearly seven years. Wang had talks with Britain's foreign minister and national security adviser and briefly met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The top Chinese diplomat's visit restarts the U.K.-China Strategic Dialogue, which has been frozen since 2018 over human rights abuses in Hong Kong, spying allegations and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that discussions would involve 'areas of bilateral economic cooperation' and security issues such as the war in Ukraine. 'We will also discuss issues where the U.K. and China do not always see eye to eye, and in some cases, the U.K. does have significant concerns,' Lammy said. In the meetings, Wang said that cooperation was increasingly urgent, given the current state of global affairs. 'Under the current situation, it is more important than before for China and the U.K. to demonstrate their responsibilities as major countries, practice multilateralism, support free trade, advocate win-win cooperation, and promote political solutions to hot spot issues, so we can jointly work for the peace and stability of the world,' Wang said through an interpreter. 'It is important that we use channels such as this for robust but constructive discussion, as we are both members of the U.N. Security Council and we'll be better able to understand each other, and each other's perspectives,' Wang added. Wang's visit is another step in the new British labor government's effort to improve its relations with China. Lammy visited China in October, and British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves traveled to Beijing in January to reopen talks of investment between the countries. As British diplomats met with Wang, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the Chinese Embassy to protest his arrival and Chinese human rights violations. 'We will take this opportunity to call on China, to hope that China can have freedom of speech, human rights and can end its dictatorship rule,' said Cheng Xiaodan, a Chinese immigrant living in England. Members of the crowd held small paper signs with images of Wang and banners that read 'Long live freedom. Long live human rights.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-diplomat-visits-uk-restarts-dialogue/7974252.html	2025-02-13T14:15:49-08:00

Pentagon chief calls on NATO partners to increase role in Europe’s defense	PENTAGON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for NATO’s European members to increase their role in the defense of Europe as the United States focuses on defending the alliance’s Pacific flank. It is a move that he says will likely require European allies to significantly increase defense spending from 2% of GDP to about 5% of GDP. 'We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you can't shoot values, you can't shoot flags, and you can't shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power,' Hegseth told reporters on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Last year, NATO’s European allies collectively spent 2% of their GDP, amounting to about $380 billion, for the first time after setting a 2% defense spending goal in 2014. The U.S. currently spends about 3.5% of its GDP on defense. Canada, the other non-European NATO ally, currently spends about 1.4% of its GDP on defense. 'NATO is a great alliance, the most successful defense alliance in history, but to endure for the future, our partners must do far more for Europe's defense,' Hegseth said. He emphasized that deterrence of Chinese aggression 'in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by the United States.' He said the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, nor does it feel that conflict with China is inevitable, but he contended the administration must work with allies to ensure deterrence in the Indo-Pacific is 'hard power deterrence, not just reputational.' Russia-Ukraine war On Wednesday, Hegseth said keeping Ukraine’s pre-invasion boundaries is an 'unrealistic objective' in its war against Russian aggression, as was the expectation that Ukraine would join NATO. He advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that would not include U.S. forces. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and whether it should concede any territory should not be decided before peace talks start, referring to Hegseth’s comments as 'concessions' made by the United States. 'Vladimir Putin responds to strength,' Hegseth said on Thursday when asked whether the U.S. was decreasing Ukraine’s leverage. 'No one's going to get everything that they want, understanding who committed the aggression in the first place,' he added, referring to Putin. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated his support for higher defense spending and appeared to defend Hegseth’s comments on Ukraine not joining the alliance. Rutte said on Thursday that while NATO must 'make sure that Vladimir Putin never ever tries again to attack Ukraine,' he said, 'it has never been a promise to Ukraine that as part of a peace deal, they would be part of NATO.' The European Union’s top diplomat warned that any peace deal struck between the United States and Russia — without Ukraine or the EU — will fail. 'Trump says that the killing should stop. Putin can stop the killing by stopping bombing Ukraine. This is doable if there is a will,' said Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. She added that any agreement without Ukraine at the table amounts to appeasement. Kallas’ comments reflected those of many NATO allies at Thursday’s meeting following U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Putin and Trump's signaling that talks on Ukraine between the two were imminent. After Thursday’s NATO ministerial gathering, Hegseth travels to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.' Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-calls-on-nato-partners-to-increase-role-in-europe-s-defense/7974207.html	2025-02-13T13:10:12-08:00

Number of accused 'high-threat' migrants at Guantanamo Bay rising	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is now housing about 68 detainees at its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an effort to assist the Department of Homeland Security with mass deportations. The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, shared the updated figure with lawmakers Wednesday, but said he could not yet provide details on how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. Admiral Alvin Holsey said those efforts include both the detention of individuals described by DHS officials as 'high-threat criminal aliens' and eventually holding up to 30,000 non-violent migrants slated for deportation. 'We're doing a phased approach,' Holsey told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that the base has the capacity now to hold about 2,500 non-violent migrants. 'We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said. 'We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' U.S. Transportation Command told VOA on Monday that there have been at least five flights of migrants to Guantanamo Bay, each aboard a C-17 or C-130 military cargo plane. Most of the flights, according to multiple officials, have carried between 10 and 15 detainees. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of the third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. 'By hurrying immigrants off to a remote island cut off from lawyers, family, and the rest of the world, the Trump administration is sending its clearest signal yet that the rule of law means nothing to it,' according to a statement from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation,' he added. According to the ACLU and the other groups, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Eucaris Carolina Gomez Lugo, learned her brother had been sent to Guantanamo Bay only after seeing him in a photo. The group also said she was shocked to learn that the government was alleging he was a member of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan street gang. DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens—they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/number-of-accused-high-threat-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay-rising/7974147.html	2025-02-13T12:30:38-08:00

UN report: China expands forced labor in Xinjiang, Tibet	WASHINGTON — A newly released report from the United Nations’ International Labor Organization states that authorities in China are not only using 'vocational skills training and education centers' for forced labor in Xinjiang and Tibet, but also the large-scale transfer of 'surplus' rural workers to state-led labor programs across the country. China called the report 'baseless' and 'false.' Released Monday, the ILO report details how Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to investigate and monitor poverty levels, setting higher targets for cross-provincial labor transfers while pressuring ethnic smallholder farmers to cede their land to large state-led cooperatives. Framed as 'liberating' rural workers, the report said, this process has forced tens of thousands of Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing under coercive conditions. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region are two of China’s five provincial-level autonomous regions. Both are located in the country's western regions. Two systems Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, described the report as 'very up to date' in its assessment of forced labor practices. 'The new report not only corrected previous conceptual errors [the 2022 version], but is very up to date in its assessment,' Zenz told VOA in an emailed response Wednesday. 'ILO attributed all forced labor in Xinjiang to the internment camps' in its previous report. Zenz noted that in February 2022, an ILO report cited observations by the International Trade Union Confederation, or ITUC, on forced labor in Xinjiang but inaccurately suggested that the region’s entire system of coercive labor was based solely on 'internment or ‘re-education’ camps,' or what Beijing calls vocational skills training and education centers, or VSTECs. The ILO’s latest report cites allegations from the ITUC regarding two major coercive labor systems operating in Xinjiang. The first involves the mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in VSTECs, which have since transitioned to long-term imprisonment in regular prisons. Released detainees from the centers, according to the report, are often subjected to forced labor in industries such as textiles and electronics. The second system, as detailed by the report, involves the mass transfer of 'surplus' rural workers into state-led labor programs, moving them away from traditional livelihoods into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing. 'In recent years, based on an intensified campaign of investigating and monitoring the poverty status of millions of rural households, the authorities had raised targets leading to increased cross-provincial labor transfers,' the report states. 'At the same time, local authorities had ‘actively guided’ ethnic smallholder farmers to transfer their agricultural plots to large state-led cooperatives, thus ‘liberating’ ‘surplus’ rural workers for transfer into manufacturing or the service sector.' Coercive labor transfers in Tibet The ILO report also highlights concerns over government-mandated labor transfers of Tibetans. 'These policies would apply coercive methods such as military-style vocational training methods and the involvement of political cadres to have Tibetan nomads and farmers swap their traditional livelihoods for jobs providing measurable cash income in industries such as road construction, mining, or food processing, thereby diluting ‘the negative influence of religion,’' the report said. The ITUC estimates that labor transfers in Tibet have increased significantly, affecting as many as 630,000 workers in 2024. Incentives for local labor brokers and companies have contributed to this rise, reinforcing concerns that Tibetans are being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and cultural traditions. International response In recent years, human rights organizations, government bodies and U.N. agencies have repeatedly called for accountability and transparency regarding labor conditions in Xinjiang and Tibet, urging countries and international companies to reassess their ties to supply chains linked to these regions. The United States has taken a strong stance against Uyghur forced labor with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which took effect in 2022. The law bans imports from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they were not made with forced labor, operating on a 'rebuttable presumption' that all goods from the region are tainted by forced labor. Additionally, the U.S. has imposed sanctions and export controls on Chinese entities linked to forced labor, reinforcing its commitment to human rights and ethical trade while pressuring Beijing to end coercive labor programs. While China has maintained that its policies are aimed at poverty alleviation and economic development, the ILO findings reinforce concerns that these initiatives are mechanisms of repression and control. The ILO Committee of Experts has formally requested China to provide detailed explanations and clarify the measures it has taken to address these allegations. The report concludes by urging Beijing to amend national and regional policies to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are not subjected to forced labor under the guise of employment and deradicalization programs. China’s response Liu Pengyu, spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, dismissed the ILO report as 'baseless' and labeled the information as 'false,' aimed at attempting to 'deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development' of Xinjiang and Tibet. 'Some forces keep spreading lies that there are 'forced labor' in Xinjiang and Xizang. The aim is only to smear China's image, denigrate the Chinese government's policies governing Xinjiang and Xizang [Chinese spelling of Tibet], interfere in China's internal affairs, and attempt to deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development of Xinjiang and Xizang,' Liu told VOA in an emailed response late Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-china-expands-forced-labor-in-xinjiang-tibet/7974064.html	2025-02-13T11:40:02-08:00	
AI-driven biometric fraud surges in Africa, fueling financial crimes	Nairobi, Kenya — A new report says the emergence of cheap artificial intelligence tools is leading to a wave of biometric fraud in Africa. The report says fraudsters are using AI to create fake documents, voices, and images that facilitate identity theft and financial crimes. In July 2024, Japhet Ndubi, a Kenyan journalist, lost his phone and could not trace it. He replaced the SIM card, bought a new phone, and went on with his life. Four days later, while on a lunch break, he received a text alerting him that he had sent money to a certain number. 'Now I am using a new phone. When I saw money was sent to a certain number, I was surprised because I have my phone here. I called Safaricom to inquire, ‘How come some money is sent to a certain number without my authorization?’ It's when they told me, ‘Are you sure you are not the one who has withdrawn? Because we see a transaction has been carried out and sent to this number, and we can see you have used your fingerprints to withdraw the money,’' he said. The fraudsters even took out a loan that took him months to pay off. Authorities never made an arrest even though his phone was recovered. Nudbi was a victim of biometric fraud — a type of criminal activity where someone copies another person's unique characteristics, like their voice or fingerprints, to impersonate them and gain access to their devices or financial accounts. Smile ID is a U.S.-based company with offices in Kenya that develops software to protect people’s privacy. A report it released late last month says cases of document forgery and deepfakes are on the rise across Africa, as are simpler phishing attempts — all in an effort to steal money from innocent victims. The Smile ID researchers found that fraudsters especially targeted vulnerable people in low-literacy regions through phishing, data breaches, and making purchases through illicit sources. Stolen data is then exploited to create fraudulent bank accounts to be used for money laundering operations. Joshua Kumah, a Ghanaian, received a fake text claiming that money had been transferred to his mobile banking account. The text led to him losing control of his account and SIM card. 'The person told me to follow a short code that the money would be transferred back to him, so I did that without paying attention to the details. So, by the time I realized it was already too late, I had already given him access to my sim card, so I had to report to cancel that sim card. So, I lost the money I had on that sim. I had to start all over again,' he said. Ndubi is still in shock at how his fingerprints were used to access money through his mobile phone. He says that has changed how he uses the device. 'I was very surprised that they were able to use fingerprints, and I kept asking the telecom provider how they were able to access it but they were not able to tell me. So, I even lost faith in the Mpesa mobile banking application; actually, I have never used it,' he said. To prevent fraud, authorities and businesses now sometimes insist that people present themselves physically and produce valid identification cards to prove their identities. As for average Kenyans, many are trying to avoid using mobile apps on their phones, and are checking with banks and telecom operators about any transactions made in and out of their accounts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-driven-biometric-fraud-surges-in-africa-fueling-financial-crimes/7973925.html	2025-02-13T10:36:10-08:00	
US aircraft carrier collides with merchant ship near Egypt	WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman was involved in a collision at sea with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt, the Navy said Thursday. The collision occurred late Wednesday while both ships were moving. It did not result in flooding or injuries aboard the carrier, and there was no damage to the ship's propulsion systems, the Navy said in a statement. None of the crew on the merchant ship, the Besiktas-M, were injured either, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been made public.

15 wounded in grenade attack in French bar	French police were searching Thursday for an unidentified man who threw a grenade into a bar late Wednesday in the southeastern Alpine city of Grenoble, wounding 15 people, at least two of them seriously, according to health officials. Regional prosecutor Francois Touret de Coucy told reporters witness at the scene reported that shortly after 8 p.m. local time, the man entered the Aksehir bar in what the prosecutor described as a 'rough' part of the city, tossed in a grenade and fled, without saying a word. The suspect was also reported to have been carrying an assault rifle but did not use it. The prosecutor told the French news agency AFP there was no reason to think the attack was related to terrorism, but the motive is still unknown. He said they are exploring the possibility the attack was drug-related. French Health Minister Yannick Neuder spoke with reporters Thursday at the Grenoble University Hospital where many of the victims were being treated. He described the wounds as mostly 'cuts and organ perforations.' He condemned the attack, which he described as an 'an act of unimaginable violence.' Grenoble Mayor Eric Piolle also spoke to reporters Thursday, expressing his shock at the nature of the attack, calling it 'a new kind of violence.' He said he intended to discuss the incident and the general increase in violent crime with French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who was reportedly due to visit the crime scene. The bar is in a neighborhood that was part of the Olympic Village when Grenoble hosted the 1968 Winter Olympic Games. Deputy Mayor Chloe Pantel told AFP the bar is 'a spot where locals and people from outside the neighborhood gather, especially to watch soccer matches.' Several Champions League matches were being played Wednesday night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wounded-in-grenade-attack-in-french-bar/7973924.html	2025-02-13T10:29:16-08:00	
Zelenskyy rejects bilateral US-Russia pact to end Moscow's war against Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that his country would not accept any agreement on its fate decided bilaterally by Russia and the United States on how to end Moscow’s three-year war on Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. 'We, as an independent country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,' Zelenskyy told reporters as he visited a nuclear plant on his way to the Munich Security Conference, where he plans to meet Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they agreed that negotiations to end the war should start immediately, with Trump suggesting the two of them might soon hold a summit in Saudi Arabia. Trump later talked with Zelenskyy and informed him of his discussions with Putin. On Thursday, Zelenskyy said, 'Today it's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral' with the U.S. Still, on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said after talking with Trump, 'We discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and President Trump informed me of what Putin told him. We believe that America’s power is enough to, together with us, together with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin toward peace.' Zelenskyy said he talked with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday, telling him that 'no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. I emphasized that Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength, with strong and reliable security guarantees, and that NATO membership would be the most cost-effective for partners.' 'Another key guarantee is serious investment in Ukraine’s defense industry. I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war,' Zelenskyy said. Trump said, in all caps on his Truth Social media platform on Thursday, 'Great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday. Good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!' Trump’s phone call with Putin came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told other NATO defense chiefs that Ukraine’s goal of restoring its 2014 borders was unrealistic and that the U.S. does not foresee Ukraine joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a negotiated settlement of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Moscow’s forces now hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014. Zelenskyy said it was important for the United States and Ukraine to draw up a plan to end the war before talking to the Russian side. Ukraine has said it is working on a Zelenskyy-Trump meeting, but nothing firm has been announced. Zelenskyy said he did not discuss the possibility of NATO membership during his phone call with Trump, although he said he knew that the United States was against the idea. NATO’s 32-nation bloc says it is committed to eventual Ukraine NATO membership but not while the Russia-Ukraine war rages. Russian officials and state-backed media appeared triumphant after Wednesday’s call between Trump and Putin that lasted more than an hour. 'To us, the position of the current [U.S.] administration is much more appealing,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, said in an online statement, 'The presidents of Russia and the U.S. have talked at last. This is very important in and of itself.' Trump in the past has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia. On Wednesday, after talking with Putin and Zelenskyy, he said, 'I’m backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money,' with U.S. officials suggesting recently that Ukraine agree to supply the U.S. with rare earth minerals for manufacture of technology products in exchange for continued military support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-rejects-bilateral-us-russia-pact-to-end-moscow-s-war-against-ukraine-/7973916.html	2025-02-13T10:26:11-08:00	
Trump hosts India's leader, pushes US defense, energy sales	THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Thursday, where administration officials say he will seek to boost U.S. defense and energy sales and further strengthen Washington’s relationship with the world’s most-populous nation as China flexes its muscles in the region. 'We will aim to build on defense sales to India to ensure they are prioritizing the use of American technology,' said an administration official in a briefing with reporters Thursday morning. As is custom when briefing journalists, the official is not being named. 'The president is also focused on unleashing American energy to the rest of the world and will prioritize India as a key importer of America's natural resources to power their economy,' the official said. 'The two leaders will discuss how we can improve our trade relationship that brings down our bilateral trade deficit and ensure an expanded fair-trade relationship.' When asked directly about New Delhi’s largest concern — of being caught in the wave of reciprocal tariffs Trump has recently imposed as part of an escalating trade war with the world — a second administration official said, 'What you'll see coming out of a meeting today is further momentum towards a solidified, fair — and I emphasize that word ‘fair’ — bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies. And the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025.' That official also touted announcements on 'semiconductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification.' Modi said on X that he was 'looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.' Analysts say China also looms large in these talks, and the White House added that the two leaders would discuss the elevation of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Australia and Japan. 'The sharp deterioration in India-China relations after the 2020 Galwan Valley incident,' in which Indian and Chinese troops clashed over road construction in disputed territory, 'undoubtedly encouraged New Delhi to be more enthusiastic about its strategic partnership with Washington,' said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace. And India-focused analyst Rick Rossow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told VOA about India’s goals. 'As President Trump kind of initiates a trade war against the world, India's got bigger stakes than a lot of countries do in that, and they need to make sure that the relations remain stable,' Rossow said. 'So, they want to be here. They want to be in front. They want to talk about things they can buy from the United States. They want to talk about policies they can resolve and try to make sure that things remain on an even keel, because this relationship, it's important for us. It's vital for India.'

Taliban chief claims Afghan governance rooted in divine commands	ISLAMABAD — The leader of Afghanistan’s governing radical Taliban has defended his policies, including banning female access to education and employment, asserting that they are derived from the 'commands of Allah.' Hibatullah Akhundzada's assertions came days after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced he was seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Taliban leader, holding him 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' A Taliban statement said that Akhundzada addressed teachers, staff and students at a public university in the southern province of Kandahar on Wednesday during his first known visit to a modern education institution, where he also discussed the significance of his edicts. 'The esteemed supreme leader stated that every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s prophet], and represents commands of Allah,' the Taliban chief was quoted as saying. Akhundzada seldom leaves his office in Kandahar and rules impoverished Afghanistan from there through numerous decrees he has issued over the past three years. He has barred girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and blocked female students from accessing university education. Afghan women are banned from most public and private sector employment nationwide. They are not allowed to travel by road or air without a chaperone and cannot visit public places such as parks, gyms or beauty salons. The Taliban supreme leader stated in his speech on Wednesday that religious schools and universities are essentially the same and emphasized the importance of supporting and safeguarding both types of educational institutions in the country. 'Now it is your turn to make Afghanistan competitive globally with your knowledge and wisdom. Work hard so that foreigners come here to learn from you and use your knowledge to succeed globally,' Akhundzada said. 'Professors and students, you must acquire religious and worldly education but serve religion solely.' The Taliban government, not recognized by any country, has established dozens of new Islamic seminaries, known as madrasas, to promote their strict interpretation of Islamic beliefs and laws, according to observers. In his Jan. 23 declaration, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan stated that his decision to seek Akhundzada’s arrest warrants was based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' Khan said. The Taliban condemned Khan’s action as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' The international community has refused to accept the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly over their harsh treatment of women and other human rights concerns. The United States and other Western countries have slapped economic sanctions on the country and primarily isolated the Afghan banking sector since the Taliban takeover. Several senior leaders of the Taliban are still listed as terrorist entities by the United Nations. An international conference of Muslim leaders hosted by Pakistan last month condemned 'extremist ideologies' and religious edicts, known as fatwas, that are rooted in cultural norms obstructing girls' education as a 'grave misuse of religious principles to legitimize policies of deprivation and exclusion.' The conference declaration, without naming the de facto Afghan rulers, noted that anyone who rejects or opposes Islamic principles mandating equal education for men and women 'is considered outside the framework of the Islamic Ummah’s [Islamic world’s] concepts and cannot be regarded as part of it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-chief-claims-afghan-governance-rooted-in-divine-commands/7973832.html	2025-02-13T09:30:34-08:00	
Senate panel advances nomination of Kash Patel, Trump's pick to lead FBI	WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to advance the nomination of Kash Patel, Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, pushing past Democratic concerns that he would operate as a loyalist for the president and target perceived adversaries of the White House. The committee voted 12-10 to send the nomination to the Republican-controlled Senate for full consideration. It was not immediately clear when the final confirmation vote will occur, but so far even nominees once seen as having uncertain prospects — including new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence — have been able to marshal sufficient support from Republicans eager to fall in line with Trump's agenda. Patel has raised alarm for his lack of management experience compared to other FBI directors and because of a vast catalog of incendiary past statements, which include calling investigators who scrutinized Trump 'government gangsters' and describing at least some defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S Capitol as 'political prisoners.' At his confirmation hearing last month, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point that he was trying to make, such as when he proposed shutting down the FBI headquarters in Washington and turning it into a museum for the so-called 'deep state.' And Patel denied the idea that a list in his book of government officials, who he said were part of a 'deep state,' amounted to an 'enemies list,' calling that a 'total mischaracterization.' Patel, who was selected by Trump in November to replace Christopher Wray as FBI director, would inherit an agency riven by turmoil amid the recent forced departures of a group of senior executives and by a highly unusual Justice Department demand for the names of all agents who participated in investigations related to Jan. 6. A letter this week from Senator Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee, cited undisclosed sources in saying that Patel was covertly involved in that process despite telling the panel at his confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any plans to fire agents. A Patel spokeswoman called the allegations 'gossip' aimed at pushing what she said was a 'false narrative.' Democrats portrayed Patel as a dangerous and inexperienced loyalist who would abuse the FBI's law enforcement powers at a time when the country is facing an escalated threat including from China and international terrorism. 'This is a guy whose judgment is beyond questionable. It's appallingly bad,' said Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He added: 'Mark my words: this Patel guy will come back to haunt you.' Durbin told his colleagues 'we are inviting a political disaster if we put Kash Patel into this job.' Addressing Republicans on the committee, Durbin said, 'I know you want to vote for all these nominations. I know none of you want a call from Elon Musk reminding you what he might do to somebody who votes the wrong way, but this really gets down to the heart of the future of an agency that is critical to the security of this nation.' Republicans, by contrast, praised Patel as the right person for the job, insisting he was needed to fix an FBI that they claim has been tainted by bias amid criminal investigations into Trump. 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, tiers of treatment and two tiers of justice. And during the Biden years, this was writ large in the acts of the DOJ and the FBI,' said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Senator Ashley Moody, a Republican from Florida, said that Patel 'might not have served in the upper echelons of the FBI, but aren't we asking this agency to set a new course? Don't we want a nontraditional candidate at this moment in time, with extensive federal experience?' A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel attracted Trump's attention during his first term when, as a staffer on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, he helped author a memo with pointed criticism of the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Patel later joined Trump's administration, both as a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the Defense Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-panel-advances-nomination-of-kash-patel-trump-s-pick-to-lead-fbi/7973808.html	2025-02-13T09:10:09-08:00	
Senate confirms Kennedy for top US health post after close vote	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Donald Trump's health secretary, putting the prominent vaccine skeptic in control of $1.7 trillion in federal spending, vaccine recommendations and food safety as well as health insurance programs for roughly half the country. Republicans fell in line behind Trump despite hesitancy over Kennedy’s views on vaccines, voting 52-48 to elevate the scion of one of America's most storied political — and Democratic — families to secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, was the only 'no' vote among Republicans, mirroring his stands against Trump's picks for the Pentagon chief and director of national intelligence. All Democrats opposed Kennedy. The GOP has largely embraced Kennedy's vision to 'Make America Healthy Again' by directing the public health agencies to focus on chronic diseases such as obesity. Kennedy, 71, whose name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist and sometimes extreme views on food, chemicals and vaccines. His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them. With Trump's backing, Kennedy insisted he was 'uniquely positioned' to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health. Last week, Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, said he hoped Kennedy 'goes wild' in reining in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But before agreeing to support Kennedy, potential holdout Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican a doctor who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations. During Senate hearings, Democrats tried to prod Kennedy to deny a long-discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Some lawmakers also raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers. Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. If confirmed as health secretary, he promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son. Kennedy will take over the agency amid a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off — even if temporarily — billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs. On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars for medical research given to universities and hospitals to develop treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he promised to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-kennedy-for-top-us-health-post-after-close-vote/7973781.html	2025-02-13T09:05:28-08:00	
Vance visits Dachau concentration camp ahead of Zelenskyy meeting	DACHAU, GERMANY — U.S. Vice President JD Vance visited the Dachau concentration camp memorial on Thursday, walking the solemn halls with a group that included a Holocaust survivor once held at the site of so much suffering and mass murder and experiencing firsthand a powerful symbol of World War II. The tour came amid an ongoing war in Europe in which Vance is serving as a key conduit for the Trump administration. The vice president on Friday has critical talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the three-year Russia-Ukraine conflict. A light rain and sleet mix fell as the vice president and his wife, Usha Vance, spoke to a group of dignitaries near one of the concentration camp's gates. The couple then listened intently to details about the camp from its director and other museum officials. Among those participating was Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor who was held at Dachau. The second couple, holding hands, eventually moved inside and to a long concrete room in front of a large map plotting concentration camps. The area was Dachau's administrative room. They next saw the intake room, where those interred arrived at the camp. It included a series of museum cases filled with personal belongings of those who were held there, like watches and government ID cards. 'That's where you started?' Vance said to Naor. Both Joe Biden, during the administration of President Barack Obama, and Mike Pence, in Trump's first term, also visited the Dachau memorial as vice presidents. Vance laid a wreath with a red, white and blue ribbon stenciled with 'We remember' and 'United States of America' embossed in gold lettering at a large sculpture known as the International Monument. Inaugurated in 1968, the monument was designed by Nandor Glid, who was persecuted as a Jew by the Nazis in his home country Yugoslavia and joined the resistance to Nazi occupation forces. On Friday, Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are set to sit down with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. They'll discuss Trump's intensifying push for Ukraine and Russia to begin negotiations to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. Talk of the current conflict followed Vance getting a firsthand look at the memorial demonstrating Nazis' World War II-era atrocities and the U.S. and Western allies' slowness to take decisive action to confront Adolf Hitler and the rise of his violent nationalist ideology. Dachau was established in 1933, the year Hitler took power, as one of the first concentration camps. More than 200,000 people from across Europe were held at the camp, and more than 40,000 prisoners died there in horrendous conditions. U.S. soldiers completed the liberation on April 29, 1945. Vance, a Republican, is on a five-day visit to France and Germany, his first overseas travel since becoming vice president last month. The moment at Dachau gave Vance a chance to reflect on the scourges of war just as Trump is ratcheting up his efforts to end the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Trump on Wednesday spoke separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. Trump said that he and Putin agreed it was time to 'start negotiations immediately' to end the war. And, as Trump announced his agreement on negotiations with Putin, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops. Trump subsequently said he thought that analysis was correct, and he was noncommittal about if Ukraine should be an equal partner if the U.S. and Russia engage in more substantive negotiations to end the war on its soil. Besides his talks with Zelenskyy, Vance is scheduled to deliver a Friday address to the security conference. The war in Europe and NATO members' defense spending are expected to be front and center for the world leaders gathering in Munich. Vance, like Trump, has been a sharp critic of U.S. allies' spending what the administration deems too little on their defense budgets. 'The Trump administration has been clear that we care a lot about Europe,' Vance said during a meeting this week with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 'But we also want to make sure that we're engaged in a security partnership that's both good for Europe and the United States.' Over nearly three years of war, 50 countries, known as the Ukraine Contact Group, have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as chair of the group since its creation. Trump in his 2024 campaign derided the enormous amount of U.S. military aid poured into Ukraine and vowed to end the conflict within 24 hours of returning to the White House. Since his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump and his advisers have dialed back on their boldest timelines and set a goal of ending the war in about six months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-visits-dachau-concentration-camp-ahead-of-zelenskyy-meeting/7973772.html	2025-02-13T08:52:16-08:00	
Ukraine, US weigh critical minerals agreement	Ukraine and the United States are considering a crucial minerals deal at this week's Munich Security Conference, according to officials from the two countries. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the proposed agreement as a potential 'long-term security shield' for Ukraine when its war with Russia comes to an end. Zelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine had received the first draft of the agreement and expressed hope that a final deal could be reached in Munich. Ukraine aims to secure continued U.S. support as it tries to stand strong against the ongoing Russian invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has stated his desire to strike a deal for Ukraine’s rare earth mineral resources in return for continued U.S. backing of the Ukrainian war effort. 'I told them (Ukraine) that I want the equivalent [of] like $500 billion worth of rare earth,' Trump told Fox News in an interview aired Monday. Strategic resources in shifting global landscape Global competition for critical raw materials essential for industry has intensified in recent years. CRMs in demand include uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite, nickel and aluminum, as well as rare earth minerals used in an array of high-tech devices. Currently, China is the world’s top supplier of rare earth minerals. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, China supplies about 40% of the European Union’s demand for those resources. Other significant suppliers include Australia, South Africa, Canada and Brazil. The United States and the European Union have worked for years to reduce their reliance on China for the minerals. That’s where Ukraine comes in. The United States maintains a list of 50 critical raw materials, and Ukraine possesses at least 22 of the elements, according to Serhii Voitsehovskyi, a board member of Ukrainian mining investment company BGV. That includes significant deposits of rare earth materials, although the minerals are so far mostly untapped due to the war and a lack of sufficient geological data. Proven reserves include some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, uranium, titanium and lithium — materials essential for many industries, including renewable energy and defense. 'We have the largest lithium deposits in Europe and significant uranium reserves, which are becoming increasingly valuable as nuclear energy experiences a global resurgence,' Voitsehovskyi said. Roman Opimakh, former general director of the Ukrainian Geological Survey, said that the U.S. has become increasingly desperate for reliable sources of CRMs. 'Over the past few years, the U.S. has seen a 24% reduction in CRM production,' he told VOA. 'At the same time, China has moved to ban direct exports of certain materials, favoring value-added products instead. This creates an urgent need for alternative sources, and Ukraine is well-positioned to fill this gap.' Geological diversity The World Economic Forum estimates that Ukraine's rich geological diversity ranks it among the world’s top 10 mineral resource suppliers, holding about 5% of global reserves. China’s dominance in CRM markets stems from decades of strategic investment. Ukraine hopes to develop a similar long-term vision, using its resources to bolster its economy and enhance integration with Western economies. 'For Ukraine, developing this sector is not just about exports — it’s about building a strong local economy that provides jobs and stability. For our international partners, it’s about securing a reliable and democratic source of these essential materials,' Voitsehovskyi said. The continuing Russian invasion — and any peace deal that left Russia in control of Ukraine’s eastern provinces — might complicate those plans. Opimakh says five to 10 key deposits of critical raw materials are in areas occupied by Russian troops. 'These deposits have reserves, proven reserves,' he said. 'Among them are earth elements and lithium, at least, and manganese.' However, he added, 'a majority of critical minerals are located in territory controlled by the Ukrainian government.' Ukraine’s CRM industry needs development Historically, Ukraine has been a significant player in the mining industry, with substantial operations in coal, iron and other commodities. However, the country’s CRM sector is still in its early stages. Unlike established industries, the development of CRM mining requires advanced exploration and processing technologies, areas in which Ukraine is seeking international investment and expertise. 'Mining and processing CRMs in Ukraine can have a transformative effect on Ukraine's economy, providing jobs, infrastructure development and technological advancements,' Opimakh said. 'At the same time, it enhances global security by reducing dependence on a single supplier.' BGV has already invested $100 million in CRM projects; however, Voitsehovskyi said that scaling up operations requires additional financing. 'Developing a graphite mining project in Balakhivka (Kirovohrad region), for example, requires approximately $450 million in capital expenditures,' he said. As Ukraine seeks to establish itself as a key player in the CRM sector, partnerships with the U.S. and other Western countries will be essential, analysts say. The partnerships would be strategic as well as economic; they would ensure a stable and diversified supply of critical materials for the global market while strengthening Ukraine’s post-war recovery and economic growth resilience. 'We believe in a win-win strategy. Ukraine has the resources, and our partners require these materials. Together, we can develop a sustainable, high-value industry that benefits everyone,' Voitsehovskyi said.

Thai lawyers' council to investigate alleged killing by soldiers	Bangkok — An influential lawyers’ association in Thailand said Thursday it is launching an investigation into the alleged killing of a Myanmar man by Thai soldiers last year, a move it says could lead to lawsuits against any officers involved. The Lawyers Council of Thailand, which accredits the country’s attorneys, announced the probe after accepting a formal complaint about the case from Fortify Rights, an international advocacy group that previously carried out an investigation into the case. In a report published last year, Fortify Rights alleged that three unidentified soldiers brutally beat Aung Ko Ko to death with bamboo rods in Baan Tai village, near the Myanmar border, on January 12, 2024, after disputing his membership in a security patrol team made up of local civilians. The courts never charged any soldiers in the case, but convicted another civilian and Myanmar national, Sirachuch, who goes by one name, with manslaughter in September. Fortify Rights claims Sirachuch is being used as a scapegoat. Sirachuch has said he saw the soldiers attack Aung Ko Ko. 'After the Lawyers Council has taken the complaint, we will then investigate the nature and circumstances of the death of Aung Ko Ko. After that, we will take appropriate legal action,' Council President Wichien Chubthaisong told a press conference in Bangkok announcing the move. 'We will set up a subcommittee to conduct a fact-finding operation, hoping this will lead to the consideration of legal aid services and ensure that justice prevails for the family of Aung Ko Ko,' he added. 'Everyone has the right to have their human rights protected and respected under the law. Citizens in general should not be punished arbitrarily,' the chairman said. Afterward, Wichien told VOA the evidence that Fortify Rights has gathered implicating the army appeared credible and that the council could pursue civil or criminal charges against any soldiers it identifies as suspects. 'With credible evidence and a strong case, I think what we can continue to do is to prosecute other people involved in this case,' he said. Neither the Royal Thai Armed Forces nor the Royal Thai Police, which investigated Aung Ko Ko’s death last year and filed the charges that led to Sirachuch’s conviction, replied to VOA’s requests for comment. Fortify Rights says the army has denied any responsibility for Aung Ko Ko’s death, both to local media and a House of Representatives committee hearing, claiming he was tortured on the Myanmar side of the border before his body was dumped on Thai soil. The rights group denies the army’s claim and says it undermines the authorities’ case against Sirachuch, which rests on Thailand having jurisdiction over an attack by Sirachuch on Aung Ko Ko in Thailand. Sirachuch, who is now serving a prison sentence of three years and four months, confessed to striking Aung Ko Ko once on the back and twice on the shins. Fortify Rights, though, says that falls well short of manslaughter. It says the post-mortem report by the hospital that examined Aung Ko Ko’s body states he died of 'head injuries caused by physical assault,' and that three eyewitnesses to the attack, Sirachuch included, claim it was the soldiers who beat Aung Ko Ko on the head. 'This is a grave miscarriage of justice at multiple levels and we are very heartened to see Thai leaders like Dr. Wichien willing to take a closer look at this case,' Fortify Rights CEO Matthew Smith said at Thursday’s press conference. Afterward, Smith said his group pursued the council’s help because of its influence and connections with Thai authorities, especially its links to the Department of Special Investigation, or DSI. The department is a special Ministry of Justice unit that investigates some of the country’s highest profile and sensitive cases, including those that may involve public corruption and abuse of power. Wichien is on the department’s board of special cases, which guides its work and is chaired by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. 'So, the fact that the Lawyers Council is willing to take a closer look at this case, we hope, is one important step closer to DSI also doing a formal investigation,' Smith told VOA. 'This is the type of situation where DSI can get involved and actually uncover the truth and ensure actual justice takes place,' he added. 'In some ways, DSI can unravel coverups, and DSI has the skills and ability and the influence and power to ensure justice in these really difficult cases.' In its report on Aung Ko Ko’s death, Fortify Rights says it interviewed 23 people during its investigation, including witnesses, acquaintances and relatives, and spoke with local police. It says he had been living in Thailand for many years and was a well-known member of the community’s civilian security team, known locally as Chor Ror Bor, which is trained and organized by Thai authorities. The report says the soldiers who detained Aung Ko Ko the day he died, and who later beat him, disputed his membership in the team, even after other members arrived to vouch for him. After the attack, it adds, Aung Ko Ko, badly bruised and bloodied, was being helped to the Myanmar border by other locals, on orders from the soldiers, when he collapsed and died of his wounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-lawyers-council-to-investigate-alleged-killing-by-soldiers/7973681.html	2025-02-13T07:43:51-08:00	
Archaeologists unearth remains of Roman basilica on site of new London skyscraper	LONDON — Work to give 21st-century London yet another skyscraper has uncovered traces — in fact chunks — of the city's origins almost 2,000 years ago. Archaeologists exploring the site of a planned 32-story office tower announced Thursday that they have unearthed the remains of a Roman basilica that once stood at the heart of the city known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished for the tower at 85 Gracechurch St. uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations, up to 1 meter (over 3 feet) wide, 4 meters (13 feet) deep and two millennia old. Sophie Jackson of Museum of London Archaeology called it 'one of the most significant discoveries' in years in London's oldest quarter, the City – the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and even earlier structures. What's been uncovered are the foundations of a two-story building, almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded Britain and some 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement. The basilica was part of the forum — the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London — where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance. It's the 'beating heart of the city,' said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. 'It kind of towers above the city. And so it's a real symbol of Roman power and authority. 'We're talking about the early stages of London here, but it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy,' he said. Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center. Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the 'absolutely massive' foundations discovered in several test pits suggests an 'extraordinary' level of preservation. Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses, and even ancient trash could give glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners. Property developers in Britain routinely have to consult archaeologists as part of their planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Saxon jewelry to medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims. The latest discovery adds to the scant traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of ancient wall, a portion of amphitheater beneath the Guildhall and a temple to the god Mithras which lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg. 'We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,' Henderson-Schwartz said. 'But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/archaeologists-unearth-remains-of-roman-basilica-on-site-of-new-london-skyscraper-/7973638.html	2025-02-13T07:42:14-08:00	
Escape from war: How a Ukrainian evacuation center works	Police and volunteers in Ukraine are moving quickly to evacuate people from front-line areas as the Russian army advances.

UNICEF says armed men in eastern DR Congo raped hundreds of children	Dakar, Senegal — Armed men in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo raped hundreds of children and recruited child soldiers at unprecedented levels, the U.N. children's fund said Thursday, as the conflict in the mineral-rich region intensified in recent weeks. 'In the North and South Kivu provinces, we are receiving horrific reports of grave violations against children by parties to the conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence at levels surpassing anything we have seen in recent years,' UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. 'One mother recounted to our staff how her six daughters, the youngest just 12 years old, were systematically raped by armed men while searching for food,' Russell added. More than 100 armed groups are vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. The M23 rebels — the most prominent armed group in the region— captured Goma, the region's largest city, in late January in a major escalation of the yearslong fighting with government forces. During the week of Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, health facilities in the restive region reported 572 rape cases, a more than fivefold increase compared to the previous week, Lianne Gutcher, Chief of Communications at UNICEF in the Democratic Republic of Congo, told The Associated Press. 170 of those treated were children, she added. Armed men perpetrated the rapes but it was unclear what specific armed group or army they belonged to, Gutcher said. 'It is suspected that all parties to the conflict committed sexual violence,' she added. Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council launched a commission that will investigate the atrocities, including rapes and summary executions, committed by both Congo's army and M23 in eastern Congo since the beginning of the year. On Monday, 84 Congolese soldiers accused of murder, rape and other crimes against civilians in the country's conflict-battered east were put on trial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unicef-says-armed-men-in-eastern-dr-congo-raped-hundreds-of-children/7973628.html	2025-02-13T07:04:54-08:00	
Pakistan, Turkey to boost strategic ties	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan and Turkey pledged to deepen cooperation in defense, mining, energy and other sectors during the seventh round of the Pakistan-Turkey High Level Strategic Cooperation Council in Islamabad on Thursday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan co-chaired the highest-level bilateral discussion forum with Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif. After the closed-door delegation-level talks Thursday, the two sides exchanged 24 signed documents, including a joint declaration, a few agreements, and several memoranda of understanding. 'We have agreed to further strengthen our relations,' Erdogan said in remarks broadcast live after the talks. The text of the joint declaration was not released. However, a brief statement from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it 'gives a roadmap for further deepening, diversifying and institutionalizing the strategic partnership between Pakistan and Turkey.' Sharif and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed the Turkish leader Wednesday night at a military airbase near the capital with much fanfare. From a 21-gun salute to a fighter jet flyby and traditional Pakistani dancers on the motorcade’s route, to a special song honoring Erdogan blaring across TV channels, Islamabad pulled out all the stops for the Turkish president, who returned after five years for a brief visit ending Thursday night. Broad cooperation Both sides agreed to cooperate in air force electronic warfare and to collaborate on defense production, with a memorandum of understanding, or MoU, signed between Turkey’s Secretariat of Defense Industries and Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense Production and another MoU between Turkey’s state-owned Aerospace Industries and Pakistan’s Naval Research and Development Institute. Over the last decade Pakistan and Turkey have ramped up defense production cooperation. That cooperation includes joint production of four MILGEM corvette warships for delivery to Pakistan, helping the South Asian country upgrade its aging fighter jet fleet, and the sharing and transfer of defense technologies. Pakistan and Turkey also agreed to upgrade their existing trade agreement and reiterated a past pledge to boost annual bilateral trade volume to $5 billion from roughly $1.5 billion. In May 2023, the two signed a Preferential Trade Agreement, reducing Pakistani tariffs on 130 product categories, while Turkey cut down tariffs on 261 product lines. Sharif announced Turkish firms will build a special economic zone in Pakistan for industrial production, despite Pakistan’s struggle to attract investment to special economic zones set up as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Both sides agreed on a protocol to amend their existing agreement of cooperation in the field of hydrocarbons and signed an MoU to help Pakistan’s energy transition. The South Asian country is aiming to decrease reliance on expensive foreign fuel and transition to affordable and abundant green energy. Pakistan reached an MoU with Turkey on mining cooperation as well, a sector Islamabad is anxious to bring foreign investment to. Under the bilateral strategic cooperation council, six joint standing committees cover a broad array of sectors, including trade, investment, banking, finance, culture, tourism, energy, defense, agriculture, transportation, communication, IT, health, science and technology, and education. Both sides signed cooperation documents in almost all the fields. In his brief remarks after the talks, Sharif pledged to fight terrorism jointly with Turkey. The Pakistani leader then singled out Afghanistan as a source of the violence. 'Afghanistan is a neighboring country, and we expect that Afghanistan will cooperate in fighting terrorism and not spreading terrorism and in that we are together,' Sharif said. Although Erdogan expressed support for Pakistan’s fight against terrorism in his remarks, the Turkish leader stopped short of naming Afghanistan as a root cause. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers reject accusation of harboring anti-Pakistan fighters on their soil. Critical timing The two allies held their highest-level dialogue at a critical time in the Middle East. 'We discussed not only our bilateral relations but also regional and global developments extensively,' Erdogan said. The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria has strengthened Ankara’s position in the region, but it has also put Turkey in direct competition with Israel, whose troops have advanced into Syrian territory. 'Turkey understands that increasing defense and strategic ties with countries like Pakistan, another established middle-sized defense power, are even more for interest for Turkey,' Umer Karim, a researcher at the University of Birmingham, told VOA. 'Sharing bilateral defense production technologies and learning is a key aspect,' Karim said. The civil war in Syria also has deeply affected militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Fighters from those countries fought alongside Syrian militias. But Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, a regional offshoot of the terror outfit IS, has brought more violence to the two South Asian neighbors. With Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, or HTS, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, now controlling Syria, security observers say Ankara and Islamabad need help from each other to manage nonstate actors. 'With Shia militias and movement from various nonstate actors, from Sunni militias moving into Syria as well, and now that the conflict has subsided, their ultimate return and its impact on the region is going to play a tremendous amount of role,' Iftikhar Firdaus, editor of The Khorasan Diary, told VOA. The online platform monitors militant activity. A delegation of Turkish corporate leaders joined Erdogan on the visit to boost trade ties with Pakistan. Sharif and Erdogan also addressed the Pakistan-Turkey Business Forum in Islamabad on Thursday. 'Turkey can explore Pakistan in two ways,' Khurram Schehzad, advisor to Pakistan’s finance minister, told VOA. 'One is as an investment corridor; the second is that Pakistan can become Turkey’s export hub into the Asia-Pacific region.' Schehzad acknowledged that despite deep strategic and people-to-people ties, Pakistan and Turkey have failed to develop a strong economic relationship. 'What I would like to have is, how the follow-up is done post-MoUs and how that MoU is converted into value,' Schehzad said. The previous session of the Pakistan-Turkey High Level Strategic Cooperation Council was held in Islamabad in February 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-turkey-to-boost-strategic-ties/7973580.html	2025-02-13T06:48:11-08:00	
China's fuel demand may have passed its peak, IEA says	London — China's demand for road and air transport fuels may have passed its peak, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Thursday, citing data showing that the country's consumption of gasoline, gasoil and jet fuel declined marginally in 2024. Combined consumption of the three fuels in China last year was at 8.1 million barrels per day (bpd), which was 200,000 bpd lower than in 2021 and only narrowly above 2019 levels, the IEA said in a monthly report. 'This strongly suggests that fuel use in the country has already reached a plateau and may even have passed its peak,' it said. After decades of leading global oil demand growth, China's contribution is sputtering as it faces economic challenges as well as making a shift to electric vehicles (EVs). The decline in China's fuel demand is likely to accelerate over the medium term, which would be enough to generate a plateau in total China oil demand this decade, according to the Paris-based IEA. 'This remarkable slowdown in consumption growth has been achieved by a combination of structural changes in China's economy and the rapid deployment of alternative transportation technologies,' the IEA said. A slump in China’s construction sector and weaker consumer spending reduced fuel demand in the country, it said, adding that uptake of EVs also weighed. New EVs currently account for half of car sales and undercut around 250,000-300,000 bpd of oil demand growth in 2024, while use of compressed and liquified natural gas in road freight displaced around 150,000 bpd, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-fuel-demand-may-have-passed-its-peak-iea-says/7973458.html	2025-02-13T04:53:27-08:00

Authorities said two of the people hurt had serious injuries. It was not immediately clear if the incident was intentional or an accident. The city is due to host the Munich Security Conference beginning Friday. Conference organizers issued a statement saying they were 'deeply saddened' by the incident.

Anti-government protest halts air traffic in Belgium	Brussles — Thousands of Belgians took to the streets on Thursday in protest over the new government's planned pension reforms in the first day of a multi-day strike that halted all air traffic in the country. Brussels airport canceled 430 flights on Thursday, a spokesperson said, adding that the disruption to the air traffic sector would last just one day. Protesters held signs with slogans such as 'We're not lemons,' and some displayed plaques featuring Latin phrases, a nod to new Prime Minister Bart De Wever's tendency to include Latin quotes whenever possible. The strike was also expected to disrupt public transport and postal services, with firefighters and military personnel joining the protests as well. The planned pension reform rewards those who work past retirement age, with 35 years of service, while early retirees without 35 years, face a penalty. The new system is less favorable for lower-income earners compared to the previous one, which provided a lump sum based on career length. Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever's government was sworn in on Feb. 3, after eight months of negotiations that resulted in a five-party coalition including right-wing, centrist, and socialist party, Vooruit. The socialist union had warned that a strike would be called if Vooruit joined the predominantly center-right government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-government-protest-halts-air-traffic-in-belgium/7973406.html	2025-02-13T03:53:57-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon back in court for impeachment hearing	Seoul — South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol will get another hearing next week before judges decide on whether to formally remove him from office over his martial law decree, the country's Constitutional Court said Thursday. The former prosecutor has remained defiant throughout weeks of hearings, blaming a 'malicious' opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule. The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down and later impeached him over the move. Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. Thursday's hearing was widely expected -- but not officially confirmed -- to be Yoon's last before the judges go behind closed doors to deliberate upholding his impeachment. But as proceedings wrapped up, the court said it would add another hearing next Tuesday. Prosecutors had argued the 'time was ripe' for the case to be decided while Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told the hearing that the impeachment trial 'continues to be conducted in an unlawful and unfair manner.' Yoon's legal team also warned they would 'make a serious decision' if that persists, though they did not specify what action would be taken. 'Unanimous ruling' expected Following the trial, the process could take up to a fortnight. Previously impeached presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates. If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president. 'Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favor of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges,' Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law, told AFP. But experts had warned that political wrangling could hold up the trial -- prominent Yoon supporters have called for more hearings. Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centered on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. Yoon's lawyers told reporters on Thursday that his martial law declaration was 'an act of governance and cannot be subject to judicial review.' Yoon also suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out. The suspended president's supporters have gathered outside the court throughout his weeks-long trial. Some have held 'Stop the Steal' signs -- borrowing U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric to support unproven claims that recent South Korean elections were manipulated by shadowy foreign forces. Yoon's legal team announced it would officially launch a 'citizen defense team' of supporters seeking to 'save' him and have him reinstated. According to the lawyers, 15,000 people have applied to join the team. Yoon is also facing a separate criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. That trial is set to begin next Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-back-in-court-for-impeachment-hearing/7973402.html	2025-02-13T03:45:54-08:00	
Chinese apps face scrutiny in US but users keep scrolling	Seoul — As a high school junior in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, Daneel Kutsenko never gave much thought to China. Last month, though, as the U.S. government prepared to ban TikTok – citing national security concerns about its Chinese ownership – Kutsenko downloaded RedNote, another Chinese video-sharing app, which he felt gave him a new perspective on China. 'It just seems like people who live their life and have fun,' Kutsenko told VOAof RedNote, which reportedly attracted hundreds of thousands of U.S. users in the leadup to the now-paused TikTok ban. Kutsenko’s move is part of a larger trend. Even as U.S. policymakers grow louder in their warnings about Chinese-owned apps, they have become a central part of American life. TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, boasts 170 million U.S. users. China’s AI chatbot DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings, including those in the United States, for several days after its release last month. Another major shift has come in online shopping, where Americans are flocking to digital Chinese marketplaces such as Temu and Shein in search of ultra-low prices on clothes, home goods, and other items. According to a 2024 survey by Omnisend, an e-commerce marketing company, 70% of Americans shopped on Chinese platforms during the past year, with 20% doing so at least once a week. Multifaceted threat U.S. officials warn that Chinese apps pose a broad range of threats – whether to national security, privacy, human rights, or the economy. TikTok has been the biggest target. Members of Congress attempting to ban the app cited concerns that China’s government could use TikTok as an intelligence-gathering tool or manipulate its algorithms to push narratives favorable to Beijing. Meanwhile, Chinese commerce apps face scrutiny for their rock-bottom prices, which raise concerns about ethical sourcing and potential links to forced labor, Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research organization, said in an email conversation with VOA. 'It raises questions of how sustainably these products are made,' Havrén, who focuses on China’s foreign policy and great power competition, said. Moreover, he said, 'the pricing simply kills local manufacturers and businesses.' Many U.S. policymakers also warn Chinese apps pose greater privacy risks, since Chinese law requires companies to share data with the government on request. ‘Curiosity and defiance’ Still, a growing number of Americans appear unfazed. Many young people in particular seem to shrug off the privacy concerns, arguing that their personal data is already widely exposed. 'They could get all the data they want. And anyway, I’m 16 – what are they going to find? Oh my gosh, he goes to school? There’s not much,' Kutsenko said. Ivy Yang, an expert on U.S.-China digital interaction, told VOA many young Americans also find it unlikely that they would ever be caught up in a Chinese national security investigation. 'What they’re chasing is a dopamine peak. They’re not thinking about whether or not the dance videos or the cat tax pictures they swipe on RedNote are going to be a national security threat,' Yang, who founded the New York-based consulting company Wavelet Strategy, said. Yang said the TikTok ban backlash and surge in RedNote downloads may reflect a shift in how young Americans see China – not just as a geopolitical rival, but as a source of apps they use in daily life. She also attributes their skepticism to a broader cultural mindset – one shaped by a mix of curiosity, defiance, and a growing distrust of institutions, including conventional media. Jeremy Goldkorn, a longtime analyst of U.S.-China digital trends and an editorial fellow at the online magazine ChinaFile, said growing disillusionment with America’s political turmoil and economic uncertainty has intensified these shifts. 'It makes it much more difficult for, particularly, young people to get worked up about what China’s doing when they feel so horrified about their own country,' Goldkorn said during a recent episode of the Sinica podcast, which focuses on current affairs in China. Polling reflects this divide. A 2024 Pew survey found 81% of Americans view China unfavorably, but younger adults are less critical – only 27% of those under 30 have strongly negative views, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. Digital barrier While Chinese apps are expanding in the United States, in many ways the digital divide remains as impenetrable as ever. China blocks nearly all major Western platforms and tightly controls its own apps, while the U.S. weighs new restrictions on Chinese tech. Though President Donald Trump paused the TikTok ban, his administration has signaled broader efforts to curb China’s tech influence. Trump officials have hinted they could take steps to regulate DeepSeek, the Chinese digital chatbot. The Trump administration also recently signaled it intends to close a trade loophole that lets Chinese retailers bypass import duties and customs checks. Broader challenges Even as Washington debates how to handle the rise of Chinese apps, some analysts say the conversation risks obscuring the deeper issue of the broader role of social media itself. Rogier Creemers, a specialist in digital governance at Leiden University, told VOA that while Chinese apps may raise valid concerns for Western countries, they are just one part of a larger, unaddressed problem. 'There’s a whole range of social ills that emerge from these social media that I think are far more important than anything the Chinese Communist Party could do,' he said, pointing to issues like digital addiction, declining attention spans, and the way social media amplifies misinformation and political unseriousness. 'And that would apply whether these apps are Chinese-owned or American-owned or Tajikistani-owned, as far as I’m concerned,' he added. The United States, Creemer said, has taken a more hands-off approach to regulating online platforms, in part due to strong free speech protections and pushback by the tech industry. Apps or influence? For millions of Americans, the bigger debates about China and digital influence barely register when they open TikTok. Kutsenko said neither he nor his friends have strong opinions about U.S.-China tensions. They just wanted an alternative to TikTok – one that felt fun, familiar, and easy to use. It’s a sign that while policymakers see Chinese apps as part of a growing tech rivalry, for many Americans they’re just another way to scroll, shop, and stay entertained, no matter where they come from.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-apps-face-scrutiny-in-us-but-users-keep-scrolling/7973393.html	2025-02-13T03:36:15-08:00	
Several injured after motorist hits crowd of people in Munich	BERLIN — A motorist has driven a car into a group of people in the German city of Munich, leaving several people injured, police said on Thursday. The Bild newspaper reported that 15 people had been injured. The Munich Security Conference is to start on Friday and U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy are scheduled to arrive later Thursday. A large-scale police operation was underway near the southern city's central train station. Police said on X they were able to detain the driver and did not consider him to pose further threat. The incident appears to have affected people participating in a demonstration linked to a strike organized by the Verdi union, according to the local BR broadcaster. The union said it did not have any information on the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-injured-after-motorist-hits-crowd-of-people-in-munich/7973359.html	2025-02-13T02:39:33-08:00	
Hamas expresses commitment to ceasefire with Israel	The militant group Hamas expressed its commitment to a ceasefire with Israel on Thursday, as mediators worked to preserve the halt in fighting amid accusations of violations and threats of a return to war. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation (Israel) adheres to it fully,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said. Qanoua also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, the country’s Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-expresses-commitment-to-ceasefire-with-israel/7973353.html	2025-02-13T02:32:10-08:00	
Russian drone attack hits Odesa port infrastructure	Ukrainian officials said Thursday a Russian drone attack injured one person and damaged port infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said the attack hit the Izmail area, which is located along the Danube River. Close to the same area, Romania’s Ministry of National Defense said Thursday its systems detected a drone crossing into Romanian airspace before going into Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement it 'strongly condemns these attacks conducted by the Russian Federation against certain Ukrainian civilian infrastructure facilities and elements, which are unjustified and severely breaching the norms of international law.' Moldova, which shares borders with Ukraine and Romania in the same region, reported Thursday that two Russian drones exploded on its soil. Moldovan President Maia Sandu said the incident put the lives of people in her country as risk. 'Russia respects no borders, attacks civilians, spreads terror,' Sandu said on X. 'Its war on Ukraine is criminal. Leave us, peaceful nations, alone.' Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 85 of the 140 total drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava and Sumy regions, the military said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that drone, artillery and missile attacks damaged 10 houses, along with a business, powerlines and a gas pipeline. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 83 Ukrainian drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Nearly half of the drones were shot down over the Bryansk region, where an official said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said the attacks damaged several houses in his region.

Suicide bombing at Afghan ministry kills 1, injures several	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials said Thursday a suicide bomb explosion outside a ministry building in the Afghan capital of Kabul killed at least one person and injured several others. The blast occurred when security guards at the entrance to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing intercepted and killed a suicide bomber, an Interior Ministry spokesperson told VOA. Abdul Mateen Qani confirmed the casualties, saying a member of Taliban security was killed, and three others were wounded in the ensuing explosion. No immediate claims of responsibility were made, but suspicions fell on a regional Islamic State group affiliate, Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K. The attack came two days after IS-K took credit for a suicide bombing outside a bank in the northeastern Afghan city of Kunduz that killed at least five people and wounded several others. Multiple sources reported that the victims of the Tuesday blast were predominantly Taliban security personnel who had assembled to collect their salaries. IS-K has plotted repeated high-profile attacks since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. The violence has killed hundreds of people, including senior Taliban leaders, religious figures and members of the Afghan Shiite community. The back-to-back bombings this week followed the Taliban’s renewed claims that their security forces nearly eliminated IS-K presence in the country, rendering the group incapable of posing a threat within or beyond Afghan borders. The United Nations and independent critics remain skeptical about the Taliban’s assertions. U.N. counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting on Monday that IS-K is one of the 'most dangerous' Islamic State branches and 'continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bombing-at-afghan-ministry-kills-1-injures-several/7973342.html	2025-02-13T01:48:14-08:00

US allies seek clarity on Ukraine support at Munich Security Conference	LONDON — Hundreds of world leaders and delegates are set to attend the Munich Security Conference in Germany this weekend, with conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo high on the agenda, alongside simmering tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. It’s the first major global summit for the new administration in Washington under President Donald Trump and comes amid speculation that his America First agenda could presage significant changes in U.S. foreign policy. US delegation The U.S. delegation includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'We are very happy that we will have a strong representation of both the administration of the new American government there, as well as representation from Congress,' said conference chairman Christoph Heusgen. 'And so, the American point of view will also be presented on stage, as will the European point of view, and that of other regions. And then, and that is what Munich stands for, there will be a dialogue, a discussion about the many issues at hand,' Heusgen told Reuters. Vance is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich. Ukraine’s war against Russia’s full-scale invasion is about to enter its fourth year. Zelenskyy said this week he shared a 'common vision' with the Trump administration. 'Of course, there may be different opinions, but a common vision of the main things — of how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and how to give guarantees of security to Ukraine and Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy told reporters on Monday. 'Unrealistic' However, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that American troops would not be deployed to Ukraine following any ceasefire deal with Russia and ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv. He also described Ukraine’s hopes to return to its pre-2014 borders with Russia as unrealistic. 'European allies must lead from the front,' Hegseth told reporters in Brussels following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. President Trump has made clear he wants a quick end to the war but it’s not clear how that might be achieved. Trump announced Wednesday he and Putin agreed in a phone call to 'immediately' begin negotiations with Ukraine to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict. NATO allies Nevertheless, U.S. allies sense a change in tone from the president since his inauguration last month, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research group. 'Though Trump has said a lot of things to worry a lot of people on tariffs, on trade, on Gaza and so on, he hasn't yet said anything particularly crazy from a European point of view about Ukraine or NATO. He hasn't repeated his threat to pull out of NATO. He said the Europeans should spend more [on defense] but most of us agree with him on that. He hasn't said he's going to cut off all aid for Ukraine,' Grant told VOA. 'One of the issues that will come up in Munich is to what extent the Europeans should help to keep the peace if there is a ceasefire in Ukraine. And certainly, President [Emmanuel] Macron of France, and to some degree the British, and possibly Friedrich Merz who may well be the next German chancellor, are all in favor of sending troops to keep the peace in Ukraine, if there's a peace to be kept,' Grant added. Ukrainian hopes On the streets of Kyiv, some Ukrainians expressed hope that the Munich conference will strengthen Ukrainian ties with the Trump administration. 'We hope that this personal meeting between President Zelenskyy and Vice President Vance will give an opportunity to convey the real situation of what is happening today in the Russian-Ukrainian war,' sociologist Asked Ashurbekov told The Associated Press. Ukrainian journalist Borden Semeniuk was less optimistic. 'The country has been living in expectation for three years, and because of this, belief in this expectation has decreased. ... I would like to see some relief from the situation. But it is impossible to live in the hope that it will 100 percent happen at this meeting,' Semeniuk told AP. Russia and Iran have not been invited to Munich. Last year, the conference organizers said their governments had not shown a serious interest in negotiations. China The official report of the Munich Security Conference cites the 'multipolarization of the international order' — a theme welcomed by China, which is sending a large delegation to the summit. 'The report shows that the international community's acceptance of a multipolar world is on the rise. … China has always called for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization,' Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. Earlier this week, the U.S Navy sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, prompting an angry response from Beijing. China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent months. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunified with the mainland, while Taipei considers the island a sovereign state. Secretary of State Rubio is due to hold a trilateral meeting with allies Japan and South Korea while in Munich. Gaza Conflict in the Middle East will also top the agenda at the Munich conference, amid fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is at risk. President Trump’s repeated suggestion that Palestinians should leave Gaza will overshadow the conference, said analyst Charles Grant. 'I don't see it happening because you can't just eliminate 2 million people and put them nowhere at all,' Grant said. 'But I think most European governments are hoping that Trump will just push this for a while, and he'll get bored of it and talk about something else – and hope he will kind of move on and forget it. But so long as he does talk about it, it's very disruptive and creates a lot of ill-feeling between European and many other governments, and the U.S.,' Grant told VOA. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence also feature on a packed agenda across the three-day conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-allies-seek-clarity-on-ukraine-support-at-munich-security-conference/7972522.html	2025-02-13T00:09:48-08:00

Gas explosion at Taiwan food court kills 4, leaves 8 hospitalized	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A gas explosion at a department store in Taiwan on Thursday killed four people and left eight hospitalized, fire authorities said. The blast occurred at the food court on the 12th floor of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung city, the Taichung Fire Bureau said. Among the dead were two people visiting from Macau, while a third was severely injured, Macao's Tourism Office confirmed Thursday. Local media reported that they were part of a family of seven who were there for tourism. Dozens of firefighters were deployed to the scene at about 11:30 a.m. Parts of the building's exterior were damaged and scattered fragments were strewn on the streets. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen told reporters at the scene that she felt the shock at her office nearby. She said the fire bureau would focus on a rescue operation first, but an investigation was also underway and officers were checking whether there were other sources of danger. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said he had asked all relevant government agencies to investigate the cause of the accident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gas-explosion-at-taiwan-food-court-kills-4-leaves-8-hospitalized/7973306.html	2025-02-13T00:01:27-08:00	
China's 2024 coal power construction hits 10-year high, researchers say	SINGAPORE — China started construction on 94.5 gigawatts of coal-fired power in 2024, the highest volume of new builds since 2015, hampering the country's transition away from fossil fuels, researchers said in a report published on Thursday. The world's biggest coal consumer and emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases had vowed to 'strictly control' coal power over the 2021-25 period, but power shortage concerns have led to a spike in new projects since 2023. 'If coal maintains a high share in China's power system for too long, it will be much harder to achieve a rapid decline in emissions,' said Qi Qin, researcher at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). 'This, in turn, could pose challenges for global climate efforts, especially at a time when countries are expected to increase their ambitions for 2035 targets,' said Qi, the report's lead author. The surge came despite a record-breaking increase in renewable capacity last year and could make it harder to connect clean power to the grid, said the report, published by CREA and the Global Energy Monitor (GEM) think tank. China has retired more than 100 GW of obsolete coal-fired power in the last decade, according to its energy regulator, and new projects can only be built to provide back-up for renewable energy bases. China also commissioned 356 GW of wind and solar last year, meeting its 2030 target of 1,200 GW of renewable capacity six years ahead of schedule. Renewable power, however, is struggling to compete for space on China's grid, with utilization rates falling sharply near the end of last year, Thursday's report said. China has promised to start cutting coal use over the 2026-2030 five-year plan period as it works to bring its emissions to a peak before the end of the decade. This has created incentives for the industry to lock in as much coal capacity as it can ahead of new restrictions that could come into effect as early as next year. 'China's current push for new coal power is primarily driven by industry interests that are advancing coal expansion under the banner of energy security,' said Qi. 'These groups recognize the constraints imposed by the 2030 carbon peak and 2060 carbon neutrality targets and are moving quickly to secure growth before the window narrows,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-2024-coal-power-construction-hits-10-year-high-researchers-say/7973302.html	2025-02-12T23:52:13-08:00	
Syrian minister makes first trip to EU as powers look to aid transition	PARIS — Syria's foreign minister will attend an international conference in Paris on Thursday as regional and Western powers seek to shield the country during its fragile transition amid ongoing instability across the region. Asaad Hassan al-Shibani is leading a delegation for a first trip to the European Union since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad and days after President Emmanuel Macron invited Syria's U.N.-sanctioned President Ahmed al-Sharaa to France. 'This Paris meeting, in a way, is to help create a protective bubble around the Syria crisis, to give them time to resolve it by dissuading the bad losers from destabilizing the country,' a French official said. Regional ministers, including from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Lebanon, will be joined with Western partners, although the United States will have merely a low-level diplomatic presence. The meeting aims to coordinate efforts to bring a peaceful transition, ensuring the country's sovereignty and security, mobilize Syria's main neighbors and partners to coordinate aid and economic support, the French foreign ministry said. It will also discuss transitional justice and the fight against impunity. The conference does not aim to raise funds, which will be left to an annual pledging conference in Brussels in March, but issues such as the lifting of sanctions would be discussed. The EU has moved forward in lifting some sanctions, although that still remains blocked amid opposition from Cyprus and Greece amid concerns over maritime delimitation talks between Syria and Turkey and assurances that sanctions could be restored quickly, two diplomats said. They said they were hopeful a compromise could be reached this month. Ahead of the meeting, main international donors will also take stock of the humanitarian situation, notably in northeastern Syria, where the impact of U.S. aid cuts has had a 'terrifying' impact, according to a European official. Officials also said the subject of Western-backed Kurdish Syrian forces, the central government and Turkey, which deems part of those forces as terrorist groups, would also be discussed. A Turkish diplomatic source said Deputy Foreign Minister Nuh Yilmaz, who will attend the meeting, would 'draw attention to the threats Syria is facing, namely the separatist terrorist organization, and emphasize our country's determination regarding the total clearance of the country from terror elements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-minister-makes-first-trip-to-eu-as-powers-look-to-aid-transition/7973296.html	2025-02-12T23:10:38-08:00	
NATO defense ministers to discuss military spending, Ukraine aid	NATO defense ministers are set to meet Thursday in Brussels to discuss defense spending targets, boosting their industrial capacity and their support to Ukraine. The ministerial meeting comes amid a U.S. push for NATO allies to commit more of their domestic budgets to defense. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte expressed support for the U.S. position ahead of the talks, saying if allies do not spend more, then they will not have the necessary deterrents against foes such as Russia in place. Rutte also is urging allies to work on boosting defense production capacities in order to boost stockpiles and to be able to provide more for Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion that began in early 2022. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Wednesday that while the U.S. wants a 'sovereign and prosperous Ukraine,' allies must recognize that going back to the Ukrainian borders that existed before Russia moved into Crimea in 2014 is an 'unrealistic objective.' Hegseth advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that are deployed under a non-NATO mission. He ruled out deploying any U.S. troops to Ukraine. Following Thursday’s NATO ministerial, Hegseth heads to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank, and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.'

Modi, Trump to meet with focus on trade, immigration, strategic ties	NEW DELHI — U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks Thursday at the White House. Officials in New Delhi expressed optimism Modi’s visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However, analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among Trump’s top priorities. Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri – the ministry’s top civil servant — said India-U.S. ties are solid and that 'this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.' Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are 'very big tariff abusers.' In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, repeated such concerns on Monday. 'India has enormously high' tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it would lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain Indian market access and boost energy imports from the U.S., analysts say. 'New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. 'India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.' For India, the stakes are high -- the United States is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with an Indian surplus of about $32 billion in 2023. India has not been affected so far by Trump’s tariff impositions – the latest 25% tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have an only marginal affect on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of U.S.-made security equipment India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries such as France, Israel and the United States. 'The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,' according to Rahul Bedi, a defense analyst in New Delhi. 'There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.' Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties. Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology. 'People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,' Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term. Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 'It was President Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about 10 years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,' said Mahapatra. 'This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-trump-to-meet-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-strategic-ties/7973280.html	2025-02-12T21:51:46-08:00

Austria’s far-right leader fails to form a government after coalition talks collapse	Talks in Austria to form a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party and the conservative People’s Party collapsed Wednesday after the two sides failed to agree on disputed policy points. The coalition talks were the latest in a series of negotiations that have failed since parliamentary elections were held in September. Herbert Kickl’s Freedom Party, with its anti-immigration platform and opposition to the European Union’s support of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, took almost 29% of the vote, pushing then-Chancellor Karl Nehammer's People's Party into second place. However, Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen did not give the Freedom Party leader the mandate to form a coalition government until January, after attempts to form a coalition bloc without Kickl’s party failed. There has not been a far-right leading party in Austria’s government since World War II. The president said Wednesday in a nationally televised address that Austria now has four options to move out of its political dilemma. He said a snap election, which would take at least three months to mount, could be held, or a minority government could lead Austria. Another option is for Austrian politicians to engage in talks once again to form a coalition with a majority. The fourth option, the president said, would be for a temporary government of experts to take on the job of leading Austria. Van der Bellen said he will soon discuss the options with fellow politicians to determine which 'could be successful, as quickly as possible, for as long as necessary.' The president also called on the political parties to engage in the spirit of compromise during their negotiations, something he said he felt was missing. Analysts thought the far-right and conservative parties could form a coalition, but challenges emerged during their discussions, including policy differences and ministry assignments. Kickl said in a letter to the president that there was no point in negotiating with the center-left Social Democrats, the only other party with which the Freedom Party could reach a parliamentary majority. 'I do not take this step without regret,' Kickl said in the letter. 'Austria has no time to waste.'

Negotiators work to preserve Israel-Hamas ceasefire	While mediators were working to preserve a fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Israel called up military reservists and the nation’s defense minister echoed U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not released Saturday. A Hamas official told The Associated Press there were positive signals three hostages would be released as planned, but the group was waiting to hear if Israel would honor the current ceasefire agreement. Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working to preserve the truce, according to Egypt's state-run Al-Qahera News TV, which is close to the country's security agencies. An Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides were working on a deal to preserve the ceasefire, AP reported. The monthlong ceasefire came under threat earlier this week when Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror organization, accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. According to Hamas, 92 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began and more than 800 have been wounded. Israel said people have been shot if they approached troops or entered certain areas in violation of the agreement. The United Nations said 1.2 million people have been fed and more than 600,000 have received shelter since the ceasefire began Jan. 19. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, the country’s Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. 'Hamas ... will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats,' Hamas spokesperson Hazaem Qassem said in a statement. 'Contacts are underway with mediator countries to conclude the implementation of the ceasefire deal.' The U.S. president’s vision has elicited anger from the Arab world. Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected any plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying Wednesday that such resettlement would be 'unacceptable.' Aboul Gheit told the World Governments Summit that the proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a 'damaging effect on peace and stability.' 'It's unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,' Aboul Gheit said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said after talks Tuesday with Trump that he reiterated his country’s 'steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,' Abdullah said on X. He highlighted what he said was Trump’s 'instrumental' role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and called on the United States and all stakeholders to ensure the halt in fighting holds. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

North Korea dismantling facility near border for separated families, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is dismantling a facility at its Mount Kumgang resort used for hosting meetings between families separated after the Korean War, South Korea said on Thursday, in the latest sign of strained tensions between the two Koreas. Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles affairs between the two Koreas, issued a statement urging North Korea to immediately stop the action at the site near the border. The demolition of the facility is an 'anti-humanitarian act that tramples on the wishes of separated families,' the ministry said, adding that it would consider legal measures over the action and a joint response with the international community. North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbor in recent years, designating South Korea as a 'hostile state.' Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time. In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. Nonetheless, there have been recent signs that North Korea may be prepared to reopen to some foreign visitors for the first time in more than five years since the closure of its borders to tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing-based Koryo Tours on Thursday said tours to North Korea were 'officially back,' with some of its staff allowed to enter the Rason area in what it hoped would mark the relaunch of tourism.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-dismantling-facility-near-border-for-separated-families-seoul-says/7973247.html	2025-02-12T19:25:09-08:00	
US judge allows Trump to proceed with federal worker deferred retirement	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A federal judge on Wednesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to carry out its federal worker deferred retirement program as the president moves to overhaul and downsize the U.S. government, handing a setback to unions trying to stop the plan. The decision could clear the way for the Republican president's administration to swiftly try to wrap up the program, though the unions could ask another court to halt the program. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston dissolved an earlier order he issued that had paused the program at the urging of unions representing more than 800,000 federal employees. O'Toole concluded that the unions lacked legal standing to challenge the rule. The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions have called the administration's deferred resignation offer to more than 2 million federal civilian employees unlawful. 'The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees,' wrote O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton. 'This is not sufficient.' The Office of Personnel Management, which announced the program in a January 28 email titled 'Fork in the Road,' on Monday told employees it intends to close the program to new entrants as soon as legally permissible. As of Friday, about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts, according to a White House official, as the Trump administration ramps up plans to engage in wide-ranging job cuts throughout the government. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President Everett Kelley called the ruling a setback. 'Importantly, this decision did not address the underlying lawfulness of the program,' he said in a statement. The unions that had filed the lawsuit argued that the plan announced in January was unlawful and that OPM lacked authority to implement the program. Trump, who began his second term as president on January 20, has appointed Elon Musk a 'special government employee' to oversee a sweeping effort called the Department of Government Efficiency with the stated aim of reducing federal spending and reshaping the United States' 2.2 million-strong federal workforce, potentially purging thousands of workers. He also signed an executive order on Tuesday to expand Musk's influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce. Democrats and other critics have accused Musk, who heads electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, of improperly taking over the federal government. Some federal workers have held protests against Musk's actions. In an email that was sent last month to nearly all federal employees, OPM said employees could choose to resign now and retain all pay and benefits until September 30. The email said employees could remain on the payroll without having to work in person and possibly having their duties reduced or eliminated in the meantime. Interested employees needed only to reply with the word 'resign' to take part. The email's title and contents mirrored a message that Musk, the world's richest man, sent to Twitter employees after he acquired the social media platform, now called X, in 2022. As the deadline approached, the Trump administration had repeated its warning that most federal agencies are likely to be downsized, a message seen by workers as pressure to accept the buyout offer. The unions in their lawsuit argued that OPM's buyout directive was 'stunningly arbitrary' and violated the Antideficiency Act, a federal law that bars agencies from spending more money than Congress appropriated. By encouraging employees to broadly quit without regard to their agency, job duties or institutional memory, OPM is ignoring the adverse consequences resignations could have on the government's ability to function, the unions said. At the request of the unions, O'Toole last week delayed an initial February 6 deadline for employees to resign to Monday. On that day, he put it on hold pending a further order of the court while he considered the case. The unions asked that the deadline be put fully on hold to give them time to seek further relief through the courts and ensure that their members can make informed decisions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-allows-trump-to-proceed-with-federal-worker-deferred-retirement-/7973201.html	2025-02-12T18:31:58-08:00	
Washington forum takes on Central Asia water insecurity	washington — Central Asia has a growing population, rising economic demand and severe water shortages that require greater coordination among governments and international aid groups to build out crucially needed water infrastructure, experts on the region say. 'There is no solution to these water problems without political solutions to regional problems involving regional integration to a unique degree,' Wesley Alexander Hill, lead analyst at the International Tax and Investment Center, said last week at an Atlantic Council forum in Washington. Hill explained that the origins of major rivers in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan largely depend on sources in Russia, China and Afghanistan. He also highlighted China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has pledged water investments in Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan’s construction of the Qosh Tepa Canal, which threatens to reduce water flow from the Hindu Kush into downstream countries such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Central Asian governments over the years have sought water-related agreements with Moscow, Beijing and Kabul. Hill said that modernizing water infrastructure in these countries presents economic opportunities. 'Investing in Central Asian water infrastructure and resources isn’t a charity project,' he said. 'It can actually be quite profitable. There’s plenty of money to be made not just by Chinese and Russian companies, but, hopefully, by American and European companies as well, in areas like relining canals.' Wilder Alejandro Sanchez, president of Second Floor Strategies, underscored the need for 'realistic and rational policy recommendations' to achieve water security in Central Asia. 'We encourage local governments to implement technologies like water-measuring systems, drip irrigation and graywater recycling,' Sanchez told attendees at the forum. He also called for policymakers to ensure accountability and transparency, given Central Asia’s well-documented record of corruption and embezzlement. He suggested that water security projects be monitored by international auditing agencies to build public trust. The Atlantic Council panelists also proposed restructuring the region’s Interstate Commission for Water Coordination, created in 1992, into a more effective Central Asia Water Council or permanent administrative office. The Central Asian governments already have their own initiatives. Tajikistan, for example, leads the Dushanbe Water Process, while Kazakhstan plans to host the Central Asian Water Environmental Summit next year. Sanchez and his colleagues encouraged the Central Asian republics, whose representatives were at the forum, to work not only with the United States but also with European and Asian partners, including the Netherlands, France, South Korea and Japan. Sanchez acknowledged that achieving unity and cooperation remains a challenge, given regional geopolitics and domestic priorities. 'Ultimately, no individual Central Asian state can achieve total water security and water independence without cooperating with its neighbors and significantly improving water management,' he said. For decades, international organizations and researchers have warned about the ecological disaster unfolding in Central Asia, particularly the shrinking of the Aral Sea, which has lost most of its volume since the 1960s. The Caspian Sea, the region’s only remaining major body of water, is also drying up. Ariel Cohen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who was also on the panel, pointed to deteriorating infrastructure as a key issue. 'A lot of water is lost because modern irrigation technologies are not used. You still have Soviet-era canals, or even pre-Soviet traditional canals, that are just dug into the ground without any protection from evaporation or dissipation,' Cohen said. 'Moving to pipe distribution of water, drip irrigation and sprinklers will probably save 50% of water consumption and move the region toward much more balanced water management.' The experts estimate that modernization will cost billions of dollars, and the question of where that funding will come from remains open. 'If it’s not going to be the U.S., it’s going to be somebody else. The best-case scenario? If it’s not us [the U.S.], it’s the Europeans. Worst-case scenario? It’s the Chinese,' said Cohen. It remains to be seen, other analysts listening to the panel said, whether the Trump administration’s 'America First' policy would support such involvement. 'Often, when we talk about U.S.-Central Asia relations, we focus on the big picture,' said Sanchez. 'We need to diversify engagement between the U.S. and Central Asia.' Water security and environmental protection are high-impact initiatives, he argued, that will not only strengthen ties but also improve the image of the U.S. in Central Asia. 'We also want the people of Central Asia to see the United States as a friend,' Sanchez said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-forum-takes-on-central-asia-water-insecurity-/7973202.html	2025-02-12T18:05:16-08:00

Trump orders revamp of US diplomatic corps to ensure it follows his agenda	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the Foreign Service to ensure 'faithful and effective implementation' of Trump's foreign policy agenda. The order, which follows upheaval at the U.S. Agency for International Development, comes as Trump institutes changes to ensure U.S. foreign policy is aligned with his 'America First' agenda. He has also repeatedly pledged to 'clean out the deep state' by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal. The order also says failure to implement the president's agenda is grounds for professional discipline, which may result in the termination of personnel. 'The Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy effectively,' the order read. 'The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure faithful and effective implementation of the President’s foreign policy agenda.' The executive order says the secretary of state will implement reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation and retention standards to 'ensure a workforce that is committed to faithful implementation of the President’s foreign policy.' It also said the secretary can revamp the programs of the Foreign Service Institute and revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual. Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Trump ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid to ensure it was aligned with his 'America First' policies. Following the order, USAID staff were put on leave and told not to report to work at the agency's headquarters, where signs were covered in tape or removed. The USAID website stopped working, and Rubio was named acting administrator.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-revamp-of-us-diplomatic-corps-to-ensure-it-follows-his-agenda/7973182.html	2025-02-12T16:57:55-08:00

Lawsuit by US rights group seeks access to migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay	washington — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. ACLU filed the complaint on behalf of families of detainees, who say the detainees themselves cannot sue because they are being held without the ability to communicate with the outside world. The suit seeks immediate phone and video access to detainees, as well as in-person visitation. President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office on Jan. 20, including the transfer of dozens of migrants to a detention site on Guantanamo Bay, which is best known for the separate high-security U.S. prison used for suspected foreign terrorists. The lawsuit follows a letter sent by ACLU and other civil and immigrant rights groups to top Trump officials last week, demanding a way to speak to detainees. 'Shipping immigrants off to Guantanamo without access to lawyers or the outside world cannot be reconciled with our country’s laws or principles,' said Lee Gelernt, ACLU lawyer and lead counsel on the case. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation.' The lawsuit cites the cases of three Venezuelan men believed to be detained at Guantanamo. Angela Carolina Sequera, one of the plaintiffs, said she was in almost daily contact with her son while he was in a Texas immigration detention center and last spoke to him on Saturday, the complaint stated. On Sunday, she received a call from the detention center saying her son would be sent to Guantanamo. 'Ms. Sequera has made numerous calls to try to locate her son and speak to him, to no avail,' the complaint said. 'She is distraught over the lack of information, and she desires that her son be provided with the ability to communicate with legal counsel regarding his detention at Guantanamo.' The plaintiffs also include four nonprofit legal service providers who said they were unable to represent migrants shuttled to the naval base. The providers have clients in Texas and Florida. The Trump administration has provided few specifics about the detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay but said the first flight carried alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said there is a system at the Guantanamo detention site for migrants to phone lawyers. She questioned the ACLU raising concerns about 'highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers and vicious gang members' rather than U.S. citizens. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the base on Friday, said in a social media post that some of the detainees had allegedly been charged or convicted of homicide, robbery and other crimes. The ACLU lawsuit said the U.S. had never before moved migrants held on civil immigration charges from the U.S. to the Guantanamo Bay base and now held them 'incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or the outside world.' The complaint said that despite significant public concern, the Trump administration had offered no explanation of its legal authority to move the detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawsuit-by-us-rights-group-seeks-access-to-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo-bay/7972904.html	2025-02-12T15:39:08-08:00

Russia, Ukraine trade blame for IAEA disruptions at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday accused each other of blocking the rotation of staff from the International Atomic Energy Agency at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Moscow's troops seized the facility, Europe's largest nuclear power station, in the first days of its invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have repeatedly accused the other of risking a potentially devastating nuclear disaster by attacking the site. Staff from the U.N. nuclear watchdog have been based there since September 2022 to monitor nuclear safety. Fighting meant the IAEA staff could not be swapped out as part of a planned rotation on Wednesday, the second such delay in a week, both Kyiv and Moscow said, trading blame for the incident. Inspectors spend around five weeks at the plant in stints before being swapped out in a complex procedure that involves traveling across the front line under supervision from the Russian and Ukrainian militaries. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy accused Russia's army of opening fire near where the planned rotation was taking place, saying Moscow's goal was to force the IAEA team to travel through Russian-controlled territory and 'violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Ukrainian army blocked the IAEA team from traveling to an agreed meeting point and were attacking the area with drones, at which point the Russian military withdrew its support team and returned to the station. 'On their return, the convoy carrying Russian military personnel and IAEA experts ... came under attack by drone and mortar strikes,' Zakharova said in a statement. The IAEA staff members were supposed to leave the station on Feb. 5 in a rotation that was also delayed. IAEA head Rafael Grossi was in both Ukraine and Russia last week, where he discussed the issue of rotations with officials from both countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-trade-blame-for-iaea-disruptions-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-/7972887.html	2025-02-12T15:28:54-08:00	
261 trafficking victims rescued from Myanmar scam center	WASHINGTON — More than 260 foreign nationals have been rescued from online scam operations in Myanmar and handed over to authorities in Thailand. The rescue is part of an escalating crackdown on human trafficking and cyber fraud along the two countries' border. A Myanmar insurgent group, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, which recently raided scam centers in the region, handed the victims over to Thai authorities on Feb. 12. DKBA Chief of Staff Major Saw San Aung told VOA's Burmese Service in a telephone interview that the group's forces raided casinos in Myawaddy District, Karen State, in search of trafficked foreign workers. 'On February 11, we identified 261 victims and transferred them to Thai authorities on February 12,' he said. 'We are handing over everyone we find today, but the process is difficult. The [Myanmar] junta's immigration department is making demands, and the terrain is challenging. We have to retrieve the victims ourselves before transferring them to the nearest Thai authorities,' Major Saw San Aung said. A rescue worker and eyewitness who requested anonymity for security reasons told VOA in a phone interview on Wednesday that online scam gangs force victims of trafficking 'to meet monthly earnings targets of up to $50,000. If they failed, they were tortured. They were only allowed to sleep for two to three hours a day and worked nonstop. They were kept in dark cells and subjected to continuous abuse.' Thai officials confirmed that the rescued individuals were taken by boat to Phop Phra, Thailand, before being moved to a secure facility. China pressured to crack down on scammers Tensions between China and Myanmar escalated after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted and held captive in Myanmar in January, before eventually being rescued from scam centers in Myawaddy. In response to this incident, China pressured Thailand to crack down on scam networks operating in the region. This pressure is widely believed to be a key factor behind Thailand's decision to cut off electricity and fuel supplies to Myanmar, significantly impacting areas controlled by ethnic Karen armed groups. The Wednesday handover follows another transfer on Feb. 6 when Myanmar's ruling junta and another armed group, the Karen Border Guard Force handed over 61 trafficked individuals, including 39 Chinese nationals, to Thai custody. Among those rescued and returned on Thursday, many were from Africa, including 46 Ethiopians and 33 Kenyans, according to the DKBA. In recent days, Myanmar's military leadership has also highlighted its efforts to crackdown on illegal online gambling and scam operations in cooperation with the international community. In audio message shared with the news media last Friday, military junta spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun said many victims of trafficking were lured with promises of high-paying jobs in computer-related and translation fields. 'They were deceived by the prospect of high salaries and good working conditions. Most of them arrived in Mae Sot from Bangkok before being taken across the border illegally by online money-laundering gangs,' General Zaw Min Tun said. Myawaddy: haven for scam syndicates Myawaddy, located in Karen State along the Thai border, is controlled by Karen armed groups, including the DKBA and the Karen BGF, the latter was previously aligned with the Myanmar military. The BGF-controlled town of Shwe Kokko in particular has turned into a notorious hub for online fraud. As of May 2022, reports indicated that 1,225 Chinese nationals, along with individuals from Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, and the Philippines, were trafficked into Shwe Kokko to work in online scam operations. These victims were lured by fake job offers and later forced into online fraud schemes. Since the Karen BGF severed ties with the Myanmar military and rebranded itself as the Karen National Army last year, the scam operations have faced increased scrutiny. The U.S. Institute of Peace has warned that online scams originating from Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, are a major security threat and cause significant financial losses in the U.S. In 2023, USIP estimated that Americans lost $3.5 billion to scams from the region. These scams, including forced labor, scams using romantic relationships and other financial crimes, target U.S. residents through fraudulent job applications and false high-tech job ads. Aye Aye Mar from VOA's Burmese Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trafficking-victims-rescued-from-myanmar-scam-center/7972816.html	2025-02-12T14:43:43-08:00	
Audit shows Senegal's previous government misreported debt, other key data	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Senegal's Court of Auditors released a long-awaited review of the country's finances on Wednesday that confirmed the previous government misreported key economic data including debt and deficit figures. Senegal's sovereign Eurobonds tumbled following release of the report. 'The work carried out by the Court shows that outstanding debt is higher than that shown in the reporting documents,' the court's report said. The court's report confirmed an audit that had been ordered by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who took office in April 2024. At the end of 2023, the total outstanding debt represented 99.67% of gross domestic product, the court's report said. That compared with a previously recorded figure of 74.41%. The audit ordered by Faye had revealed that Senegal's debt and budget deficit were much wider than former President Macky Sall's administration had reported. As a consequence of the audit, Faye's government decided in June not to present a request for further disbursement under its three-year $1.8 billion credit facility with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF had suspended the program pending the Court of Auditors' review. The IMF said on Wednesday that it would analyze the report and initiate consultations with authorities to address issues raised. 'The IMF remains committed to supporting the authorities moving forward,' an IMF spokesperson said via email. The court's report, which covers public finances from 2019 to March 2024, said it detected other anomalies and data discrepancies between the reported and the actual numbers. 'The deficit calculated and reported to the IMF for the period under review is very far from its real value, if the exact volume of project loan disbursements is taken into account,' the court said in the report. The reviewed budget deficit for 2023 stood at 12.3% of GDP compared with 4.9% reported by the previous administration, the court said. Leo Morawiecki, associate investment specialist for emerging market debt at Abrdn, an investment company, said the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2024 was likely to be in excess of 110% given the large deficit being run. 'In response, the IMF will almost certainly move Senegal from moderate to high risk of debt distress,' he said in a note, adding that the government seemed committed to fiscal consolidation and an IMF program. In a note to investors after the report's release, Senegal's finance ministry said it would centralize management of its public debt and implement strict controls over projects financed from external resources. The ministry will shortly organize a call with global investors, the note said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/audit-shows-senegal-s-previous-government-misreported-debt-other-key-data-/7972823.html	2025-02-12T14:22:23-08:00	
Malawi university students feel impact of US aid freeze	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Public universities in Malawi have ordered all students sponsored by USAID to drop out or seek other sources of funding if they want to remain in school. This follows the 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign assistance recently announced by President Donald Trump. However, Malawi’s government says it is working to ensure that students can continue their education. USAID has provided financial support to thousands of students in several Malawi universities, including the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mzuzu University, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, and the Malawi University of Science and Technology or MUST. James Mphande, the communications manager at MUST, said the U.S. foreign aid freeze is a big blow to several USAID-funded projects the school was implementing. 'And what it means now is that everything has been suspended,' he said. 'So, if we were developing a curriculum, we can’t proceed. If we had some outreach activities, we can’t proceed. If we were in the process of making some procurements, we can’t proceed.' He said some sponsored students may face the impact next semester. 'Fortunately, we are in the middle of a semester. So, probably fees or support for this semester was already sorted out. But for the upcoming semesters or years, it means the students will have to look elsewhere for support or they risk withdrawing,' Mphande said. However, Patience Yamikani Chakwana, a beneficiary of USAID at MUST, told VOA that she is already feeling the impact. Chakwana, a first-year student in business information technology, said the foreign aid suspension was imposed before students received money for their daily upkeep. 'It was really unexpected. It was, like, we have just started school after a week, then we are getting the news,' she said. 'At the time, we didn’t have the money, and the pocket money had not been given. … I heard the news while I was in class. I didn’t know what to do. That was the only hope I had.' Chakwana said USAID was paying for her tuition and accommodation, as well as giving her money for groceries and the internet connection for her mobile phone. She said she now survives on money she borrows from friends. Jessie Kabwila, Malawi’s minister of higher education, said the aid suspension is discouraging, but the Malawi government is working to find other sources to help students. 'We have engaged local partnerships that are in the private sector to see how they can help us. We have also engaged international partners. For example, we have got a standing agreement with the Republic of Morocco. We have also engaged the Czech Republic, and we will be engaging others, too,' Kabwila said. Alexander Kude, deputy director for the Commonwealth Students Association, told VOA that the U.S. foreign aid suspension should be a wake-up call for developing countries to start investing more in education and reduce overdependence on foreign aid. 'Look, the budget that the United States of America uses to fund us through USAID, it’s just a percent of their money and budget. If you look how much that is and where they get it from, why not stand alone and do it ourselves?' Kude said. The Trump administration says it imposed the 90-day freeze to review USAID spending and make sure it aligns with U.S. policy and interests. The freeze will extend through April 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-university-students-feel-impact-of-us-aid-freeze/7972824.html	2025-02-12T14:07:37-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Kurdish demonstration laws block protesters from entering Irbil	On Sunday, violence erupted at a security checkpoint outside of the Kurdistan Region's capital Irbil after security forces prevented hundreds of protesting teachers from Sulaymaniyah and Halabja provinces from entering the city. The teachers, who are still waiting to receive their December salary payments, told VOA it was their right to take their protests to Irbil as the capital of the Kurdistan Region. Police, however, said the teachers' request to protest was not approved by the Ministry of Interior, and used tear gas, plastic bullets and water cannons to disperse crowds. Hardi Salah, a lawmaker with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, told VOA the incident highlighted the need for the Kurdistan Regional Parliament to amend the region's protest law, which he said allows authorities to prevent any gathering they deem a challenge to their authority. But Muna Nabi Kahveci, the deputy head of the Turkmen Reform Party and former Kurdistan Parliament Secretary with close alliance to the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), denounced any attempt to amend the region's 2010 election law, arguing, 'Protesters were barred from entering Irbil to avoid violent unrest.'

Fire at Rio de Janeiro Carnival costume factory injures 21	RIO DE JANEIRO — A fire broke out Wednesday at a factory making costumes for Rio de Janeiro's Carnival, injuring 21 people in a blow to the famed extravaganza that attracts millions of tourists to the Brazilian city every year. Firefighters scaled ladders to reach a window where desperate workers were calling for help as black smoke bellowed from the building in the north of the city, local media images showed. The area around the factory was cordoned off by authorities as firefighters brought the blaze under control, according to an AFP reporter. The fire department's communication service told AFP that 21 people were hospitalized, 12 of whom were in a serious condition. Earlier, state health secretary Claudia Mello said at least eight people had been intubated and were on artificial respiration. Fire department chief Colonel Luciano Pacheco Sarmento said that those affected were working in a 'precarious manner' and without 'safety conditions.' The building contained 'a lot of highly combustible material,' added Sarmento. 'We have information that there have been fires here before,' he said. 'No way' down A survivor, identified as Roberta, told local media she had been working and sleeping in the building 'since Monday.' The fire 'came from the floor below and we had no way to get down,' she said. Rio de Janeiro's labor ministry announced a probe into working conditions at the factory. The cause of the fire has not been established. Rio's Carnival, famous for parades with lavish costumes and towering floats to the tune of samba music, begins on February 28 and will run until March 8. Preparations last almost the whole year, with the final weeks often very tense as competitors scramble to meet deadlines for the making of costumes and floats. One of the associations for the samba schools that compete in the parades, Liga RJ, expressed its 'deep concern' for the injured. The organization said the Maximus Factory that was hit by the fire was 'an essential space for the Rio Carnival.' 'The impact of this incident directly affects the planning of the Carnival and the entire production chain of its realization,' Liga RJ warned in an Instagram message. 'The League will urgently call its presidents for an extraordinary general assembly to evaluate the situation,' the statement said. Samba schools affected Three samba schools were having their outfits made at the affected factory, although none of them were taking part in the main competition for Carnival champion. Like football, the parade competition has several divisions, and samba schools can be relegated or rise up through the ranks each year. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes said the schools impacted by the fire would not be demoted from their carnival league. 'If they can parade, all three will do so out of competition,' he wrote on the X social media network. Paulo Santi, director of Imperio Serrano, one of the affected schools, said it would carry out its planned parade on March 1 'as if it were competing for the title. Showing the people of Rio that Imperio Serrano will endure.' The samba schools are rooted in Rio's favela urban settlements and each parade tells a story, often dealing with politics, social issues and history. Their parades take place in the Sambadrome, a large, open-air venue where more than 70,000 spectators gather to watch the spectacle with thousands of dancers in shimmering costumes. In 2011, a blaze in the Samba City complex of workshops and warehouses stocking Carnival material wiped out eight months of preparations worth millions of dollars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-at-rio-de-janeiro-carnival-costume-factory-injures-21/7972743.html	2025-02-12T13:29:18-08:00	
Pressure builds on US over future of its military presence in Syria	The future of the United States’ military presence in Syria is in question, with President Donald Trump facing competing demands from Turkey and Israel over the 2,000-strong force that is supporting a Syrian Kurdish-led coalition fighting Islamic State. Israel wants the U.S. to keep supporting Kurdish forces in Syria, while Turkey opposes that strategy.

Trump pushes for lower interest rates alongside tariffs	WASHINGTON — As his trade advisers finalized plans to enact reciprocal measures on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will push for lower interest rates alongside his tariff policies. 'Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!' Trump said on social media Wednesday morning. To maintain the Federal Reserves’ autonomy from politics, U.S. presidents traditionally avoid even the appearance of meddling in monetary policy and the nation’s interest rates, which is the purview of the central bank. Trump, however, has not shied from the practice. In a videoconference address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Trump said he would 'demand that interest rates drop immediately.' 'I know interest rates much better than they do,' he said of Fed officials. He has ramped up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 for a term that ends in 2026. Trump’s push to lower interest rates is intended to go hand in hand with punitive measures on trading partners. Reciprocal tariffs are 'absolutely a high priority for the president,' White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters Wednesday, promising 'a lot more action on it today.' Hassett said the White House has begun negotiations with other countries early to lay the groundwork for imposing such tariffs, although he acknowledged the details about which sectors or how they will be implemented is a 'work in progress.' Under World Trade Organization rules, member countries have the right to impose tariffs on imports. Countries negotiate those rates at the WTO to determine the maximum tariff rate a member country can impose on imports from other member countries. Inflation, looming trade war U.S. inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government data released Wednesday. Last month, the annual pace was 2.9%. Trump campaigned on lowering high consumer prices he blamed on his predecessor, Joe Biden. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt again attributed the increase to the previous administration. 'This is an indictment on the Biden administration's mismanagement of the inflation crisis and their lack of transparency,' she said during her briefing Wednesday. Trump wants to lower interest rates and inflation, she said. 'He believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.' However, some economists warn that combining high tariffs and low interest rates will have the opposite effect. Trump's plan reflects a 'misunderstanding of how the economy works,' said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'Tariffs raise prices directly, that is inflationary, but also cutting interest rates is inflationary if you do it excessively,' he told VOA. 'Especially with today's data, cutting interest rates would not be a good idea.' During testimony Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said the Fed was in no rush to cut interest rates because the economy had stabilized. He noted that inflation, while still above the Fed’s 2% target, was at 2.6% last year, and he said the labor market was cooling without plummeting, with the unemployment rate at 4%. Gagnon also warned of a looming trade war. Trump already had announced Monday his decision to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12. The duties will hit top U.S. steel supplier Canada, followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Germany. Additionally, Canada is the leader in aluminum exports to the American market. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday the move 'will not go unanswered,' saying it will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc, potentially targeting iconic American industries such as bourbon, jeans and motorcycles. EU trade ministers are meeting Wednesday to determine their next moves. China, Mexico and Canada Last week, Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, which the White House said was aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals. On Monday China began slapping retaliatory actions on some American goods, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals, and it launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google. Trump delayed enacting a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada for a month — until March 4 — to allow negotiations over his demands for the U.S. neighbors to secure their borders and stop the flow of the illegal drug fentanyl. The duties could affect about $1.323 trillion in trade imports that come from China, Mexico and Canada, according to U.S. government data. This accounts for 43% of U.S. imports and 5% of the $27 trillion U.S. gross domestic product. If enacted, the new import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China will increase the average tariff rate from its current level of 3% to 10.7% based on contemporary trade patterns, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at financial advisory firm RSM. 'Should the trade skirmishes escalate to include the European Union and turn into an all-out trade war, expect U.S. economic growth to ease back to 2% as the tariffs drag down growth and employment, stoke inflation and widen the current account deficit, all amid higher interest rates,' he wrote on RSM’s Real Economy Blog.

US warns citizens of potential terror threats at key mosque in Pakistan's capital	ISLAMABAD — The United States advised its citizens Wednesday to steer clear of a popular mosque in Pakistan’s capital due to potential terrorist threats. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued the threat alert following the emergence of a social media video earlier this week featuring a purported militant operative at the city’s Faisal Mosque, a major tourist destination. The brief video showed the individual displaying a hand-drawn pamphlet featuring the flag of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which the United Nations has listed as a global terrorist organization. The video was shared on Monday via social media affiliated with TTP. The U.S. diplomatic mission has prohibited employees from traveling to the mosque area until further notice. The advisory also urged American citizens to avoid the area, stating that 'TTP militants have issued threats against Faisal Mosque in Islamabad.' The terror threat alert was issued on the day Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Islamabad for a bilateral visit, amid heightened security measures. TTP routinely stages suicide bombings and gun attacks against Pakistani security forces and other official targets, mainly in districts near and on the country’s border with Afghanistan. The violence has killed hundreds of people in recent years. Islamabad has maintained that the group orchestrates terrorist attacks from sanctuaries in Afghanistan and has persistently called on the neighboring country’s Taliban leaders to rein in TTP militants. The Taliban government in Kabul, not recognized by any country, denies the presence of TTP or any other foreign militant organizations on Afghan soil. It claims that no one is allowed to threaten neighboring countries and beyond from Afghanistan. Critics have questioned the Taliban's denial, pointing to the frequent high-profile attacks claimed or attributed to the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an Afghan affiliate of the transnational Islamic State terrorist network. The violence has killed hundreds of people, including senior Taliban leaders, religious figures and members of the Afghan Shiite community, since the Taliban reclaimed control of the country in 2021. On Monday, U.N. counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting that IS-K is one of the 'most dangerous' Islamic State branches. 'ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond,' Vladimir Voronkov, U.N. undersecretary-general for counterterrorism, told the meeting, using another acronym for IS-K. The latest IS-K-claimed attack occurred on Tuesday when a suicide bomber detonated himself outside a bank in the northeastern Afghan city of Kunduz. Taliban officials said the blast killed five people and injured seven others. Multiple sources reported that the victims were primarily members of the Taliban security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-citizens-of-potential-terror-threats-at-key-mosque-in-pakistan-s-capital/7972680.html	2025-02-12T12:40:37-08:00	
Federal appeals court upholds singer R. Kelly's convictions, 30-year prison term	NEW YORK — R. Kelly's racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the American singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March. The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling 'unprecedented,' saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law 'to situations absurdly remote' from the statute's intent. Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago. The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings, and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper. 'Enabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,' the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls. 'Evidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,' the three-judge panel said. The appeals court said it was 'neither arbitrary nor irrational' that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify. 'None of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,' the appeals court said. The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, 'were properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.' Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's 'excellent opinion,' but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available. 'This was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,' Bonjean said. Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly and the cult classic Trapped in the Closet, a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue. Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex. Widespread outrage over Kelly's sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary Surviving R. Kelly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-appeals-court-upholds-singer-r-kelly-s-convictions-and-30-year-prison-term/7972508.html	2025-02-12T11:55:25-08:00

Zimbabwe to pay displaced, foreign white farmers	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe’s government said Wednesday it will compensate foreign investors who lost assets in the country’s controversial land reforms in the early 2000s but were protected by bilateral investment protection agreements. Zimbabwean Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said in a statement the government will pay 94 former farmers from countries such as Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. The farmers are covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements, or BIPPAs, that Zimbabwe signed with the farmers’ countries. Ncube said $20 million is being paid out of the 2024 budget and another $20 million would come from the 2025 budget. 'This is a very important issue for our arrears clearance and debt resolution process for Zimbabwe, because some of the countries for which we want support, their farmers, their investors, into Zimbabwe were affected by the land reform program in the early 2000s,' Ncube said. 'But we're only targeting those countries where the BIPPAs were ratified properly.' The aim, he said, is to have cleared the entire $146 million liability for BIPPA farmers by the end of 2028. 'We believe that this is very important for building trust, for honoring our commitments,' he said. Zimbabwe’s government is aiming to rebuild its financial reputation after requesting debt relief and restructuring from international financial institutions and other countries in 2022. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe's total foreign debt is $21 billion — including interest — which it has been failing to service for years. However, Eddie Mahembe, an independent economist based in Harare, says resettled farmers, not the government, should pay the $146 million, to prevent increasing the country’s debt. 'Why is the government paying for the farms which were allocated to individuals?' Mahembe said. 'They are farming. Some are doing tobacco. They've been selling their tobacco over the years, and we are seeing ... that there is now a move toward giving them title deals. Why is the government assuming that debt?' Others are concerned that Harare is paying only former farmers of foreign origin. Displaced white Zimbabwean farmers want to be compensated as well, as per a 2020 agreement. That agreement called for Harare to pay $3.5 billion to the farmers driven off their land under a program backed by then-President Robert Mugabe starting in 2000. Trevor Gifford, former head of Zimbabwe’s Commercial Farmers Union, said, 'Twenty-five years from the start of land reform in Zimbabwe, the majority of displaced title deed holders remain destitute due to the nonpayment of compensation. The government failed to honor its commitment on paying [on time] under the global compensation agreement, which is now expired.' He said the government’s move to give title deeds to the farmers who took over the land will create confusion and keep away foreign investors. 'The issuing of title deeds on top of existing title deeds, which have still not been paid for in terms of the international norms for land reform, is reckless and does not create any confidence for prospective investments in Zimbabwe,' Gifford said. Graham Rae was displaced from his farm about 100 kilometers east of Harare and is now farming in neighboring Zambia. He said that until he is compensated, he will not surrender title deeds to the land for which he was dispossessed. 'You can't steal a car and then sell it to me and think you've washed your hands and now it's a legal car,' Rae said. 'It's still illegal and by the mere fact that I'm buying a stolen car from you, I'm complicit in the theft, so there are going to be lots of problems. I find that fraudulent, I just find that very sad that Zimbabwe has regressed into a basket case where there's no rule of law, and that the rule really is at the barrel of a gun — if you don't agree, you disappear.' For now, the Zimbabwe government says it will issue titles to the resettled farmers so that they can use them to borrow money for capitalization of their businesses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-to-pay-displaced-foreign-white-farmers/7972468.html	2025-02-12T10:35:54-08:00	
Key Islamic State planner killed in airstrike, US and Somali officials say	WASHINGTON — Ahmed Maeleninine, an Omani-born leader of Islamic State, was killed in U.S. airstrikes against the terror group in Somalia earlier this month, officials of the Puntland region said Wednesday. Maeleninine was the main target of the Feb. 1 airstrike against Islamic State hideouts in the semi-autonomous region of northern Somalia. In an interview with VOA Somali, the Puntland state minister for presidency, Abdifitah Mohamed Abdinur, said Somalia and its international security partners had been watching Maeleninine’s movements in the region. 'He was an Omani-born man in his 40s who was wanted for international crimes and his movements and activities have been followed at least for the last two years, as he was hiding in the mountainous area of Puntland,' Abdinur said. 'He was a thorn removed from the flesh of Somalis and the world population, and he eventually tasted what he deserved.' The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed late Tuesday that Maeleninine and 13 other operatives linked to the Islamic State — also known as IS, ISIL or Daesh — were killed in the Feb. 1 operation, which it said was run in coordination with the Somali government. In a statement, AFRICOM described Maeleninine as a 'recruiter, financier, and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Abdinur said Puntland officials are still collecting the names and nationalities of the other 13 IS figures killed and will share them with the media when their identities are confirmed. Assessing the success of the U.S. strikes was delayed due to the location of the targets and the terrain — a series of cave complexes in the Cal Miskaad area of Somalia's Golis Mountains. At the time, a Somalia commander told VOA the U.S. strikes had targeted at least 10 locations. Residents in Qandala, a small town in Puntland’s Bari region, not far from the site of the attacks, told VOA that they heard at least seven explosions and saw plumes of smoke and flames. IS has increased its presence in Somalia over the past several years, while IS-Somalia has become a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. The Somali branch has simultaneously become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to head IS's directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree, but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. VOA’s Jeff Seldin, Harun Maruf and Fadumo Jama contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-islamic-state-planner-killed-in-airstrike-us-and-somali-officials-say/7972276.html	2025-02-12T10:34:59-08:00	
RFE/RL journalist released from Belarus jail	WASHINGTON — A journalist with VOA’s sister outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was released from Belarus on Wednesday, after spending more than four years imprisoned in a case that was widely viewed as politically motivated. Andrey Kuznechyk, a journalist with RFE/RL’s Belarus service was released from Belarus on Wednesday, RFE/RL said. RFE/RL President Stephen Capus welcomed Kuznechyk’s release. 'This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young children. After more than three years apart, this family is together again thanks to President Trump. We are also grateful to Secretary Rubio and his team, and to the Lithuanian government for their support,' Capus said in a statement. The terms of the deal were not immediately clear. Kuznechyk had been jailed since November 2021. He was initially sentenced to 10 days in jail on hooliganism charges, which he rejected. When Kuznechyk was due to be released, authorities kept him in prison and added an additional charge of creating an extremist group. In a trial that lasted only one day, a regional court found Kuznechyk guilty in June 2022 and sentenced him to six years in prison. RFE/RL and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees RFE/RL and VOA, consistently rejected the charges against Kuznechyk and called for his release. Belarus ranks among the worst jailers of journalists in the world. As of early December, at least 31 journalists were jailed there over their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Another RFE/RL journalist — Ihar Losik — has been jailed in Belarus since 2020 on charges he and his employer reject. 'We remain hopeful that our journalist Ihar Losik will also be released and look to the Trump administration for its continued leadership and guidance,' Capus said in a statement. Three other RFE/RL journalists are currently jailed in Russian-occupied Crimea, Russia and Azerbaijan, all on charges that are viewed as politically motivated. The Belarusian government has embarked on a severe crackdown on independent journalists and other critics ever since longtime President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a 2020 presidential election that was widely viewed as rigged. More than 1,200 political prisoners are currently detained in Belarus, according to the rights group Viasna.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfe-rl-journalist-released-from-belarus-jail-/7972466.html	2025-02-12T10:17:54-08:00

Trump vows to 'immediately' negotiate for end to Ukraine war	President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he and Russia’s leader agreed in a phone call to 'immediately' begin negotiations with Ukraine’s leader to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict. 'We will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,' Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. 'I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful.' Trump did not specify what the terms might be to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, in Germany Wednesday for a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, ruled out a key demand by Ukraine’s: eventual membership in NATO. 'The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,' Hegseth said. Trump’s top hostage negotiator on Wednesday credited Trump’s 'great friendship' with Russia’s leader and with Saudi Arabia’s prince as key in releasing American teacher Marc Fogel from Russian custody late Tuesday. 'I think that getting Mark Fogel out was critical and the Russians were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating,' Witkoff said, speaking to reporters at the White House. 'And I think that's maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future and what that may portend for the world at large for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship. And I think now it's going to continue and it's a really good thing for the world.' Trump welcomed Fogel to the White House late Tuesday. He had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country. 'I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,' Fogel said as he stood next to Trump at the White House late Tuesday. Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it 'very fair' and very reasonable.' Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday. Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office January 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vows-to-immediately-negotiate-for-end-to-ukraine-war/7972444.html	2025-02-12T09:54:05-08:00	
Senate approves Trump’s nominee to lead US intelligence	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul the country’s intelligence apparatus appears set to move forward, with lawmakers confirming Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s next director of national intelligence. The Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Gabbard on Wednesday, narrowly rejecting concerns about her experience and past statements on leaks of classified intelligence and other matters. Gabbard got support from every Republican senator except for former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined Democrats in opposing her confirmation. 'The intelligence community needs to refocus on its core mission — collecting intelligence and providing unbiased analysis of that information,' said Republican Majority Leader John Thune, praising Gabbard on Monday as lawmakers began debating her nomination. 'That’s what Tulsi Gabbard is committed to ensuring,' Thune said. 'And I believe she has the knowledge and leadership capabilities to get it done.' Democrats were less enthusiastic, making last minute pleas to their Republican colleagues to reject Gabbard. 'We simply cannot, in good conscience, trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories,' said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, addressing lawmakers before Wednesday’s vote. Schumer also alleged that most Republicans secretly agree. 'If we had a secret ballot, Gabbard might get 10 votes,' he said. 'People know. That's why they raise so many questions. But Donald Trump and Elon Musk evidently threaten them, and they're changing their view.' Trump selected Gabbard in November, praising her 'fearless spirit.' But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii and one-time Democratic presidential candidate faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Gabbard’s nomination to serve as director of national intelligence advanced to the full Senate by a 9-8 party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'It's fair to say Ms. Gabbard's nomination has generated a bit more interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, acknowledged during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing late last month. During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by Republicans and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she introduced to pardon him. Each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor, Gabbard declined to answer. 'Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation's security,' Gabbard said during once exchange with Republican Senator James Lankford. Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about her comments about Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications,' said Warner, a Democrat. 'Repeatedly, you have excused our adversaries' worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the United States.' Gabbard, however, managed to find common ground with the committee’s Republican senators, winning over Susan Collins and Todd Young. Young also shared a letter from Gabbard in which she pledged to hold U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence leaks and to 'not advocate for any protections which should only be extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.' Gabbard further promised to not make any recommendation 'regarding the legal standing of Edward Snowden' to the U.S. attorney general or to Trump. And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a lawmaker.

US defense chief: Return to Ukraine's 2014 borders 'unrealistic'	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO military allies on Wednesday that Ukraine’s hoped-for return to its 2014 borders is an 'unrealistic objective,' and that the United States does not believe that Kyiv membership in NATO is a 'realistic outcome' of a negotiated end to Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine. Speaking in Brussels at NATO headquarters, Hegseth told his fellow defense chiefs, 'We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.' No peace talks have been scheduled, but Hegseth said any durable conclusion to the war must include 'robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.' 'The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,' he said, which would invoke the military alliance’s mutual defense provision among NATO’s 32 member nations that requires each of them to help defend each other when they are attacked. Kyiv has long sought NATO membership, and the alliance’s other member nations have said they are committed to it, but not while the war rages on. Instead, Hegseth said security guarantees for Ukraine should be backed by 'capable European and non-European troops.' 'If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article 5,' he said, referring to the alliance's mutual defense clause. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, supported pro-Russian separatists fighting against Kyiv’s forces in eastern Ukraine in the ensuing years and then launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. It now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s pre-2014 territory. Before taking office to begin his second term in the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict even before being inaugurated. More recently, his aides say he hopes for a peace pact in the first 100 days of his new term, roughly by the end of April. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. was Ukraine’s biggest military benefactor. Trump has often voiced skepticism of continued U.S. support, refusing to say at a political debate last year that he wanted Ukraine to win the war. Now Trump appears intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine. He also has suggested that going forward, Ukraine should pay for continued U.S. support by giving the United States access to its rare earth minerals needed to produce technology products. 'Members of this [Ukraine] contact group must meet the moment,' Hegseth said to the assembled group of about 50 member countries that have provided $126 billion worth of weapons and military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. 'We hear you,' British Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks. Hegseth said that NATO members must increase their defense spending to 5% of their national economies, a figure that no NATO country currently allocates. The U.S. is at 3.4%, with Poland the highest NATO country at 4.12%. The current NATO defense spending goal is 2% of each country’s national economy, a figure that 23 of the 32 countries meet, up from six in 2021 after Trump chided other NATO countries about the issue during his first presidential term. Hegseth would not commit the U.S. to the 5% figure, saying it was up to Trump. 'We live in fiscally constrained times,' Hegseth said, and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. But the U.S. defense leader said, 'The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship [among NATO members] which encourages dependence [on the U.S.]; rather our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.' NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, June 24-26.

Rubio heads to Munich amid diplomatic push for Ukraine peace deal	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to depart Thursday for Munich and later this week will visit the Middle East amid an intensive diplomatic push to end Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as efforts to follow up on U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the post-war Gaza Strip. Preparations are also underway for Rubio to hold talks with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity. If the meeting takes place as expected, it would be the first U.S.-Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial trilateral under the Trump administration. Ukraine As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year, the U.S. is pursuing multiple diplomatic avenues to secure a peace deal. Although not directly linked to efforts to secure a peace deal, U.S. officials have described Russia’s Tuesday release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel as 'a show of good faith from the Russians' and 'a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end' the brutal war in Ukraine. Rubio has said that the U.S. will reaffirm its determination to end the war during meetings at the Munich Security Conference, a high-profile international security forum running from Feb. 14 to 16. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to hold in-person talks in Munich. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will also attend the conference. Ukraine has said that its delegation will present its position on ending the war and outline its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Meanwhile, negotiations are in progress as Ukraine seeks security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. Ukraine is willing to offer U.S. companies lucrative reconstruction contracts, Zelenskyy told The Guardian newspaper in an interview this week. He also said that if Trump manages to bring him and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer a land swap: Ukrainian-occupied territory in Kursk in exchange for Russian-held land in Ukraine. Rare earth minerals Trump has expressed interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Wednesday for talks on energy and rare earth minerals. He is the first cabinet-level official in the Trump administration to visit the country. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium. Russia has gained control over a significant portion of Ukraine's identified mineral resources in the territories it occupies. If Russia permanently seizes that land, Ukraine will lose access to those minerals and other reserves, which would be a blow to both European and U.S. security. First US-Japan-ROK trilateral Rubio’s expected talks with both Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Munich would take place amid concerns over North Korea’s military ties with Russia, China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, and security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. On Jan. 21, Rubio met with Iwaya in Washington to discuss strengthening U.S.-Japan cooperation against global security threats, including what officials describe as 'China’s destabilizing actions' in the Indo-Pacific. The following day, he spoke with Cho by phone, where both emphasized the need to further trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Japan and South Korea. 'We need to do more and strengthen relationships with our friends around the world,' said Republican Congressman Rob Wittman of Virginia during a discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday. 'We should be concerned about China's growing relationships with countries like Russia,' he added. Wittman serves as the vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as 'transactional,' adding that Moscow’s technology transfers to Pyongyang are not out of the 'goodness of the heart.' The U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral framework was established under former president Joe Biden’s administration. Experts, including former senior State Department official Rick Waters, note that such trilateral cooperation has become increasingly institutionalized, making it 'hard to reverse' — even amid South Korea’s political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment over his brief martial law attempt last December. 'I’d be very surprised if, in four years, we would see anything other than further consolidation' of existing U.S. alliance frameworks in the Indo-Pacific,' Waters said Tuesday at the CSIS event. Middle East Rubio will travel to the Middle East after holding talks with his counterparts in Munich. On Tuesday, he spoke with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ahead of his visit to Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital, next week. They 'discussed the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the importance of ensuring that Hamas releases all hostages, including American citizens,' according to the State Department. Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the two also 'highlighted the imperative of ensuring that Hamas can never rule Gaza or threaten Israel again' during the call. Trump said this week the Hamas militant group must release all hostages held in Gaza by midday Saturday, or he will propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. Rubio is scheduled to travel to Munich, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi from Feb. 13-18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-heads-to-munich-amid-diplomatic-push-for-ukraine-peace-deal/7972321.html	2025-02-12T08:34:55-08:00	
White House blocks AP reporter from Oval Office event over ‘Gulf of America’ policy	The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday because the news agency has not altered its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America, the news agency said. Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, said the White House informed the nonprofit news agency that the AP would be blocked from the Oval Office event if the outlet did not align its editorial standards with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. An AP reporter attempted to enter the White House event on Tuesday afternoon but was turned away. Later Tuesday night, a second AP reporter was barred from an event in the White House Diplomatic Room. 'As a global news organization, The Associated Press informs billions of people around the world every day with factual, nonpartisan journalism,' Pace said in a statement. 'It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,' Pace said. 'Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.' The White House Correspondents’ Association, or WHCA, also condemned the decision as 'unacceptable.' 'The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news,' WHCA President Eugene Daniels said in a statement. The White House did not immediately reply to a VOA request for comment in response to the AP and WHCA statements. Shortly after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, the highest peak in North America. According to his order, the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali would revert to Mount McKinley — its name before President Barack Obama changed it in 2015. A few days later, the AP announced that the news agency would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while acknowledging the new name Trump had picked. The AP said it made that decision because the gulf has carried the Gulf of Mexico name for more than 400 years and that other countries and international bodies do not need to recognize the name change. However, since the area of the Alaskan mountain lies entirely in the United States and Trump has authority to change the name, the AP said it will use the name Mount McKinley. Thousands of journalists and writers around the world follow the AP’s style. Voice of America typically follows the AP’s style, but VOA’s standards editor announced in late January that the congressionally funded but editorially independent news outlet would begin referring to the body of water as the Gulf of America, in addition to referring to the mountain as Mount McKinley. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-blocks-ap-reporter-from-oval-office-event-over-gulf-of-america-policy/7972268.html	2025-02-12T08:00:25-08:00	
Cost of groceries, gas goes up as US inflation worsens	WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries, gas and used cars rose, a disappointment for families and businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the Federal Reserve's resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts. The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesday's report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3½-year low of 2.4% in September. The figures show that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months, after it fell steadily for about a year and a half. Elevated prices created a major political problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices in last year's campaign, although most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs. The unexpected boost in inflation could dampen some of the business enthusiasm that arose after Trump's election on promises to reduce regulation and cut taxes. Dow futures tumbled 400 points, and all major markets are likely to sell off at the opening bell. Bond yields rose, a sign traders expect inflation and interest rates to remain high. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core consumer prices rose 3.3% in January compared with a year ago, up from 3.2% in December. Economists closely watch core prices because they can provide a better read of inflation's future. Month-to-month inflation Inflation also worsened monthly, with prices jumping 0.5% in January from December, the largest increase since August 2023. Core prices climbed 0.4% last month, the most since March 2024. Grocery prices climbed 0.5% just in January, pushed higher by a 15.2% surge in egg prices, the biggest monthly increase since June of 2015. Egg prices have soared 53% compared with a year ago. An avian flu epidemic has forced many egg producers to cull millions of birds from their flocks. Some stores have imposed limits on egg purchases, and some restaurants have placed surcharges on egg dishes. The cost of car insurance continues to rise and picked up 2% just from December to January. Hotel prices rose 1.4% last month, while the cost of a gallon of gas moved up 1.8%. Inflation often jumps in January as many companies raise their prices at the beginning of the year, although the government's seasonal adjustment process is supposed to filter out those effects. Later Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will likely be asked about inflation and the Fed's response to it. The Fed raised its benchmark rate in 2022 and 2023 to a two-decade high of 5.3% to combat inflation. With inflation down significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022, it cut its rate to about 4.3% in its final three meetings last year. Interest rates and tariffs Early Wednesday, Trump said on social media that interest rates should be lowered, 'something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!' Yet the tick up in consumer prices makes it less likely the Fed will cut rates anytime soon. Fed officials are mostly confident that inflation over time will head lower, but they want to see further evidence that it is declining before cutting their key rate any further. The Fed's rate typically influences other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Inflation's recent uptick is a major reason the Federal Reserve has paused its interest rate cuts, after implementing three of them last year. 'We do not need to be in a hurry' to implement further reductions, Powell said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. The Trump administration's tariff policy could lift prices in the coming months. Trump on Monday imposed 25% taxes on steel and aluminum imports and has pledged to impose more tariffs. Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast that yearly core inflation would fall almost a full percentage point, to 2.3%, by the end of this year, absent any import duties. But they expect tariffs will raise end-of-year inflation to 2.8%. On Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that higher tariffs could lift inflation and limit the central bank's ability to cut rates, calling it 'a possible outcome.' But he emphasized that it would depend on how many imports are hit with tariffs and for how long. 'In some cases, it doesn't reach the consumer much, and in some cases it does,' Powell said. 'And it really does depend on facts that we haven't seen yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cost-of-groceries-gas-goes-up-as-us-inflation-worsens/7972230.html	2025-02-12T07:29:23-08:00	
Evacuations in eastern Ukraine's Pokrovsk as Russian forces inch closer	Ukrainian forces are trying to slow down an ongoing Russian advance toward the city of Pokrovsk in Eastern Ukraine's Dontesk region. The Ukrainian government has been evacuating civilians from the region, but constant shelling is making it dangerous. Kateryna Besedina has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

UN rights office estimates up to 1,400 killed in crackdown on protests in Bangladesh	Geneva — The U.N. human rights office on Wednesday estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister. In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services 'systematically engaged' in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation. Citing 'various credible sources,' the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 — the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising. Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured 'were shot by Bangladesh's security forces,' the report said. Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed —- or as many as about 180 people — were children. In some cases, 'security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,' it said. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk cited signs that 'extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture' were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests. The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country's interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown. The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said 'many perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.' The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said. While the government has changed, 'the system has not necessarily changed,' Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office's Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. 'Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,' he said. Such a situation creates 'a potential conflict of interest' and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added. The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with 'imminent threat of death or serious injury.' In a statement after the report was published, Yunus reiterated his government's commitment to upholding the rule of law and said it was crucial to reform the country's law enforcement and justice sectors. 'I call on everyone working inside these institutions to side with justice, the law, and the people of Bangladesh in holding to account their own peers and others who have broken the law and violated the human and civil rights of their fellow citizens,' he said. What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the 'immediate trigger' to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-office-estimates-up-to-1-400-killed-in-crackdown-on-protests-in-bangladesh/7972079.html	2025-02-12T05:49:48-08:00

Paul McCartney rocks the Bowery - Inside his surprise NYC concert	New York — Paul McCartney’s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575. It was probably less than that since McCartney’s sound board and gear — too much to fit backstage — occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage. Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening. 'So, here we are,' McCartney said, grinning. 'Some little gig. New York. Why not?' Later, before launching into 'Let Me Roll It,' he added: 'I can’t quite believe we’re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.' It was not McCartney’s first impromptu concert. The Beatles famously performed in 1969 atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London. Since then, he’s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York. In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles’ famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his 'Egyptian Station.' With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes. For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery. Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. 'I thought: I can do this,' Jaffe said before the show. 'I put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.' Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: 'I don’t actually believe it.' Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom. 'We just got lucky,' Sokoloff said. 'I’m always learning about these things the day after.' McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: 'You don’t need to rehearse!' If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn’t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with 'A Hard Day’s Night' and also performed 'Got To Get You Into My Life,' 'Maybe I’m Amazed,' 'Lady Madonna,' 'Jet,' 'Get Back,' 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,' 'Let it Be' and 'Hey Jude.' 'Blackbird' was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States. 'We were just kids,' McCartney said. 'I’ve got grandchildren older than that now.' In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' 'From Me to You.' 'It had everything to do with the fans, really,' McCartney said. Before playing the Wings song 'Mrs. Vanderbilt,' McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. 'Let’s hope it gets back to that soon,' he said. Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. 'That was a Beatles scream.' Then he asked for more, saying, 'OK, let’s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.' All in attendance obliged. McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, 'Now and Then,' a ballad penned by Lennon in the late ’70s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson’s 2021 documentary, 'The Beatles: Get Back.' The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York. 'Let’s hear it for John,' he said. McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary festivities. He’s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday. It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he’s hoping to finish a new album this year. For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. 'Some of us need to get some sleep, you know,' he replied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paul-mccartney-rocks-the-bowery---inside-his-surprise-nyc-concert-/7972017.html	2025-02-12T04:33:18-08:00	
Snow and freezing rain pummel the mid-Atlantic while California prepares for likely flooding	Snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected to continue pummeling the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, while California readied for a storm that could flood areas ravaged by the recent wildfires. Especially heavy snowfall — up to nearly 25 centimeters — was expected in parts of Virginia and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Ice accumulations could reach more than 8.4 millimeters in Stanleytown, Virginia, and 6.3 millimeters in Glendale Springs, North Carolina. In California, an atmospheric river — a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas — was expected to move in late Wednesday, likely flooding urban areas across central and Southern California, according to the weather service. The snowstorm that blew into the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday caused accidents on icy roads and prompted school closures. By Tuesday night, nearly 12,000 people in Virginia had lost power, according to PowerOutage.us. 'Stay home and off the roads tonight, Virginia,' the Virginia Department of Transportation posted on social media Tuesday night, alongside a meme of Dorothy from 'The Wizard of Oz' saying, 'There’s no place like home.' In parts of Baltimore and Washington, 2.5 centimeters of snow was falling each hour, according to the weather service. All Washington public schools were closed Wednesday due to the weather. Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said Tuesday it had 5,400 workers dedicated to restoring power. About 65 Virginia National Guard soldiers were at facilities along the Interstate 95 and state Route 29 corridors and in southwest Virginia to support the storm response, guard officials said. Another 20 soldiers and members of the Virginia Defense Force were in support roles. Winter storm warnings extended from northwest North Carolina to southern New Jersey, and the snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures climb. Meanwhile a separate storm system was expected to dump heavy snow on an area stretching from Kansas to the Great Lakes starting Tuesday night, the weather service said. The Kansas Legislature canceled Wednesday meetings because of the weather, and Gov. Laura Kelly closed state offices in the capital, Topeka. Hundreds of accidents In Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency and schools and government offices were closed Tuesday, state police reported 700 accidents and dozens of injuries Tuesday. Matt Demlein, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said they can't say definitively that all were weather related. In southern West Virginia, multiple crashes temporarily shut down several major highways Tuesday. Smith’s Towing and Truck Repair responded to at least 15 calls, mostly from tractor-trailer drivers who got stuck on Interstate 64 in Greenbrier County near the Virginia border, dispatcher Kelly Pickles said. 'Basically, they just get sucked over into the median or they go off of the interstate just a little bit on the right-hand side,' she said. 'And they just don’t have enough power in their vehicles to get back onto the road, due to the icy conditions.' ‘Skating rinks instead of roads’ Paige Williams, who owns Downtown Books in Lexington, Virginia, closed her store Tuesday because of the weather. She hoped to reopen Wednesday, noting that Lexington and surrounding Rockbridge County are dependable when it comes to clearing the roads. But with temperatures on either side of freezing Tuesday night and Wednesday, the rain that is supposed to follow could make the roads better or worse. 'It’s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,' Williams said. 'Rain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.' Bitter cold temperatures An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. The temperature bottomed out Tuesday morning at minus 35 Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died from cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for homeless people in the city of about 35,000 were out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needed them, according to Erickson. 'When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,' Erickson said. In Oregon’s Multnomah County, officials extended a state of emergency through at least Thursday. Five emergency shelters were set to open Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Midweek wind chill readings could dip to minus 12 Celsius in Portland, the weather service said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/snow-and-freezing-rain-pummel-the-mid-atlantic-while-california-prepares-for-likely-flooding-/7972005.html	2025-02-12T04:15:34-08:00

Arab League chief rejects Trump plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza	Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected any plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying Wednesday that such resettlement would be 'unacceptable.' Aboul Gheit told the World Governments Summit that U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of war-ravaged Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a 'damaging effect on peace and stability.' 'It's unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,' Aboul Gheit said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said after talks Tuesday with Trump that he reiterated his country’s 'steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,' Abdullah said on X. He highlighted what he said was Trump’s 'instrumental' role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and called on the United States and all stakeholders to ensure the halt in fighting holds. Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. The status of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was in question Wednesday amid a dispute concerning the next planned release of hostage from Gaza set for Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said if more hostages are not freed by Saturday, then the Israeli military 'will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated.' Trump had earlier suggested canceling the ceasefire agreement if all hostages are not released by Saturday. Trump made his remarks Monday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and threatened to delay the release of three hostages set to be freed Saturday. A Hamas official said Tuesday the only way for the captives to be freed was to respect the terms of the truce. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, also said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and said Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' A United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. In Paris, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Hamas to adhere to the planned hostage release. 'We must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immense tragedy,' he said. 'I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages next Saturday.' 'Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement and resume serious negotiations in Doha for the second phase,' Guterres said. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-league-chief-rejects-trump-plan-to-displace-palestinians-from-gaza-/7971978.html	2025-02-12T03:30:29-08:00	
Investigators file criminal complaints against Philippine vice president	MANILA, Philippines — Philippine government investigators filed criminal complaints, including sedition, against Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday over her public threat to have the president assassinated if she herself was killed in an escalating political storm. National Bureau of Investigation Director Jaime Santiago said at a news conference that the complaints of inciting to sedition and grave threats against Duterte were filed at the Department of Justice, which would decide whether to dismiss the complaints outright or elevate them to court. The vice president, a lawyer and daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, reacted briefly by saying that she had expected the move by the NBI. She has accused her political rivals of taking steps to prevent her from seeking the presidency when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s term ends in 2028. The vice president's father himself, whose presidential term ended in 2022, is facing legal troubles. The International Criminal Court has been investigating the widespread killings under a brutal anti-drug crackdown he oversaw while in office as a possible crime against humanity. Sara Duterte ran as Marcos' vice presidential running mate in 2022. Their whirlwind political alliance, however, quickly frayed and deteriorated into a bitter feud in an Asian democracy that has long been hamstrung by clashing political clans. Last week, the vice president was impeached by the House of Representatives on a range of accusations that included her threat to have Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez killed if she herself were fatally attacked in an unspecified plot that she brought up in an online news conference in November. The impeachment complaint, which was signed by majority of the more than 300 members of the House, which is dominated by Marcos' allies, also included allegations of largescale corruption and misuse of her office's confidential funds. The 24-member Senate plans to tackle the impeachment complaint after Congress reopens in June. The vice president has vaguely denied that what she said amounted to a threat against Marcos, his wife and Romualdez, the president's cousin, but her remarks still sparked a national security alarm at the time and investigations, including by the NBI. The vice president said at a news conference last week that her lawyers were preparing for a legal battle in her upcoming impeachment trial, but she refused to say if resignation was an option so that she could preempt a possible conviction that would bar her from running for president in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/investigators-file-criminal-complaints-against-philippine-vice-president/7971948.html	2025-02-12T02:30:28-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China tightens censorship of short-form video dramas	China's National Radio and Television Administration released a new 'classified and tiered review' system to tighten censorship on microdramas on Feb. 5. Any microdrama themed at 'politics, national security, United Front, diplomacy, ethnicity' will be closely and directly scrutinized by the regulator. Most streaming platforms, required to manage the content themselves, will still be prohibited from distributing or promoting microdramas, unlicensed without a registration number. The latest policy runs contrary to the Chinese government's efforts since early last year to promote the microdrama industry. Why is there a sharp turn now? How will the regulator censor microdramas with sensitive themes? How will the Chinese audience respond to the tightened censorship?

VOA Kurdish: Increased ISIS activity in Iraq raises security concerns	Security and military sources report a significant increase in ISIS movements between Kirkuk and Salahaddin, with militants wearing military uniforms and carrying advanced weapons. Iraqi forces continue airstrikes in key areas, including recent bombings that killed high-ranking ISIS members. Despite efforts to suppress the group, officials warn that ISIS remains a security threat, taking advantage of political instability to reorganize and strengthen its presence, particularly in Arab villages. The Iraqi government has intensified military operations along the Iraq-Syria border to curb the group's resurgence.

Allies to discuss Ukraine military aid	Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said allies gathering Wednesday in Brussels would discuss the supply of military aid for Ukraine, including accelerating deliveries of key weapons such as air defense systems. Umerov’s comments came ahead of the latest meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a collection of 50 nations that has coordinated supplies for Ukraine’s military since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Umerov said Wednesday’s talks would also include investments in Ukraine’s defense industry and partnerships on projects with European partners. British Defense Secretary John Healey is leading the meeting for the first time, after previous sessions headed by the U.S. defense chief. 'We will step up support for Ukraine, boost deterrence through NATO, and secure peace through strength,' Healey said on X. New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address the meeting at NATO’s headquarters, a day before a gathering of NATO defense ministers where Hegseth has said he will push for allies to boost their defense spending. 'Our commitment is clear: NATO must be a stronger, more lethal force — not a diplomatic club. Time for allies to meet the moment,' Hegseth said Wednesday on X. Ukraine will remain a focus on Friday, with U.S. Vice President JD Vance expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference.

US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China	WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's 'peace through strength' approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said. 'The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific,' said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington. 'We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,' Trump said. Ishiba said: 'Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific' is key 'to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.' Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests. Security commitment Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases. Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his 'America First' approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific,' Weinstein told VOA on Sunday. 'The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation' with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines 'to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,' Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement. There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region. 'A big concern on the part of the Japanese' was whether the Biden administration's emphasis 'on the centrality of alliance' or the 'so-called multilayered structures' or 'mini laterals' would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. Sneider told VOA on Monday, 'It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement.' In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed 'strong opposition' to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. They also expressed support for Taiwan's 'meaningful participation in international organizations' and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait. At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, 'The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region.' Increased investment Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region. Ishiba said, 'An unprecedented investment' from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are 'mutually beneficial' and 'contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world.' Weinstein, at Hudson, said, 'The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector' and 'the pending U.S. Steel investment.' 'Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,' he said. 'So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability.' In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized 'a foreign policy centered on our national interest' and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world. 'Ishiba respects Trump's America First' policy, but he is also a 'Japan first' prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center. She told VOA on Friday that 'both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.' In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' 'unwavering commitment' to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also 'reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.' There is 'continuity' from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties 'the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-japan-aligned-in-peace-through-strength-to-counter-china/7971803.html	2025-02-12T00:21:06-08:00	
Deadly Russian missile, drone attacks hit Kyiv	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday Russian forces launched overnight attacks involving ballistic missiles and more than 120 drones, killing at least one person in Kyiv. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three other people also were injured as a result of the attacks. Kyiv emergency services reported fires and other damage at buildings in four districts in the city. Ukraine’s military said missiles also targeted the city of Kryvyi Rih, located in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged a school, hotel, administrative building and three apartment buildings. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six missiles and 71 of the 123 drones that Russian forces deployed, the Ukrainian air force said. Drone intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. 'Putin is not preparing for peace - he continues to kill Ukrainians and destroy cities,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. 'Right now, we need the unity and support of all our partners in the fight for a just end to this war.' Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down three Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-russian-missile-drone-attacks-hit-kyiv-/7971903.html	2025-02-11T23:54:23-08:00	
Pakistan sees economy on long-term recovery path under IMF program	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan's economy is on a path to long-term recovery, thanks to a stabilization program backed by the International Monetary Fund, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said ahead of a first review of a $7-billion IMF bailout set for early in March. The comments came in Sharif's meeting on Tuesday with Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the World Government Summit 2025 in Dubai, his office said in a statement. He underscored the progress made under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which has played a key role in stabilizing Pakistan's economy and set it on the path of long-term recovery, it added. Ahead of the IMF review, the government and central bank have expressed confidence about meeting its targets, even as Pakistan, bolstered by the bailout secured in September, struggles to navigate the recovery. Tuesday's meeting focused on the macroeconomic stability, achieved by the government's agenda for comprehensive reform under the IMF program. Discussions highlighted Pakistan's commitment to adopting structural reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline under the IMF program, Sharif's office said. He reaffirmed his government's resolve to maintain reform momentum, particularly in critical areas such as taxes, energy efficiency and private sector development, it added. A three-member IMF mission, separately, is currently in Pakistan for a an assessment under the EFF program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-sees-economy-on-long-term-recovery-path-under-imf-program/7971891.html	2025-02-11T23:25:23-08:00	
Russia says some of the 300 fishermen stranded on ice floe refused evacuation	Some of the 300 Russian fishermen stranded on an ice floe drifting in the Sea of Okhotsk in the Western Pacific have refused evacuation, Russia's emergency ministry said on Wednesday. A rescue operation with helicopters and vessels has brought 109 of the fishermen ashore, but some refused to be rescued, the ministry said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Some extreme sports enthusiasts are not going to leave without a catch, under any circumstances,' the ministry said. It posted a video showing fishermen walking on snowy ice away from the rescuers. It was unclear why so many fishermen had gathered at the location. About a 10-meter ice crack formed from the Russian village of Malki to the mouth of the Dolinka River in the Sakhalin region, setting the fishermen adrift in the Sea of Okhotsk, the ministry said earlier. Winters in the Sakhalin region in Russia's Far East, which comprises the Sakhalin Island and the chain of the Kuril Islands, are cold, snowy and long, often lasting more than five months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-some-of-the-300-fishermen-stranded-on-ice-floe-refused-evacuation/7971888.html	2025-02-11T23:05:46-08:00	
Teacher questioned in stabbing death of first-grader in South Korea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean police on Tuesday were questioning an elementary school teacher who allegedly stabbed a first-grader to death in the city of Daejeon. The killing on Monday during after-school care has shocked the nation and prompted the country's acting president to order school safety standards reviewed. The female suspect was receiving medical treatment for self-inflicted wounds following the death of the girl in an audio-visual room on the second floor of the school, said Yuk Jong-myeong, chief of Daejeon's western district police station. The suspect, reported to be in her 40s, told police that she had recently returned to work after a period of leave for health reasons, Yuk said. She told police she has received treatment for depression since 2018. After the first-grade student was reported missing at 5:15 p.m. local time Monday, police and family members searched throughout the school and surrounding areas. Her grandmother found her in the audio-visual room around 5:50 p.m. The girl was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Choi Sang-mok, who is the country's acting leader due to President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment, called for a thorough investigation into the killing and instructed education authorities to 'implement necessary measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.' Visitors laid flowers and condolence letters at the gate of the school, which was closed on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teacher-questioned-in-stabbing-death-of-first-grader-in-south-korea/7971886.html	2025-02-11T22:50:43-08:00	
Giant schnauzer named Monty wins top prize at Westminster Kennel Club	NEW YORK — A giant schnauzer named Monty won the top prize at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show Tuesday night. Monty bested six other finalists to take best in show at Madison Square Garden. The award is considered the most prestigious prize in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed. Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize. Other finalists included a bichon frisé called Neal, a Skye terrier named Archer, a whippet and repeat runner-up known as Bourbon, a shih tzu called Comet who's been a finalist before, a German shepherd named Mercedes, who came in second last year, and an English springer spaniel called Freddie. Monty made the finals for a third year in a row and won the huge American Kennel Club's big show in December. A Westminster win is considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed. Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize. Every dog at Westminster is a titled champion, but they also are household pets. Some also do therapy work, search-and-rescue or other canine jobs. 'A good German shepherd is an all-purpose dog,' said co-breeder and co-owner Sheree Moses Combs of Wardensville, West Virginia. Some of her pups have become service dogs for wounded veterans, she said. 'Dog shows are fun, but that is what our breed is all about,' she said. Big dogs had their day at Westminster on Tuesday, when 'working' breeds had their turns in the ring. First-round competitor Brina, for instance, is a 71.6 kilogram Neapolitan mastiff. 'I've been struck by this breed since I was 12. ... They're so unique,' owner Yves Belmont, Ph.D., said as Brina napped in her crate, equipped with a 7.5-liter water bucket. With their size, jowly heads and guard-dog history, the breed was developed to be imposing. But Belmont, who currently has several of them at his family's Atlanta-area home, said he also is impressed by their intelligence. A trip to Westminster is a reminder of dogs' variety, even just among purebreds. The same day Brina competed, Tyra the miniature bull terrier also strutted her stuff. Formally called GCH CH Rnr's Top Model, she's named after fashion model Tyra Banks. The hardy terrier breed is 'a big dog in a small package, but they always keep you smiling,' said owner and co-breeder Jessica Harrison of Austin, Texas. Asked where the 2-year-old Tyra falls on the mischief meter, Harrison smiled, 'like a nine, for sure.' 'You can't be upset with them because they're just so cute,' she said as Tyra rolled on her back to get a belly rub from a passerby at the Javits Center, the convention venue that hosted the first-round judging of each breed. Regardless which dog gets the trophy at Westminster, others also have scored points with the crowd. During two nights of semifinals, spectators shouted out breeds and names of canine competitors as if they played for one of the pro teams that call the Garden home, the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers. 'Love you, Lumpy!' someone yelled to a Pekingese named Lumpy, who earned laughs for his ambling gait. The arena erupted with cheers for a golden retriever named Tuffy, a representative of a popular breed that has never won. Calaco, a Xoloitzcuintli, got huge applause for a confident performance that also earned him some recognition from the judge. Xoloitzcuintlis, are hairless dogs with deep roots in Mexico. A Doberman pinscher called Penny got whoops of approval from spectators, too. Despite her dignified, focused appearance, Penny can be 'a mush,' breeder and co-owner Theresa Connors-Chan of Ontario, Canada, said earlier in the day. Westminster also featured agility and obedience championships, held Saturday. The agility prize went to a border collie named Vanish, and an Australian shepherd called Willie triumphed in obedience.	https://www.voanews.com/a/giant-schnauzer-named-monty-wins-top-prize-at-westminster-kennel-club/7971860.html	2025-02-11T20:37:52-08:00	
US teacher returns home after being freed by Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel to the White House late Tuesday after Fogel was freed from Russia where he had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country. 'I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,' Fogel said as he stood next to Trump. Fogel praised the president, U.S. diplomats and lawmakers for working to secure his release. 'I am in awe of what they all did,' Fogel said. Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it 'very fair' and very reasonable.' Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-teacher-returns-home-after-being-freed-by-russia/7971848.html	2025-02-11T20:20:52-08:00	
Russia frees American schoolteacher Marc Fogel after four years	WASHINGTON — Russia released American schoolteacher Marc Fogel on Tuesday following an unannounced visit to Moscow by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and he was headed for a White House welcome, U.S. President Donald Trump said. The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump told reporters that Fogel would visit the White House on his return to the U.S. late on Tuesday, and White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said he would also be reunited Tuesday night with his family, who celebrated the news. On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his U.S. passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler. Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump said: 'Not much' and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians. 'We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that (Ukraine) war and millions of people can stop being killed,' Trump said. Fogel was sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug smuggling after he was detained in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport in August 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana in his luggage. The marijuana had been medically prescribed in Pennsylvania, where it is legal, said Martin De Luca, a member of Fogel's legal team. Witkoff's plane was on the ground in Moscow for a few hours before leaving with Fogel onboard, flying through central Europe and back to Washington, De Luca told Reuters. 'We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,' the Fogel family said in a statement. 'This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.' Fogel's Russian lawyer Dmitry Ovsyannikov confirmed the release to state news agency RIA. 'For the moment, we don't know on what grounds he was released from where he was serving time - a pardon or something else,' Ovsyannikov told TASS. He told Russia's Interfax news agency that Fogel was last week transferred from a prison in Rybinsk, north of Moscow, to a pre-trial detention center in Moscow ahead of his release. Fogel was left out of a historic swap of prisoners in August that involved 24 prisoners - 16 sent from Russia to the West, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, and eight sent back to Russia from the West. Trump has indicated he has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin but has been vague on the details other than to say he is insistent on ending the three-year-old Ukraine war. 'We're making good progress there. I think, I really think we're making some very good progress,' Trump told reporters about Ukraine on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-frees-american-schoolteacher-marc-fogel-after-four-years/7971848.html	2025-02-11T19:46:59-08:00	
White House fires USAID inspector general after funding oversight warning, officials say	WASHINGTON — The White House fired the inspector general for the U.S. Agency for International Development on Tuesday, several U.S. officials said. The dismissal comes a day after his office warned that the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID had made it all but impossible to monitor $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian funds. The White House gave no reason for the firing of Inspector General Paul Martin, one of the officials said. The dismissal was first reported by CNN. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Inspectors general are typically independently funded watchdogs tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies. The Trump administration earlier purged more than a dozen inspectors general. On Monday, Martin's office issued a flash report warning that the Trump administration's funding freeze and staff actions within USAID had left oversight of the humanitarian aid 'largely nonoperational.' That includes the agency's greatly reduced ability to ensure none of the $8.2 billion in unspent unhumanitarian funds falls into the hands of violent extremist groups or goes astray in conflict zones, the watchdog said. Multiparty lawsuit Separately, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged that the Trump administration's fast-paced dismantling of USAID is stiffing American businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done. The administration's abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750 furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the lawsuit says. 'One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,' the U.S. businesses and organizations said. An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge. It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President Donald Trump; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; acting USAID Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central figure in hollowing out the agency; and Russell Vought, Trump's head of the Office of Management and Budget. Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff on leave in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers' groups. 'Insubordination' and 'noncompliance' by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide which U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote. It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration's rapid unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular, saying its work is out of line with Trump's agenda. Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on foreign assistance and an agency shutdown under a January 20 executive order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington headquarters. Interceding for farmers The new administration terminated contracts without the required 30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done, according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration. For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, the funding freeze has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says. For the health commodities alone, not delivering them 'on time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths,' the lawsuit says. Meanwhile, seven Republican lawmakers from farm states introduced legislation to safeguard a long-running $1.8 billion food-aid program run by the aid agency, by moving the Food for Peace program under the Department of Agriculture. Farmers, a politically important bloc for the Trump administration, have been affected by the administration's funding freeze as well. Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who announced the legislation, over the weekend thanked Rubio for interceding to allow delivery of $560 million in U.S.-grown commodities intended for hunger programs worldwide but stuck in ports because of the administration's abrupt cutoff of foreign assistance spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-fires-usaid-inspector-general-after-funding-oversight-warning-officials-say-/7971828.html	2025-02-11T19:42:32-08:00	
New York health department confirms first case of new mpox strain	The New York State Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the new mpox strain, adding to the global concerns over the spread of the little-known variant. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were three confirmed cases in the country — in California, Georgia and New Hampshire — caused by the clade Ib strain. The agency said the three cases were not linked. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years in August, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighboring countries. The New York State Department of Health declined to provide further information on the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-health-department-confirms-first-case-of-new-mpox-strain/7971833.html	2025-02-11T18:44:46-08:00	
DOGE cuts $900M from agency tracking US students' progress	WASHINGTON — A federal research agency that tracks the progress of America's students is to lose $900 million in funding after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its work. It's unclear to what degree the Education Department's Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk's team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute's work. The Education Department did not immediately share details on the cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will not affect the institute's primary work, including the NAEP assessment, known as the nation's report card, and the College Scorecard, a database of university costs and outcomes. Musk's grip on the Education Department was dealt a setback Tuesday when the agency temporarily blocked DOGE workers from more than a dozen internal systems containing sensitive information. As part of a lawsuit challenging its access, the department agreed to block Musk's team until at least Monday while a judge weighs a broader pause. Advocates sound alarm The cuts to the institute raised alarm among advocates who said it could hurt the accountability of America's education system, leaving the nation in the dark on schools' effectiveness. Historically, achievement gaps have shown low-income students and students of color falling behind their peers. The cuts are counterproductive and destructive, said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of the Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research firms. 'Cutting out at the knees the one independent agency that helps improve student outcomes is ridiculous,' Dinkes said. Biedermann declined to share the names of vendors whose contracts were cut. Cuts under contract clause The Institute of Education Sciences is a central source of information on the health of America's education system. Across the country, it tracks student progress over time and across demographics. It evaluates the effectiveness of federal programs, and colleges and schools rely on its research to improve student outcomes. The cuts appear to have been carried out under a clause allowing IES to end contracts at any time 'for the government's convenience,' according to notices obtained by The Associated Press. Among the projects being cut is a study exploring how to accelerate math learning for students in fourth and fifth grade, according to a document obtained by the AP. Known as ReSolve, the project was being led by research group MDRC. Last month, IES released the latest NAEP results, revealing that America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills and made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Activate Research, a small business, lost four contracts and plans to lay off at least 20 of its 28 workers. The company was hired to ensure accuracy and objectivity in reports. When founder Dinah Sparks announced the company was winding down Tuesday, she had a message for her team: 'We are not waste,' she said. 'We did valuable work for the U.S. taxpayer.' Another small business lost multiple contracts after being hired to collect basic information on the nation's schools. The company started laying off workers this week, according to an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Congress gave the institute about $800 million last year, roughly 1% of the Education Department's annual budget. Associations call to reinstate contracts Two prominent research associations jointly called for the contracts to be reinstated, saying much of IES' work is mandated by Congress and relies on contracts to support its limited staff. The groups said 169 contracts had been cut, curbing the institute's ability to report data on school finances and student outcomes. The institute oversees a wide range of work, including the administration of the NAEP exam and U.S. participation in PISA, an assessment that compares academic progress across nations. It's also a major funder of education research and keeps a database of research that has shown results in improving education. IES shines a light on inequity, and its work is 'more than just numbers and statistics,' said the Education Trust, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. 'Without it, we are left in the dark, unable to see where educational gaps exist or how to close them,' the group said in a statement. Mark Schneider, a former IES commissioner appointed by President Donald Trump in 2018, said the cuts give the new administration a chance to rethink programs that have changed little in decades. 'The question is not what happened on Monday; it's what happens next,' Schneider said. 'If we just swing this sledgehammer, break all this stuff and say, 'OK, done,' then we've wasted an opportunity to fix things.' Democratic Senator Patty Murray, a former teacher and member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she will be 'sounding the alarm' to fight the cuts. Trump has promised to abolish the Education Department and turn its power over to states and schools. The White House is considering an order that would direct Trump's education chief to dismantle the agency as far as possible while calling on Congress to fully shut it down. It's unclear how far Trump could act on his own to slash the department's spending, much of which is ordered by Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doge-cuts-900m-from-agency-tracking-us-students-progress/7971800.html	2025-02-11T18:27:31-08:00	
Fresh fighting flares in eastern DR Congo	Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo — Fighting erupted Tuesday in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, three days after a call by African leaders for a ceasefire and a brief lull in the conflict. M23 fighters attacked Congolese army positions in South Kivu province at dawn, local and security sources told AFP. The DRC government has designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting the rebels, a charge that Rwanda denies. The resurgence comes after east and southern African leaders called on their general staff to propose a plan for implementing an 'unconditional' ceasefire by Thursday, in a conflict which has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. The M23 has in recent months swiftly seized tracts of territory in mineral-rich east DRC after again taking up arms in late 2021, in a country plagued by numerous conflicts for decades. The armed group began advancing in South Kivu after taking control of Goma, the capital of neighboring North Kivu province that borders Rwanda, at the end of last month. Clashes took place Tuesday near the village of Ihusi, around 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the provincial capital Bukavu and 40 kilometers from the province's airport, according to security sources. Several local sources reported 'detonations of heavy weapons'. Kavumu airport is used by the Congolese army to transport reinforcements of troops and equipment to the region and its main military base is located nearby. Bukavu has been preparing for an M23 offensive for several days, with schools shuttering in the city Friday as residents began to flee and shops closed over fears of an imminent attack. Banks were still shut in the city Tuesday. The capture of Bukavu would give full control of Lake Kivu to the M23 and Rwandan troops. Almost 300 Congolese soldiers are currently on trial in a military court in the city, for charges including rape, murder and looting. The M23, which claims to want to 'liberate all of Congo' and oust President Felix Tshisekedi, has attempted in recent days to advance into the highlands overlooking the main road to Bukavu to cut off the DRC army's supply lines. But Burundian soldiers, who are in east DRC to support the Congolese army, stopped the M23 advances, security sources said. Around 10,000 Burundian soldiers are deployed in South Kivu, according to a security source. Bujumbura sent at least one additional army battalion to the area Friday, a security source told AFP. The M23 has begun setting up its own administration in Goma, a city of 1 million people, launching recruitment campaigns, including to create a police force. The humanitarian situation in Goma is worsening with no running water in large parts of the city and residents forced to take water from Lake Kivu, where bodies were recovered after the fighting. An increase in cholera cases has been seen in the region, particularly among people displaced by the conflict, UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said. The city's airport also remains closed despite a United Nations appeal last week to try allow for the transport of humanitarian aid and the wounded. The crisis in east DRC is set to be discussed at an African Union meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Friday. With the recent intensification of the conflict, calls for de-escalation from the international community have increased amid fears the fighting could lead to a regional war. But diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict that has lasted for more than three years have so far been unsuccessful. The DRC has called for 'targeted sanctions' against Rwanda but with little effect. Kinshasa accuses Kigali of wanting to plunder natural resources in the DRC, such as tantalum and tin used in batteries and electronic equipment, as well as gold. Rwanda denies this, saying it wants to remove armed groups it believes pose a permanent threat to its security, notably the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), created by former Hutu leaders of the 1994 genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda. To add to Kinshasa's woes, an attack by a militia from the Lendu ethnic group in the northeastern Ituri province killed 51 people, local and humanitarian sources told AFP on Tuesday. Members of the Cooperative for the Development of Congo (CODECO) killed 51 mostly displaced people in three adjoining areas of Ituri province on Monday, humanitarian sources and a local community leader, Jules Tsuba, said. CODECO was a peaceful agricultural cooperative before transforming into an armed rebel movement fighting the rival Hema community. Monday's raid was allegedly a response to a strike by a Hema militia earlier in the same area. Different conflicts and rebellions have plagued the country for more than 30 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fresh-fighting-flares-in-eastern-dr-congo/7971820.html	2025-02-11T18:24:20-08:00	
First US Navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait since Trump inauguration	BEIJING — Two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait this week in the first such mission since President Donald Trump took office last month, drawing an angry reaction from China, which said the mission increased security risks. The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied countries, transits the strait about once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, says the strategic waterway belongs to it. China's military said the two U.S. ships, which it named as the destroyer Lyndon B. Johnson and the survey ship Bowditch, had passed through the strait between Monday and Wednesday, adding that Chinese forces had been dispatched to keep watch. 'The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security risks,' the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army said in a statement early Wednesday. The U.S. Navy confirmed the transit. The last publicly acknowledged U.S. Navy mission in the strait was in late November, when a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew over the waterway. The last time a U.S. Navy ship was confirmed to have sailed through the strait was in October, a joint mission with a Canadian warship. China's military operates daily in the strait as part of what Taiwan's government views as part of Beijing's pressure campaign. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-us-navy-ships-sail-through-taiwan-strait-since-trump-inauguration/7971825.html	2025-02-11T18:23:37-08:00	
US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China	WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's 'peace through strength' approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said. 'The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific,' said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington. 'We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,' Trump said. Ishiba said: 'Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific' is key 'to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.' Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests. Security commitment Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases. Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his 'America First' approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific,' Weinstein told VOA on Sunday. 'The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation' with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines 'to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,' Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement. There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region. 'A big concern on the part of the Japanese' was whether the Biden administration's emphasis 'on the centrality of alliance' or the 'so-called multilayered structures' or 'mini laterals' would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. Sneider told VOA on Monday, 'It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement.' In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed 'strong opposition' to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. They also expressed support for Taiwan's 'meaningful participation in international organizations' and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait. At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, 'The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region.' Increased investment Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region. Ishiba said, 'An unprecedented investment' from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are 'mutually beneficial' and 'contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world.' Weinstein, at Hudson, said, 'The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector' and 'the pending U.S. Steel investment.' 'Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,' he said. 'So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability.' In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized 'a foreign policy centered on our national interest' and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world. 'Ishiba respects Trump's America First' policy, but he is also a 'Japan first' prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center. She told VOA on Friday that 'both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.' In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' 'unwavering commitment' to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also 'reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.' There is 'continuity' from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties 'the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7971803.html	2025-02-11T17:44:45-08:00	
Appeals court rejects push to reinstate spending freezes on grants, loans	Washington — A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully obeyed an earlier order. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the emergency appeal, though it said it expected the lower court judge to act quickly to clarify. The Justice Department had asked the appeals court to let it implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower court order to keep promised money flowing 'intolerable judicial overreach.' That ruling came from U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island, the first judge to find that the administration had disobeyed a court order. He is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country. The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored. Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31 order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said. McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to 'immediately take every step necessary' to unfreeze all federal grants and loans. He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, a move announced last week. The Justice Department said McConnell's order prevents the executive branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over discretionary spending or fraud. 'A single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the President the power to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day,' government attorneys wrote in their appeal. The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can't block money that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell. The court battle is unfolding as a string of court losses is increasingly frustrating top administration officials by slowing President Donald Trump's wide-ranging agenda . Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump's push to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury Department records by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers. The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding pause would bring federal spending in line with the president's priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed concern that some nonprofit groups weren't getting their funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-rejects-push-to-reinstate-spending-freezes-on-grants-loans/7971794.html	2025-02-11T17:21:17-08:00	
Vance stakes forceful claim to US leadership in AI	U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United States would maintain its leadership position in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries not to adopt regulatory standards that might 'kill' the new technology 'just as it's taking off.' 'The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,' Vance told an audience of world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of President Donald Trump 'will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured chips.' Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies. 'But,' he said, 'to create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.' Regulations criticized The vice president criticized the European Union's regulatory structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments 'tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints.' Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources, saying that countries are 'chasing reliable power out of their nations' at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to electricity. 'The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety,' Vance said. 'It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the future.' While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint declaration on 'building trustworthy data governance frameworks to encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI,' the U.S. and U.K. did not. More calls for reduced regulation Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened. French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, said that while safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other countries. 'At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world,' Macron said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the bloc's privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly across all 27 member countries. 'At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have to cut red tape — and we will,' von der Leyen said. Veiled China comments Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit, said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with the aim of creating 'a community with a shared future for mankind.' In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of collaboration that Zhang described. Vance spoke of 'hostile foreign adversaries' that 'have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech' and authoritarian regimes that have 'stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national security.' Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, 'means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure.' The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to restrict access to the service. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a press conference: 'We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus contributing China's part to global AI development.' 'We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building, advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national security, or politicizing trade and tech issues,' Gou said. Tech researchers concerned Vance's remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his predecessor entitled, 'Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.' Following Vance's remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult. 'In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets,' Susan Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation's Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society. 'Many AI researchers believe we're running out of data,' Aaronson said. 'The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with policymakers and users in those markets.' Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is a prevailing concern. 'If you talk to people in the research community in the United States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their research,' she said. 'There will be very severe implications for research in the United States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these international conversations,' Sloane said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-stakes-forceful-claim-to-us-leadership-in-ai/7971777.html	2025-02-11T17:18:29-08:00	
Trump pauses enforcement, orders review of foreign corruption act	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a pause and review of a law that has defined the activities of U.S. business overseas for nearly five decades, claiming that the strict prohibitions against bribing foreign officials strangle American competitiveness in a tough global market. 'It's going to mean a lot more business for America,' Trump said as he signed the order on Monday for the Department of Justice to pause ongoing investigations and review the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for the next six months. The order argues that 'overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.' But the latest annual review of the law's enforcement by Stanford Law School says the number of enforcement actions in 2024 were 'well below the ten-year average of 36,' with 26 cases that year filed by the two entities responsible for enforcement — the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'This decline suggests that each bribery scheme yielded more unique actions against a corporation and its subsidiaries, employees, and agents, but that fewer separate schemes were targeted for enforcement in 2024,' the report concluded. The president's order garnered criticism from anti-corruption advocates. 'The world must not default to where bribery and corruption are the norm,' Gary Kalman, executive director of Transparency International U.S., said in a statement to VOA. 'A race to the bottom harms both the citizens in the country and the businesses involved in corrupt transactions. Those who do choose to flout the law often face multiple bribery demands that delay or prevent these businesses from obtaining the licenses and permits they need to enter overseas markets. In the end, bribery is a lose-lose proposition.' Bribery is still illegal Private legal experts rushed Tuesday to clarify the order's scope and significance. 'Bribery is still Illegal,' according to the headline of the analysis issued Tuesday morning by Washington-based multinational law firm Arnold & Porter. The eight lawyer-authors go on to say in their analysis that not only does bribery remain illegal under the law, which has not been repealed by Congress, but also under various state, federal and foreign laws. They also note that other countries have boosted their enforcement of anti-corruption laws. 'For now, we recommend that companies wait and see what will happen, and meanwhile continue to focus on compliance,' the lawyers concluded. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, said Tuesday that the new order 'puts America on the side of 'routine' corrupt business practices all over the world.' The order, he said, gives corporations 'free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial tribute to corrupt foreign officials.' His statement also took aim at Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman whose closeness to Trump has put him at the head of efforts to radically reshape the U.S. government and target waste, fraud and corruption through his Department of Government Efficiency. 'The Trump-Musk Administration is making bribery and corruption perfectly legal again,' Raskin wrote in a statement. 'The prices of eggs and other groceries, housing and rent and electricity continue to soar, but it just became a lot cheaper to engage in political corruption.' Musk and his companies have tangled publicly with the SEC and the Department of Commerce, but neither his name nor those of any of the businesses he is associated with appears on either's complete list of FCPA enforcement actions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pauses-enforcement-orders-review-of-foreign-corruption-act-/7971485.html	2025-02-11T17:02:30-08:00

Key Islamic State planner killed in airstrike, US says	WASHINGTON — The main target in a series of U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State terror group in Somalia earlier this month is dead, according to the most recent assessment by military officials. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced late Tuesday that Islamic State attack planner Ahmed Maeleninine was killed along with 13 other high-ranking operatives in the Feb. 1 operation, run in coordination with the Somali government. In a statement, AFRICOM described Maeleninine as a 'recruiter, financier, and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Officials did not provide additional information on Maeleninine's exploits. Assessing the success of the U.S. strikes was delayed due to the location of the targets and the terrain — a series of cave complexes in the Cal Miskaad area of Somalia's Golis Mountains. At the time, a Somalia commander told VOA the U.S. strikes had targeted at least 10 locations. Residents in Qandala, a small town in the Bari region of Puntland not far from the site, told VOA that they could see plumes of smoke and flames, and that they heard at least seven explosions. Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played a key role in the terror group's operations in Africa and beyond. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. IS-Somalia has simultaneously become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS's directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree, but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May 2024. Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has more than doubled in size over the past year and may now have as many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier on Tuesday warned that Washington would not hesitate to take action against IS in Somalia and beyond. 'Where we see those growing, plotting or planning with increased capabilities, we will strike,' he said during a visit to AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. He also said the U.S. is open to keeping in place about 500 special operation forces currently stationed in Somalia. 'I want to listen to the commanders on the ground, first and foremost,' Hegseth said. 'The president, he's charged me with, give me your best advice but also keep your ear to the ground of what's most effective.' U.S. President Donald Trump, toward the end of his first term in office in January 2021, withdrew U.S. forces from Somalia. Former President Joe Biden reversed the decision in May 2022, sending about 500 U.S. special operation forces to help Somali forces counter IS and al-Shabab.

Trump signs executive order to continue downsizing federal workforce	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump made a rare appearance with Elon Musk, his most powerful adviser, in the Oval Office on Tuesday before signing an executive order to continue downsizing the federal workforce. The Associated Press reviewed a White House fact sheet on the order, which is intended to advance Musk's work slashing spending with his Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but they need to be accountable and called it an 'unelected' fourth branch. 'The people voted for major government reform, and that's what the people are going to get,' he said. 'That's what democracy is all about.' It was Musk's first time taking questions from reporters since he joined the Trump administration as a special government employee with sprawling influence over federal agencies. He's also the world's richest person and the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Despite concerns that he's amassing unaccountable power with little transparency, Musk described himself as an open book. He joked that the scrutiny was like a 'daily proctology exam.' The White House fact sheet said that 'agencies will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren't required by law.' It also said that agencies should 'hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service.' There are plans for exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public safety. Trump and Musk are pushing federal workers to resign in return for financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers have taken the offer. Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers. Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy, said she's fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program. She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer. 'From the get-go, I didn't trust it,' she said. Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important service for the American public. 'It's too easy to vilify us,' she said. Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal workforce. 'They're worried about their jobs. They're worried about their families. They're also worried about their work and the communities they serve,' said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency employee and current union leader in Seattle. Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington. Murray said workers 'deserve better than to be threatened, intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.' She also said that 'we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or things are going to start breaking.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-order-to-continue-downsizing-federal-workforce-/7971513.html	2025-02-11T15:54:36-08:00

Optimism grows as Niger holds convention on transition plans	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Niger is set to hold a national convention to map out its long-awaited political transition following the July 2023 coup that deposed President Mohamed Bazoum. Junta leader, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, says the dialogue will be inclusive, set governance priorities and determine the transition timeline. Niger's military announced on state television last Saturday that the national convention will take place from February 15-19. Authorities said the meeting is expected to produce a preliminary draft of the transition charter. Junta leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani had initially committed to a three-year transition after seizing power from President Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023. But months of silence on the issue fueled uncertainty among Nigeriens and international observers. Ibrahim Faruk, program coordinator for the African division at Yiaga Africa, said the convention is a step in the right direction. 'This signals the beginning of the timeline for a transition to a democratically elected government in the Republic of Niger,' said Faruk. 'I think why this is important is that democratic stability in the West African subregion has a way of creating a ripple effect. We saw how once there were coups and attempted coups in some of these countries, it caused a ripple effect. But beyond just a return to [a] democratic government, it must also provide the promise of development that comes with democracy as well.' Ahead of the convention, authorities held consultations across Niger's eight regions and formed a national commission to oversee the dialogue. At the end of the meeting, the commission is expected to submit a final report to Tchiani within three weeks. The July 2023 coup triggered widespread condemnation, including threats of military intervention from the regional Economic Community of West African States, known as ECOWAS. Niger's political crisis reflects a broader trend in the Sahel, where military takeovers have become more frequent amid escalating jihadist threats and growing resentment toward civilian governments. Faruk believes Niger could set a positive example. 'Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, who have witnessed unconstitutional change of government — I think one common thread that has been running through these three countries is that there hasn't been adherence to previously agreed transition timelines.' said Faruk. '[So,] I hope that with this step in the Republic of Niger, it will signal to their brothers in Mali and Burkina Faso that indeed there's an importance to return back to democratically elected government.' Mali and Burkina Faso, both under military rule, have extended their transition timelines, despite initially pledging a quicker return to democracy. Mali's military attributes the delay to a second coup in 2021, just months after overthrowing President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Burkina Faso's junta postponed elections, citing security concerns. Political analyst Ahmed Buhari said a transition plan is a good step, but 'it's very important for us Africans to know that we cannot copy and paste an entire system and expect it to work with different cultural views, values and norms,' he said. 'And that is why I think that we're struggling as a continent to find stability, economic growth, security, and most importantly, identity for our people. Different democracies will work for different people around the world. We must create a democratic environment that is suitable for our current realities and challenges.' Critics warn that prolonged military rule remains a strong possibility in the Sahel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/optimism-grows-as-niger-holds-convention-on-transition-plans/7971421.html	2025-02-11T14:17:14-08:00

Russia frees American serving 14-year marijuana sentence	Marc Fogel, an American teacher detained in Russia since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country, was freed by Moscow on Tuesday and headed back to the United States, the White House announced. The 63-year-old history teacher, who had been serving a 14-year sentence, was expected to be reunited with his family in the eastern state of Pennsylvania by the end of the day. He left Russian airspace aboard the personal aircraft of Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign affairs envoy who helped negotiate his release. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained. Witkoff is a billionaire New York real estate executive and close friend of Trump’s. He previously had helped negotiate the six-week Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza initiated by Biden in the last months of his presidency. Witkoff also had been secretly negotiating the deal for Fogel’s release. Online flight trackers spotted his presence in Moscow when he flew there on his private jet. With the U.S. leading the way in the West’s opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was the first known trip to Moscow by a senior U.S. official since William Burns, then the Central Intelligence Agency director, flew to the Russian capital in November 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Russia from invading Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-frees-american-serving-14-year-marijuana-sentence/7971415.html	2025-02-11T13:58:54-08:00	
US withdrawal from UN human rights body draws mixed reactions	Washington — Human rights experts in Washington are divided over whether the U.S. withdrawal from a United Nations body on human rights will hurt North Korea’s already poor human rights situation. Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order pulling the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, or UNHRC, reintroducing the stance he held during his previous term. The executive order said that the UNHRC has 'protected human rights abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves from scrutiny,' adding that the council deserves 'renewed scrutiny.' The decision was announced ahead of Trump’s recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited Washington for the first time since Trump’s second inauguration. Since his first term, President Trump has been disapproving of the activities of the U.N. human rights body. In June 2018, the Trump administration criticized the UNHRC for its 'bias against Israel,' stressing the council that year passed resolutions against Israel more than those passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined. Negative impact Robert King, who served as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea’s human rights under the Obama administration, said that the U.S. decision to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council could negatively undermine international efforts to improve human rights conditions in the North. 'It will have a negative impact. The U.N. Human Rights Council has been a very effective body in terms of calling attention to North Korea’s serious human rights abuses,' King told VOA Korean on the phone last week. 'And the fact that the United States will not be an active participant is again a very unfortunate situation.' Roberta Cohen, former deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights, said leaving the UNHRC is 'a short-sighted decision.' Cohen, who also served as senior adviser to the U.S. Delegation to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, said it is important that the U.S. be seated at the council with a vote and be active in mobilizing support for any new initiatives. 'If the reforms are needed and they are, the U.S. should be involved heavily,' Cohen told VOA Korean by phone last week. 'Walking away cedes the floor to your opponents.' Cohen highlighted that the council was where the Commission of Inquiry on the Human Rights in North Korea, or COI, was conceived. The COI is widely considered to be the first systematic and thorough documentation of Pyongyang’s violations of human rights. She added that an update of the COI is to be presented in September for the first time in more than a decade, saying that Washington needs to be part of the process when the report is introduced. However, others question the role of the Human Rights Council in making a real impact on improving North Korea's human rights conditions. 'The Human Rights Council has become a very tragic farce. It was supposed to promote and protect human rights around the world but instead it coddles dictatorships and gives them legitimacy by including them as members of the council,' said Suzanne Scholte, president of the Defense Forum Foundation and a longtime North Korea human rights activist. 'We're not addressing the horrific things that are happening to the North Korean refugees in China that are being shot and executed when they’re returned.' ‘Illegitimate’ members Human rights experts have long criticized Beijing for failing to afford protection to North Korean refugees and forcefully repatriating them to North Korea. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy in Washington, said North Korean human rights issues need to be separated from how Trump wants to deal with the United Nations. 'This is about the Trump administration’s views toward U.N. organizations and how they are being misused by countries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea,' Maxwell told VOA Korean on Monday via email. 'When these organizations are coerced by members of the so-called axis of upheaval, they are not able to support the people who are suffering true human rights abuses.' Meanwhile, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies in Washington, said the U.S. has other tools to address the North Korean human rights issue. 'Pulling out of the UNHRC won’t make much of a difference practically speaking,' Yeo told VOA Korean via email last week. 'The U.S. has other means and platforms to raise North Korean human rights objections, including its own State Department human rights reports.' The U.S. rejoined the UNHRC shortly after the inauguration of Joe Biden as president in 2021, but the Biden administration decided not to seek a second term as a board member of the council when the three-year membership was to expire at the end of 2024. The move was made amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which launched a surprise attack on the former a year prior. The State Department explained at the time that the U.S. decided not to pursue a second term at the council 'because we are engaged with our allies about the best way to move forward.' Every March or April, the State Department releases the annual Human Rights Reports, which cover the human rights situations around the world. The document last year said there were credible reports of unlawful killing, enforced disappearances and torture taking place in North Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-withdrawal-from-un-human-rights-body-draws-mixed-reactions/7971418.html	2025-02-11T13:57:43-08:00

Trump doubles down on Gaza takeover plan to Jordan's King Abdullah	WASHINGTON — King Abdullah II was at the White House on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his demand that Jordan permanently take in Palestinians and support the United States to take over Gaza — a plan that Trump said will 'be wonderful' for the Middle East. 'You're going to see some great progress,' Trump told the Jordanian king in front of reporters in the Oval Office ahead of their meeting. 'The whole thing will come. It's not a complex thing to do.' He added, 'You're going to have stability in the Middle East for the first time. And the Palestinians, or the people that live now in Gaza, will be living beautifully in another location. They're going to be living safely.' Pressed by a reporter, Trump said that the Palestinians will live 'where we ultimately choose as a group,' which could be 'a parcel of land in Jordan ... a parcel of land in Egypt,' and elsewhere. Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi have rejected Trump’s plans to forcibly relocate an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt so the U.S. can take over and 'own' the territory. The king declined Trump’s invitation to share his counteroffer with reporters. 'I think we have to keep in mind that there is a plan from Egypt and the Arab countries. We've been invited by [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman to discussions in Riyadh,' Abdullah said, stressing the need to find a mutually beneficial solution. 'We're going to have some interesting discussions today,' he said, adding that Jordan is immediately prepared to take in 2,000 children who are sick with cancer and other illnesses. Trump maintained that the United States will not be purchasing Gaza but did not elaborate on his takeover plan. 'We're going to have it, and we're going to keep it, and we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace, and there's not going to be any problem, and nobody's going to question it,' he said. It’s a high-stakes meeting for Abdullah that comes as Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warn that if Hamas does not return Israeli hostages by noon Saturday, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that was agreed upon Jan. 19 will end. 'I don't think they're going to make a deadline, personally. I think they want to play tough guy. But we'll see how tough they are,' Trump said Tuesday, adding that he rejects the incremental nature of the swap. 'They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or all bets are off,' he said. The agreement between Israelis and Hamas on the number of hostages being released for Palestinians held in Israeli jails was negotiated for months by the Biden administration together with Qatar and Egypt. Hamas on Monday threatened to delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages because of what it said are Israeli violations of the truce. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said he has ordered the Israeli military to surround Gaza. 'The decision that I passed unanimously in the Cabinet is this: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will be terminated, and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,' he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Aid threats Ahead of the king’s visit to Washington, Trump warned that U.S. assistance to Jordan and Egypt could be in jeopardy if they don’t meet his demands on Gaza. On Tuesday he seemed to backtrack, saying, 'I don't have to threaten that. ... I think we're above that.' Jordan and Egypt are major recipients of U.S. military and economic aid. The U.S. provided Amman with almost $1.7 billion in foreign aid in fiscal 2023, the most recent period with complete data, according to U.S. government information. It gave Cairo about $1.5 billion during the same period. Trump first floated the idea of developing Gaza into what he calls 'the Riviera of the Middle East' during Netanyahu’s visit to the White House last week. The proposal sent shock waves throughout the Middle East and placed Abdullah in a difficult spot between keeping military and diplomatic ties with a key ally and popular support for Palestinians at home. The Jordanian king has been under immense pressure to maintain good relations with the U.S. over the years while absorbing the shocks from Washington’s policy that has drifted toward Israel’s ultra-right parties, particularly since the first Trump administration, said Zaha Hassan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'There is no set of circumstances in which the king will accept Palestinian displacement into Jordan,' Hassan told VOA. 'The issue is existential for the king and his continued reign,' she said. Threat to Jordan’s stability Nearly 3 million Palestinians are in Jordan — refugees and naturalized Jordanian citizens of Palestinian descent who came as refugees during Al-Nakba, the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. An influx of Palestinians from Gaza would dramatically increase strains on an already struggling economy and could upend the fragile demographic balance in Jordanian society, which includes hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. Palestinians, and those who support their cause in Jordan, will not accept more displacement, said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'This will create domestic unrest,' he told VOA, adding that an influx would include Hamas members and supporters, creating a terror threat for the kingdom that would turn Jordan into a staging ground for attacks on Israel. 'All of these things will create very, very severe threats to Jordan's stability and maybe even survival,' he said. Jordanian officials have rejected the forced relocation of Palestinians as morally wrong. Palestinians are adamant they will not leave the land they consider rightfully theirs. Trump’s plan could also disrupt the fragile peace between Israel and Jordan under a 1994 peace treaty. 'That agreement would be in jeopardy, as it was based on certain guarantees from the U.S. and premised on a political solution for Palestinians, who had signed an interim agreement with Israel a year earlier,' Hassan said. Israeli far-right politicians, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, support Trump’s plan, as do most Israelis, according to a survey by the country’s Channel 12 media. United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese said Trump’s proposal is 'unlawful, immoral and irresponsible,' and worse than ethnic cleansing. 'It’s inciting to commit forced displacement, which is an international crime,' she said last week at a news conference in Copenhagen. Pressed by a reporter, Trump maintained he will stick to his plan to develop Gaza no matter what alternatives Arab countries may offer. 'I think it's going to be something that's going to be magnificent for the Palestinians. They're going to be in love with it,' Trump said. 'I did very well with real estate. I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it.'

How pause in US foreign aid is impacting South, Central Asia	WASHINGTON — In Kabul, Afghanistan, a major midwifery program — girls' only higher education option — has closed. Across Pakistan, dozens of development programs have ground to a halt. In Bangladesh, a health research center has laid off more than 1,000 employees. The fallout comes two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration suspended foreign aid amid a widespread review, leaving thousands of development programs in limbo. 'I'm in shock,' said a student at the USAID-funded midwifery school in Kabul, speaking anonymously. 'This was the last remaining option for girls to receive an education and get a job.' 'People keep calling and asking, 'When is the program going to restart?'' said the head of a USAID-backed education nonprofit in Afghanistan, speaking on condition of anonymity. The freeze follows a Jan. 20 executive order issued by Trump that suspended all foreign aid pending a 30-day review. The president said the review was necessary because 'the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests, and in many cases, antithetical to American values.' The executive order said the current setup 'serves to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries' that undermine 'harmonious' international relations. Now, U.S. government agencies involved in delivering foreign assistance must decide by April 30 to keep, change or end their foreign aid programs. The aid suspension marks a sharp break with decades of U.S. foreign policy. Historically, the U.S. has been the world's biggest foreign aid donor, with $68 billion in aid in 2023. The offices of USAID, the lead foreign aid agency, remain closed. Although the State Department has issued a broad exemption to 'lifesaving' humanitarian programs such as emergency food distribution in Afghanistan, most programs on the ground remain closed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has taken over as acting head of USAID, said that while he backs foreign assistance, 'every dollar' spent on foreign assistance must advance U.S. national interest. 'We are not walking away from foreign aid,' Rubio told Scott Jennings on Sirius XM Patriot 125 on Monday. 'We are walking away from foreign aid that's dumb, that's stupid, that wastes American taxpayer money.' USAID is recognized globally as a premiere development agency, but critics at home and abroad have long accused it of throwing American taxpayer money into wasteful projects. To highlight this, the White House last week issued a list of USAID programs involving 'waste and abuse,' including $1.5 million 'to advance diversity, equity and inclusion' in Serbia; $47,000 for a 'transgender opera' in Colombia; and $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt. Foreign aid defenders acknowledge the waste, but they argue these projects represent a fraction of the $68 billion U.S. aid program. South Asia Though U.S. aid to South and Central Asian nations has declined recently, the region still gets billions annually, with Afghanistan the largest regional recipient. The country, which received $1.3 billion in 2023, now faces a wave of program shutdowns. While emergency humanitarian aid continues after a brief interruption, development programs from child and maternal health to education have stopped. The impact has been wide-ranging. The United Nations Population Fund has frozen all U.S.-backed programs in Afghanistan, potentially leaving more than 9 million people cut off from health services, according to regional director, Pio Smith. The UNFPA, which Republicans have long accused of promoting coercive family planning practices, relies on U.S. assistance for almost a third of its humanitarian operations. The agency, which denies the charge, is likely to lose all that support, impacting its work across the region. Education is another casualty of the aid suspension in Afghanistan. The American University of Afghanistan, established in 2006 with a USAID grant and now operating out of Qatar, has reportedly suspended classes. A university spokesperson could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile in Bangladesh, the Asian University for Women is scrambling to keep hundreds of Afghan students after U.S. funding dried up. To cover the funding shortfall, the university has launched a $7 million appeal. 'We cannot and will not send these students back to an uncertain and oppressive future,' the university said in a statement. Bangladesh, despite its $437 billion economy, is also feeling the pinch. The country is a U.S. ally and South Asia's largest recipient of U.S. aid after Afghanistan, with more than $500 million supporting a wide range of programs from emergency food assistance to fighting tuberculosis and pandemic influenza. In Pakistan, more than three dozen USAID-funded projects have reportedly shut down in recent days. A burns and plastic surgery center in the northwestern city of Peshawar, built with a $15 million USAID grant, faces an uncertain future. 'At the moment, I don't know what's going to happen to the whole program, but I'm hopeful that the program will move forward,' Dr. Tahmeedullah, the center's director, said in an interview. Central Asia In Central Asia, where five former Soviet Republics received about $235 million in 2023, nearly every USAID-funded program and initiative has been stopped, according to local news reports. 'From what I've gathered, all types of programs and initiatives have been suspended as of now,' said Alisher Khamidov, a Kyrgyzstan-based consultant who follows USAID-projects in the region. The suspensions include critical health initiatives such as USAID's $18 million-$20 million 'TB-Free' programs in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, both launched in 2023. 'This five-year project has special significance for Uzbekistan as it was one of the few projects tackling TB in the country,' Khamidov said in an interview last week with VOA. The State Department did not respond to a VOA question about the current status of U.S.-funded aid operations in South and Central Asia. USAID has poured billions of dollars into many regional development programs since the early 1990s, including initiatives to promote democratization and civil society. Those efforts, however, represent a fraction of the total aid. Today, the agency is largely focused on agriculture and health projects, according to Khamidov. Across the region, USAID programs have long faced allegations of waste and abuse, with numerous examples uncovered by the agency's own inspector general. Nowhere has the alleged abuse been starker than in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have been accused of siphoning of millions of dollars in U.S. aid funneled through U.N. agencies. Some Taliban opponents have welcomed the aid freeze, arguing that it could force the group to accede to international demands. Others, such as former Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh, say it could level the political playing field in the country. 'The dismantling of USAID clears the path for the rise of genuine leaders in Afghanistan,' Saleh wrote on X. Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says a multibillion-dollar program can inevitably lead to waste and abuse. He told VOA that foreign aid can showcase U.S. goodwill but also cause diplomatic friction over policy and cultural issues. Clark said that though the aid pause should have been less abrupt, a thorough review of the program is necessary. 'It makes sense to stop as a new administration comes in and reassess where the money is going, where it's being allocated,' he said.

EU, Canada vow to stand firm against Trump's tariffs on metals	The 27-nation European Union and Canada quickly vowed Tuesday to stand firm against U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to impose 25% tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, verbal sparring that could lead to a full-blown trade war between the traditionally allied nations. 'The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. 'Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers. 'Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,' she said. Trump said the steel and aluminum tariffs would take effect on March 12. In response, EU officials said they could target such U.S. products as bourbon, jeans, peanut butter and motorcycles, much of it produced in Republican states that supported Trump in his election victory. The EU scheduled a first emergency video on Wednesday to shape the bloc's response. Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU presidency, said it was 'important that everyone sticks together. Difficult times require such full solidarity.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a conference on artificial intelligence in Paris that Trump’s steel and aluminum levy would be 'entirely unjustified,' and that 'Canadians will resist strongly and firmly if necessary.' Von der Leyen is meeting Tuesday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Paris, where they are expected to discuss Trump's tariff orders. 'We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,' she said in advance of the meeting. Trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariff to boost the fortunes of U.S. producers. 'It’s a big deal,' he said. 'This is the beginning of making America rich again.' Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, said the tariff on the imports could bring back 120,000 U.S. jobs. As he watched Trump sign an executive order, Lutnick said, 'You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you.' Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports. South Korea — the fourth-biggest steel exporter to the United States, following Canada, Brazil and Mexico — also vowed to protect its companies' interests but did not say how. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok said Seoul would seek to reduce uncertainties 'by building a close relationship with the Trump administration and expanding diplomatic options.' The spokesperson of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said London was 'engaging with our U.S. counterparts to work through the detail' of the planned tariffs. In Monday's executive order, Trump said 'all imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries and the UK' would be subject to additional tariffs. The same countries are named in his executive order on steel, along with Brazil, Japan and South Korea. 'I'm simplifying our tariffs on steel and aluminum,' Trump said. 'It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions.' Bernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament's international trade committee, warned that previous trade measures against the U.S. were only suspended and could legally be easily revived. 'When he starts again now, then we will, of course, immediately reinstate our countermeasures,' Lange told rbb24 German radio. 'Motorcycles, jeans, peanut butter, bourbon, whiskey and a whole range of products that of course also affect American exporters' would be targeted, he said. In Germany, the EU's largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that 'if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united.' But he warned, 'Ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.' The European steel industry expressed concerns about the Trump tariffs. 'It will further worsen the situation of the European steel industry, exacerbating an already dire market environment,' said Henrik Adam, president of the European Steel Association. He said the EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports. The United States is the second-largest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. 'Losing a significant part of these exports cannot be compensated for by EU exports to other markets,' Adam said. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-canada-vow-to-stand-firm-against-trump-tariffs-on-metals/7971311.html	2025-02-11T12:50:37-08:00

US military not 'abandoning' allies, defense chief says	WASHINGTON — World leaders are making a mistake if they conclude that an effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to review America’s global military posture means Washington is pulling back, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth Tuesday spoke to reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, home to the headquarters for U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command, the first stop on his first international trip since being sworn-in last month. 'We would be remiss in not reviewing force posture everywhere, but it would be the wrong planning assumption to say America's abandoning something or America's leaving,' Hegseth said. 'No, America's smart to observe, plan, prioritize and project power where we need to deter conflict,' he added. The comments come ahead of key meetings Wednesday and Thursday in Brussels of NATO defense ministers and of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia. U.S. defense officials have said Hegseth is expected to press NATO allies to take more of a leadership role in confronting challenges in Europe and also to increase defense spending — something the U.S. defense chief emphasized in Germany. 'The European continent deserves to be free from any aggression. But it ought to be those in the neighborhood investing the most in that individual and collective defense,' Hegseth said. 'That's common sense. 'You defend your neighborhood, and the Americans will come alongside you in helping in that defense,' he said. But whether that means the U.S. will maintain a robust military presence across Europe is unclear. Hegseth said Trump’s push for a 'rapid peace deal in Ukraine' could allow the U.S. to shift resources to counter the rising threat from China in the Indo-Pacific. China threat 'There's just no doubt the communist Chinese ambitious ambitions are robust,' Hegseth told reporters. 'Their view of the world is quite different than ours, and whoever carries that mantle is going to set the tone for the 21st century.' He also called out Beijing for what he called pernicious intentions in Latin America and across Africa. 'America's posture there, along with allies and partners, is going to matter about contesting that space,' he said. Terrorism in Africa Hegseth also left open the possibility that the U.S. could maintain a military presence in Africa, including Somalia, despite Trump’s decision to pull U.S. forces from the country during his first term. 'Africa is very much the front lines of a fight from Islamists,' Hegseth said. 'We're not going to allow them to maintain a foothold, especially to try to strike at America.' The U.S. currently has about 500 special operations forces in Somalia, helping government forces push back against the Islamic State terror group’s Somali affiliate and against al-Qaida linked al-Shabab. 'I want to listen to the commanders on the ground, first and foremost,' Hegseth said, adding that while the U.S. will keep forces where they are needed, there’s a preference to 'do counterterrorism effectively over the horizon.' Earlier this month, U.S. airstrikes targeted a senior Islamic State planner in the Somalia’s Golis mountains. Defense spending Hegseth on Tuesday also pledged to find ways to make U.S. defense spending more efficient, saying he will welcome the help of Elon Musk, the multibillionaire running Trump’s non-governmental Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 'I hope to welcome Elon to the Pentagon very soon,' he said. 'There is waste, redundancies and headcounts in headquarters that need to be addressed.' As an example, Hegseth pointed to Pentagon programs focused on addressing climate change. 'The Defense Department is not in the business of climate change, solving the global thermostat,' he said. 'We're in the business of deterring and winning wars.' He added, however, that efforts to cut waste would not be 'to the detriment of American operational or tactical capabilities.' Even while cutting waste, Hegseth said, the U.S. needs to spend more on defense — calling for spending at least 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). The Trump administration has been calling for NATO allies, many of which have lagged behind the U.S. on military funding, to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-not-abandoning-allies-defense-chief-says-/7971327.html	2025-02-11T12:36:06-08:00

Europe announces plans to ease AI regulations in bid to become heavyweight	Europe says it will ease regulations on artificial intelligence at a key AI summit in Paris on Feb. 11, 2025, that brought together the U.S. and other global tech giants and politicians. But some experts see bigger challenges stalling the bloc’s ambitions to be an AI heavyweight, from the need to pool resources to attracting more investment and talent. After U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive Stargate investment project and China’s DeepSeek startup, Europe wants to get a share of the artificial intelligence pie. Among other announcements at the Paris summit, co-host French President Emmanuel Macron outlined plans for $113 billion in private AI investment. The two-day summit underscored tensions between fears of too much AI regulation and not enough. 'At this moment, we face the extraordinary prospect of a new Industrial Revolution, one on par with the steam engine or Bessemer steel,' U.S. Vice President JD Vance told summit attendees Tuesday. 'But it will never come to pass if overregulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball.' Macron, who’s been nicknamed France’s startup president, outlined caveats. He said advancing international governance of AI will enable the consolidation of trust, acceleration and innovation in order to set the rules for AI, which are necessary to move forward. Currently, Europe's AI industry lags behind those of the U.S. and China. But the right policies, some experts believe, can help close the gap. 'Europe really has pretty much everything else it needs to lead in AI or other complex technologies,' said Pierre Alexandre Balland, chief data scientist at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. 'The talent is absolutely incredible. … [T]he scale of the European economy is also huge … the education system. Essentially, we see a wind of change in the EU really led by France, and Emmanuel Macron is very much behind that.' Beyond easing EU regulations, Balland sees bigger challenges — such as pooling European research and other resources, calling for investing pension funds to finance AI’s growth, and concentrating on a single AI hub in Europe. 'Paris is absolutely by far the leading AI ecosystem in Europe,' he said. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, senior fellow at Brussels-based Bruegel policy institute, agreed France is leading the way. She believes Europe should narrow its goals — focusing on areas like AI applications for robotics. 'Can the AI make the EU more competitive? No doubt,' Garcia-Herrero said. 'But I think there’s many other issues that need to be solved beyond AI. The most important one is having a single market.' Paris summit organizers have also pushed for commitments on making AI more ethical, accessible and environmentally sustainable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-announces-plans-to-ease-ai-regulations-in-bid-to-become-a-heavyweight-/7971187.html	2025-02-11T11:16:57-08:00	
Gabon courts stand still as magistrates protest working conditions	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Gabon’s courts are effectively closed because the magistrates who run them refuse to work due to what they call poor working conditions and pay. They have rejected pleas by leaders to return to work while waiting for conditions to improve. Civilians say hundreds of people seeking justice have been turned away from the courts for close to a month now. Courts in Gabon traditionally handle cases that include land disputes, marriage disputes, divorce, labor disputes, inheritance and criminal offenses. The courts also authenticate documents and establish certificates of nonconviction for civilians who want to get national identity cards or run for public office. Shopkeeper Narcisse Eboko said he visited the court at the administrative center in Gabon's capital, Libreville, five times within the past 10 days to apply for a certificate of nonconviction, but no one has attended to him. Eboko is surprised that the government is allowing courts, which ensure the protection of human rights and freedoms, to be paralyzed for so long, he told VOA via a messaging app from Libreville on Tuesday. Magistrates in Gabon launched their protests on Jan. 13, saying that they want an immediate application of the general status of their profession, which gives financial and material advantages to guarantee their independence. It is very difficult for magistrates to make fair decisions based on the law without adequate remuneration as stated in Gabon's laws, the magistrates say. Gabon's National Trade Union of Magistrates, or SYNAMAG, said it is surprised there has been no concrete response from the central African state’s government on if there are plans to improve the magistrates’ working conditions. SYNAMAG President Landry Abaga Essono said the union launched protests because Gabon's government refused to improve working conditions of magistrates and declined calls for dialogue. He said the protests will continue until the government improves working conditions. SYNAMAG also blamed the government for failing to improve the functioning of understaffed courts with dilapidated infrastructure, especially in Libreville, Mouila, Port-Gentil, Makokou and Franceville. Justice Minister Paul Marie Gondjout defended the government, saying it is not reluctant to solve the problems and is concerned about the plight of the magistrates and other court workers. He cited a new court building in Ntoum as proof. The country’s financial difficulties make it impossible to raise the $40 million needed to immediately solve the problems presented by the magistrates, Gondjout said on state TV Monday. The government is, however, looking for a way to satisfy some urgent needs of magistrates, he said. Essono did not agree, saying Gabon does not lack the financial means to improve working conditions in a sector as important and sensitive as justice, especially when the courts will be highly important during presidential elections in two months. The vote is expected to end a military transition that began with a coup on Aug. 30, 2023. Essono also pointed out that the government had the resources to increase job benefits for government troops only a few months ago. The magistrates say they have petitioned Gabon's transitional president, General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, to immediately order his government to improve their living conditions. VOA could not verify whether Nguema had received the request. SYNAMAG said it is calling on citizens to be patient, saying that the protest is necessary to improve the delivery of justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-courts-stand-still-as-magistrates-protest-working-conditions/7970989.html	2025-02-11T10:33:00-08:00	
Amid USAID debate, Britain offers model for merging aid, diplomacy	London — As Washington debates the future of the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID amid reports that it may be put under the control of the State Department, analysts say Britain could offer lessons for America on merging diplomacy and aid. The Trump administration last month paused funding for USAID, citing a need to align the agency with the president’s America First policy. British model In 2020, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson merged the Department for International Development (DFID), which oversaw the UK’s foreign aid programs, with the Foreign Office. 'This will unite our aid with our diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort,' Johnson told lawmakers in June 2020. 'The foreign secretary will be empowered to decide which country receives or ceases to receive British aid while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the National Security Council, which I chair,' Johnson added. Johnson’s decision could be traced to his previous role as Britain’s foreign secretary, according to Tim Durrant, program director at the Institute for Government in London. 'I think he'd got frustrated that it felt like DFID, and the UK's aid program and agenda, were separate and not always aligned with what he thought the UK's foreign policy priorities should be,' he told VOA. 'I think there was definitely a sense among those on the right of UK politics that DFID was a bit too big for its boots perhaps or needed better oversight.' Aid shock The move caused shock among many in the aid sector, recalled Mark Miller, a senior advisor at the British-based development research group ODI Global. 'I think the immediate reaction was almost one of confusion. Where does the aid sector go next? What is aid for in this new world where it's being controlled in the Foreign Office? Because you now had a set of senior managers in place who were largely focused on supporting the UK's national interest - however you might interpret that - rather than previously, [which was] a very clear mandate where aid was meant to be prioritised towards poverty reduction,' Miller said, adding that the confusion is 'still playing out.' In 2020, a few months after the merger of DFID with the Foreign Office, Britain’s aid budget was cut from 0.7% of gross national income, the highest in the G7 group of developed nations, to 0.5%. Geopolitical priorities Spending was redirected as the government sought to align aid with its political aims. Almost a third of Britain’s aid budget, amounting to some $5.2 billion, was spent on supporting refugees inside the country in 2023. Aid spending also reflected Britain’s geopolitical priorities, said ODI Global’s Miller. 'There was more attention being paid to trying to out-compete, let's say China or Russia, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Trying to upscale investment in these regions, whereas historically aid had been much more focused on Africa,' he said. 'You've also seen budgets that were traditionally focused on social sectors like health, for example, relatively deprioritized towards some of the sectors associated with the UK’s trade and investment relationships. Particularly energy and climate finance has been a big focus,' Miller added. UK lessons The creation of Britain’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, or FCDO, offers lessons for Washington as it mulls the future of USAID. 'In the UK instance, there was a sort of reputational hit. DFID had a very strong brand, as does USAID,' said analyst Durrant. 'There's also the kind of knock-on impact it has on morale and productivity. I think this is particularly going to be the case in the U.S.' 'But there is now a sense that the FCDO is the one voice and that there are people who have both development and diplomacy experience who are representing the UK in countries where the UK is spending development money.' There are practical as well as political lessons from Britain’s merging of diplomacy and aid, said Miller of ODI Global. 'The loss of expertise and how this rather disruptive merger is going - I think there's lessons about how that could be managed more carefully. I think the second thing we saw in the UK was that closing down a department didn't necessarily forge a new consensus on what aid is for,' Miller said. With economic pressures impacting government budgets, political debates over the role of foreign aid continue in London and Washington, noted Durrant. 'What you need is strong institutions, you need UK parliamentary and U.S. congressional oversight. You need people to be able to look through what's being spent and how what impact it's having,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-usaid-debate-britain-offers-model-for-merging-aid-diplomacy/7970771.html	2025-02-11T10:18:53-08:00

US, UK and Australia target Russian cybercrime network with sanctions	WASHINGTON — The U.S., U.K. and Australia on Tuesday sanctioned a Russian web-hosting services provider and two Russian men who administer the service in support of Russian ransomware syndicate LockBit. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and its U.K. and Australian counterparts sanctioned Zservers, a Russia-based bulletproof hosting services provider — which is a web-hosting service that ignores or evades law enforcement requests — and two Russian nationals serving as Zservers operators. Treasury alleges that Zservers provided LockBit access to specialized servers designed to resist law enforcement actions. LockBit ransomware attacks have extracted more than $120 million from thousands of victims around the world. LockBit has operated since 2019, and is the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific, according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The Treasury Department's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley T. Smith, said Tuesday's action 'underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.' LockBit has been linked to attacks on airplane manufacturer Boeing, the November 2023 attack against the Industrial Commercial Bank of China, the U.K.'s Royal Mail, Britain's National Health Service, and international law firm Allen and Overy. Ransomware is the costliest and most disruptive form of cybercrime, crippling local governments, court systems, hospitals and schools as well as businesses. It is difficult to combat as most gangs are based in former Soviet states and out of reach of Western justice. Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday's sanctions 'underscore the United States' commitment, along with our international partners, to combating cybercrime and degrading the networks that enable cyber criminals to target our citizens.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-and-australia-target-russian-cybercrime-network-with-sanctions-/7970957.html	2025-02-11T09:49:02-08:00	
Salman Rushdie testifies about his shock and pain as stranger repeatedly stabbed him on stage	MAYVILLE, N.Y. — Salman Rushdie described in graphic detail Tuesday the frenzied moments in 2022 when a masked man rushed at him on a stage in western New York and repeatedly slashed him with a knife, leaving him with life-threatening injuries. The 77-year-old author addressed jurors on the second day of testimony at the trial of Hadi Matar, 27, who has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and assault in the attack. It was the first time since the attack that Rushdie found himself in the same room with the man accused of trying the kill him. 'I only saw him at the last minute,' Rushdie said. 'I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious.' Rushdie said he first thought his knife-wielding attacker was striking him with a fist. 'But I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes,' he said. 'He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.' Rushdie said he was struck more times in his chest and torso and stabbed in his chest as he struggled to get away. 'I was very badly injured. I couldn't stand up any more. I fell down,' he said. While lying on the stage, he recalled 'a sense of great pain and shock, and aware of the fact that there was an enormous quantity of blood that I was lying in.' 'It occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought,' he said . His wife, Rachel Eliza Griffiths, cried from her seat in the courtroom's second row. Rushdie was blinded in one eye in the attack and spent months recovering, a process he detailed in a memoir released last year. A speaker who was to appear with Rushdie also was wounded. Jurors heard opening statements Monday, followed by testimony from staffers at the Chautauqua Institution, the nonprofit art and education center where the attack happened about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. Matar has been in custody since he was subdued by spectators after the attack. The trial is expected to last up to two weeks. Jurors are unlikely to hear about a fatwa issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie's death, according to District Attorney Jason Schmidt. Rushdie, the author of 'Midnight's Children' and 'Victory City,' spent years in hiding after Khomeini announced the fatwa in 1989 following publication of the novel 'The Satanic Verses,' which some Muslims consider blasphemous Schmidt has said discussing Matar's motive will be unnecessary in the state trial, given the attack was seen by a live audience that was expecting to hear Rushdie present a lecture on keeping writers safe. 'This is not a case of mistaken identity,' Schmidt said during opening statements Monday. 'Mr. Matar is the person who attacked Mr. Rushdie without provocation.' A public defender representing Matar told jurors that the case is not as straightforward as prosecutors have made it out to be. 'The elements of the crime are more than `something really bad happened' — they're more defined,' Lynn Schaffer said. 'Something bad did happen, something very bad did happen, but the district attorney has to prove much more than that.' In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was driven to act by a terrorist organization's 2006 endorsement of the fatwa. A later trial on federal terrorism charges will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/salman-rushdie-testifies-about-his-shock-and-pain-as-stranger-repeatedly-stabbed-him-on-stage-/7970966.html	2025-02-11T09:46:03-08:00	
Modi to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to Washington this week for a visit expected to be dominated by issues relating to trade, immigration, defense and strategic ties. India, which has built a strong partnership with the U.S., is expecting to face turbulence on issues such as trade but hopes mutual geostrategic concerns will help maintain steady ties.

Trump ally Steve Bannon pleads guilty and avoids jail time in border wall fraud case	New York — Steve Bannon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a fraud charge related to duping donors who gave money to a private effort to build a wall along the U.S. southern border — a case the conservative strategist has decried as a 'political persecution.' Bannon, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, reached a plea agreement that spares him from jail time in the 'We Build the Wall' scheme as long as he stays out of trouble. Asked how he was feeling as he left the courtroom, Bannon said, 'Like a million bucks.' The deal comes just days after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to investigate what the president called the ' weaponization of prosecutorial power.' The case had been scheduled to go to trial March 4. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office charged Bannon in state court after a Trump pardon in 2021 wiped away federal charges on the same allegations. In November, Judge April Newbauer ruled prosecutors could show jurors certain evidence, including an email they say shows Bannon was concerned the fundraising effort was 'a scam.' Bannon had been planning an aggressive defense strategy and recently hired a new team of attack dog lawyers who sought to portray the case to jurors as a selective and malicious prosecution. In January, Bannon's lawyers filed papers asking Newbauer to throw out the case, calling it an 'unconstitutional selective enforcement of the law.' The judge had been expected to rule on that on Tuesday before Bannon's plea deal made the request moot. Bannon, 71, pleaded not guilty in September 2022 to a state court indictment charging him with money laundering, fraud and conspiracy. He was accused of falsely promising donors that all money given to the We Build the Wall campaign would go toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, prosecutors alleged the money was used to enrich Bannon and others involved in the project. The campaign, launched in 2018 after Trump fired Bannon as his chief strategist, quickly raised over $20 million and privately built a few miles of fencing along the border. It soon ran into trouble with the International Boundary and Water Commission, came under federal investigation and drew criticism from Trump, the Republican whose policy the charity was founded to support. Bragg, a Democrat, took up the case after Trump cut Bannon's federal prosecution short with a pardon in the final hours of his first term in the White House. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses. Early in the fundraising campaign, Bannon pooh-poohed it, prosecutors said at a November hearing. 'Isn't this a scam? You can't build the wall for this much money,' Bannon wrote in an email, according to prosecutor Jeffrey Levinson. He said Bannon went on to add: 'Poor Americans shouldn't be using hard-earned money to chase something not doable.' Two other men involved in the project, Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato, pleaded guilty to federal charges and were sentenced to prison. A third defendant, Timothy Shea, was convicted and also sentenced to prison. Bannon went to prison in an unrelated case last year, serving four months at a federal lockup in Connecticut for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. He was released in October. Bondi last week formed a 'Weaponization Working Group' at the Justice Department to examine cases she said appear to have been motivated by 'political objectives or other improper aims,' including Bragg's pursuit of criminal charges against Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ally-steve-bannon-pleads-guilty-and-avoids-jail-time-in-border-wall-fraud-case/7970825.html	2025-02-11T08:26:04-08:00	
Scores dead as Islamic State attacks military base in Somalia	Nearly 100 people were killed and up to 60 others wounded when members of the Islamic State terror group launched a deadly attack on a military base belonging to security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Tuesday. At least 27 Puntland soldiers and more than 70 militants were slain in the fierce fighting around the Togga Jacel area of the Cal Miskaad mountains in Puntland’s Bari region, Puntland security officials told VOA. In an interview Tuesday with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed — known as Fadhigo — said the militants waged suicide attacks on the military base late Monday. 'We have confirmed that at least 27 Puntland soldiers and 70 Islamic State militants, were killed during the attack and subsequent gun battle,' Ahmed said. Ahmed said it was the deadliest attack since Puntland launched an offensive last month against Islamic State groups that have hideouts in the mountains. He said the death toll from the attack could be substantially higher than official figures. 'The death toll, especially that of the militants, could be significantly higher than the number we have provided because they were killed in caves. They were hiding, and we are still assessing,' Ahmed said. According to Puntland security officials, the militants using car bombs and suicide motorbikes launched attacks on the Puntland security base before a fierce gunbattle ensued. 'We knew they were coming as we had prior intelligence tip. They attacked us with car bombs and explosives-laden motorbikes, and then dozens of them engaged in a fierce gunbattle with our soldiers,' Ahmed said. A statement from the Puntland forces said their troops repulsed the attack aimed at taking control of the base. 'Puntland security forces have successfully repelled the enemy attack, and they still remain in their base in Togga Jecel, dealing a significant blow to the extremist group,' the statement said. On Wednesday last week, nearly 70 people were killed, and up to 50 others were wounded, during 24 hours of fighting between the two sides. This latest attack is the deadliest the Islamic State militants have waged on Puntland soldiers. Earlier this month, U.S. warplanes targeted the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the airstrike on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' Puntland began a major offensive against Islamic State in December and claims to have since killed nearly 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS. This story originated in VOA's Somali Service.

Iran pardons journalists who covered woman’s death that triggered protests	Iran’s top judicial authority has pardoned two journalists who uncovered the death of a young woman in police custody, the judiciary’s news outlet, Mizan, said Tuesday. The case triggered widespread protests in 2022. Journalists Elaheh Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi had been sentenced to 12 and 13 years in prison, respectively, by an Iranian Revolutionary Court in 2023 for their coverage of the death of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman, died in 2022 while in the custody of Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict dress code for women. The death of the 22-year-old sparked the nationwide 'Woman Life Freedom' uprising, which in turn prompted a harsh crackdown by Iranian authorities. The pardons of the two journalists were applied on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, Mizan said. 'Following the approval by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of a list of pardons that was prepared by the judiciary’s head, these individuals were pardoned,' Mizan said. Both journalists were temporarily released last year after spending 17 months behind bars and later acquitted of the charge of 'collaboration with the U.S.' in an appeals court. Other charges, such as 'colluding against national security' and 'propaganda against the regime,' remained. But the pardons mean those charges have now been cleared, and the legal cases against the journalists are now closed. The jailings of the two journalists underscores the poor state of press freedom in Iran. The country ranks among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, with at least 16 behind bars for their work as of early December 2024, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Iranian authorities detained at least 95 journalists in the wake of the nationwide protests following Amini’s death, according to CPJ. In 2024, Iran ranked 176 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 180 shows the worst press freedom environment.

UN announces death in Yemeni prison of aid worker detained by Houthis	Cairo — The United Nations World Food Program said Tuesday that an aid worker has died in a Yemeni prison three weeks after his detention by Houthi rebels. The announcement came a day after the U.N. suspended its operations in the rebel's stronghold in northern Yemen. The World Food Program said in a statement that one of its staff members died while in detention in northern Yemen. He was one of seven WFP staffers detained by the Houthi rebels on Jan. 23. No cause of death was given. 'Heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss of WFP team member, Ahmed, who lost his life while arbitrarily detained in Yemen,' WFP executive director Cindy McCain wrote on the X social media platform. She said the worker, who is survived by his wife and two children, 'played a crucial role in our mission to deliver lifesaving food assistance.' A Houthi spokesman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The 40-year-old worker, who joined the U.N. food agency in 2017, died Monday in a prison in the northern province of Saada, and that the circumstances of his death weren't immediately known, said a WFP official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.N. said Monday it was suspending its humanitarian operations in the northern province of Saada after the Houthis detained eight more U.N. staffers. A U.N. statement said the 'extraordinary' decision to pause all operations and programs in Saada was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. It called for the Houthis to release all detained U.N. staff. The rebels have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. None of the U.N. staffers has been released. The U.N. decision will affect the global response to one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. Seven U.N. agencies operate in Saada, including the WFP, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with several international aid organizations, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. Yemen's civil war began in 2014, when Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels took control of the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed at the time by the U.S., in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government to power. The war has killed more than 150,000 people including civilians and combatants, and in recent years deteriorated largely into a stalemate and caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The U.N. had projected that over 19 million people across Yemen will need humanitarian assistance this year as many deal with climate shocks, malnutrition, cholera and the economic effects of war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-announces-death-in-yemeni-prison-of-aid-worker-detained-by-houthis/7970653.html	2025-02-11T05:55:51-08:00	
Vance tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI	Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their 'massive' regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as 'authoritarian censorship.' The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant. Vance, setting out the Trump administration's America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union's far tougher regulatory approach. 'We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,' Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris. 'We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,' he added. Vance criticized the 'massive regulations' created by the EU's Digital Services Act, as well as Europe's online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms. 'Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,' he said. European lawmakers last year approved the bloc's AI Act, the world's first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit. Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the U.S. technology sector. Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%. 'From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes,' Vance said. But he said that 'partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product.' Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup's technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely available to use and view. However, some government organizations have reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use. Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting it. 'We need a trustworthy AI,' he said. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would cut red tape and invest more in AI. In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to discuss Trump's substantial increase of tariffs on steel. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday. A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI. Altman promptly posted on X: 'no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.' The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry's biggest players. Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI -- which big players develop -- he also said: 'Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-tells-europeans-that-heavy-regulation-could-kill-ai-/7970615.html	2025-02-11T05:24:13-08:00

Modi to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties	New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S. President Donald Trump’s top priorities. Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S. ties are solid and that 'this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.' Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is attending a global conference on artificial intelligence. Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are 'very big tariff abusers.' In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on Monday. 'India has enormously high' tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say analysts. 'New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. 'India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.' For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023. India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions — the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security equipment. India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the United States. 'The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,' according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. 'There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.' Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties. Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology. 'People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,' Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term. Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 'It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,' said Mahapatra. 'This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-to-meet-trump-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-and-strategic-ties-/7970558.html	2025-02-11T04:38:24-08:00	
Russia, Ukraine strike energy infrastructure	Russia and Ukraine attacked each other’s energy infrastructure overnight, just days before U.S. and Ukrainian officials were set to discuss steps toward ending the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion. Russian strikes damaged natural gas production facilities in Ukraine’s Poltava region overnight, using a combined attack of 19 cruise, ballistic and guided missiles, the Ukrainian air force said. As a result of the attack, Ukraine imposed emergency power restrictions on Tuesday, according to Ukraine energy minister German Galushchenko. 'The enemy launched an attack on gas infrastructure overnight,' Galushchenko said in a post on social media. 'As of this morning, the energy sector continues to be under attack.' Russia, which previously focused its missile and drone attacks on the Ukrainian electricity sector, recently stepped-up attacks on gas storage and production facilities, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had struck an oil refinery in Russia's Saratov region overnight, causing a fire. It said the refinery produces more than 20 types of petroleum products and is involved in supplying the Russian forces. Saratov regional Governor Roman Busargin posted on the Telegram messaging app that a fire at an industrial facility in the region had been extinguished. He did not name the facility. Russia's defense ministry said air defense units intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Eighteen of the drones were destroyed over the Saratov region, the ministry said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The rest were downed over four other regions in Russia's south and west, it said. The Russian military also said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Yasenove in eastern Ukraine. Talks between US and Ukraine As U.S. Vice President JD Vance prepares for a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later this week, President Donald Trump suggested that Ukraine 'may be Russian someday.' Trump talked about the war in a Fox News interview that aired Monday. 'They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,' he said. Trump also discussed trading Ukraine’s natural resources, such as rare minerals, in exchange for U.S. military support. 'We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,' Trump said. 'And they have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.' Trump’s senior advisers are expected to meet with Zelenskyy this week on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg are traveling to Germany for the summit. 'Knowing how the process works, it would probably be better for Zelenskyy if we all met together and talked through it as a group,' Kellogg said in an interview with the Associated Press. Trump on Monday said he'd 'probably' speak with Zelenskyy this week. Information from the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-strike-energy-infrastructure-/7970514.html	2025-02-11T03:41:04-08:00	
Hamas: Ceasefire is only way to bring back hostages	After U.S. President Donald Trump suggested canceling the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas if all hostages were not returned by Saturday, a Hamas official warned that the only way to bring the captives home was to respect the terms of the agreement. Trump made his remarks Monday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and threatened to delay the release of hostages. 'As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday 12 o'clock — I think it's an appropriate time — I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,' Trump told reporters at the White House. On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters and Agence France-Presse that the U.S. president’s remarks complicate the fragile truce. 'Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the prisoners,' he said. 'The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters.' Hamas said Monday no more hostages would be released until further notice. The group — which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and several other countries — accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. Hamas also said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and said Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' A United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. Plan for Gaza Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan, the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have rejected. Trump was scheduled to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday. 'I do think he'll take' refugees, Trump said Monday of the king. Asked if he would withhold aid from Jordan and Egypt if they declined to do so, Trump said: 'Yeah, maybe, sure, why not... if they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid.' King Abdullah has said he rejected any moves to annex land and displace Palestinians. He is expected to tell Trump such a move could spur radicalism, spread chaos in the region, jeopardize peace with Israel and threaten the country's very survival. Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday that Arab states rejected the plan to displace Palestinians and take control of the enclave. Egypt's foreign ministry said Abdelatty stressed the importance of rebuilding Gaza while Palestinians remained there. After the meeting, the U.S. State Department issued a statement that did not explicitly mention Trump's plan but added that Rubio 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again.' Terms of the ceasefire During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-ceasefire-is-only-way-to-bring-back-hostages-/7970496.html	2025-02-11T03:21:39-08:00	
EU's AI push to get $50 billion boost, EU's von der Leyen says	PARIS — Europe will invest an additional $51.5 billion to bolster the bloc's artificial intelligence ambition, European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday. It will come on top of the European AI Champions Initiative, that has already pledged 150 billion euros from providers, investors and industry, von der Leyen told the Paris AI Summit. 'Thereby we aim to mobilize a total of 200 billion euros for AI investments in Europe,' she said. Von der Leyen said investments will focus on industrial and mission-critical technologies.

Five killed in suicide bomb blast in northeastern Afghanistan, police say	At least five people were killed when a suicide bomber with explosives strapped to his body detonated outside a bank in northeastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, police said. The blast took place at 8:35 a.m. near the Kabul Bank branch in Kunduz province, killing the bank's security guard and four others including civilians and members of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, police said. Seven people were wounded, provincial police spokesman Jumma Uddin Khakasr added. He did not say who was believed to be behind the attack and no group has claimed responsibility so far. Militants from the Afghan chapters of Islamic State have waged an insurgency against the Taliban since they returned to power in 2021. Taliban authorities say they have mostly crushed the group, even as it continues to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-killed-in-suicide-bomb-blast-in-northeastern-afghanistan-police-say/7970453.html	2025-02-11T01:51:53-08:00	
Virginia governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on mid-Atlantic states	A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings of potential power outages. The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West Virginia. Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set to be closed Tuesday. The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to 1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with heavy ice buildups. 'Did you think winter was over? Think again!' the weather service's office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media platform X. Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday morning. In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for snowplows and other vehicles. Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey, and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee, southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday afternoon. A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said. Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needs them, Erickson said. 'When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,' he said. 'Having all those resources available literally can save their life or keep them from frostbite.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-governor-declares-storm-emergency-as-snow-and-ice-bear-down-on-mid-atlantic-states/7970427.html	2025-02-11T00:16:20-08:00	
Singapore detains student accused of embracing far-right extremism	SINGAPORE — An 18-year-old Singapore student who was radicalized by violent far-right extremism online and who idolized the gunman behind deadly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand has been detained under the Internal Security Act, the government said. Nick Lee Xing Qiu, identified as an 'East Asian supremacist,' envisioned starting a 'race war' between Chinese and Malays in Singapore, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said in statement issued on Monday. 'At the point of his arrest, Lee's attack ideations were aspirational and he had no timeline to carry them out,' the ISD said, adding investigations into his online contacts had not revealed any imminent threats to Singapore. Lee has been detained since December under the ISA, which allows suspects to be held for up to two years without trial. The ISD said Lee found Islamophobic and far-right extremist content on social media in 2023, and then began actively searching for such content. It said he idolized the gunman who killed 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, role-playing as him in an online simulation. 'Lee aspired to carry out attacks against Muslims in Singapore with like-minded, far-right individuals that he conversed with online,' the ISD said. Lee is the third Singaporean youth with far-right extremist ideologies to be dealt with under the ISA, the department said, noting far-right extremism was a growing concern globally. 'Youths may be more susceptible to such ideologies and may gravitate toward the sense of belonging and identity that far-right movements appear to provide,' the ISD said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-detains-student-accused-of-embracing-far-right-extremism/7970405.html	2025-02-10T23:05:07-08:00	
Indonesia general to head state food procurement company, sparking concerns	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's appointment of an army general to run the national food procurement company has raised concerns about the expansion of military roles under President Prabowo Subianto, with a rights activist saying it also violated military laws. Major General Novi Helmy Prasetya was named chief executive of Bulog, a powerful state logistics company in charge of government-controlled imports of rice and other important food staples, on the weekend, becoming the first active duty general in the role since the authoritarian regime of General Suharto. Under military laws, soldiers are allowed to fill civilian posts only at state institutions in sectors such as defense, security, intelligence and disaster response. They are also not allowed to be involved in politics and business. 'This is a threat to democracy and a violation towards the law,' said Ardi Manto Adiputra, director of Indonesian rights group Imparsial, late on Monday. The armed forces are subject to the military justice system, which is separate from the civilian criminal code, raising issues of oversight and transparency at any government institution run by active duty officers, Adiputra said. State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said the appointment was a strategic move towards achieving a goal of food self-sufficiency, according to state news agency Antara. The SOE ministry and the presidential communication office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. The military law does not stipulate penalties for such a breach. However, the appointment can be appealed through a petition to the administrative court. It follows other military appointments in civic works since Prabowo took office in October, a trend that has caused unease among some people as it raises comparisons to Suharto's military-backed regime when the armed forces dominated public life. Prabowo was a military commander under Suharto, his former father-in-law. Suharto was overthrown in 1998. Sana Jaffrey, a research fellow at the Australian National University, noted Prabowo had appointed other active duty officers, such as his cabinet secretary and senior officials at the ministries of agriculture and transportation, which she said showed he trusted the military to help him meet his goals. 'But he's not willing to consider the long-term political consequences of placing active military officers in civilian roles, whether this is at odds with the law or what sort of institutional damage this might cause,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-general-to-head-state-food-procurement-company-sparking-concerns-/7970402.html	2025-02-10T22:52:57-08:00	
Private jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person, authorities say	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said. Neil's jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil's representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them. 'Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today,' Robinson said. The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said. Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane. Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,' Folio said. The runway has been closed and will remain closed 'for the foreseeable future,' Kuester said. Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies. 'On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,' she said. 'We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.' The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away. The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/private-jets-collide-at-scottsdale-airport-in-arizona-killing-1-person-authorities-say/7970380.html	2025-02-10T21:40:03-08:00	
Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports	U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel tariffs that could hit Canada and Mexico, the top two exporters to the U.S., the hardest. Trump’s ongoing trade offensive also provoked chiding from the U.S.’ top competitor, China. VOA correspondent Anita Powell reports from the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-imports/7970363.html	2025-02-10T20:37:02-08:00	
Back to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper straws’	President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring that it is 'the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws.' Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July 2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly recyclable products. Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws 'are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws.' He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use. 'It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,' Trump said Monday as he signed the order. The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035. Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy 'DEAD!' in a social media post over the weekend. In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings. He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the use of paper straws within 45 days. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/back-to-plastic-trump-announces-us-policy-to-end-the-use-of-paper-straws-/7970362.html	2025-02-10T20:01:41-08:00	
US senior advisers to talk with Zelenskyy on Munich sidelines	Senior advisers in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump are preparing to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to an Associated Press interview with retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. Kellogg, a special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said planning continues for talks with Zelenskyy at the annual conference. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Kellogg are among those who could participate in the sideline conversations with Ukraine’s president, AP reported. Trump has been critical about how much the war is costing the U.S. and has said European countries should repay the U.S. for helping Ukraine. During his campaign, Trump said if he were elected president, he would bring a swift end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, but he did not specify how he would accomplish that. Recently, he has said that he wants to make a deal with Ukraine to continue U.S. support in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. On Monday, AP reported the president said there are people currently working on a money-for-minerals-deal with Ukraine. 'We have people over there today who are making a deal that, as we give money, we get minerals and we get oil and we get all sorts of things,' Trump said. Kellogg told AP that 'the economics of that would allow for further support to the Ukrainians.' Meanwhile, Russian drone attacks caused a fire in Kyiv, injured a woman in Sumy and damaged several homes, according to Ukrainian officials. The Russian military reported downing 15 Ukrainian drones overnight, including seven in the Krasnodar region. Nobody was hurt as a result of the fire in Kyiv, which was sparked in a non-residential building, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Five houses were damaged and a woman was reportedly injured in the northeastern city of Sumy, regional governor Ihor Kalchenko said on Telegram. Material from the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senior-advisers-to-talk-with-zelenskyy-on-munich-sidelines/7970359.html	2025-02-10T19:50:15-08:00	
Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports	White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers. 'It’s a big deal,' Trump said, the thick black marker in his right hand hovering over the executive order. 'This is the beginning of making America rich again,' he said, dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper. Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval Office. Trump's trade adviser said this move will help domestic producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back. 'You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you,' Lutnick said. The nuts and bolts Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be 'melted and poured' and aluminum to be 'smelted and cast' in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel. The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 'The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security,' he told reporters. 'This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum,' Navarro said. What now? Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat exchange. Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods. 'There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,' said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'They harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade issues.' Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global policy questions. 'It's not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this is going to be permanent,' said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma State University. 'Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are part of?' He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade relationships, which will likely alarm producers. 'It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses, again, hate uncertainty,' Heragu said. 'So, they're going to put everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have inflationary effects.' Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ 'Motor City,' echoed that concern. 'Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn't a lot of good that comes out of that,' said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit Regional Chamber. Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax revenue. Another analysis shows they could 'impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up consumer prices.'

Hamas threatens to delay hostage release	Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to say 'all hell is going to break out' if all the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms 'as long as the occupation adheres to them.' Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The group said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert. In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the enclave, they would have no right to return. In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected. Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated. But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to return home to Gaza, Trump said, 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing.' 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,' Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build 'beautiful communities' for the Palestinians. 'Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'Illusion of achieving total victory.' Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-threatens-to-delay-hostage-release/7970331.html	2025-02-10T18:45:11-08:00	
France seeks AI boom, urges EU investment in the sector	French President Emmanuel Macron wants Europe to become a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, he told a global summit of AI and political leaders in Paris Monday where he announced that France’s private sector has invested nearly $113 billion in French AI. Financial investment is key to achieving the goal of Europe as an AI hub, Macron said in his remarks delivered in English at the Grand Palais. He said the European bloc would also need to 'adopt the Notre Dame strategy,' a reference to the lightning swift rebuilding of France’s famed Notre Dame cathedral in five years after a devastating 2019 fire, the result of simplified regulations and adherence to timelines. 'We showed the rest of the of the world that when we commit to a clear timeline, we can deliver,' the French leader said. Henna Virkkunen, the European Union’s digital head, indicated that the EU is in agreement with simplifying regulations. The EU approved the AI Act last year, the world’s first extensive set of rules designed to regulate technology. European countries want to ensure that they have a stake in the tech race against an aggressive U.S. and other emerging challengers. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to address the EU’s ability to compete in the tech world Tuesday. Macron’s announcement that the French private sector will invest heavily in AI 'reassured' Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a U.S. company with French co-founders that is a hub for open-source AI, that there will be 'ambitious' projects in France, according to Reuters. Sundar Pichai, Google’s head, told the gathering that the shift to AI will be 'the biggest of our lifetimes.' However, such a big shift also comes with problems for the AI community. France had wanted the summit to adopt a non-binding text that AI would be inclusive and sustainable. 'We have the chance to democratize access [to a new technology] from the start,' Pichai told the summit. Whether the U.S. will agree to that initiative is uncertain, considering the U.S. government’s recent moves to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. U.S. Vice President JD Vance is attending the summit and expected to deliver a speech on Tuesday. Other politicians expected Tuesday at the plenary session are Chinese Vice Premier Zhan Guoqing and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. About 100 politicians are expected. There are also other considerations with a shift to AI. The World Trade Organization says its calculations indicate that a 'near universal adoption of AI ... could increase trade by up to 14 percentage points' from what it is now but cautions that global 'fragmentation' of regulations on AI technology and data flow could bring about the contraction of both trade and output. A somewhat frightening side effect of AI technology is that it can replace the need for humans in some sectors. International Labor Organization leader Gilbert Houngbo told the summit Monday that the jobs that AI can do, such as clerical work, are disproportionately held by women. According to current statistics, that development would likely widen the gender pay gap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-seeks-ai-boom-urges-eu-investment-in-the-sector-/7970306.html	2025-02-10T17:29:46-08:00	
Justice Dept directs prosecutors to drop charges against New York mayor	The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove. Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025 mayoral reelection campaign. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the case, court records showed Monday evening. Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey. Adams pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-dept-directs-prosecutors-to-drop-charges-against-new-york-mayor/7970311.html	2025-02-10T17:28:24-08:00	
Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI	A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire's fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm. Musk's bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: 'no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.' Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House. OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models. Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money. 'It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,' Musk said in a statement Monday. 'We will make sure that happens.' Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'Musk's bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI's quest to remove the nonprofit's control over its for-profit entity,' said Rose Chan Loui, executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. 'This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit's economic interests,' she said. 'If OpenAI values the nonprofit's interests at less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why.' The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel Capital Management, and Eight Partners. XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported Musk's offer earlier Monday. XAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters. Throwing a wrench 'This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,' said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance. 'The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it's a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs' lawyers would justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction.' OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January. Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds. 'Musk's offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation,' said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. 'The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors ... OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank.' Musk's stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-led-group-makes-97-4-billion-bid-for-control-of-openai/7970292.html	2025-02-10T17:01:16-08:00

Facing backlash over $500K salary, LA's wildfire recovery czar agrees to work for free	LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable donations, not with taxpayer money. Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation. Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner. 'Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing,' Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery czar position on Jan. 17. A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday. Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month's inferno. His son, NBC News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated neighborhood where he grew up. He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district. Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting with federal agencies. In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both volunteer positions. Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the role of the city's recovery officer. 'I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to drop everything. This time they did,' Soboroff said. 'And I said OK, under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.' It wasn't clear which charitable organizations would have covered his pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary 'obscene.' Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facing-backlash-over-500k-salary-la-s-wildfire-recovery-czar-agrees-to-work-for-free-/7970272.html	2025-02-10T16:33:33-08:00	
What the Westminster show dogs' names mean	They have names that could make a random password generator cry uncle. Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass. 'She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,' Fred Ortiz said as he groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Her name says ... what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event, you can just call her Wrassy. Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed judging that leads to U.S. dogdom's most illustrious best in show prize, awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience contests Saturday, as well as other events. If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have the names, titles and nicknames to match. Their 'registered,' or formal, names are the ones used for showing. Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog information. Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. 'GCHG' and 'CH,' for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional, breed-by-breed judging. After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end. Meanwhile, show dogs have 'call names' that they go by on a day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different 'puppy name' bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner. The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go back over a century. But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which litter was which. Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical order — one litter had names that start with 'A,' the next with 'B,' and so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as Finn. When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian buhunds, she just likes to have pun. 'I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh, that’s cute,'' said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington. A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence 'Betta,' a type of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he's at home with co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii. GCH CH Aberdeen's Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who likes to cuddle. Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife, model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the movie 'Big.' 'We knew he was going to grow,' and plenty big, explained Hearst. Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog's cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of breed. Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva's Sassafras Lass. She and other breed winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night. Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst's mother, newspaper heir Patricia Hearst Shaw. Famous in the 1970s for her abduction and involvement in a robbery by a radical group, she's been renowned in recent years for her Frenchies and other show dogs. Colton Johnson and his family name their litters of old English sheepdogs by themes, such as songs, movies, money, or — appropriately — fluffy things. One of those 'fluff' dogs is GCH CH Bugaboo's Give Me S'more, who lolled on a table while Johnson brushed him Monday. 'It’s his spa day,' joked Johnson, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The dog’s call name is Graham, as in the crackers that join toasted marshmallow and chocolate to make s’mores. The Johnsons considered calling him Marsh or Mallow, but those names didn't stick. Three-year-old Graham is a grandson of Swagger, the old English sheepdog whom Johnson handled to a second-place finish at Westminster in 2013. Last year's runner-up, a German shepherd named GCHP Kaleef's Mercedes, is back this year for a last hurrah and won her breed Monday. The 5-year-old will retire from showing after this event, co-owner Dr. Cynthian Wilhelmy said. As for her name, 'I wanted something German and something that represented excellence,' said Wilhelmy, of Martinsburg, West Virginia. 'Classic, reliable and excellent — that's Mercedes.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-the-westminster-show-dogs-names-mean-/7970021.html	2025-02-10T16:22:28-08:00	
Democrats look for ways to oppose Trump administration's changes while in the minority	Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump administration’s 'extreme' efforts to reshape the U.S. government, vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both chambers of the U.S. Congress. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S. government. 'This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the high cost of living,' Jeffries said. Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce federal spending. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and communication and mobilization. Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees from being laid off. Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing on X, 'If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.' Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, 'For those of us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive power.' Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose information about wrongdoing. In a statement, they said, 'As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch, Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records, conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.' Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S. government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in the chamber with 53 seats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-look-for-ways-to-oppose-trump-administration-s-changes-while-in-the-minority-/7970251.html	2025-02-10T16:20:35-08:00	
As tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal	New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are next. Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say. Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing to offer to return to a so-called 'Phase 1' trade deal that was signed during Trump’s first term. The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in the contract. Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, said he would assess China's compliance with the first phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a starting point in relations with China. What is the Phase 1 deal? On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms. The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation. The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in terms of regulation. Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in 2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target. The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of China's purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China trade war. Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing. Starting point Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for new trade discussions. 'The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get that ball rolling,' Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response Friday. Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for U.S.-China trade discussions. 'First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they know it’s feasible,' he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday. He also explained that using the agreement 'suits both sides’ interests.' 'Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance, which he sees as his primary measure of success,' he explained, noting that this agreement supports that narrative. He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid making significant structural reforms. Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between Washington and Beijing difficult. 'A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or something like the spy balloon incident,' he said. Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-tariffs-take-effect-beijing-and-washington-look-back-to-2020-deal/7970267.html	2025-02-10T16:18:28-08:00

Arizona adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state	FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive. Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders. Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva-swabbing campaign. The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants. Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated. 'If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,' said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. 'By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.' Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall. The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall. Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months. 'There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what’s in the database,' Riley said. 'A little bit like a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.' Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats. 'They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,' Lear said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arizona-adds-endangered-bat-to-list-of-night-flying-creatures-that-frequent-the-state/7970013.html	2025-02-10T15:48:53-08:00	
15 cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions	Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state. South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were 'two children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.' Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing. 'I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases,' he said. Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two unvaccinated family members. Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data. Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%. But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the U.S. But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services. One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott said the agency has been in communication with Texas officials but there was no known exposure to measles in his state. 'We're going to watch this very closely,' Nott said. Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don't appear to be connected. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cases-of-measles-in-texas-county-with-numerous-vaccine-exemptions-/7970000.html	2025-02-10T15:38:20-08:00	
On sidelines of AI Summit in Paris, unions denounce its harmful effects	PARIS — In front of political and tech leaders gathered at a summit in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a strategy on Monday to make up for the delay in France and Europe in investing in artificial intelligence (AI) but was faced with a 'counter-summit' that pointed out the risks of the technology. The use of chatbots at work and school is destroying jobs, professions and threatening the acquisition of knowledge, said union representatives gathered at the Theatre de la Concorde located in the Champs-Elysees gardens, less than a kilometer from the venue of the Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence. Habib El Kettani, from Solidaires Informatique, a union representing IT workers, described an 'automation already underway for about ten years,' which has been reinforced with the arrival of the flagship tool ChatGPT at the end of 2022. 'I have been fighting for ten years to ensure that my job does not become an endangered species,' said Sandrine Larizza, from the CGT union at France Travail, a public service dedicated to the unemployed. She deplored 'a disappearance of social rights that goes hand in hand with the automation of public services,' where the development of AI has served, according to her 'to make people work faster to respond less and less to the needs of users, by reducing staff numbers.' Loss of meaning 'With generative AI, it is no longer the agent who responds by email to the unemployed person but the generative AI that gives the answers with a multitude of discounted job offers in subcontracting,' said Larizza. This is accompanied by 'a destruction of our human capacities to play a social role, a division into micro-tasks on the assembly line and an industrialization of our professions with a loss of meaning,' she said, a few days after the announcement of a partnership between France Travail and the French startup Mistral. 'Around 40 projects' are also being tested 'with postal workers,' said Marie Vairon, general secretary of the Sud PTT union of the La Poste and La Banque Postale group. AI is used 'to manage schedules and simplify tasks with a tool tested since 2020 and generalized since 2023,' she said, noting that the results are 'not conclusive.' After the implementation at the postal bank, La Banque Postale, of 'Lucy,' a conversational robot handling some '300,000 calls every month,' Vairon is concerned about a 'generative AI serving as a coach for bank advisers.' ‘Students are using it’ On the education side, 'whether we like it or not, students are using it,' said Stephanie de Vanssay, national educational and digital adviser of the National Union of Autonomous Unions (UNSA) for primary and secondary school. 'We have indifferent teachers, worried teachers who are afraid of losing control and quality of learning, skeptics, and those who are angry about all the other priorities,' she said. Developing the critical thinking of some 12 million students is becoming, in any case, 'an even more serious concern and it is urgent to explain how to use these tools and why,' de Vanssay said. The Minister of National Education Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday the launch of a call for tenders for an AI for teachers, as well as a charter of use and training for teachers. 'No critical thinking without interactions and without helping each other to think and progress in one's thinking, which requires intermediation,' said Beatrice Laurent, national secretary of UNSA education. 'A baby with a tablet and nursery rhymes will not learn to speak.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-sidelines-of-ai-summit-in-paris-unions-denounce-its-harmful-effects-/7970005.html	2025-02-10T15:37:15-08:00	
US judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now	BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald Trump's buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. The decision by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston prevents Trump's administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it entirely. More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O'Toole will rule on the request by the unions. The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer — saying Trump's administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday, according to a White House official. Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton called the buyout plan a 'humane off-ramp' for those frustrated by Trump's decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability of many of them to work from home. But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a 'slap dash' fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. 'They failed to consider the continued functioning of government,' lawyer Elena Goldstein said. The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday before O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual government agency. Musk's actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S. lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk's team has been given to sensitive information in government computer systems that contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of federal workers. Several lawsuits The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits challenging Trump's rapid remaking of government and won some initial victories. A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought's move to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump's administration now faces. Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the Trump administration. An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development is partially on hold after a judge's ruling. Trump's effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans, grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the case. On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk's entity from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at the Treasury Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-keeps-block-on-trump-federal-buyout-plan-in-place-for-now/7969998.html	2025-02-10T15:36:33-08:00	
Trump signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs	Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront trade war. Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions. The proclamations were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures. Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be 'melted and poured' and aluminum to be 'smelted and cast' in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into the U.S. The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 'The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security,' he told reporters. 'This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.' Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-orders-on-steel-aluminum-tariffs/7970007.html	2025-02-10T15:35:06-08:00	
2 US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members aboard	Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States — the first since a January deal between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — are heading to Venezuela, the South American country's government said Monday. The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela 'because of economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against our country,' the government statement said. Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be vigorously investigated for criminal ties. Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31, where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues. Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been held by Venezuelan authorities. The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell's visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and provide for their transportation back home. The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its borders in 2023. Trump's administration has also moved to remove deportation protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose work permits and then be deported in April. More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the government on sanctions by the United States and others. Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country's opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was fraudulent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportation-flights-head-to-venezuela-alleged-gang-members-aboard/7970003.html	2025-02-10T15:26:24-08:00	
UN Security Council raises alarm over rising IS-K threat from Afghanistan	Islamabad — United Nations counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting Monday that an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains a significant threat to regional and global security. The discussion centered on the threat posed by Islamic State, also known as Daesh, and its regional offshoots to international peace and security. The Afghan-based Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) was highlighted as one of the 'most dangerous branches' of the transnational terrorist group. It has carried out repeated high-profile attacks targeting Afghan civilians and members of the country’s de facto Taliban rulers. 'ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond,' Vladimir Voronkov, U.N. undersecretary-general for counterterrorism, told the meeting, using another acronym for IS-K. He stated that IS-K supporters had plotted attacks in Europe and were actively seeking to recruit individuals from Central Asian countries. 'There were also reports of small numbers of foreign terrorist fighters continuing to travel to Afghanistan,' Voronkov said. He renewed a U.N. appeal for all member states to come together to prevent the South Asian country from 'again becoming a hotbed of terrorist activities.' While addressing the meeting, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea described IS-K as a significant global threat. 'We remain concerned about ISIS-K's capabilities to plot and conduct attacks, as well as sustain recruitment campaigns, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan,' Shea stated, using another acronym for IS-K. Chinese envoy Fu Cong cautioned without elaborating that terrorists linked to IS-K, al-Qaida and the anti-China East Turkestan Islamic Movement 'are very active' in Afghanistan and 'are colluding with each other.' 'China calls on the Afghan interim government to take visible and verifiable action to disintegrate and eliminate all terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan,' Fu said, referring to the Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the U.N., attributed the increasing threat of IS-K to the hasty withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO troops from Afghanistan in 2021. 'The growing activity of ISIL-Khorasan is no coincidence. While hastily leaving Afghanistan, NATO troops abandoned vast quantities of weapons and equipment there, which then fell into the hands of ISIL inter alia [among other things],' Nebenzya asserted. Munir Akram, Pakistan’s envoy to the U.N., questioned the validity of U.S. claims that IS-K is conducting recruitment campaigns in his country. He cited U.N. findings that Afghanistan is 'the main hub for ISIL-K’s recruitment and facilitation' and rejected 'any imputation that there is any such recruitment in Pakistan.' Taliban authorities have not responded to the U.N. assertions but have persistently downplayed IS-K activities in the country, claiming that no foreign terrorist groups operated on Afghan soil. De facto Afghan leaders assert that Taliban counterterrorism forces have nearly eliminated IS-K hideouts, and the group can no longer pose a threat to Afghanistan or other nations from its territory. However, IS-K has routinely conducted and claimed attacks targeting members of the Afghan Shiite community and the Taliban. Last December, an IS-K suicide bomber targeted and killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban’s minister of refugees, along with several of his associates inside his ministry in Kabul, the Afghan capital. This marked the most high-profile assassination since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-raises-alarm-over-rising-is-k-threat-from-afghanistan/7969985.html	2025-02-10T14:59:39-08:00	
ICC opens inquiry into Italy over release of Libyan warlord	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS — Judges at the International Criminal Court have officially asked Italy on Monday to explain why the country released a Libyan man suspected of torture, murder and rape rather than sending him to The Hague. Italian police arrested Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, last month but rather than extraditing him to the Netherlands, where the ICC is based, sent him back to Libya aboard an Italian military aircraft. 'The matter of state’s non-compliance with a request of cooperation for arrest and surrender by the court is before the competent chamber,' the court’s spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said in a statement. Addressing parliament last week, Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio defended the decision to send al-Masri home, claiming the ICC had issued a contradictory and flawed arrest warrant. The court, he said, 'realized that an immense mess was made,' he told lawmakers. Al-Masri was arrested in Turin on the ICC warrant on Jan. 19, the day after he arrived in the country from Germany to watch a soccer match. The Italian government has said Rome’s court of appeals ordered him released on Jan. 21 because of a technical problem in the way that the ICC warrant was transmitted, having initially bypassed the Italian justice ministry. The ICC said it does not comment on national judicial proceedings. Al-Masri’s arrest had posed a dilemma for Italy because it has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli as well as energy interests in the country. According to the arrest warrant, al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force, which acts as a military police unit combating high-profile crimes including kidnappings, murders as well as illegal migration. Like many other militias in western Libya, the SDF has been implicated in atrocities in the civil war that followed the overthrow and killing of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Additionally, any trial in The Hague of al-Masri could bring unwanted attention to Italy’s migration policies and its support of the Libyan coast guard, which it has financed to prevent migrants from leaving. In October, the court unsealed arrest warrants for six men allegedly linked to a brutal Libyan militia blamed for multiple killings and other crimes in a strategically important western town where mass graves were discovered in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-opens-inquiry-into-italy-over-release-of-libyan-warlord/7969989.html	2025-02-10T14:57:05-08:00	
Trump calls for halting penny production, saying it's too expensive	RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more. President Donald Trump announced Sunday he's ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying power is long past its prime. Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint. Trump's surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to pitch the penny. 'Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,' the Farmers' Almanac said in its 1989 edition. Here's a look at some questions surrounding Trump's order. Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without Congress' approval? Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University. U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and issue coins 'in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States.' If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for the penny is zero, he's within his legal rights, Tribe said. 'Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,' Tribe said, referring to the aggressive executive action Trump's taken on other issues since taking office. Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and metal content of coins, could make Trump's order permanent through law. But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed. Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated. How many pennies are in circulation? It depends on what you mean by circulation. Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That's more than half of all the new coins it made last year. MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny, said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion pennies. But, he says, 'because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of active circulation much faster than other coins.' If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, 'Does that qualify as being in circulation?' Will Americans miss pennies? Experience in other countries suggests no. Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and others dropped their lowest-denomination coins. After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not looked back. What comes next? Trump's order, which he announced in a social media post as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl, was the latest in his administration's rapid-fire efforts to cut government costs. 'Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,' Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details about plans for a post-penny future. After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for their 'valuable' copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the Canadian Mint.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-calls-for-halting-penny-production-saying-it-s-too-expensive-/7969975.html	2025-02-10T14:39:24-08:00	
Boston man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent	Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S. charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China's government by supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups in the local Chinese community. Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter efforts by China's government ato silence its critics abroad. Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges 'ridiculous' and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community activist who advocated for the 'reunification' of democratically governed Taiwan with mainland China -- a view in harmony with China's leaders. 'Justice has finally arrived,' Liang told reporters through a translator following the verdict. U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a statement that while prosecutors 'respect the jury's decision, we are disappointed in (Monday's) verdict.' Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege Demissie. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during closing arguments in the case that China's government sought out Liang because it 'wanted someone already involved in the community who knew the people who were there.' Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which focused on promoting China's goals with Taiwan. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials, in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency, tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two potential local recruits. Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on Liang's right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 'This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China,' Demissie said. 'That's what this is about. And it had the purpose of scaring people, and it achieved that purpose.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7969980.html	2025-02-10T14:37:25-08:00	
UN halts aid work in Houthi rebels' stronghold in Yemen after staff detentions	CAIRO — The United Nations said Monday it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen’s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers, affecting the global response to one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. In a statement, the U.N. said the 'extraordinary' decision to pause all operations and programs in northern Saada province was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. A spokesperson for the Houthis didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen’s capital. None of the U.N. staffers have been released. The U.N. statement said the pause in operations is meant to give the Houthis and the world body time to 'arrange the release of arbitrarily detained U.N. personnel and ensure that the necessary conditions are in place to deliver critical humanitarian support' in rebel-held areas. It said the latest detained U.N. staffers — taken late last month — included six working in Saada, on Yemen’s northern border with Saudi Arabia. Seven U.N, agencies operate in Saada, including the World Food Program, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with several international aid organizations, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. The U.N. late last month suspended all travel into Houthi-held areas. The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen’s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north. The U.N. had projected that over 19 million people across Yemen will need humanitarian assistance this year as many deal with climate shocks, malnutrition, cholera and the economic effects of war. The rebels have imprisoned thousands of people during the war. In recent months, they also intensified their crackdown on dissent, including recently sentencing 44 people to death. In January, the Houthis unilaterally freed 153 war detainees as one of several overtures to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Such prisoner releases have been viewed as a means to jump-start talks over permanently ending Yemen’s war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-halts-aid-work-in-houthi-rebels-stronghold-in-yemen-after-staff-detentions-/7969962.html	2025-02-10T14:26:36-08:00

US judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending freeze	A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump's administration violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to block the move said last week that the government was still withholding funds. The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. 'The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country,' McConnell said on Monday. 'These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the TRO.' McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can hold a hearing on the states' motion for a longer-term order. On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that some payments were delayed for 'operational and administrative reasons.' However, McConnell said his order had been 'clear and unambiguous' in applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders by Trump. The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from the White House's Office of Management and Budget announcing a wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was filed, OMB rescinded that memo. The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked a flurry of lawsuits. In a separate case over Trump's push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, federal employee unions have accused the administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who were placed on administrative leave.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-ordered-to-restore-all-frozen-federal-spending/7969952.html	2025-02-10T14:11:17-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China courts India as Trump, Modi vow to deepen ties	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on Wednesday.

While Modi's government has shifted toward populist policies, China launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its standing with India. Analysts view China's diplomatic push as a response to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing's desire to maintain regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump administration.

US defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings	Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month. Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland. In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting updates on developments in both regions. From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday and Thursday. U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a leadership role for challenges facing Europe. He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year. The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S. This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain. Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting will focus on 'priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.' The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, 'will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.' Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops. Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as 'the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,' which gets underway Friday. 'We're not going to the Munich Security Conference,' Hegseth told defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the Pentagon. 'We're instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we're going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,' he said. 'I would much rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That's my job.' Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-headed-to-europe-for-nato-ukraine-meetings/7969820.html	2025-02-10T12:12:04-08:00

51 dead in Guatemala after bus plunges off bridge	Guatemala City — At least 51 people are dead after their bus plunged off a bridge Monday on the outskirts of Guatemala’s capital, said Hector Flores, who was helping coordinate the municipal government's response. Firefighting spokesperson Edwin Villagran said a multi-vehicle crash sent the bus off the bridge before dawn, trapping survivors. Many of the victims pulled from the wreckage were seriously injured. Volunteer firefighting spokesman Oscar Sanchez said children were among the victims. The densely packed bus had come from Progreso department, northeast of the capital on a busy route into the city when it plunged from Puente Belice, a highway bridge that crosses over a road and creek. The bus fell 35 meters into a sewage-polluted stream. It landed upside down and half-submerged in water. Guatemala City fire department spokesperson, Carlos Hernandez, said the bodies of 36 men and 15 women had been sent to a provincial morgue set up for the accident. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo declared three days of national mourning and deployed the country's army and disaster agency to assist response efforts. 'I stand in solidarity with the families of the victims who today woke up to heartbreaking news. Their pain is my pain,' Arevalo said on social media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemala-bus-accident/7969667.html	2025-02-10T10:58:06-08:00	
Space telescope spots rare 'Einstein ring' of light	CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — Europe's Euclid space telescope has detected a rare halo of bright light around a nearby galaxy, astronomers reported Monday. The halo, known as an Einstein ring, encircles a galaxy 590 million light-years away, considered close by cosmic standards. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. Astronomers have known about this galaxy for more than a century and so were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring, reported in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. An Einstein ring is light from a much more distant galaxy that bends in such a way as to perfectly encircle a closer object, in this case a well-known galaxy in the constellation Draco. The faraway galaxy creating the ring is more than 4 billion light-years away. Gravity distorted the light from this more distant galaxy, thus the name honoring Albert Einstein. The process is known as gravitational lensing. 'All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically. This one is particularly special, because it's so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful,' lead author Conor O'Riordan of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said in a statement. Euclid rocketed from Florida in 2023. NASA is taking part in its mission to detect dark energy and dark matter in the universe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/space-telescope-spots-rare-einstein-ring-of-light/7969600.html	2025-02-10T09:57:56-08:00	
Opening statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman Rushdie	Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New York. Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar, bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for the first time in more than two years. Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater. Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach, chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with permanent damage to one hand. The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his long, painful recovery in a memoir, 'Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,' released last year. Rushdie had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel 'The Satanic Verses' was denounced as blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree. The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa — Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty. A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He calmly said, 'Free Palestine' while being led in to court Monday past members of the media taking photographs and video. Matar's defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and would not attend the start of the trial. Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the defense's opening statement in his place. Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to 10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived. The event's moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night before the attack. Matar's attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization's endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death. A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Rushdie has been one of the world's most celebrated authors since the 1981 publication of 'Midnight's Children,' winner of the Booker Prize. His other works include the novels 'Shame' and 'Victory City,' which he had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir 'Joseph Anton,' in which he wrote about his time in hiding. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group's then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opening-statements-begin-in-trial-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-salman-rushdie/7969468.html	2025-02-10T07:44:47-08:00	
Third federal judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order	Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and 'attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values.' Trump's Republican administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship. The administration is appealing the Seattle judge's block on Trump's executive order. At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed. In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S. Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli, or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/third-federal-judge-blocks-trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order/7969406.html	2025-02-10T07:08:58-08:00	
Romanian President Iohannis announces resignation after pressure by populists	Bucharest, Romania — Romanian President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Monday following mounting pressure from populist opposition groups, two months after a top court annulled a presidential election in the European Union country. 'To spare Romania from this crisis, I am resigning as president of Romania,' he said in an emotional address, adding that he will leave office on Feb. 12. Iohannis, 65, held the presidential role since 2014 and served the maximum of two five-year terms. But his presidency was extended in December after the Constitutional Court canceled the presidential race two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. That came after the far-right populist Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round, after which allegations emerged of Russian interference and electoral violations. Several opposition parties, including the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), the nationalist SOS party and the Party of Young People — but also some members of the reformist Save Romania Union party — sought Iohannis' ouster through a motion filed to Parliament. Some lawmakers from the governing coalition were also expected to vote in favor. 'This is a useless endeavor because, in any case, I will leave office in a few months after the election of the new president,' Iohannis said. 'It is an unfounded move because I have never — I repeat, never — violated the constitution. And it is a harmful endeavor because ... everyone loses, and no one gains.' He added that the consequences of his ouster would be 'long-lasting and highly negative' for Romania, an EU member since 2007, and a NATO member since 2004. 'None of our partners will understand why Romania is dismissing its president when the process for electing a new president has already begun,' he said. New dates have been set to rerun the presidential vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later, on May 18. It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election. After his resignation announcement, clashes broke out between Georgescu supporters and police in front of the government building in the capital, Bucharest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-president-iohannis-announces-resignation-after-pressure-by-populists/7969345.html	2025-02-10T06:33:36-08:00	
Kosovo prime minister looking for allies for new Cabinet after failing to win parliament majority	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s leftwing party won most seats in the weekend parliamentary election but was left without a majority in the house, forcing it to look for an ally to form the next government, according to preliminary results released Monday. The vote on Sunday was key in determining who will lead Kosovo as talks on normalizing ties with rival Serbia remain stalled and foreign funding for one of Europe’s poorest countries is in question. The election marked the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo’s parliament completed a full four-year mandate. It was the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence. With 88% of the votes counted, Kurti’s Self-Determination Movement Party, or Vetevendosje!, had won 41.3%, according to the Central Election Commission, the election governing body. The Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are detained at a Netherlands-based international criminal tribunal in The Hague and accused of war crimes, won 21.8% of the vote. Next, with 17.8% support is the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country. The LDK lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The Alliance for Kosovo’s Future of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj garnered 7.7% of the votes. Still, Kurti was upbeat, though his remarks gave nothing away about who he plans to ask to join his coalition government. 'The people won. Vetevendosje! won. We are the winners who will form the next Cabinet,' Kurti told journalists as his supporters took to the streets to celebrate. The commission’s webpage was down temporarily on Sunday as it was overloaded 'due to the citizens’ high interest to learn the results,' election body said. Results were collected manually. A preliminary turnout after 92% of the votes counted was 40.6% — about 7% lower than four years ago. The new 120-seat parliament reserves 20 seats for minorities regardless of election results, 10 of them for the Serb minority. Kurti’s new term will face multiple challenges after Washington recently announced it was freezing foreign aid and the European Union, almost two years ago, suspended funding for some projects and initiatives. He also is under pressure to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty. Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than $6,000 per person. Kurti also is likely to try and repair ties with Western powers, at odds since his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency, the dinar, and dinar transfers to Kosovo's Serbs. Kosovo’s ethnic Serb minority depends on Belgrade’s social services and payments. The United States, the European Union and the NATO-led stabilization force in Kosovo, or KFOR, have urged the government in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict. In Sunday's election, Srpska Lista, the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, won 2.8% of the vote — just over half of its winnings four years ago. The party's leader, Zlatan Elek, said it was 'the absolute winner of this election,' and thanked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic for the 'strong support for our people.' KFOR had increased its presence in Kosovo after last year’s tensions with Serbia, as well as ahead of the election. A team of 104 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations, monitored the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-prime-minister-looking-for-allies-for-a-new-cabinet-after-failing-to-win-parliament-majority-/7969195.html	2025-02-10T03:38:05-08:00	
Russia drone attacks spark fire, damage homes	Russian drone attacks caused a fire in Kyiv, injured a woman in Sumy and damaged several homes, according to Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, the Russian military reported downing 15 Ukrainian drones overnight, including seven in the Krasnodar region. Nobody was hurt as a result of the fire in Kyiv, which was sparked in a non-residential building, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Five houses were damaged and a woman was reportedly injured in the northeastern city of Sumy, regional governor Ihor Kalchenko said on Telegram. While fighting continued, a group of U.S. officials from President Donald Trump's administration were set to travel to Europe this week for discussions that would include the war in Ukraine. Vice President JD Vance was scheduled to attend an artificial intelligence summit in France before attending the Munich Security Conference with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Munich event, billed as 'the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,' is expected to focus on prospects for peace in Ukraine as well as discussions of other global conflicts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will visit the headquarters of two military commands, then meet with NATO defense ministers. He’ll also attend a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, where he 'will reiterate President Trump's commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,' according to the Pentagon. Material from Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-drone-attacks-spark-fire-damage-homes/7969133.html	2025-02-10T02:54:44-08:00	
High-stakes AI summit in Paris: World leaders, tech titans and challenging diplomatic talks	PARIS — Major world leaders are meeting for an AI summit in Paris, where challenging diplomatic talks are expected as tech titans fight for dominance in the fast-moving technology industry. Heads of state, top government officials, CEOs and scientists from around 100 countries are participating in the two-day international summit from Monday. High-profile attendees include U.S. Vice President JD Vance, on his first overseas trip since taking office, and Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. 'We’re living a technology and scientific revolution we’ve rarely seen,' French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday on national television France 2. France and Europe must seize the 'opportunity' because AI 'will enable us to live better, learn better, work better, care better and it’s up to us to put this artificial intelligence at the service of human beings,' he said. Vance's debut abroad The summit will give some European leaders a chance to meet Vance for the first time. The 40-year-old vice president was just 18 months into his time as Ohio’s junior senator when Donald Trump picked him as his running mate. Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children — Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel — for the trip to Europe. They were greeted on French soil Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy’s charge d’affaires, David McCawley. On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the menu. Vance, like President Donald Trump, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office. Vance will attend later this week the Munich Security Conference, where he may meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaders in Europe have been watching carefully Trump’s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends — an idea that’s been flatly rejected by Arab allies. Fostering AI advances The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture. A global public-private partnership named 'Current AI' is to be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest. The Paris summit 'is the first time we’ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,' said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. 'I see it as a norm-setting moment.' Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by 'moving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.' However, it remains unclear if the U.S. will support such initiatives. French organizers also hope the summit will lead to major investment announcements in Europe. France is to announce AI private investments worth a total of $113 billion over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as 'the equivalent' of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project. Indian PM co-hosting the summit India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron, in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle. India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid 'perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.' Macron will also travel Wednesday with Modi to the southern city port of Marseille to inaugurate a new Indian consulate and visit the ITER nuclear research site. France has become a key defense partner for India, with talks underway on purchasing 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Officials in New Delhi said discussions are in final phase and the deal could be inked in a few weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-stakes-ai-summit-in-paris-world-leaders-tech-titans-and-challenging-diplomatic-talks-/7969168.html	2025-02-10T02:49:06-08:00	
China hopes the aging Dalai Lama can 'return to right path'	BEIJING — China hopes the Dalai Lama can 'return to the right path' and is open to discussions about the Nobel Peace laureate's future, as long as certain conditions are met, the foreign ministry said on Monday. The exiled leader of Tibetan Buddhism, who turns 90 this year, fled Tibet in 1959 for India after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, but has expressed a desire to return to Tibet before he dies. China is open to talks about the future of the Dalai Lama if he abandons his position of splitting the 'motherland,' a foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told a regular press conference. Guo was responding to a request for comment on the death of the spiritual leader's elder brother Gyalo Thondup, who had previously acted as his unofficial envoy in talks with Chinese officials. Gyalo Thondup died on Sunday, aged 97, in his home in the Indian town of Kalimpong. The Dalai Lama needs to openly recognize that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People's Republic of China, Guo said, using the country's official name. The Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognize. Official talks with his representatives have stalled since. As the Dalai Lama ages, the question of his successor has also become increasingly urgent. China insists it will choose his successor as Tibet's spiritual leader. But the Dalai Lama says he will clarify questions about the succession, such as if and where he will be reincarnated, in line with Tibetan Buddhist belief, around the time of his 90th birthday in July. A new book by the Dalai Lama, due out in March to coincide with the anniversary of the uprising, is expected to outline a framework for the future of Tibet 'even after I am gone,' he has said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hopes-the-aging-dalai-lama-can-return-to-right-path-/7969144.html	2025-02-10T01:56:36-08:00	
Almost all nations miss UN deadline for new climate targets	PARIS — Nearly all nations missed a UN deadline Monday to submit new targets for slashing carbon emissions, including major economies under pressure to show leadership following the U.S. retreat on climate change. Just 10 of nearly 200 countries required under the Paris Agreement to deliver fresh climate plans by Feb. 10 did so on time, according to a UN database tracking the submissions. Under the climate accord, each country is supposed to provide a steeper headline figure for cutting heat-trapping emissions by 2035, and a detailed blueprint for how to achieve this. Global emissions have been rising but need to almost halve by the end of the decade to limit global warming to levels agreed under the Paris deal. UN climate chief Simon Stiell has called this latest round of national pledges 'the most important policy documents of this century.' Yet just a handful of major polluters handed in upgraded targets on time, with China, India and the European Union the biggest names on a lengthy absentee list. Most G20 economies were missing in action with the United States, Britain and Brazil -- which is hosting this year's UN climate summit -- the only exceptions. The US pledge is largely symbolic, made before President Donald Trump ordered Washington out of the Paris deal. Accountability measure There is no penalty for submitting late targets, formally titled nationally determined contributions (NDCs). They are not legally binding but act as an accountability measure to ensure governments are taking the threat of climate change seriously. Last week, Stiell said submissions would be needed by September so they could be properly assessed before the UN COP30 climate conference in November. A spokeswoman for the EU said the 27-nation bloc intended to submit its revised targets 'well ahead' of the summit in Belem. Analysts say China, the world's biggest polluter and also its largest investor in renewable energy, is also expected to unveil its much-anticipated climate plan in the second half of the year. The United Arab Emirates, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, New Zealand, Andorra, Switzerland and Uruguay rounded out the list of countries that made Monday's cut-off. The sluggish response will not ease fears of a possible backslide on climate action as leaders juggle Trump's return and other competing priorities from budget and security crises to electoral pressure. Ebony Holland from the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development said the US retreat was 'clearly a setback' but there were many reasons for the tepid turnout. 'It's clear there are some broad geopolitical shifts underway that are proving to be a challenge when it comes to international cooperation, especially on big issues like climate change,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/almost-all-nations-miss-un-deadline-for-new-climate-targets/7969128.html	2025-02-10T01:17:33-08:00	
Indonesia launches $183 million free health screening to prevent early deaths	JAKARTA — Indonesia launched an annual free health screening on Monday, a $183 million initiative to prevent early deaths that the country's health ministry said was its biggest ever undertaking. Under the program, all Indonesians will eventually be entitled to a free screening on their birthday, the ministry said. The screening, which is not mandatory, includes blood pressure, tests to determine the risk of heart problems or stroke, and eye tests, the ministry said. The program is initially targeting children under 6 and adults aged 18 and over, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told Reuters last week. The leading causes of death in the world's fourth most populous nation include stroke, heart disease, and tuberculosis, data from the World Health Organization shows. Budi said the $184 million allocation for the program was about $62 million less than originally planned after President Prabowo Subianto ordered budget cuts to help fund election promises, including giving free meals to school children. At a health center in Jakarta on Monday, about 30 people had signed up for the screening on the first day. Teacher Ramika Dewi Saragih said she underwent checks on her breasts, cervix, eyes, and more and was not apprehensive. 'I was really looking forward to this,' the 33-year-old said, adding that more people should take up the opportunity. A health ministry spokesperson said the target for the checks this year was 100 million people. Budi said the program was intended to promote preventive care as Indonesians tended to check for illnesses only when they already had them. 'Our culture is checking when we're already sick ... that cuts closest to the grave,' he said. He said the program was the biggest the ministry had ever undertaken, surpassing COVID-19 vaccinations. Budi added the screening, which is to be rolled out at more than 20,000 health centers and clinics, also includes mental health tests to determine signs of depression or anxiety. Researchers at the University of Indonesia's Economic and Social Research Institute warned the program could risk burdening the country's already-strained local health centers, citing uneven distribution of drugs or doctors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-launches-183-million-free-health-screening-to-prevent-early-deaths/7969114.html	2025-02-10T00:08:10-08:00	
Chinese marriages slid by a fifth in 2024, fanning birthrate concerns	HONG KONG — Marriages in China dropped by a fifth last year, the biggest drop on record, despite manifold efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children to boost the country's declining population. More than 6.1 million couples registered for marriage last year, down from 7.68 million a year earlier, figures from the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed. Declining interest in getting married and starting a family has long been blamed on the high cost of childcare and education in China. On top of that, sputtering economic growth over the past few years has made it difficult for university graduates to find work and those that do have jobs feel insecure about their long-term prospects. But for Chinese authorities, boosting interest in marriage and baby-making is a pressing concern. China has the second-biggest population in the world at 1.4 billion but it is aging quickly. The birth rate fell for decades due to China's 1980-2015 one-child policy and rapid urbanization. And in the coming decade, roughly 300 million Chinese - the equivalent of almost the entire U.S. population - are expected to enter retirement. Measures taken last year by authorities to tackle the problem included urging China's colleges and universities to provide 'love education' to emphasize positive views on marriage, love, fertility and family. And in November, China's state council or cabinet, told local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis and spread respect for childbearing and marriages 'at the right age.' Last year saw a slight rise in births after a lull due to the pandemic and because 2024 was the Chinese zodiac year of the dragon - with children born that year considered likely to be ambitious and have great fortune. But even with the increase in births, the country's population fell for a third consecutive year. The data also showed that more than 2.6 million couples filed for divorce last year, up 1.1% from 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-marriages-slid-by-a-fifth-in-2024-fanning-birthrate-concerns/7969113.html	2025-02-10T00:05:37-08:00	
UK Anglicans meet after Church of England hit by scandals	LONDON — The Church of England's elected governing body will gather Monday at a time of 'unprecedented crisis' following a number of sexual abuse scandals. The meeting of the General Synod will see members debate the Makin Review, a damning report which set out a series of failings around a Christian camp leader and serial abuser, John Smyth. On Tuesday, a debate on a new way to handle safeguarding will also be held. The meeting comes a month after the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby stepped down as head of the world's Anglicans over failures in the Church of England's handling of the Smyth case. 'There's never been anything like this in our lifetime, because the Church is in an unprecedented crisis,' Synod member Ian Paul told the domestic PA news agency. Paul said 'the crisis we're facing now is a result of gradual erosion over years of trust and confidence and lack of openness, lack of transparency. 'And suddenly the rafters, the rotten rafters, break, the roof collapses.' Paul was one of the people behind a petition last year calling on Welby to resign. Welby announced his resignation in November after an independent probe found that he 'could and should' have formally reported decades of abuse by Church-linked lawyer Smyth to authorities in 2013. 'Prolific' abuser' Smyth, who organized evangelical summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, was responsible for 'prolific, brutal and horrific' abuse of up to 130 boys and young men, according to the independent Makin Review. It concluded the Church of England -- the mother church of Anglicanism -- covered up the 'traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks,' which occurred in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over several decades. Stephen Cottrell, who became Archbishop of York in 2020, has temporarily replaced Welby while also tainted by scandal himself. In December, the 66-year-old faced calls to stand down over claims he mishandled a sexual abuse case during his time as the Bishop of Chelmsford, in southeastern England. Priest David Tudor remained in his post despite Cottrell knowing that the Church had banned him from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse claimant, the BBC reported. Cottrell has said he is 'deeply sorry that we were not able to take action earlier' but defended his actions. In a fresh blow last month, the Bishop of Liverpool, John Perumbalath, said he was stepping down after a broadcaster aired allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. Perumbalath denied wrongdoing but said in a statement a 'rush to judgment and my trial by media... has made my position untenable'. He said a church safeguarding team had investigated the allegations and had found them 'unsubstantiated' and the first allegation was investigated by the police who decided to take no further action. Ahead of the synod meeting, Andrew Graystone, an advocate for abuse survivors, called on church leaders at the four-day meeting in London to show 'radical humility.' 'No one wants another hand-wringing apology; no one wants another 'lessons learned' review; no one wants another reminder of how hard it is to be a bishop. 'We don’t want any more words at all. Instead, we want radical humility from the Archbishop (Cottrell) downwards.' The Anglican Church is the established state church in England and dates back to King Henry VIII's split from the Roman Catholic Church in the 1530s. King Charles III, its supreme governor, appoints archbishops on the advice of the prime minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-anglicans-meet-after-church-of-england-hit-by-scandals/7969111.html	2025-02-10T00:02:08-08:00	
Ecuador's conservative incumbent and a leftist lawyer advance to presidential runoff	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador will choose its next president in a runoff election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes Sunday to beat 14 other candidates. The contest, set for April 13, will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency. Noboa and González are now vying for a full four-year term, promising voters to reduce the widespread criminal activity that upended their lives four years ago. The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years could turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserved more time in office. Noboa, an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, and González, the protégée of Ecuador's most influential president this century, were the clear front-runners ahead of the election. Figures released by Ecuador's National Electoral Council showed that with 80% of ballots tallied, Noboa received more than 3.71 million votes, or 44.43%, while González earned over 3.69 million votes, or 44.17%. The 14 other candidates in the race were far behind them. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. Electoral authorities reported that more than 83% of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Crime, gangs and extortion Under Noboa's watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. Still, it remained far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019, and other crimes, such as kidnapping and extortion, have skyrocketed, making people fearful of leaving their homes. 'For me, this president is disastrous,' said Marta Barres, 35, who went to the voting center with her three teenage children. 'Can he change things in four more years? No. He hasn't done anything.' Barres, who must pay $25 a month to a local gang to avoid harassment or worse, said she supported González because she believes she can reduce crime across the board and improve the economy. Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election that was triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of former President Rafael Correa, had only served short stints as lawmakers before launching their presidential campaigns that year. To win outright Sunday, a candidate needed 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest challenger. More than 100,000 police officers and members of the military were deployed across the country to safeguard the election, including at voting centers. At least 50 officers accompanied Noboa, his wife and their 2-year-old son to a voting center where the president cast his ballot in the small Pacific coast community of Olón. Testing the limits of laws and norms of governing Noboa, 37, opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father's Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. As president over the past 15 months, some of his mano dura, or heavy-handed, tactics to reduce crime have come under scrutiny inside and outside the country for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. His questioned tactics include the state of internal armed conflict he declared in January 2024 in order to mobilize the military in places where organized crime has taken hold, as well as last year's approval of a police raid on Mexico's embassy in the capital, Quito, to arrest former Vice President Jorge Glas, a convicted criminal and fugitive who had been living there for months. His head-on approach, however, is also earning him votes. 'Noboa is the only person hitting organized crime hard,' retiree German Rizzo, who voted to get the president reelected, said outside a polling station in Samborondón, an upper-class area with gated communities separated from the port city of Guayaquil by a river. 'Things are not going to change' González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal. González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa's party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election. Quito's University of the Americas professor Maria Cristina Bayas said Sunday's result was 'a triumph' for Correa's party because pre-election polls projected a wider difference between Noboa and González. Esteban Ron, dean of the Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences at the International University SEK in Quito, said Noboa will be forced to reengineer his campaign at the risk that he may have already reached his vote ceiling. Ron attributed the outcome to the problems Noboa faced during his administration. Waiting for her turn to vote in Guayaquil, architecture student Keila Torres said she had not yet decided who to vote for. None, she said, will be able to lower crime across Ecuador due to deep-rooted government corruption. 'If I could, I wouldn't be here,' said Torres, who witnessed three robberies in public buses over the past four years and barely escaped a carjacking in December. 'Things are not going to change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-conservative-incumbent-and-a-leftist-lawyer-advance-to-presidential-runoff/7969082.html	2025-02-09T22:00:24-08:00	
Chile issues evacuation alerts as wildfires rage in the country's south	SANTIAGO, Chile — Chilean authorities on Sunday issued two evacuation alerts for the southern region of La Araucanía as wildfires raged. At least one person has died. The country's government said the move aims to protect more than 860,000 people. Chile's government ordered the evacuation in regions of imminent risk, urging residents to leave their homes and seek refuge in safe areas. It did not provide figures on damage or number of people evacuated following a request from The Associated Press. Authorities confirmed the death of an 84-year-old woman who had been evacuated but eventually returned home. La Araucanía, south of capital Santiago, has faced a wave of forest fires that have spread rapidly due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought. Authorities issued a red alert in several parts of the region as firefighting teams fight against the flames. Chile's President Gabriel Boric, who ordered a curfew in affected regions on Saturday, said recently some fires are 'deliberate' and urged an investigation. Police arrested five people this weekend in connection with the case. Wildfires have recently devastated 33,406 hectares in Chile, 44% less than last year, authorities said. Much of those blazes are in La Araucanía. Temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this weekend boosted the wildfires in the region. Dozens of people were killed last year and over 1,000 homes were destroyed due to forest fires in the Valparaiso region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chile-issues-evacuation-alerts-as-wildfires-rage-in-the-country-s-south/7969076.html	2025-02-09T21:46:26-08:00	
Colombia government in crisis after president calls for Cabinet resignations	Bogota, Colombia — Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Sunday called for his ministers and other senior officials to step down, as tensions soared in the government days after he lambasted his team on live television. The demand came after Petro on Tuesday subjected his Cabinet to a five-hour public dressing down on state TV, accusing several officials, including his trade, education and health ministers, of falling behind on the delivery of key projects. 'I have requested the resignation of ministers and directors of administrative departments,' Petro posted on social media platform X. 'There will be some changes in the Cabinet to achieve greater compliance with the program ordered by the people.' Earlier Sunday, Colombia's environment minister Susana Muhamad became the second Cabinet member in a week to step down after the contentious meeting, in which Petro said the government had been underperforming. Several ministers have complained about the presence at the meeting of Armando Benedetti, one of Petro's closest aides, who is being investigated over illegal campaign financing during the president's 2022 election race and who has been accused by his ex-wife of domestic abuse. They also expressed disapproval of the appointment as foreign minister of Laura Sarabia, Petro's scandal-hit former chief of staff, who has had a meteoric rise within the government. She was implicated in an investigation into the largest corruption scandal in the government and was involved in a case of alleged illegal wiretapping against her nanny. The day after the Cabinet meeting, culture minister Juan David Correa resigned, as did Jorge Rojas, the head of the state agency DAPRE, which manages large amounts of state funds. Muhamad, who hosted last year's UN COP16 conference on biodiversity in the city of Cali and was generally viewed as a capable pair of hands in the erratic Petro's left-wing government, was one of the few to earn the president's praise during the meeting. Muhamad told the online channel Los Danieles that her decision to quit was 'difficult' and said it was motivated by Benedetti's involvement in the running of the state. During Tuesday's meeting she had complained 'as a feminist and a woman' against his presence. Muhamad has been one of the stars of Petro's administration at a time when he is seeking to claim a leading role in global climate diplomacy. She had been touted as a possible candidate to succeed the highly unpopular Petro, Colombia's first-ever leftist president, when his term ends in 2026. The political shake-up also comes just weeks after some ministers took office, including Sarabia, and the ministers for finance, information and transport.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-government-in-crisis-after-president-calls-for-cabinet-resignations/7969075.html	2025-02-09T21:44:26-08:00	
Court grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent to Guantanamo	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president's immigration crackdown. In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the detainees 'fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua gang.' It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that 'the mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction.' During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men. 'It's short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in the weeks to come,' Vosburgh told The Associated Press. A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President President Nicolás Maduro 's rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there, saying the base should not be used as a 'legal black hole.' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-grants-request-to-block-detained-venezuelan-immigrants-from-being-sent-to-guantanamo/7969074.html	2025-02-09T21:34:16-08:00	
Philadelphia defeats Kansas City in Super Bowl	The Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Kansas City Chief in this year’s Super Bowl, defeating the reigning champions by a score of 40-22. The Chiefs had been slightly favored to win the game, going into the American football showdown with hopes of winning their third consecutive National Football League title. But the Eagles held the Chiefs scoreless until late in the third quarter. By that time, the Philadelphia team already had 34 points on the board at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was named the game’s MVP. President Donald Trump attended the matchup, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. Before the game, the president issued a press release stating that 'football is America’s most popular sport—for good reason—it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities.' 'This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members, law enforcement officers, and first responders,' he noted. The Super Bowl was estimated to attract more than 120 million viewers, with 30-second advertisements costing a record $8 million. Before the kickoff, a ceremony honored those killed and wounded in a truck-ramming New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans on Bourbon Street, as well as first responders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philadelphia-defeats-kansas-city-in-super-bowl/7969042.html	2025-02-09T19:46:37-08:00

Anora' wins at Producers and Directors Guild Awards	Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner? Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy 'Anora' took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors. Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged 'Anora' as the front runner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners 'The Brutalist' and 'Emilia Perez,' 'Anora' reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday. Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times. The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees. The guild also named RaMell Ross' 'Nickel Boys' best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut. Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's 'Emilia Perez' is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy. Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's 'The Wild Robot' cleaned up with nine awards including best film. 'The Wild Robot' will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anora-wins-at-producers-and-directors-guild-awards/7968987.html	2025-02-09T16:17:58-08:00	
Super Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential missteps	Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a little break. As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise. Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers. Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars. Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire. 'That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,' Calkins said. 'Safe advertising isn’t the advertising you notice or remember.' And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year. Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads: Heartwarming nostalgia Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's 'When Harry Met Sally,' except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise. The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from 'Frozen,' Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes. Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said. Celebrity mashups Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats. Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns. Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said. Serious moments It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic. For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash's cover of 'Personal Jesus,' shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is. Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said. 'We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,' she said. 'People might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.' Artificial intelligence arrives Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's '50 States, 50 Stories' campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-bowl-commercials-rely-on-comedy-nostalgia-to-avoid-potential-missteps/7968981.html	2025-02-09T16:01:08-08:00	
Westminster show's canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend	New York — They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship. Sorry — no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports. Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years. 'I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl 'the Westminster of football,' ' quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers. The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all. And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster's green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.) Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago. 'We never thought we'd be here. And now we're here,' Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday. A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 300 champion-level canines. 'She's very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me,' handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically. A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable, handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York. Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble, who competed again this year. She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short. His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored. 'He's always exciting — he does ridiculous things,' Ondeyka said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs. 'We have fun, regardless what happens.' While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix, used to be 'afraid of the world' but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said. Saturday's competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog. They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes. Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again. Westminster's traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night. That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey. Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail. There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund. The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball. 'It's a lot of organized chaos,' Hillary Brown said after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix. 'It's a blast. The dogs love it,' Brown said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/westminster-show-s-canine-athletes-get-their-piece-of-super-bowl-weekend/7968742.html	2025-02-09T15:41:10-08:00	
Aga Khan, leader of Ismaili Muslims, laid to rest in Egypt during private burial	Aswan, Egypt — The Aga Khan IV was laid to rest on Sunday at a private ceremony in Aswan, Egypt. The death of Prince Karim -- the 49th hereditary imam of the Shiite Ismaili Muslims -- was announced Tuesday by the Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community. His son, 53-year-old Rahim Al-Hussaini, has been named as the Aga Khan V, the spiritual leader of the world's millions of Ismaili Muslims, according with his father's will. On Saturday, a private funeral service took place at the Ismaili community center in Lisbon attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Spain's King Emeritus Juan Carlos and Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The Aga Khan is considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and is treated as a head of state. The governor of Aswan welcomed Prince Karim's family at the southern Egyptian's provinces airport on Saturday. 'When his will was opened, it was found that he had requested to be buried in Aswan near his grandfather, Sultan Muhammad Shah, and his grandmother, Om Habiba,' said Maj. Gen. Ismail Kamal. Ismaili mourners marched as bells rang during the burial ceremony in the country's southern Aswan province, as Prince Karim's body was taken in a van. They carried his body, draped in a white shroud, and placed it on a yacht on the Nile River. Prince Karim, 88, was given the title of 'His Highness' by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, unexpectedly made him heir to the family's 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect. The late Aga Khan evolved over decades into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease. He was a defender of Islamic culture and values, but also widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West. The Aga Khan Development Network deals mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. It says it works in over 30 countries and has an annual budget of about $1 billion for nonprofit development activities. Ismailis lived for many generations in Iran, Syria and South Asia before also settling in east Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Europe, North America and Australia more recently. They consider it a duty to donate up to 12.5% of their income to the Aga Khan as steward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aga-khan-leader-of-ismaili-muslims-laid-to-rest-in-egypt-during-private-burial/7968738.html	2025-02-09T15:31:43-08:00	
German chancellor candidates clash on Trump, the far-right and NATO	Berlin — Europe is prepared to respond 'within an hour' if the United States levies tariffs against the European Union, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a pre-election debate with his conservative challenger Friedrich Merz. In the first duel ahead of the Feb. 23 election, Merz portrayed Scholz as a ditherer who had led Germany into economic crisis, while the Social Democrat presented himself as an experienced leader in command of the details. Asked if the EU was ready with a targeted response if the U.S. imposed tariffs, Scholz, well behind Merz in the polls, said, 'Yes ... We as the European Union can act within an hour.' U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to enact tariffs against the United States' largest trading partners, accusing them of free-riding on American prosperity. Trade policy is an EU competence, run by the European Commission in Brussels. Trump and the far-right Alternative for Germany, endorsed by his confidante Elon Musk, overshadowed the debate. Merz, far ahead in the polls and the favorite to become Germany's next chancellor, expressed reluctance to raise taxes or borrow to reach the NATO alliance's defense spending target of 2% of gross domestic product, far short of the 5% Trump is demanding. When Scholz said that would not be enough, Merz signaled his openness to discuss scrapping Germany's totemic spending cap — despite a manifesto pledge to keep the constitutional debt braked. The two clashed over the AfD, with Scholz warning that Merz could not be trusted not to govern with the party. Merz ruled that out, blaming what he called Scholz's 'left-wing' policies for fueling the far-right party's rise to second in the polls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-chancellor-candidates-clash-on-trump-the-far-right-and-nato/7968734.html	2025-02-09T15:20:31-08:00	
Trump to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately. Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum. Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs — raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed 'so that we're treated evenly with other countries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-announce-steel-aluminum-tariffs-in-latest-trade-escalation/7968731.html	2025-02-09T15:12:44-08:00	
49 migrant bodies found in 2 mass graves in southeastern Libya	Cairo — Libyan authorities have uncovered nearly 50 bodies from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, officials said Sunday, in the latest tragedy involving people seeking to reach Europe through the chaos-stricken North African country. The first mass grave with 19 bodies was found Friday in a farm in the southeastern city of Kufra, the security directorate said in a statement, adding that authorities took them for autopsy. Authorities posted images on its Facebook page showing police officers and medics digging in the sand and recovering dead bodies that were wrapped in blankets. The al-Abreen charity, which helps migrants in eastern and southern Libya, said that some were apparently shot and killed before being buried. A separate mass grave, with at least 30 bodies, was also found in Kufra after raiding a human trafficking center, according to Mohamed al-Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra. Survivors said nearly 70 people were buried in the grave, he added. Authorities were still searching the area. Later Sunday, authorities said they freed 76 migrants from the trafficking center and arrested three people — a Libyan and two foreigners — on suspicion of detaining and torturing migrants. Prosecutors ordered the suspects to remain in detention pending investigation. Migrants’ mass graves are not uncommon in Libya. Last year, authorities unearthed the bodies of at least 65 migrants in the Shuayrif region, 350 kilometers (220 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli. Libya is the dominant transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to make it to Europe. The country was plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Muammar Gadhafi in 2011. Oil-rich Libya has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of militias and foreign governments. Human traffickers have benefited from more than a decade of instability, smuggling migrants across the country’s borders with six nations, including Chad, Niger, Sudan Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia. Once at the coast, traffickers pack desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels for risky voyages on the perilous Central Mediterranean Sea route. Rights groups and U.N. agencies have for years documented systematic abuse of migrants in Libya including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers’ boats. Those who have been intercepted and returned to Libya — including women and children — are held in government-run detention centers where they also suffer from abuse, including torture, rape and extortion, according to rights groups and U.N. experts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-bodies-found-in-2-mass-graves-in-southeastern-libya/7968727.html	2025-02-09T15:02:00-08:00	
Chiefs chase Super Bowl 'three-peat' as Trump attends NFL showpiece	New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans headed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000 fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT). Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies. Trump's presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy police presence following a New Year's Day attack which left 14 people dead and many more injured on the Big Easy's famous Bourbon Street. Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice. Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his decision to attend this year's Super Bowl was for the good of the country. 'I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the President be at the game,' Trump told Fox. 'It's an iconic day. It's going to be a great game, two great teams, and let's see what happens,' Trump added, revealing that he was tipping Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win. 'When a quarterback wins as much as he's won, I have to go with Kansas City,' Trump said. 'I have to go with Kansas City.' Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its conclusion. Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump's attendance at the game. 'I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first President to make it,' Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP. Chiefs favorites As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who had a clean sweep at last Sunday's Grammys, winning in all five categories for which he received nominations. Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final game in the NFL. For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago which the Chiefs won by three points. They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented 'three-peat.' The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory in 2020. But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley. The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game. Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team's attitude to training over the whole week since arriving in Louisiana. 'I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to get done,' Reid said. The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the Superdome on Saturday for a team photo. Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were 'hungry' and 'ready to roll.' 'We're ready for the challenge against a really good team,' Sirianni said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chiefs-chase-super-bowl-three-peat-as-trump-attends-nfl-showpiece/7968725.html	2025-02-09T14:40:55-08:00	
Trump official orders consumer protection agency to stop work	Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The email also ordered the bureau to 'cease all supervision and examination activity.' Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. Yet Elon Musk commented, 'CFPB RIP' on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading 'page not found.' Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are 'excessive.' Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures. 'This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,' Vought said on X. The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts — and 'cheating' customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, 'that's why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans — Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.' The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation. During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented. The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said. Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive. Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations. 'Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families,' Warren said. Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign. Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-official-orders-consumer-protection-agency-to-stop-work/7968717.html	2025-02-09T13:51:53-08:00	
Trump official responds to critics of Gaza takeover plan, as ceasefire deal holds	U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz responded Sunday to critics of the Gaza takeover plan that U.S. President Donald Trump suggested last week.

White House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency	White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief foreign aid agency, contending that 'all too often' it was not aligned with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money. Waltz told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that the U.S. Agency for International Development programs, often food and humanitarian assistance across the world, 'are not in line with strategic U.S. interests like pushing back on China. They're doing all kinds of other things that frankly, aren't in line with strategic interests or the president's vision.' Moreover, he said, 'Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren't being used … wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and that's exactly what's being done.'.' Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or terminated. A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job. On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington. Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest. The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies. Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30 without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality. The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work, far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were hoping for. Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department, where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts. Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially necessary. 'Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon's acquisition process,' he said. Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said, 'I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000 to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough, enough with the bloat and the waste….' 'For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers will welcome' a spending review, he said.' On another matter, Waltz said 'sensitive conversations' are occurring on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine. 'We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through the details of how to end this war,' Waltz said. 'And that means getting both sides (to) the table.' Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine, possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods. 'Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,' Waltz said. 'President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-defends-efforts-to-shut-down-foreign-aid-agency/7968670.html	2025-02-09T11:51:57-08:00	
‘Dog Man’ bests ‘Heart Eyes,’ ‘Love Hurts’ at box office	New York — On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks Animation’s 'Dog Man' chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in theaters. The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey’s popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases — the Ke Huy Quan action movie 'Love Hurts' and the Valentine’s Day-themed slasher 'Heart Eyes'— were left nipping at the heels of 'Dog Man.' Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple’s much-derided 'Argylle' debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV. It wasn’t a banner weekend for 'Dog Man.' It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, 'Dog Man' has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks. Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group’s 'Heart Eyes,' released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a 'B-' CinemaScore. Spyglass made 'Heart Eyes' for $18 million. 'Love Hurts,' the action comedy from 87North Productions ('John Wick,' 'The Fall Guy'), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback in 'Everything All at Once,' Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving 'Love Hurts' a 'C+' CinemaScore. Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of the year with the release of Marvel’s 'Captain America: Brave New World' and Sony’s 'Paddington in Peru.' Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Dog Man,' $13.7 million. 2. 'Heart Eyes,' $8.5 million. 3. 'Love Hurts,' $5.8 million. 4. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $3.9 million. 5. 'Companion,' $3 million. 6. 'One of Them Days,' $3 million. 7. 'Becoming Led Zeppelin,' $2.6 million. 8. 'Flight Risk,' $2.6 million. 9. 'Sonic the Hedgehog,' $1.8 million. 10. 'Moana 3,' $1.5 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dog-man-bests-heart-eyes-love-hurts-at-box-office/7968655.html	2025-02-09T11:06:10-08:00	
Soaring egg prices in US pique interest in backyard chickens	NEW YORK — Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak. Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that commercial eggs sold for in December. 'Anyone who's done an ounce of research will very quickly understand that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping chickens,' said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home. 'You're going to pay more, particularly in your first several years, in your setup and in your birds. And there's a huge learning curve on how to care for animals that are really unusual pets,' said Mormino, who has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick. Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone. Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on the size and type. Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a backyard alternative. 'We've seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking steps toward sustainability,' said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San Antonio. 'We adopt out whole flocks. We're receiving at least a dozen inquiries per week,' he said. Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown. 'It's not always cost-effective,' she said. 'You have to really look at how many eggs you're eating and what the cost of those are versus what you would be spending.' There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other 'chickeneers,' as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips on how to get started. Tend to legal matters You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who wrote The Chicken Chick's Guide to Backyard Chickens, said the first thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that, don't assume your county, town or city will allow it. Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable. Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your area. Don't rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the subject. Don't assume that's a green light. Many codes are 'permissive use' regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code doesn't say you're permitted, you're not! If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds? Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on animal keeping. Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal. They weren't. She called the town clerk's office to ask whether a building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn't. It was. In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she's an attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing backyard chickens in her town. What about bird flu? Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl droppings. 'There's a limited number of things that we can do because our birds live where wildlife live,' Mormino said. 'People need to know if they have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested for bird flu.' Don't bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said. Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea; stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing. Don't feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam. Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of shoes or boots strictly for use around them. 'The biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That's the fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard,' Mormino said. Consider your costs Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville, Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat. She's had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at about $2,500. Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from her coop, meaning she's not mucking out her coop more than twice a year. 'But the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite expensive. I don't know if a lot of people know that,' Penny said. Her coop alone, which her family built themselves, cost about $2,000. It had to be outfitted to keep predators out, including rats that tunnel under the ground. Many people start with buying hatchlings, which just got more expensive to ship via the U.S. Postal Service due to new fees. Raising hatchlings requires a chick brooder involving a separate enclosure, heat lamp, feeders and other supplies. Penny buys a bag of feed every two weeks for $15 to $20 a bag. There's also the cost of calcium, such as oyster shells, and grit to aid digestion if chickens are not free-ranging or getting those elements in their feed. She estimates her monthly costs at about $60, saving a bit by also feeding her chickens healthy human leftovers. She's careful not to include foods that are toxic for chickens, including onions, potatoes and avocados. It's all worth it to Penny. 'We eat a lot of eggs,' she said. 'We probably go through a dozen every two days. We bake a lot. We're an ingredient household, so the majority of our food is cooked from scratch. Eggs are a main staple for our breakfast.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/soaring-egg-prices-in-us-pique-interest-in-backyard-chickens/7966140.html	2025-02-09T10:55:51-08:00	
Military: Sudan to form new government after regaining Khartoum	Dubai — The formation of a new Sudanese government is expected to happen after the recapture of Khartoum is completed, military sources told Reuters on Sunday, a day after army head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he would form a technocratic wartime government. The Sudanese army, long on the backfoot in its war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has in recent weeks regained ground in the capital Khartoum along several axes, closing in on the symbolic presidential palace along the Nile. The RSF, which has said it would support the formation of a rival civilian administration, has retreated, overpowered by the army's expanded air capacities and ground ranks swollen by allied militias. 'We can call it a caretaker government, a wartime government, it's a government that will help us complete what remains of our military objectives, which is freeing Sudan from these rebels,' Burhan told a meeting of army-aligned politicians in the army's stronghold of Port Sudan on Saturday. The RSF controls most of the west of the country — and is engaged in an intense campaign to cement its control of the Darfur region by seizing the city of al-Fashir. Burhan ruled out a Ramadan ceasefire unless the RSF stopped that campaign. The war erupted in April 2023 over disputes about the integration of the two forces after they worked together to oust civilians with whom they had shared power after the uprising that ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir. The conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises with the displacement of more than 12 million people and half the population facing hunger. Burhan said there would be changes to the country's interim constitution, which the military sources said would remove all references to partnership with civilians or the RSF, placing authority solely with the army which would appoint a technocratic prime minister who would then appoint a Cabinet. Burhan called on members of the civilian Taqadum coalition to renounce the RSF, saying they would be welcomed back if they did so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/military-sudan-to-form-new-government-after-regaining-khartoum-/7968633.html	2025-02-09T10:34:40-08:00	
Pope reminds armed forces to act for defense, respect international laws	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Sunday told soldiers, police and other law enforcement officials from around the world that armed force can only be used for legitimate defense and must always respect international law. The pontiff reappeared in public for the first time since he was diagnosed with bronchitis Thursday to celebrate an outdoor Jubilee Mass for the armed forces, police and security personnel. However, after a few words, he handed off his homily to an aide to read, saying he was having difficulty with his breath. 'I would like to recall the teaching of the Church in this regard: The Second Vatican Council says that those who exercise their profession in the ranks of the army in the service of their homeland should consider themselves as servants of the security and freedom of their people,' Francis said in his final prayer. 'This armed service must be exercised only for legitimate defense, never to impose dominion over other nations, and always observing international conventions regarding conflicts,' he added. The pontiff launched a new appeal for peace, citing conflicts around the world, including Ukraine, the Middle East, Myanmar and Sudan. 'Let the weapons be silenced everywhere and let the cry of the people asking for peace be heard,' Francis said. Since being diagnosed with bronchitis Thursday, the pope had continued his activities and audiences indoors at Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican residence where he lives, until Sunday. Francis has long battled health problems including long bouts of bronchitis. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin. Speculation about the pope's health is a constant in Vatican circles, especially after Pope Benedict XVI broke 600 years of tradition and resigned from the papacy in 2013. Francis has said that he has no plans to resign anytime soon, even if Benedict 'opened the door' to the possibility. In his autobiography 'Hope' released this month, Francis said that he hadn’t considered resigning even when he had major intestinal surgery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-reminds-armed-forces-to-act-for-defense-respect-international-laws-/7968594.html	2025-02-09T09:11:25-08:00	
Israel withdraws from corridor splitting Gaza as tenuous ceasefire holds	A new benchmark was reached Sunday in the tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza, with Israeli troops withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by 15 months of fighting. Cars heaped with belongings, including water tanks and suitcases, were seen heading north through a road that crosses the six-kilometer Netzarim. Under the truce, Israel was required to allow the cars to cross through uninspected, and there did not appear to be troops in the vicinity of the road. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu's illusion of achieving total victory.' Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire that extends into early March. But almost no progress has been made in negotiating an extension of the truce, which is supposed to lead to the release of more hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel. Netanyahu was sending a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in talks between the sides, but the mission included low-level officials. The Israeli leader is also expected to convene a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this week to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire, the extension of which is not guaranteed. Separately on Sunday, the Palestinian health ministry said that two women in their 20s, including one who was eight months’ pregnant, were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops have been carrying out a broad operation against militants. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The ceasefire pact was thrown into further turmoil this past week when U.S. President Donald Trump, standing by Netanyahu at a White House news conference, called for U.S. ownership of Gaza at the end of the war and later declared that Israel would hand over the territory along the Mediterranean Sea. Hamas, Arab nations and U.S. allies and adversaries alike condemned the proposal although Netanyahu applauded it as a potential game-changing breakthrough leading to Middle East peace. But Netanyahu is under heavy pressure from his far-right political allies to resume the war after the first phase so that Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack on Israelis in their history, can be defeated. He is also facing pressure from Israelis who are eager to see more hostages return home and want the truce to continue, especially after the gaunt appearances of the three male captives freed Saturday stunned the nation. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, freed three more Israeli hostages Saturday and Israel responded with the release of 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange of hostages for prisoners. It was the fifth exchange since the ceasefire took effect last month. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-withdraws-from-corridor-splitting-gaza-as-tenuous-ceasefire-holds/7968576.html	2025-02-09T08:46:40-08:00	
Rescuers recover 1 body and search for 28 people in a landslide in southwest China	Beijing — Emergency teams in China's southwestern Sichuan province raced against time Sunday to locate 28 people after a landslide triggered by rains killed one person and buried homes. Nearly 1,000 personnel were deployed following the landslide in the village of Jinping in Junlian county on Saturday. Some officers navigated through the remains of collapsed buildings, using drones and life-detection radars to locate any signs of life with the help of locals who were familiar with the area, state broadcaster CCTV said. Two injured people were rescued and about 360 others evacuated after 10 houses and a manufacturing building were buried, CCTV reported. At a news conference Sunday, authorities said preliminary assessments attributed the disaster to heavy rainfall and local geological conditions. They said these factors transformed a landslide into a debris flow about 1.2 kilometers (more than half a mile) long, with a total volume exceeding 100,000 cubic meters (3.5 million cubic feet). The rescue operation was hampered by continuous rainfall and more landslides. According to preliminary estimates, the collapsed area was about 16 football pitches in size and many houses were carried far by the debris flow. Chinese Vice Premier Liu Guozhong was at the site to guide the operation and visited the affected residents, according to official news agency Xinhua. Liu also noted the surrounding slopes still pose collapse risks, calling for scientific assessment to ensure the safety of the operation and prevent another disaster, Xinhua said. China has allocated about $11 million to support disaster relief and recovery efforts. Landslides, often caused by rain or unsafe construction work, are not uncommon in China. Last year, a landslide in a remote, mountainous part of China's southwestern province of Yunnan killed dozens of people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-recover-1-body-and-search-for-28-people-in-a-landslide-in-southwest-china/7968534.html	2025-02-09T07:52:12-08:00	
31 suspected Maoist rebels, 2 police officers killed in forest combat in central India	PATNA, India — At least 31 suspected Maoist rebels and two police officials were killed on Sunday in the deadliest combat so far this year in central India, police said. Hundreds of police and paramilitary soldiers launched an operation in the forests of the Indravati area of Chhattisgarh state based on intelligence that large number of rebels had gathered there, said state police Inspector General Pattilingam Sundarraj. Sundarraj said as the troops conducted a search operation fighting erupted in the forest, killing at least 31 insurgents and two police officials. Two other police were injured . He said search operations were continuing in the area and the troops had recovered some arms and ammunition, including automatic rifles. There was no immediate statement from the rebels. Sunday's fighting is the biggest so far this year and the second major clash in less than a month in Chhattisgarh, according to police officer Jitendra Yadav. At least 16 rebels were killed in the state's Gariband district on Jan. 23. According to Indian officials, the government had issued a bounty for 12 of them totaling about $345,000. Eight rebels were killed in a gunbattle with troops in the Bijapur district on Jan. 31. Indian soldiers have been battling the Maoist rebels across several central and northern states since 1967, when the militants, also known as Naxalites, began fighting to demand more jobs, land and wealth from natural resources for the country's poor indigenous communities. The insurgents are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. Years of neglect have isolated many locals, who face a lack of jobs, schools and health care clinics, making them open to overtures by the rebels. The rebels speak the same tribal languages as many villagers and have promised to fight for a better future especially in Chhattisgarh, one of India's poorest states despite its vast mineral riches. The rebels have ambushed police, destroyed government offices and abducted officials. They've also blown up train tracks, attacked prisons to free their comrades and stolen weapons from police and paramilitary warehouses to arm themselves.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspected-maoist-rebels-and-2-police-officers-killed-in-forest-combat-in-central-india-/7968437.html	2025-02-09T05:20:37-08:00	
Polls open in Ecuador with conservative incumbent and leftist lawyer leading presidential race	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador's presidential election Sunday is shaping up to be a repeat of the 2023 race, when voters chose a conservative young millionaire over the leftist protégé of the country's most influential president this century. President Daniel Noboa and Luis González are the clear front-runners among the pool of 16 candidates. All promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that pushed their lives into an unnerving new normal four years ago. The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses will be a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. More than 13.7 million people are eligible to vote. On Thursday, thousands of inmates who await sentencing cast ballots at voting centers set up in more than 40 prisons. To win outright, a candidate needs 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest opponent. If needed, a runoff election would take place on April 13. Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of former President Rafael Correa, had only served short stints as lawmakers before launching their 2023 presidential campaigns. Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. He opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father's Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. Under his presidency, the homicide rate dropped from 8,237, or 46.18 per 100,000 people, in 2023 to 6,964, or 38.76 per 100,000 people, last year. Still, it remained far higher than the 1,188 homicides, or 6.85 per 100,000 people, in 2019. González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal. González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa's party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-open-in-ecuador-with-conservative-incumbent-and-leftist-lawyer-leading-presidential-race-/7968425.html	2025-02-09T05:10:41-08:00	
Baltic states switch to European power grid, ending Russia ties	VILNIUS — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Sunday they had successfully synchronized their electricity systems to the European continental power grid, one day after severing decades-old energy ties to Russia and Belarus. Planned for many years, the complex switch away from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord is designed to integrate the three Baltic nations more closely with the European Union and to boost the region's energy security. 'We did it!,' Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said in a post on social media X. After disconnecting on Saturday from the IPS/UPS network, established by the Soviet Union in the 1950s and now run by Russia, the Baltic nations cut cross-border high-voltage transmission lines in eastern Latvia, some 100 meters from the Russian border, handing out pieces of chopped wire to enthusiastic bystanders as keepsakes. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, herself an Estonian, earlier this week called the switch 'a victory for freedom and European unity.' The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipeline outages between the Baltics and Sweden or Finland. All were believed to have been caused by ships dragging anchors along the seabed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement. Poland and the Baltics deployed navy assets, elite police units and helicopters after an undersea power link from Finland to Estonia was damaged in December, while Lithuania's military began drills to protect the overland connection to Poland. Analysts say more damage to links could push power prices in the Baltics to levels not seen since the invasion of Ukraine, when energy prices soared. The IPS/UPS grid was the final remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the Soviet Union, and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004. The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped purchases of power from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilize networks to avoid outages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-states-switch-to-european-power-grid-ending-russia-ties-/7968415.html	2025-02-09T04:53:54-08:00	
High home prices and mortgage rates put American dream out of reach for many	The Petersen family's two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small. Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, said her mother, Jenn Petersen. The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area. According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing — including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment — to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent. Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens — they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. 'I'm not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house,' Petersen said. The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash. 'The American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn't exist anymore,' Petersen said. 'The whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I've done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn't fit financially.' Supply lags demand First-time homeowners are getting older. The same is true for an increasing number of American families. In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018. The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option. 'Wage growth hasn't kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates,' said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. 'Even though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.' That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the United States. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were 'very' concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election. Is the dream going to fade? Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that 'there are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they'd rather own a home than rent.' McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too — it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in. McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease — all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the 'apex of the American dream.' 'The big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade,' McCabe said. 'It's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?' It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family 'house poor.' 'I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach,' she said. 'At some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?' Petersen said she'll 'always hold out a little bit of hope' that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget? 'I'd take that,' she said. Cities offer support Some cities are providing crucial aid to first-time homebuyers Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach. 'The prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher,' said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations. Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place. Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing — funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage. Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself — Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes. But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working — doing jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics. 'I was determined to have my piece of the pie,' she said. 'I felt I deserved that. I've always worked. Always. Nonstop.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-home-prices-and-mortgage-rates-put-american-dream-out-of-reach-for-many/7966141.html	2025-02-09T04:08:23-08:00	
Dalai Lama's elder brother, who led several rounds of talks with China, dies at 97	NEW DELHI — The elder brother of the Dalai Lama and former chairman of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, Gyalo Thondup, who led several rounds of talks with China and worked with foreign governments for the Tibetan cause, has died. He was 97. Thondup died at his home in Kalimpong, a hill town in the Himalayan foothills of eastern West Bengal state, on Saturday evening, media reports said. No other details were immediately released about his death. Tibetan media outlets credited Thondup for networking with foreign governments and praised his role in facilitating U.S. support for the Tibetan struggle. The Dalai Lama led a prayer session for Thondup at a monastery in Bylakuppe town in India's southern state of Karnataka on Sunday where the spiritual leader is currently staying for the winter months. He prayed for Thondup's 'swift rebirth,' in accordance with Buddhist traditions, and said 'his efforts towards the Tibetan struggle were immense and we are grateful for his contribution.' Thondup, one of six siblings of the Tibetan spiritual leader and the only brother not groomed for a religious life, made India his home in 1952 and helped develop early contacts with the Indian and U.S. governments to seek support for Tibet. In 1957, Thondup helped recruit Tibetan fighters who were sent to U.S. training camps in subsequent years, a report by the U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia said. According to RFA, Thondup was primarily responsible for liaising with the Indian government, including with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, when the Dalai Lama escaped to India in 1959. He also played a key role in establishing Tibetan leaders' relations with U.S. officials. Thondup began discussions between Tibetans and Chinese leaders in 1979, in a departure from his earlier approach, which sought an armed struggle against Chinese control of Tibet. The meeting laid a basis for a series of formal negotiations between the Dalai Lama's official envoys and the Chinese leadership that continued until they were halted in 2010. In an interview with RFA broadcast in 2003, Thondup said neither India nor the U.S. would be able to solve the Tibetan issue, and that progress could only come through face-to-face talks with Beijing. Thondup served as chairman of the Tibetan government-in-exile based in India's northern hillside town of Dharamshala from 1991 to 1993.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dalai-lama-s-elder-brother-who-led-several-rounds-of-talks-with-china-dies-at-97-/7968396.html	2025-02-09T04:07:10-08:00	
Kosovo votes for new parliament as foreign aid dwindles and talks with Serbia are stalled	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — Kosovars cast their votes Sunday in a parliamentary election considered a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti as talks on normalizing ties with rival Serbia remain stalled and foreign funding for one of Europe's poorest countries in question. Kurti's left-wing Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination Movement Party, is seen as the front-runner but is not expected to win the necessary majority to govern alone, leaving open the possibility the other two contenders join ranks if he fails to form a Cabinet. The other challengers are the Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are detained at an international criminal tribunal at The Hague accused of war crimes, and the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country that lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The parties made big-ticket pledges to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty. However, they did not explain where the money would come from, nor how they would attract more foreign investment. Ties with Serbia remain a concern Kurti has been at odds with Western powers after his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency and dinar transfers from Serbia to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority that depends on Belgrade's social services and payments. The U.S., the European Union and the NATO-led stabilization force KFOR have urged the government in Pristina to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict. This is the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo's parliament has completed a full four-year mandate. It is the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-99 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence. The vote will determine who will lead the Kosovo in negotiations with Serbia, which stalled again last year. Some aid funds are suspended The EU has suspended funding for some projects and set conditions for their gradual resumption, linked to Kosovo taking steps to de-escalate tensions in the north, where most of the Serb minority lives. Kosovo is also suffering after Washington imposed a 90-day freeze on funding for different projects through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been key in promoting the country's growth. Some 2 million eligible voters will elect 120 lawmakers from 1,280 candidates from 27 political groupings. One independent candidate is also running. The Kosovar parliament has 20 seats reserved for minorities regardless of election results, 10 of which are for the Serb minority. 'I encourage all the citizens of Kosovo to use this opportunity to decide on the next four years,' Kurti said after casting his ballot. There have been sporadic violent incidents. Prosecutors said they detained five people for trying to influence voters. Kosovars abroad started voting on Saturday at 43 diplomatic missions. There are some 20,000 voters from the diaspora of nearly 100,000 casting ballots at the missions, and the rest by mail. Although crucial for the region's stability, negotiations with Serbia have not figured high on any party's agenda. 'What can we do? We were born here. Our graves are here. It will be better, I hope. We have to come out and vote. That is our duty,' Mileva Kovacevic, a Serb resident in northern Mitrovica, said. Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than 6,000 euros per person. KFOR has increased its presence in Kosovo after last year's tensions with Serbia as well as for the election. A team of 100 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations will monitor the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-votes-for-new-parliament-as-foreign-aid-dwindles-and-talks-with-serbia-are-stalled/7968375.html	2025-02-09T02:54:03-08:00	
China to roll back clean power subsidies after boom	BEIJING — China's top economic planning agency said on Sunday it was taking steps to scale back subsidies for renewable energy projects after a boom in solar and wind power installations. China broke its own records for new solar installations in 2024 with installed capacity up 45% from the previous year. China now has almost 887 GW of installed solar power, more than six times the capacity of the United States, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency. The surge in installations meant China hit its 2030 target six years ahead of schedule, underscoring the speed of its clean energy rollout at a time when President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate deal for a second time and pledged to make it easier to drill for oil and gas. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said together with China's energy administration it had issued 'market-oriented' changes to policies intended to encourage clean energy projects. The NDRC said China's clean energy capacity of all kinds had reached more than 40% of the economy's total energy generation capacity, in part because of the support of a system that guaranteed prices for renewable energy sold to the grid. 'The cost of new energy development has dropped significantly compared to earlier stages,' the NDRC said in a statement. The agency said any new projects completed after June this year would face payments for electricity based on 'market-based bidding.' The NDRC said it expected there would be no impact on the price for residential users and farming and that power prices would be 'basically the same' for industrial and commercial operations after the change took effect. The NDRC said it would work with local governments across China on the implementation of the plan. It did not provide details of the pricing formula it would introduce. Less generous subsidies for new solar farms could add pressure on China's solar industry, where overcapacity relative to global demand has sent prices for solar panels plunging and threatened to drive smaller producers into bankruptcy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-roll-back-clean-power-subsidies-after-boom/7968356.html	2025-02-09T01:15:06-08:00	
Sam Nujoma, Namibia's first president, dies at 95	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Sam Nujoma, the fiery freedom fighter who led Namibia to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990 and served as its first president for 15 years, and was known as the father of the nation, has died. He was 95. Nujoma's death was announced Sunday by current Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba. Mbumba said Nujoma died on Saturday night after being hospitalized in the capital, Windhoek. 'The foundations of the Republic of Namibia have been shaken,' Mbumba said in a statement. 'Over the past three weeks, the Founding President of the Republic of Namibia and Founding Father of the Namibian Nation was hospitalized for medical treatment and medical observation due to ill health.' 'Unfortunately, this time, the most gallant son of our land could not recover from his illness,' Mbumba added. Nujoma was revered in his homeland as a charismatic father figure who steered his country to democracy and stability after long colonial rule by Germany and a bitter war of independence from South Africa. He spent nearly 30 years in exile as the leader of its independence movement before returning to be elected his country's first democratic leader in 1990. Nujoma, with his trademark white beard, was the last of a generation of African leaders who brought their countries out of colonial or white minority rule that included South Africa's Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda and Mozambique's Samora Machel. Many Namibians credited Nujoma's leadership for the process of national healing and reconciliation after the deep divisions caused by the independence war and South Africa's policies of dividing the country into ethnically based regional governments, with separate education and health care for each race. Even his political opponents praised Nujoma — who was branded a Marxist and accused of ruthless suppression of dissent while in exile — for establishing a democratic Constitution and involving white businessmen and politicians in government after independence. Despite his pragmatism and nation-building at home, Nujoma often hit foreign headlines for his fierce anti-Western rhetoric. He claimed AIDS was a man-made biological weapon and also occasionally waged a verbal war on homosexuality, calling gays 'idiots' and branding homosexuality a 'foreign and corrupt ideology.' Nujoma built ties with North Korea, Cuba, Russia and China, some of which had supported Namibia's liberation movement by providing arms and training. But he balanced that with outreach to the West, and Nujoma was the first African leader to be hosted at the White House by former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993. Clinton called Nujoma 'the George Washington of his country' and 'a genuine hero of the world’s movement toward democracy.' Nujoma grew up in a rural, impoverished family, the eldest of 11 children. His early life revolved around looking after his parents' cattle and the cultivation of land. He attended a mission school before moving to Windhoek and working for South African Railways. He was arrested following a political protest in 1959 and fled the territory shortly after his release. In exile, he helped establish the South West African People’s Organization and was named its president in 1960. SWAPO has been Namibia's ruling party since 1990. When South Africa refused to heed a 1966 U.N. resolution ending its mandate over the former German colony of South West Africa, Nujoma launched SWAPO’s guerrilla campaign. 'We started the armed struggle with only two sub-machine guns and two pistols,' Nujoma once said. 'I got them from Algeria, plus some rounds of ammunition.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sam-nujoma-namibia-s-first-president-dies-at-95-/7968336.html	2025-02-08T22:36:26-08:00	
Economists raise concern over sustainability of Indonesian meal program	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Economists are raising concerns about the viability of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s program launched this year to combat child nutrition. According to an Indonesian Ministry of Health Nutritional Status Study report, 21.6% of children ages 3 and 4 experienced stunting caused by malnutrition in 2022. The first stage of the Free Nutritious Meal Program, extending through March, is intended to provide around 20 million Indonesian school children, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers meals to improve their health and prevent stunting. The effort was initially projected to cost $28 billion over five years. However, Coordinating Minister for Food Zulkifli Hasan said on Jan. 9 during a meeting on food security that the $4.4 billion budgeted for this year will run out in June and that $8.5 billion more will be requested to fund the program through December. China, Japan, the United States and India have expressed support for the program, although it is unclear how much money will be provided or what form that support will take. Japan and India have said their help will be in the form of training. Officials plan to implement the program in stages, eventually reaching 83 million people — more than a quarter of Indonesia’s 280 million population — by 2029, Muhammad Qodari, deputy chief of the presidential staff told reporters on Feb. 3. The program is part of a long-term strategy to develop the nation’s youth to achieve a 'Golden Indonesia' generation, referring to a plan to make Indonesia a sovereign, advanced and prosperous nation by its 2045 centennial. The program's cost could make Prabowo politically vulnerable, according to Dinna Prapto Raharja, a professor of international relations at Jakarta’s Bina Nusantara University and a senior policy adviser at Jakarta consulting firm Synergy Policies. 'In order to finance this program, Prabowo has taken steps to implement major cutbacks in his government budget with some ministries seeing 50% cuts,' Dinna said. 'Now he is forced to seek financial assistance from overseas sources.' she told VOA on Jan. 31. The Finance Ministry said the spending cuts would amount to $18.7 billion, 8% of this fiscal year’s approved spending. While other nations said they would support the program, officials from the National Nutrition Agency — which manages the program — said internal talks about the level of foreign aid, type of assistance and technical aspects of its implementation have not begun. Support from China, Japan, US and India In November, China committed to supporting free nutritious meals but did not pledge a specific amount. The Chinese Embassy in Jakarta did not respond to VOA requests for further information on the value and form of the assistance. It remains unclear whether China’s financial assistance will be in the form of a loan or grant. The United States is providing training to Indonesian dairy farmers to support the program, which has increased the demand for locally produced milk. Indonesia, so far, can provide milk only two to three times a week to school children, according to Deddy Fachrudin Kurniawan, CEO of Dairy Pro Indonesia and project leader of U.S. Dairy Export Council training. Deddy told VOA on Jan. 8 that Indonesia has had to import 84% of its milk in the past, and that demand will double because of the food program. In January, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Japan will support the meal program by helping the Indonesian government increase its ability to combat childhood malnutrition. Ishiba offered Japan’s support by training Indonesian cooks and sending Japanese chefs to assist. Prabowo added that Japan will also assist in improving the fishery and agriculture sectors, based on Japan’s experience. More recently, India reaffirmed support for the program through the sharing of knowledge of the government’s Food Corporation of India and other institutions with Indonesian officials. 'India shares its experiences in the fields of health and food security, including the [free] lunch scheme and public [service] distribution system to the Indonesia government,' Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on his YouTube channel on Jan. 25. Other support and reaction Other countries have said they support the program. France and Brazil expressed their support on the sidelines of the recent G20 Leaders Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Prabowo instructed his team to arrange a visit of an Indonesian delegation to Brazil to take notes from the South American country's similar program. France, which has a similar school feeding program, intends to share its expertise and help Indonesia modernize its agricultural sector. Teuku Rezasyah, an associate professor of international relations at Bandung’s Universitas Padjajaran, noted that India exported 20,000 metric tons of water buffalo meat to Indonesia last year while Brazil exported 100,000 metric tons of beef to Indonesia. British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Reynar showed similar interest during her meeting with Prabowo in London in November. However, it remains unclear what type of support the U.K will offer. Mohammad Faisal, executive director of the Center of Reform on Economics, told VOA in Jakarta on Jan. 31 that countries offering support will have their own interests in mind, as well. 'I believe there’s no free lunch,' Faisal said. 'The donations may be partly altruistic, but not entirely. Donor countries consider it as strengthening bilateral ties, but they may also expect to reap the benefits in the future, such as enjoying ease of investing in Indonesia through incentives and getting better penetration of export markets as a reward.' Rezasyah agreed. 'Donor countries are probably hoping Indonesia will import more products from their countries to support this multibillion-dollar supplemental food program,' he said. 'On the other hand, they see Indonesia becoming a middle power that could contribute to finding solutions to global affairs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/economists-raise-concern-over-sustainability-of-indonesian-meal-program/7966819.html	2025-02-08T20:14:15-08:00	
Released Thai hostages return to Bangkok after being held for over a year in Gaza	BANGKOK — Five Thai workers released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived in Bangkok on Sunday. Sarusak Rumnao, 32, Watchara Sriaoun, 33, Sathian Suwannakham, 35, Pongsak Thaenna, 36, and Bannawat Saethao, 27, were freed on Jan. 30 as part of an exchange arrangement. They were embraced by family members, some of whom cried, in the arrivals hall at Suvarnabhumi airport. Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sagniampongsa and Israeli Ambassador to Thailand Orna Sagiv were both at the airport to welcome home the freed hostages. 'We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don't know what else to say,' Pongsak told a news conference at the airport. Maris said the Thai government 'never gave up hope and here is the result today. The tears of joy are our encouragement.' He added that Bangkok would continue working to secure the release of the remaining Thai hostage. The group quickly left the news conference to return to their hometowns in Thailand's northern and northeastern regions. They were the second batch of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. All five men were assessed at a hospital outside Tel Aviv prior to their return. Four of them were joined by one relative each earlier this week. The trip was sponsored by the Israeli government, according to the Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv. Hamas militants kidnapped 31 Thai nationals during the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel, making them the largest group of foreigners held captive. Many of the Thai agricultural workers lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli kibbutzim and towns, and Hamas militants overran those places first. A total of 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including two Thai citizens who were killed during the attack and their bodies taken into Gaza, according to Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There was no immediate information available about Nattapong Pingsa, who is the last Thai hostage left in Gaza, nor the two Thai workers whose bodies were taken into Gaza. Maris, the Thai foreign minister, traveled to Israel to visit the five freed men shortly after their release. Maris met with his Israeli counterparts seeking support to secure the release of the remaining Thai hostage and retrieve the bodies of the two deceased Thais. Thai workers remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel. The countries implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago specifically easing the way for Thai agricultural workers. Many Palestinian workers had since returned, and before the Hamas attack about half of Israel's workforce was made up of foreign and Palestinian laborers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/released-thai-hostages-return-to-bangkok-after-being-held-for-over-a-year-in-gaza/7968321.html	2025-02-08T19:55:38-08:00	
North Korea slams US-South Korea-Japan partnership, vows to boost nuclear program	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said an elevated U.S. security partnership with South Korea and Japan poses a grave threat to his country and vowed to bolster his nuclear weapons program, state media reported Sunday. Kim has previously made similar warnings, but his latest statement implies again that the North Korean leader won't likely embrace U.S. President Donald Trump's overture to meet him and revive diplomacy anytime soon. In a speech on Saturday marking the 77th founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army, Kim said the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral security partnership was established under a U.S. plot to form a NATO-like regional military bloc. He said it is inviting military imbalance on the Korean Peninsula and 'raising a grave challenge to the security environment of our state,' according to the official Korean Central News Agency. 'Referring to a series of new plans for rapidly bolstering all deterrence including nuclear forces, he clarified once again the unshakable policy of more highly developing the nuclear forces,' KCNA said. Amid stalled diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea in recent years, Kim has focused on enlarging and modernizing his arsenal of nuclear weapons. In response, the United States and South Korea have expanded their bilateral military exercises and trilateral training involving Japan. North Korea has lashed out at those drills, calling them rehearsals to invade the country. Trump on Kim: 'I got along with him' Since his January 20 inauguration, Trump has said he would reach out to Kim again as he boasted of his high-stakes summit with him during his first term. During a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday, Trump said, 'We will have relations with North Korea, with Kim Jong Un. I got along with him very well, as you know. I think I stopped the war.' During a Fox News interview broadcast on January 23, Trump was asked if he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, 'I will, yeah.' Trump met Kim three times in 2018-19 to discuss how to end North Korea's nuclear program in what was the first-ever summitry between the leaders of the U.S. and North Korea. The high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed after Trump rejected Kim's offer to dismantle his main nuclear complex, a partial denuclearization step, in return for broad sanctions relief. North Korea hasn't directly responded to Trump's recent overture, as it continues weapons testing activities and hostile rhetoric against the U.S. Many experts say Kim is now preoccupied with his dispatch of troops to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine. They say Kim would eventually consider returning to diplomacy with Trump if he determines he would fail to maintain the current solid cooperation with Russia after the war ends. Kim reaffirms support for Russia In his Saturday speech, Kim reaffirmed that North Korea 'will invariably support and encourage the just cause of the Russian army and people to defend their sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.' Kim accused the U.S. of being behind 'the war machine which is stirring up the tragic situation of Ukraine.' In South Korea, some worry that Trump might abandon the international community's long-running goal of achieving a complete denuclearization of North Korea to produce a diplomatic achievement. But a joint statement issued by Trump and Ishiba after their summit stated the two leaders reaffirmed 'their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK,' the acronym of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement said the U.S. and Japan also affirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S.-South Korean trilateral partnership in responding to North Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-slams-us-south-korea-japan-partnership-vows-to-boost-nuclear-program-/7968313.html	2025-02-08T19:10:30-08:00	
Japan prime minister voices optimism over averting US tariffs	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism on Sunday that his country could avoid higher U.S. tariffs, saying President Donald Trump had recognized Japan's huge investment in the U.S. and the American jobs that it creates. At his first White House summit on Friday, Ishiba told public broadcaster NHK, he explained to Trump how many Japanese automakers were creating jobs in the United States. The two did not specifically discuss auto tariffs, Ishiba said, although he said he did not know whether Japan would be subject to the reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he plans to impose on imports. Tokyo has so far escaped the trade war Trump unleashed in his first weeks in office. He has announced tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, although he postponed the 25% duties on his North American neighbors to allow for talks. The escalating trade tensions since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20 threaten to rupture the global economy. Ishiba said he believes Trump 'recognized the fact Japan has been the world's largest investor in the United States for five straight years and is therefore different from other countries.' 'Japan is creating many U.S. jobs. I believe (Washington) won't go straight to the idea of higher tariffs,' he said. Ishiba voiced optimism that Japan and the U.S. can avoid a tit-for-tat tariff war, stressing that tariffs should be put in place in a way that 'benefits both sides.' 'Any action that exploits or excludes the other side won't last,' Ishiba said. 'The question is whether there is any problem between Japan and the United States that warrants imposing higher tariffs,' he added. Japan had the highest foreign direct investment in the United States in 2023 at $783.3 billion, followed by Canada and Germany, according to the most recent U.S. Commerce Department data. Trump pressed Ishiba to close Japan's $68.5 billion annual trade surplus with Washington but expressed optimism this could be done quickly, given a promise by Ishiba to bring Japanese investment in the U.S. to $1 trillion. On Sunday, Ishiba identified liquefied natural gas, steel, AI and autos as areas that Japanese companies could invest in. He also touched on Trump's promise to look at Nippon Steel investing in U.S. Steel as opposed to buying the storied American company, a planned purchase opposed by Trump and blocked by his predecessor, Joe Biden. 'Investment is being made to ensure that it remains an American company. It will continue to operate under American management, with American employees,' Ishiba said. 'The key point is how to ensure it remains an American company. From President Trump's perspective, this is of utmost importance.' On military spending, another area where Trump has pressed allies for increases, Ishiba said Japan would not increase its defense budget without first winning public backing. 'It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something the taxpayers can understand and support,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-prime-minister-voices-optimism-over-averting-us-tariffs/7968310.html	2025-02-08T18:38:36-08:00

Authorities in Somalia warn against financing terrorism	Somalia's government Saturday sent stern warnings to businesses and individuals that pay extortion money to al-Shabab, saying the full force of the law would be brought against traders and individuals who pay the al-Qaida ally. Presenting a unified front, Somalia's Minister of Internal Security Abdullahi Sheikh Ismail and Minister of Religious Affairs Mukhtar Ali Robow joined the government's attorney general and the deputy minister of information at a joint news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. They said, any business found to have paid or collaborated with al-Shabab in any way would 'face legal action,' including having their government-issued trading permits revoked. 'Do not let your wealth destroy your life because security forces are prepared to act against anyone attempting to collaborate with these groups,' said minister Ismail. He said in recent government actions — aimed at cutting off al-Shabab funding —security forces shut down financial accounts used by the militant group to receive funds. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud declared a 'total war' against the al-Qaida-linked militants shortly after being elected in May 2022. President Mohamud said at the time that part of the government strategy to weaken and defeat the militants was not only on the military front, but also to cut its finances. In January 2023, Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said his government had closed every known account connected with the militants. 'The government had successfully shut down 250 bank accounts belonging to the group and closed an additional 70 mobile money accounts of the militants,' Barre said at the time. The al-Qaida affiliated group has continued to fund itself for years through intimidation and by extorting businesses in Mogadishu and collecting taxes in areas under its control. Robow, a former al-Shabab fighter who defected before accepting the Cabinet ministry position, said there is no justification for paying al-Shabab. He said it is unacceptable for anyone to finance activities that harm the Somali people, especially in areas under government control, such as Bakara market. 'Those who attempt to justify their support for terrorism will find no refuge,' he warned. Deputy Minister of Information Abdirahman Yusuf al-Adala acknowledged that the government is tracing sources of money going to al-Shabab. 'The government possesses detailed information about individuals directly or indirectly funding groups like al-Shabab and ISIS. Make no mistake, no one will escape unpunished' if found to be involved in 'terrorist funding in any form,' al-Adala said, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group by an acronym. Ismail praised the government's multi-faceted approach to dismantle the terrorist organization. 'Our primary objective was to combat al-Shabab and defeat them across various fronts. Now, we can say we have beaten them in the financial warfare, media battles, ideological war and on the front lines,' Ismail said. Ismail added that the government is aware of individuals who still have secret dealings with al-Shabab. 'I warn ... our citizens to avoid any engagement with al-Shabab. If you are found in contact with al-Shabab, and you are seen facilitating funds, the government will take serious action against you,' he said. Prosecutors' meeting Saturday's government warning follows the conclusion of the 7th Prosecutors' Conference of Somalia in Mogadishu this week, which marked a significant step in the nation's fight against terrorism financing. According to a government statement, this year's conference focused on addressing the financial networks that support extremist groups, a critical challenge in ensuring national security and stability. A government statement at the conclusion of the conference said that participants engaged in in-depth discussions and research on strategies to strengthen the legal framework and enhance inter-agency cooperation aimed at eliminating the financial resources that fuel terrorist activities. 'Officials at the conference emphasized the importance of robust legal measures and collaborative efforts in dismantling the financial infrastructures of terrorist organizations,' the statement said. 'This conference is part of the government's broader efforts to secure Somalia's future by targeting the economic lifelines of terrorism and ensuring that the rule of law prevails.' the statement added. One of the keynote speakers of the conference was Regional Police Commander Moalim Mahdi, chief of the Banadir region that covers Mogadishu. He said taxes provided by traders to al-Shabab funded terrorist attacks that claimed innocent lives. 'The explosive attacks orchestrated by al-Shabab in the capital cost as much as $80,000 per operation, with Somali traders unknowingly funding the group's activities,' Mahdi said. Mahdi said that al-Shabab secures much of its operational funding through extortion from business owners in key commercial areas, including the Bakara Market, the biggest in Somalia. He said the group uses extorted taxes to finance the manufacturing and transport of explosive devices, which are often smuggled into Mogadishu from the Shabelle and Jubba regions. 'Moving these explosives into the city requires substantial financial support,' Mahdi said. 'Each operation involves payments ranging from $10,000 to $80,000, and the vehicles carrying the bombs pass through at least nine intermediaries before reaching their target.' Mahdi noted that many traders comply with the extortion demands out of fear of retaliation, but he warned that their payments are directly fueling attacks that harm innocent Somali civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-in-somalia-warn-against-financing-terrorism/7968302.html	2025-02-08T18:17:24-08:00	
Head of UN chemical weapons watchdog meets Syrian leader	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The head of the world's chemical weapons watchdog met Syria's new leader Saturday, in a first visit to Damascus since the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, who was repeatedly accused of using such weapons during Syria's 13-year civil war. More than a decade ago, Syria agreed to hand over its declared stockpile for destruction, but the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been concerned that the declaration was incomplete and that more weapons remained. With new authorities now in power, the OPCW visit has raised hope that Syria will be conclusively rid of such weapons after years of delays and obstructions to the body's work. 'This visit marks a reset. After 11 years of obstruction by the previous authorities, the Syrian caretaker authorities have a chance to turn the page,' OPCW chief Fernando Arias said. The Syrian presidency said interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani received a delegation from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons led by Arias. The presidency also shared pictures of Sharaa and Shaibani shaking hands with Arias. There has been widespread concern about the fate of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons since Assad's dramatic overthrow at the hands of Islamist-led rebels. The OPCW has also expressed concern that valuable evidence may have been destroyed in intense Israeli strikes on Syrian military sites in the wake of his fall. Israel has said its targets included chemical weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists. In 2013, Syria agreed to join the OPCW and disclose and hand over its toxic stockpile under Russian and U.S. pressure, and to avert the threat of airstrikes by Washington and its allies. This came after a suspected chemical attack on the Eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus that killed more than 1,000 people, according to U.S. intelligence, and was attributed to the Syrian government, which denied involvement and blamed rebels. Despite insisting the use of chemical weapons was a red line, then-U.S. President Barack Obama did not conduct strikes, instead he reached a deal with Russia on the dismantlement of Syria's chemical arsenal under U.N. supervision. Assad's government had long denied using chemical weapons. But in 2014, the OPCW set up what it called a 'fact-finding mission' to investigate chemical weapons use in Syria, subsequently issuing 21 reports covering 74 instances of alleged chemical weapons use. Investigators concluded that chemical weapons were used or likely used in 20 instances. In 14 of these cases, the chemical used was chlorine. Sarin was used in three cases and a mustard agent was employed in the remaining three. In 2021, OPCW members stripped Syria of voting rights after a probe blamed Damascus for poison gas attacks carried out after it had claimed the stockpile was eliminated. In November 2023, France issued international arrest warrants against Assad, his brother Maher and two generals on suspicion of complicity in the 2013 chemical attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/head-of-un-chemical-weapons-watchdog-meets-syrian-leader/7968301.html	2025-02-08T17:50:34-08:00	
Lasers aid river search for debris from plane-helicopter collision	Crews continuing to search for debris from the deadly collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter near Washington used a plane outfitted with lasers to scan the bottom of the Potomac River early Saturday, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Large pieces of the jetliner and helicopter along with the remains of all 67 victims were recovered this week, and crews will spend the coming days looking for smaller debris before finishing the work in about a week. A plane operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and equipped with laser scanning technology flew at low altitudes over the crash site. The lasers are used to penetrate the river's surface and map the riverbed. 'All major pieces' of the two aircraft have been found, and investigators will examine them for any markings that could reveal the angle of the collision, according to an NTSB statement released Saturday afternoon. The NTSB said information collected will be part of its ongoing investigation into the January 29 collision between the Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight over Washington. There were no survivors. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the collision on what he called an obsolete computer system used by U.S. air traffic controllers and vowed to replace it. NTSB officials told members of Congress that the helicopter's advanced surveillance technology, which transmits aircraft location and other data to air traffic control and other aircraft, was turned off, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Thursday. Investigators are also looking into the altitude of the plane and helicopter, including whether the helicopter was above its 61-meter flight ceiling. Investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of the Black Hawk to get more precise information. The crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lasers-aid-river-search-for-debris-from-plane-helicopter-collision-/7968296.html	2025-02-08T17:30:56-08:00	
Scandal-hit narco-musical 'Emilia Perez' wins Spanish film prize	GRANADA, SPAIN — Narco-musical Emilia Perez won best European film at Spain's equivalent of the Oscars on Saturday, after social media posts by the movie's star prompted a backlash in the middle of awards season. The mostly Spanish-language musical tells the story of a Mexican drug cartel boss who transitions to life as a woman and turns her back on crime. Before the scandal broke, the film earned 13 Oscar nods, picked up four Golden Globes in January and won multiple prizes at last year's Cannes Film Festival. But old social media posts by star Karla Sofia Gascon, in which she denigrates Islam, China and African American George Floyd, unleashed a scandal that has harmed her reputation and the film. Voting for the Goya awards closed on Jan. 24, days before the posts were uncovered. Spaniard Gascon, the first transgender woman nominated for an Oscar for best actress, has apologized for her posts and distanced herself from publicity for the film. She lives near Madrid but did not attend the Goya awards ceremony in Granada. The movie's French director Jacques Audiard has called the posts 'inexcusable' and 'absolutely hateful.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scandal-hit-narco-musical-emilia-perez-wins-spanish-film-prize/7968297.html	2025-02-08T17:30:28-08:00	
7.6 magnitude quake shakes Caribbean southwest of Cayman Islands, USGS says	MEXICO CITY — A magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook the Caribbean Sea southwest of Cayman Islands on Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Some Caribbean islands and Honduras urged people near the coastline to move inland or avoid beaches as a precaution in case of a tsunami. The quake struck at 6:23 p.m. local time in the middle of the sea and had a depth of 10 kilometers, the USGS said. Its epicenter was 209 kilometers south-southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands. The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said there is no tsunami alert for the U.S. mainland but issued a tsunami advisory for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Cayman Islands government issued a tsunami threat alert and said in its social media channels that its 'residents living near the coastline are encouraged to move inland.' Honduran authorities said there were no immediate reports of damage but urged its residents to stay away from beaches in the next few hours, local media said. The International Tsunami Information Center said 'hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within the next three hours along some coasts of' Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, Honduras, Bahamas, Haiti, Turks and Caicos, San Andres Providence, Belize, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Panama, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands and Saba.	https://www.voanews.com/a/magnitude-quake-shakes-caribbean-southwest-of-cayman-islands-usgs-says/7968294.html	2025-02-08T17:20:30-08:00	
Chile imposes curfews in wildfire impacted regions	SANTIAGO, CHILE — Chile's President Gabriel Boric on Saturday issued state of emergency decrees for two regions in the center and south of the country due to the threat of raging wildfires. He said the measures for Nuble and Maule, which are aimed at saving forests, fields, homes and human life, would include curfews to allow the authorities to tackle possible criminal acts. Speaking at a news conference at the presidential palace, Boric said he has 'reasons to believe that a large part of the fires that affect the AraucanIa area today (south of capital Santiago) are deliberate.' 'We are not going to tolerate the vile behavior of a person or organization that carries out these types of acts,' said Boric. Local authorities say there are about 15 active fire outbreaks in Chile currently, which have been aggravated by weather temperatures above 40 Celsius degrees. More than 60 arrests have been made recently in connection with forest fires in the AraucanIa area, according to local authorities. Dozens of people were killed last year and over 1,000 homes were destroyed due to forest fires in the Valparaiso region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chile-imposes-curfews-in-wildfire-impacted-regions/7968293.html	2025-02-08T17:11:24-08:00	
US judge temporarily blocks Musk's DOGE from accessing payment systems	A federal judge early Saturday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon Musk's government efficiency team and Trump administration political appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could be improperly disclosed. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan issued the order after a coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 19 U.S. states filed a lawsuit late Friday arguing Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has no legal power to access the U.S. Department of Treasury systems. Musk, on X, called the ruling 'absolutely insane!' and said without evidence that 'something super shady is going to protect scammers.' 'How on Earth are we supposed to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money without looking at how money is spent?' Musk said on his social media platform and called Engelmayer 'an activist posing as a judge.' The lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to further his political agenda. DOGE's access to the system also 'poses huge cybersecurity risks that put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in peril,' the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE's access. The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the states' claims were 'particularly strong' and warranted him acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing before another judge on Feb. 14. 'That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,' Engelmayer wrote. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE team's unfettered access to their data. 'We knew the Trump administration's choice to give this access to unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court agreed,' James said in a statement. 'Now, Americans can trust that Musk — the world's richest man — and his friends will not have free rein over their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds.' Engelmayer's order bars access from being granted to Treasury Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special government employees and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department. The judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or downloaded. The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the government. Musk's efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal workers en masse. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week that the department's payment system will not be touched by Musk and that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-musk-s-doge-from-accessing-payment-systems/7968292.html	2025-02-08T17:06:13-08:00	
Rescuers search for 30 people missing after landslide in China	BEIJING — Chinese rescuers searched for some 30 people after a landslide Saturday in southwestern Sichuan province buried 10 houses and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate. The Ministry of Emergency Management deployed hundreds of rescuers including firefighters following the landslide in a village in Junlian county. Two people were pulled out alive and about 200 others were relocated, state broadcaster CCTV said. A villager told Beijing News that rocks were frequently seen rolling down the mountain since the second half of 2024, in some cases making sounds similar to firecrackers. The villager said geologists had inspected the area late last year, the state-run newspaper reported. President Xi Jinping expressed his concern and urged authorities to make every effort to search for the missing people and minimize casualties, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Chinese Premier Li Qiang asked for an investigation and inspection of potential geological hazard risks in nearby areas. Li also said residents who were under threat should be evacuated to prevent another disaster, according to Xinhua. The National Development and Reform Commission has allocated $6.9 million from the central budget to support the emergency restoration of infrastructure and public service facilities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-search-for-30-people-missing-after-landslide-in-china/7968291.html	2025-02-08T17:01:05-08:00	
Spending bill talks bog down after Trump's efforts to slash government	WASHINGTON — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they must deal with some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year's spending bills. It's a task that by all accounts is not going well. The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills in Washington. But Trump's first weeks in office have escalated tensions between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional approval. A look at where the talks stand: Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January; aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But optimism has faded in recent days. 'Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they walked away from talks. But it'll have to resume,' House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, said Thursday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, gave a similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as though they are 'trying to set up some sort of government shutdown, which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they've been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So, I hope we can get back to it.' Representative Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as Thursday, so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. 'But we're not making the progress I would hope,' said Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma. Democrats dispute GOP leadership's characterization Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said 'that is false' in response to the assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. 'The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from the table,' DeLauro said. Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro 'has been trying to get Republicans to respond to her for weeks.' 'I'm hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at the table and reach a spending agreement in the best interest of the American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors,' Jeffries said. Tensions over topline spending levels Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, worked out with then-President Joe Biden, spending for defense and non-defense would increase by 1% for the current budget year, which began October 1. That would bring the tallies to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for non-defense. Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of inflation, at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. 'That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people,' Jeffries said. Republicans don't see it that way. Cole said Democrats should adjust to the reality of a Republican president in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. 'We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don't have those anymore,' Cole said. 'And in particular, the president doesn't feel bound by an agreement made by another president that didn't go down on his watch.' Cole said that 'there's only one signature that matters right now and it's not Joe Biden's anymore.' Democrats wary as Trump, Musk revamp federal government Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to Trump's first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to resign, entire agencies are dismantled, and Elon Musk's team from the Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive information of countless Americans. They are worried about how current government services are being affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending bill negotiations. 'The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in Congress,' said Washington Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 'It is up to our Republican colleagues to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real.' DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. 'You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And that's got to be it. Those assurances have to be made,' DeLauro said. Plan B If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure, then it's possible that they could also pass another temporary measure to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they try to work out their differences. Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions (CRs), generally fund government programs and agencies at current levels. 'I don't want a CR,' Cole said. 'But I certainly prefer a CR to a shutdown.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/spending-bill-talks-bog-down-after-trump-s-efforts-to-slash-government-/7968287.html	2025-02-08T16:48:08-08:00	
Thailand leader seeks more cooperation with China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Thailand's prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, vowed to deepen cooperation with China to tackle the cyber scam centers that have troubled both countries, and she signed more than a dozen agreements to elevate bilateral economic ties between the two nations at the conclusion of her visit to China on Saturday. Some analysts say the Thai prime minister's four-day visit shows that Thailand is managing its relationship with China 'quite well.' 'The trip signaled that Thailand is willing to cooperate proactively on a number of fronts that will benefit Thailand economically and enhance Thailand's ability to protect its security interests in neighboring Myanmar,' said Hunter Marston, a research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia. Ahead of her first official visit to China since taking power last August, Paetongtarn said she hoped to demonstrate Thailand's commitment to crack down on illegal cyber scam centers operating in areas near the Thai-Myanmar-Chinese border. On Tuesday, Thai authorities announced they would suspend electricity to some border areas close to Myanmar, as the government intensified efforts to target cyberscam operations. Additionally, the Thai leader was seeking Beijing's help to boost Chinese tourist confidence in traveling to Thailand. The abduction of Chinese television actor Wang Xing from the Southeast Asian country to a scam center in neighboring Myanmar has sparked widespread concern among Chinese tourists about the risks of traveling to Thailand. During a bilateral meeting with Paetongtarn in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised Thailand's 'efforts and effective measures' to combat online gambling and telecom fraud, and said both countries should 'strengthen law enforcement, security and judicial cooperation to safeguard the safety of people's lives and property.' Apart from promising to 'take resolute and effective measures' to combat cyber scam operations, the Thai prime minister also said she takes Chinese citizens' safety in her country 'seriously.' 'I personally looked into all the securities myself, I talked to the police, I talked to the military and everybody who is involved' ... 'to be able to take care of everybody that wants to come to Thailand,' Paetongtarn said during an interview this week with China's state-run China Daily. Experts say that while the willingness by China and Thailand to strengthen law enforcement cooperation could help push cyber scam centers farther away from the border region, it's unlikely to entirely root out illegal operations. The cyber scam operations 'will find some other place where they can slip to unless the Thais and the Chinese are willing to do significant cross-border operations into Myanmar,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. Paul Chambers, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Naresuan University in Thailand, told VOA that one potential risk of increasing law enforcement cooperation between Beijing and Bangkok is that there could be 'a much heightened and unaccountable Chinese police presence in Thailand.' And since the United States Agency for International Development used to be a 'major funder' of counter-human trafficking efforts in Thailand, Chong said the Trump administration's decision to freeze foreign aid could complicate Beijing and Bangkok's efforts to crack down on the cyber scam gangs. 'What the meeting between Xi and the Thai prime minister didn't talk about is who will provide the money to continue those programs,' he told VOA by phone. Deepening economic ties Apart from strengthening joint efforts to combat cyber scams, Thailand and China also are looking to deepen bilateral economic cooperation in areas like infrastructure, digital economy, and electric vehicles. One key project is the 609-kilometer-long high-speed railroad connecting Thailand with southern China through neighboring Laos, which Bangkok hopes to finish building by 2030. Chinese President Xi said he hoped both countries would 'promote the vision of interconnected development of China, Laos, and Thailand to achieve more fruitful outcomes as soon as possible'. Additionally, Thailand and China signed 14 agreements related to cooperation in artificial intelligence, green development, and fish product exports during Paetongtarn's meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Marston said, while China says the high-speed railway could help enhance their connectivity with regional countries, Thailand hopes to further develop key industries through deepened economic cooperation with Beijing. Bangkok hopes 'the relocation of Chinese manufacturing to Thailand could help them develop their own semiconductor and electric vehicle manufacturing capacity,' Marston told VOA by phone. Other analysts warn, however, that Thailand's enhanced cooperation with China over electric vehicles could adversely affect other countries' automobile manufacturing in Thailand. 'What may be good for China in the EV market may not necessarily be good for other countries, such as Japan, that have traditionally made automobiles and have supplied a lot of middle-class jobs in Thailand,' Mark Cogan, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Kansai Gaidai University in Japan, told VOA in a video interview via Zoom. As the United States threatens to impose tariffs against products from several countries, including longstanding allies like Canada, and vows to boycott global summits like the G20, Marston said China sees a window of opportunity to further relations with neighboring countries like Thailand. 'China will be making every effort to deepen relations with Southeast Asian countries and impress upon them the perception that the U.S. is not reliable,' he told VOA. Marston said while Thailand is trying to expand engagement with China, it also isn't distancing itself from the U.S., which has long been Bangkok's key security partner. 'Thailand is well positioned to continue its bamboo diplomacy, and we will likely see it maintain positive relations with both China and the U.S. in the years ahead,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-leader-seeks-more-cooperation-with-china/7968278.html	2025-02-08T16:22:44-08:00	
Dozens killed in bus accident in southern Mexico	MEXICO CITY — More than three dozen people have died in an accident involving a bus in southern Mexico, local media reported Saturday, as local authorities expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The bus was traveling between Cancun and Tabasco, according to reports. 'We are attentive to the federal and state authorities to help with whatever they request,' said Ovidio Peralta, the mayor of Comalcalco, a town in Tabasco. Some 44 passengers were traveling on the bus, according to a list shared by the bus operator, Tours Acosta. 'Tours Acosta is profoundly sorry about what happened,' the company said in a post on Facebook, adding that it was working with authorities to find out what happened and that the bus had been traveling within speed limits. Authorities will give an update with details on the number of victims and their identities later Saturday, said the secretary of government of Tabasco, Ramiro Lopez.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-killed-in-bus-accident-in-southern-mexico-/7968091.html	2025-02-08T14:59:08-08:00

US declares interest in developing African mining sector	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in developing the mining sector in Africa. On the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order focusing on minerals, mineral extraction, and mineral processing. 'Mainly in the United States but if you read closely there are also multiple references in that executive order to international partnerships and you know, cooperating with partner nations,' said Scott Woodard, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for energy transformation at the U.S. State Department. Woodard spoke at a recent African mining conference — also known as an indaba — in Cape Town, South Africa. Moderator Zainab Usman, director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, asked Woodard whether the U.S. understands that in addition to mineral extraction, Africans want projects that add value to the raw material in order to boost the continent's industrialization. Woodard replied that the Trump administration is still putting together its policies. In recent years, America's investment in the African minerals needed for cleaner energy has been driven by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. In 2022, the U.S. entered into agreements with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to establish a supply chain for electric vehicle batteries, underscoring its interest in both countries' copper, lithium and cobalt resources. The U.S. also has funded the rebuilding of the Lobito Rail Corridor, which will transport minerals from Congo, Zambia and Angola on the west coast. Speaking in the exhibition hall during the indaba, Zambia's minister of transport and logistics, Frank Tayali, thanked the U.S. for its leadership. 'We have something like a $350 billion gap in terms of infrastructure gap financing that the continent needs,' said Tayali. 'Now this focus on infrastructure development is really key in helping the African economies to be able to improve so that they are able to look after their people more effectively.' China, meanwhile, is invested in rehabilitating the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority — known as TAZARA — to bolster rail and sea transport in East Africa. And in South Africa, the conference's host country, transport and logistics problems at the state-owned Transnet railway system are being considered. 'The CEO of Transnet is very open about the state of the rail network,' said Allan Seccombe, head of communications at the Minerals Council of South Africa. ' ... it needs a lot of work.' How will they raise the money? 'They are going out on public tenders to try and get that investment in,' said Allan Seccombe, head of communications at the Minerals Council of South Africa. 'Also, significantly they're speaking to their customers who are by and large, large mining companies to maybe through tariffs they can invest in the rail network, improve it, then have private trains they can operate on the network.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-declares-interest-in-developing-african-mining-sector-/7968007.html	2025-02-08T13:49:54-08:00	
Trump administration sends third flight of detainees to Guantanamo	PENTAGON — The top U.S. homeland security official got a firsthand look at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, visiting the U.S. naval base in Cuba on Friday, posting video of what appears to be a third flight of 'high-threat illegal aliens' to arrive at the facility. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shared details of her visit on her official account on the X social media platform, promising, 'Vicious gang members will no longer have safe haven in our country.' Noem did not share details about how many detainees were offloaded from what appeared to be a military cargo jet or about the crimes with which they are charged or of which they are suspected of having committed. The Homeland Security Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have yet to respond to requests for details. U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at Guantanamo Bay, did not comment on the number of flights but told VOA Saturday that the detention facility is now housing 'over three dozen individuals.' SOUTHCOM also said it 'is prepared to support operations for holding illegal aliens as directed by the Department of Defense' and that any new arrivals 'will be treated safely and humanely in accordance with international humanitarian standards.' Immigrants' rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, on Friday sent DHS, the State Department and the Pentagon a letter demanding information and immediate access to the individuals sent to the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay. 'The Constitution, and federal and international law prohibit the government from using Guantánamo as a legal black hole,' the groups stated. 'We therefore request that the government provide our organizations access to the noncitizens detained at Guantánamo so that those individuals will have access to legal counsel, and so advocates and the public can understand the conditions under which the government is detaining them.' Noem, in another post on X late Friday, said she was at Guantanamo Bay 'checking out some of the operations we're standing up to house the worst of the worst and illegal criminals that are in the United States of America.' 'They won't be there for long,' she added, while also thanking U.S. President Donald Trump for his hard work to 'make America safe again.' Noem's visit to Guantanamo Bay came a day after the arrival of a second flight of 'high-threat illegal aliens,' whom she described on social media as 'murderers & vicious gang members.' In a separate post, earlier Friday, Noem said the detainees were all Venezuelan gang members. She said one detainee had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. A U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation, said Thursday's flight aboard a U.S. military cargo plane carried 13 'high threat' individuals. DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. The first 10 undocumented migrants arrived at the detention facility Tuesday, also on board a C-17. Officials have said all the migrants are being held in jail cells under the supervision of officers with ICE. Homeland security officials said the 10 migrants who arrived Tuesday were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. U.S. defense officials have called the detention of the high-threat migrants at Guantanamo Bay detention facility a temporary measure. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday emphasized the military's commitment under President Donald Trump to secure the U.S. southern border with Mexico. 'We've seen an invasion,' Hegseth told a town hall meeting with Pentagon employees. 'From people all around the world who I'm sure many of them want to seek a better life. I understand that.' 'But we also don't know who millions of them are, what their intentions are, why they're here,' he said. 'That creates a very real national security threat.' Since Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed hundreds of Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. That includes preparing the detention center, known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. It also includes setting up tents and other facilities to house non-violent migrants on another section of the base to prepare for as many as 30,000 migrants who will stay there until they can be deported to their countries of origin or to other countries willing to take them. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W. Bush administration in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Human rights groups have criticized the Trump administration's move to use Guantanamo as a holding center for migrants, some warning it would amount to a human rights catastrophe. At its height during the global war on terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility also was used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.

Hundreds protest in London against proposed 'mega embassy' for China	Hundreds of demonstrators protested Saturday at a site earmarked for Beijing's controversial new embassy in London over human rights and security concerns. The new embassy, if approved by the U.K. government, would be the 'biggest Chinese Embassy in Europe,' one lawmaker said earlier. Protester Iona Boswell, a 40-year-old social worker, told AFP said there was 'no need for a mega embassy here' and that she believed it would be used to facilitate the 'harassment of dissidents.' China has for several years been trying to relocate its embassy, currently in the British capital's upmarket Marylebone district, to the sprawling historic site in the shadow of the Tower of London. The move has sparked fierce opposition from nearby residents, rights groups, critics of China's ruling Communist Party and others. 'This is about the future of our freedom, not just the site of a Chinese Embassy in London,' Conservative Party lawmaker Tom Tugendhat told AFP at the protest, adding that people living in the U.K. have been threatened by Chinese state agents. 'I think it would be a threat to all of us because we would see an increase in economic espionage... and an increase in the silencing of opponents of the Chinese Communist Party (in the U.K.),' the former security minister added. Housing the Royal Mint, the official maker of British coins, for nearly two centuries, the site was earlier home to a 1348-built Cistercian abbey but is currently derelict. Beijing bought it for a reported $327 million in 2018. 'It will be like a headquarter (for China) to catch the (Hong Kong) people in the U.K. to (send them) back to China,' said another protester dressed in black and wearing a full face mask, giving his name only as 'Zero,' a member of 'Hongkongers in Leeds,' the northern English city. The protest comes as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, elected last July, wants more engagement with Beijing following years of deteriorating relations over various issues, in particular China's rights crackdown in Hong Kong. In November, Starmer became the first U.K. prime minister since 2018 to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, when the pair held talks at the G20 summit in Brazil. A national planning inspector will now hold a public inquiry into the project, but Communities Secretary Angela Rayner will make the final decision. Opponents fear the Labour government's emphasis on economic growth, and improved China ties, could trump other considerations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-protest-in-london-against-proposed-mega-embassy-for-china/7968055.html	2025-02-08T13:06:08-08:00	
Emboldened by Trump, Iranian dissidents demand overthrow of rulers	PARIS — Thousands of opponents to Iran's authorities rallied in Paris on Saturday, joined by Ukrainians to call for the fall of the government in Tehran, hopeful that U.S. President Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign could lead to change in the country. The protest, organized by the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, which is banned in Iran, comes as two of the group's members face imminent execution with a further six sentenced to death in November. 'We say your demise has arrived. With or without negotiations, with or without nuclear weapons, uprising and overthrow await you,' NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi said in a speech. People from across Europe, some bussed in for the event, waved Iranian flags and chanted anti-government slogans amid images deriding Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Hundreds of Ukrainians accusing Iran of backing Russian President Vladimir Putin in the war against Ukraine joined the protest. Iryna Serdiuk, 37, a nurse turned interpreter originally from Ukraine's embattled Donbas region and now exiled in Germany, said she had come to Paris to join forces against a common enemy. 'I'm happy to see these Iranians because they are opposition. They support Ukraine and not the Iranian government which gives Russia weapons. We are together and one day it will be victory for Ukraine and Iran too,' she said. The NCRI, also known by its Persian name Mujahideen-e-Khalq, was once listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union until 2012. While its critics question its support inside Iran and how it operates, it remains one of the few opposition groups able to rally supporters. Mohammad Sabetraftar, 63, an Iranian in exile for 40 years and who now runs a taxi business in the United Kingdom, dismissed criticism of the NCRI saying that it was the only alternative capable of achieving democracy in Iran. 'What we expect from Mr. Trump or any Western politician is to not support this government. We don't need money, we don't need weapons, we rely on the people. No ties with the regime, no connections and put as much pressure on this government.' Tehran has long called for a crackdown on the NCRI in Paris, Riyadh, and Washington. The group is regularly criticized in state media. In January, Trump's Ukraine envoy spoke at a conference organized by the group in Paris. At the time, he outlined the president's plan to return to a policy of maximum pressure on Iran that sought to wreck its economy, forcing the country to negotiate a deal on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and regional activities. Homa Sabetraftar, 16, a schoolgirl in Britain, said she felt it was her duty to come to the event to represent the youth of Iran. 'Some people in Iran don't have that voice and aren't able to vocalize as freely as we are able to here,' she said. 'We need to push for a better future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/emboldened-by-trump-iranian-dissidents-demand-overthrow-of-rulers-/7968042.html	2025-02-08T12:47:46-08:00	
Massive protest in Germany against far-right AfD ahead of election	MUNICH, GERMANY — More than 200,000 protesters rallied in Munich, Germany, on Saturday against far-right extremism ahead of the country's general election. The far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is in second place in recent polls and has prompted widespread protests across the country before voters cast their ballots on Feb. 23. The protest at Munich's Theresienwiese — where Oktoberfest takes place each year — brought a significantly larger crowd than expected, according to the German dpa news agency. The event's organizer estimated the crowd could be up to 320,000 people, many of whom carried signs against the AfD with slogans like, 'Racism and hatred is not an alternative.' The protest was supported by activist groups as well as the Munich Film Festival, churches and Munich soccer clubs FC Bayern and TSV 1860, among others. Police told dpa that the demonstration was peaceful. Similar protests attracted large crowds Saturday in Hanover, Rostock and elsewhere in Germany, mirroring other demonstrations that have occurred across the country in recent weeks. Last month at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, a huge crowd blew whistles, sang antifascist songs and carried banners denouncing AfD. Activists said they hoped the rally also would draw attention to other far-right parties in Europe and the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Demonstrators have recently also opposed Friedrich Merz, the center-right leader and front-runner in the upcoming election, and his Christian Democrats for last month sending to parliament proposals for tough new migration rules that received AfD's backing. The protesters say Merz and his party broke Germany’s unwritten post-Nazi promise by all democratic parties to never pass any rule or resolution in parliament with the support of far-right, nationalist parties like the AfD. Merz insists his position is unchanged and that he didn’t and won’t work with the party. The 12-year-old AfD entered the national parliament in 2017, benefiting from then-Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s decision two years earlier to allow large numbers of migrants into the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-protest-in-germany-against-far-right-afd-ahead-of-election/7968003.html	2025-02-08T11:09:11-08:00	
White South Africans reject Trump’s resettlement plan	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — Groups representing some of South Africa's white minority responded Saturday to a plan by President Donald Trump to offer them refugee status and resettlement in the United States by saying: thanks, but no thanks. The plan was detailed in an executive order Trump signed Friday that stopped all aid and financial assistance to South Africa as punishment for what the Trump administration said were 'rights violations' by the government against some of its white citizens. The Trump administration accused the South African government of allowing violent attacks on white Afrikaner farmers and introducing a land expropriation law that enables it to 'seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation.' The South African government has denied there are any concerted attacks on white farmers and has said that Trump's description of the new land law is full of misinformation and distortions. On Saturday, two of the most prominent groups representing Afrikaners said they would not be taking up Trump's offer of resettlement in the U.S. 'Our members work here, and want to stay here, and they are going to stay here,' said Dirk Hermann, chief executive of the Afrikaner trade union Solidarity, which says it represents about 2 million people. 'We are committed to build a future here. We are not going anywhere.' At the same news conference, Kallie Kriel, the CEO of the Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum, said: 'We have to state categorically: We don’t want to move elsewhere.' Trump's move to sanction South Africa, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, came after he and his South African-born adviser Elon Musk accused its Black leadership of having an anti-white stance. But the portrayal of Afrikaners as a downtrodden group that needed to be saved would surprise most South Africans. 'It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the U.S. for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged,' South Africa's Foreign Ministry said. There was 'a campaign of misinformation and propaganda' aimed at South Africa, the ministry said. Whites in South Africa still generally have a much better standard of living than Blacks more than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Despite being a small minority, whites still own about 70% of South Africa's private farmland. A study in 2021 by the South Africa Human Rights Commission said 1% of whites were living in poverty compared with 64% of Blacks. Trump's action against South Africa has given international attention to a sentiment among some white South Africans that they are being discriminated against as a form of payback for apartheid. The leaders of the apartheid government were Afrikaners. Solidarity, AfriForum and others are strongly opposed to the new land expropriation law, saying it will target land owned by whites who have worked to develop that land for years. They also say an equally contentious language law that's recently been passed seeks to remove or limit their Afrikaans language in schools, while they have often criticized South Africa's affirmative action policies in business that promote the interests of Blacks as racist laws. 'This government is allowing a certain section of the population to be targeted,' said AfriForum's Kriel, who thanked Trump for raising the case of Afrikaners. The South African government says the laws that have been criticized are aimed at the incredibly difficult task of redressing the wrongs of colonialism and then nearly a half-century of apartheid, when Blacks were stripped of their land and almost all their rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-south-africans-reject-trump-s-resettlement-plan/7967974.html	2025-02-08T10:23:06-08:00	
White House order halts Myanmar refugee resettlement deal with Thailand	BANGKOK — The head of a Thai parliamentary committee that oversees border affairs and refugee camp officials told VOA the suspension by the United States of refugee admissions has halted a resettlement deal the U.S. struck with Thailand last year to take in thousands of Myanmar families. About 90,000 refugees from Myanmar are in Thailand in a string of nine sealed-off camps along the countries’ shared border. Some have lived in the camps since the mid-1980s, fleeing decades of fighting between Myanmar’s military and ethnic-minority rebel groups vying for autonomy. Most are ethnic minority Karen. After more than a year of talks and planning, the United States agreed to start taking in some of the refugees last year, although the U.S. State Department would not say how many of them might resettle. However, Thai lawmaker Rangsiman Rome, and an aid worker previously told VOA that local United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees staff told them in 2023 that it could be up to 10,000 per year, a claim the U.N. would not confirm or deny. The first groups of 25 families left the camps for the United States in July. U.S. President Donald Trump said that during the previous four years — the term of former President Joe Biden — 'the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,' and he suspended the program by executive order Jan. 20, effective a week later. The administration is allowing only case-by-case exceptions, 'until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.' The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok declined to comment to VOA on the order’s impact on the resettlement deal the United States and Thailand struck last year. Asked about the deal’s fate, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA it was 'coordinating with implementing partners to suspend refugee arrivals to the United States' and refused further comment. Rangsiman, who chairs the Thai House of Representatives National Security, Border Affairs, National Strategy and National Reform Committee, which monitors the refugee camps, confirmed Friday that Trump's order has put a stop to the deal, at least for the time being. 'We are aware that the deal is on hold but still waiting for updates from related departments if this deal can be renegotiated,' he told VOA. Officials and spokespersons for the Thai government and ministries involved in managing the deal either refused to speak with VOA or did not reply to requests for comment. Camp administrators told VOA that all work vetting and preparing the refugees in the camps for resettlement to the U.S., including interviews and medical checks, has stopped since the White House order. 'After the 20th, after the announcement, everything stopped,' said Nido, who goes by one name, the vice chairman of the committee managing day-to-day operations at the Umpiem camp in Tak province. 'On the 27th, many people from the camp had to go for their second vaccination. The doctors and nurses were there already preparing to vaccinate. But when the people arrived, they said there were some changes, so they had to stop the vaccination process. They told the people they will have to stop this process for a while, but they could not say for how long,' he said. 'The interviews, the vaccinations — they had to stop it.' Bweh Say, secretary of the Karen Refugee Committee that oversees the individual camp committees, said he was told by UNHCR staff that resettlement work was on hold across all the camps. 'Some of their staff, when we sit together, we talk together … they said [it has] stopped,' he said. The UNHCR has been helping Thailand and the United States run the resettlement program, but it refused to comment to VOA on the impact of the suspension of the U.S. refugee admissions program, USRAP. Camp officials and refugee advocates say the deal between Thailand and the U.S. was the only foreseeable chance in the near term for thousands of families to have a future other than as permanent refugees. The Myanmar military’s overthrow of a democratically elected government in 2021 amplified violence in the country, setting off a civil war that has killed thousands of civilians. Thailand itself will not allow the refugees to settle outside the camps and mostly denies them the chance to work or study outside the camps legally. Aid and advocacy groups that work with the refugees have described rising despair, drug abuse and violence. No other country besides the United States has taken up Thailand’s call to resettle the refugees in large numbers. 'This [deal] is very important for the refugees. Some of us have been staying in the camps for decades — two or almost three. Children have been born here,' said Nido, a refugee himself who fled Myanmar nearly 20 years ago. 'The situation in Myanmar now is very terrible,' he said. 'A lot of conflict and fighting. It’s not possible to go back. It’s also not possible to be recognized as a Thai national or to get Thai ID, and when you’re stateless, it is very hard to move around or find work.' Inside the camps, jobs are hard to come by except for running a small shop or working with an aid group for a modest stipend. Schools are barred from teaching the Thai curriculum or language, leaving little chance for a higher education. Monthly food allowances, funded by international donors, barely keep pace with inflation. Since Trump took office, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development also has compelled the clinics it was funding across the camps to close, forcing the refugees onto Thailand’s own public health care system. The Thai government has vowed to plug the gap, but media reports say it is struggling. Some critics say the USAID programs are wasteful and promote an agenda that fosters dependence without addressing the root of the problem. A Justice Department official, Brett Shumate, said Friday, 'The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID,' although he did not detail the alleged mismanagement. 'If they could return [to Myanmar], if the situation [were] safe, of course everyone would want to return to their homes. But since it is impossible, then resettlement is one of their first options,' said Wahkushee Tenner, a former refugee from the camps who now runs the Karen Peace Support Network, a nongovernment group based in Thailand that advocates for the Karen. 'Resettlement is not the best option,' she said, 'but there is no best … option.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-order-halts-myanmar-refugee-resettlement-deal-with-thailand/7967957.html	2025-02-08T10:07:59-08:00	
African leaders call for 'immediate ceasefire' at DRC summit	BUKAVU, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — A summit of African leaders meeting to address the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday called for an 'immediate and unconditional ceasefire' within five days. The M23 armed rebel group has rapidly seized swathes of territory in the mineral-rich eastern DRC in an offensive that has left thousands dead and displaced vast numbers. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The summit in Tanzania brought together Rwandan President Paul Kagame and his Congolese counterpart, Felix Tshisekedi, as well as leaders from the East African Community bloc and 16-member Southern African Development Community. Kagame appeared in person, while Tshisekedi joined via video call. In the final statement, the summit called for army chiefs from both communities 'to meet within five days and provide technical direction on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.' It also called for the opening of humanitarian corridors to evacuate the dead and injured. Meanwhile, fighting was ongoing about 60 kilometers from the South Kivu provincial capital of Bakuvu, local and security sources told AFP. The M23 took the strategic city of Goma, capital of North Kivu province, last week and is pushing into neighboring South Kivu in the latest episode of decadeslong turmoil in the region. Local fears Since the M23 reemerged in 2021, peace talks hosted by Angola and Kenya have failed and multiple ceasefires have collapsed. While Rwanda continues to deny supporting the M23 militarily, a report by United Nations experts said last year Rwanda had around 4,000 troops in the DRC and profited from smuggling out of the country vast amounts of gold and coltan — a mineral vital for phones and laptops. Rwanda accuses the DRC of sheltering the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The summit comes amid reports that the M23 is closing on the town of Kavumu in South Kivu, which hosts an airport critical to supplying Congolese troops. There have also been reports of panic in the provincial capital, Bukavu, as residents board up shops and seek to escape. 'The border with Rwanda is open but almost impassable because of the number of people trying to cross. It's total chaos,' they said. Gang rape, slavery U.N. rights chief Volker Turk warned Friday: 'If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come for the people of the eastern DRC but also beyond the country's borders.' Turk said that nearly 3,000 people had been confirmed killed and 2,880 wounded since the M23 entered Goma on Jan. 26, and that the final tolls were likely to be much higher. He also said his team was 'currently verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery.' M23 has already installed its own mayor and local authorities in Goma. It has vowed to march all the way to the national capital, Kinshasa, even though the city lies about 1,600 kilometers away across the vast country, which is roughly the size of Western Europe. The DRC army, which has a reputation for poor training and corruption, has been forced into multiple retreats. The M23 offensive has raised fears of a regional war, given that several countries are supporting the DRC militarily, including South Africa, Burundi and Malawi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-leaders-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-at-drc-summit/7967909.html	2025-02-08T08:51:04-08:00	
Lebanese leader forms new government, pledges reforms	BEIRUT — Lebanon formed a new government Saturday, following unusually direct U.S. intervention in the process and in a step intended to bring the country closer to accessing reconstruction funds following a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah. Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace, new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the 24-member Cabinet would prioritize financial reforms, reconstruction and the implementation of a United Nations resolution seen as a cornerstone to stability on the Lebanese border with Israel. The announcement came after more than three weeks of talks with rival political parties in Lebanon — where government posts are parceled out according to sect — and days of deadlock over the Shiite Muslim ministers, usually named by Iran-backed Hezbollah and its Shiite ally Amal. But Washington pushed back against Hezbollah's sway in any new government. U.S. Deputy Middle East Envoy Morgan Ortagus said on Friday that the U.S. considered Hezbollah's involvement in the new Cabinet a 'red line' and thanked Israel for dealing devastating blows to the group, in a controversial statement that sparked protests in Lebanon. But ultimately, Hezbollah's ally Amal — which is headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri — was allowed to choose four of the new Cabinet's members, including the finance minister Yassin Jaber, and give its nod of approval to a fifth. The Cabinet is now charged with drafting a policy statement — a broad outline of the upcoming government's approach and priorities — and will then need a vote of confidence from Lebanon's Parliament to be fully empowered. Joseph Aoun, who enjoyed U.S. backing as army commander, was elected president on Jan. 9 and nominated Salam to form a new government days later. Salam had been serving as the head of the International Court of Justice. Salam's nomination was the latest signal of a dramatic shift in the power balance in Lebanon, following the heavy blows Israel dealt to Hezbollah, the ousting in December of Hezbollah's Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad and Aoun's election last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanese-leader-forms-new-government-pledges-reforms/7967899.html	2025-02-08T08:27:29-08:00	
Modi’s party wins majority in New Delhi polls, first time in 27 years	NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist party won the most seats in the high-stakes state legislature election in the country’s federal territory, including New Delhi, for the first time in over a quarter-century, according to official data Saturday. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 47 seats in the 70-member assembly that includes India’s capital of 20 million people, ousting the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, that ruled New Delhi since 2015. The AAP won 22 seats. The outcome of the race in one remaining seat had yet to be declared, according to the Election Commission of India. India's main opposition Congress party lost on all seats for the third consecutive term. In a major upset, the AAP founder and leader Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, lost their seats despite their party having built widespread support with its welfare policies and anticorruption movement. 'We accept the mandate of the people with great humility,' Kejriwal said in a video statement while congratulating the BJP on its victory. He said he hoped that the BJP would fulfil its election promises. 'We have done a lot of work in the field of health, education and infrastructure in the last 10 years,' Kejriwal said. 'We will not only play the role of a constructive opposition but will also remain among the people and continue to serve them.' Waving party flags and posters of Modi, supporters of the BJP chanted slogans and danced outside its headquarters in the capital as vote results began trickling with most exit polls predicting the party's win. Pledges on schools and health services The BJP's Amit Shah, who is India's powerful home minister, said his party's victory signified that 'people can’t be misled with lies every time.' He said under the leadership of Modi, the BJP would make New Delhi 'the world’s No. 1 capital by fulfilling all promises.' 'Our victory is a sign of the people’s faith in Prime Minister Modi’s vision of progress,' he said in a statement. Saturday’s victory is seen as a big boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states last year. Ahead of the election, Modi’s party slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget. During the electioneering, Modi and Kejriwal offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, along with a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women. Federal investigations Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key party leaders on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, who won her seat Saturday. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest, accusing Modi’s government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures before the national election. Kejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger over corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women. In 2020, the AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last state legislature election, leaving the BJP with eight and the Congress party with none. The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-s-party-wins-majority-in-new-delhi-polls-first-time-in-27-years/7967851.html	2025-02-08T07:40:35-08:00	
More than 50 killed in convoy ambush in Mali, sources say	More than 50 people were killed near Mali's northeastern city of Gao on Friday after armed assailants ambushed their convoy and its army escort, a local official and residents said. The attackers struck near the village of Kobe, around 30 kilometers from Gao in a region where affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have been active for over a decade, destabilizing Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. 'People jumped out of vehicles to flee. There were many dead and wounded civilians,' the local official said on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. Up to 56 bodies were recorded at the hospital in Gao, the official said, adding that there also was an unknown number of military casualties. The Malian army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Gao resident also said about 50 were killed and vehicles torched. Deadly attacks have become so frequent that the military organizes near-daily escorts, the resident said. The insurgencies took root in Mali's arid north following a Tuareg separatist rebellion in 2012. The Islamist militants have since spread to other countries in the impoverished central Sahel region south of the Sahara. The attacks have killed thousands of people and contributed to a humanitarian crisis with upwards of 3.2 million people displaced as of January, according to the International Organization for Migration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-50-killed-in-convoy-ambush-in-mali-sources-say/7967744.html	2025-02-08T05:18:42-08:00	
Zelenskyy hints at ‘intensive’ talks with Trump as US, Ukraine discuss peace deal	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not confirmed that he will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump next week but said the coming weeks may be 'very intensive in diplomacy.' Trump said on Feb. 7 that he is likely to meet with Zelenskyy next week. The site of the meeting 'could be Washington,' he said, adding that he would not be going to Kyiv. He also said he would 'probably' be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin soon but did not give a time frame. Zelenskyy said it is important that he and Trump meet in person before the U.S. president meets with Putin. Zelenskyy did not confirm a meeting with Trump but said diplomacy would be ramping up. 'The coming weeks may be very intensive in diplomacy, and we will do what’s needed to make this time effective and productive. We always appreciate working with President Trump,' he said shortly after Trump spoke. 'Weʼre also planning meetings and talks at the teams’ level. Right now Ukrainian and American teams are working out the details. A solid, lasting peace shall become closer.' In his comments earlier at the White House, the U.S. president reiterated that he is interested in tying continued military aid to access to Ukraine's raw materials. 'One of the things we're looking at with President Zelenskyy is having the security of their assets. They have assets underground, rare earth and other things, but primarily rare earth,' he said. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earths and other things,' Trump said on Feb. 3. He said on Feb. 7 that the United States wants 'an equal amount of something' in exchange for U.S. support. 'We would like them to equalize,' Trump said. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel, and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium, and titanium. Ukraine floated the idea of opening its critical minerals to investment by allies last year when it presented its plan to end the war and now suggests it could be open to a deal. 'If we are talking about a deal, then let's do a deal. We are only for it,' Zelenskyy said on Feb. 7, emphasizing Ukraine's need for security guarantees from its allies as part of any settlement of the war. 'Strong security always has many elements, and each one matters,' he said on X. 'Ukraine possesses some of the largest strategic resource reserves in Europe, and protecting Ukraine also means protecting these resources.' Less than 20% of Ukraine's mineral resources, including about half its rare earth deposits, are under Russian occupation, Zelenskyy said in an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7. Moscow could open those resources to North Korea and Iran if it maintains its hold on the territories. 'We need to stop Putin and protect what we have -- a very rich Dnipro region, central Ukraine,' he told Reuters. Zelenskyy is likely to further discuss the idea with allies next week at the Munich Security Conference. Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said this week he plans to attend the conference, but denied a report that he will present Trump’s plan for ending the war in Ukraine at the gathering, which starts Feb. 14. Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said he had spoken to Kellogg about the battlefield situation, the safety of Ukrainian civilians, and meetings at the annual security conference. He also said Ukraine is looking forward to Kellogg’s visit later this month. Some information for this report came from Reuters and dpa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-hints-at-intensive-talks-with-trump-as-us-ukraine-discuss-peace-deal/7967709.html	2025-02-08T02:41:58-08:00	
Baltics begin decoupling from Russian power grid	VILNIUS, LITHUANIA — The Baltic states on Saturday began cutting ties with Russia's power grid in order to integrate with Europe's system, a years-long process that gained urgency with Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- all former Soviet republics now in the European Union and NATO -- are leaving Russia's grid to prevent Moscow from weaponizing it against them. 'We are now removing Russia's ability to use the electricity system as a tool of geopolitical blackmail,' Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas told AFP. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas -- Estonia's former prime minister -- hailed the move on X as 'a victory for freedom and European unity.' Lithuania was the first of the three Baltic countries to decouple from the Moscow-controlled electricity network, Lithuania's state-run grid operator Litgrid said Saturday. 'I can confirm that Lithuania's electricity exchange lines with Kaliningrad and Belarus were disconnected at 07:43' local time (0543 GMT), Litgrid spokesperson Matas Noreika told AFP. Estonia and Latvia were due to follow suit by 0700 GMT, he added. Official celebrations are planned across the Baltics, although some consumers worry about disruptions to supply including from potential cyberattacks. Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia on Saturday and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is to attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius on Sunday. 'We are ready,' Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said on X, calling the weekend 'the beginning of a new era of our energy independence.' The Baltics have long prepared to integrate with the European grid but faced technological and financial issues. The switch became more urgent after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, spooking the Baltic states into thinking they could be targeted. They stopped purchasing Russian gas and electricity after the invasion, but their power grids remained connected to Russia and Belarus, controlled from Moscow. This left them dependent on Moscow for a stable electricity flow, which is crucial for factories and facilities requiring a reliable power supply. 'Possible provocations' After the Baltic states disconnect from the Russian grid, they will operate in so-called 'isolated mode' for about 24 hours to test their frequency, or power levels. 'We need to carry out some tests to assure Europe that we are a stable energy system,' said Rokas Masiulis, head of Litgrid. 'We'll switch power stations on and off, observe how the frequency fluctuates and assess our ability to control it.' The states will then integrate into the European power grid via Poland. Authorities have warned of potential risks linked to the change. 'Various short-term risks are possible, such as kinetic operations against critical infrastructure, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns,' Lithuania's state security department told AFP. Poland's power grid operator PSE said it will use helicopters and drones to patrol the connection with Lithuania. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics told LTV1 the countries were 'maximally ready' for the switch, but said they could not 'rule out possible provocations.' In Estonia, police and volunteer defense corps will man critical electrical infrastructure until the following weekend because of the risk of sabotage. Several undersea telecom and power cables have been severed in the Baltic Sea in recent months. Some experts and politicians have accused Russia of waging a hybrid war, an allegation Moscow denies. 'People won't feel it' A total of $1.7 billion -- mostly EU funds -- has been invested in the synchronization project across the Baltic states and Poland. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda was sure the switch would go smoothly, telling reporters: 'People won't feel it, either in terms of their bills or any inconvenience.' Estonia's climate ministry urged everyone to carry on as usual as 'the more regular and predictable the behavior... the easier it is to manage the power grid.' But some consumers worry about power cuts and home improvement stores in Estonia have noted a sharp increase in sales of generators. After the Baltic decoupling, the energy system in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad will lose its grid connection to mainland Russia. Kaliningrad has been building up power generation capacity for years and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed all concerns. Asked about the cut-off last week, he said: 'We have taken all measures to ensure the uninterrupted reliable operation of our unified energy system.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltics-begin-decoupling-from-russian-power-grid/7967586.html	2025-02-08T00:32:54-08:00	
Rwandan, Congolese leaders to meet over eastern DRC conflict	DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA — Rwanda's President Paul Kagame was due to meet his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi in Tanzania on Saturday as regional leaders convene in a bid to defuse the conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo. The M23 armed group has rapidly seized swathes of territory in the mineral-rich eastern DRC in an offensive that has left thousands dead and displaced vast numbers. The group took the strategic city of Goma last week and is pushing into the neighboring South Kivu province in the latest episode of decades-long turmoil in the region. Kagame and Tshisekedi are due to attend a joint summit in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, bringing together the eight countries of the East African Community and 16-member South African Development Community. Since the M23 reemerged in 2021, several peace talks hosted by Angola and Kenya have failed. Rwanda denies military support for the M23 but a U.N. report said last year it had around 4,000 troops in DRC and profited from smuggling vast amounts of gold and coltan -- a mineral vital to phones and laptops -- out of the country. Rwanda accuses the DRC of sheltering the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Local fears The summit comes as the M23 advances on the town of Kavumu, which hosts an airport critical to supplying Congolese troops. Kavumu is the last barrier before the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu on the Rwandan border, where panic has set in. A Bukavu resident said shops were barricading their fronts and emptying storerooms for fear of looting, while schools and universities suspended classes on Friday. 'The border with Rwanda is open but almost impassable because of the number of people trying to cross. It's total chaos,' they said. U.N. rights chief Volker Turk warned: 'If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come, for the people of the eastern DRC, but also beyond the country's borders.' 'Gang rape, slavery' Turk said nearly 3,000 people had been confirmed killed and 2,880 injured since M23 entered Goma on Jan. 26, and that final tolls were likely much higher. He also said his team was 'currently verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery.' The M23 has already installed its own mayor and local authorities in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. It has vowed to go all the way to the national capital Kinshasa, even though it lies about 1,600 kilometers away across the vast country, which is roughly the size of Western Europe. The DRC army, which has a reputation for poor training and corruption, has been forced into multiple retreats. The offensive has raised fears of regional war, given that several countries are engaged in supporting DRC militarily, including South Africa, Burundi and Malawi. Regional foreign ministers gathered on Friday for the first day of the summit in Tanzania ahead of their leaders on Saturday. Kenyan foreign secretary Musalia Mudavadi said there was a 'golden opportunity' to find a solution, calling for the previous peace processes hosted by Angola and Kenya to be merged into one.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwandan-congolese-leaders-to-meet-over-eastern-drc-conflict/7967581.html	2025-02-08T00:01:18-08:00	
Uyghurs mark 28 years since Ghulja violence, condemn ongoing repression	WASHINGTON — The first week of February is marked by grief for Zubayra Shamseden not only because she lost loved ones nearly three decades ago, she says, but because China’s repressive policies toward Uyghurs continue. 'I have been commemorating this day and protesting for the past 28 years, every February 5,' Shamseden told VOA. 'The Ghulja massacre in 1997 was the beginning of today’s ongoing genocide of Uyghurs.' Many protesters were killed by the Chinese armed forces that day in what Shamseden describes as a violent Chinese government crackdown on a peaceful Uyghur protest in Ghulja, a city in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang. During subsequent crackdowns, she also lost her brother, Sadirdin, and her nephew, Hemmat Muhammet. In the aftermath, another brother was sentenced to life in prison. 'The Chinese government should release all prisoners, including my brother, who were unjustly imprisoned,' she told VOA. Outset of violence In recent years, China’s policy toward Uyghurs in Xinjiang has drawn global attention, with the U.S. officially labeling China’s actions as genocide. The United Nations has raised alarms, warning that China’s conduct may constitute crimes against humanity, including mass detentions, forced labor, and other abuses. Beijing, which refers to the 1997 crackdown as 'the Yining incident' — a measured police response to an unfolding 'riot' — has dismissed these claims as 'sheer falsehoods' driven by U.S.-led anti-China forces. Now Chinese outreach coordinator for the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, Shamseden led a demonstration Wednesday outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Joined by a dozen activists, she marked the anniversary of what she and many others refer to as the Ghulja Massacre. Recalling the violence of that day, Shamseden says a few hundred unarmed Uyghur youths marched through Ghulja, calling for basic rights. 'They took to the streets peacefully and unarmed, asking the government to respect their Islamic religious freedom and Uyghur cultural practices,' said Shamseden, a former vice president of the World Uyghur Congress. The youths also called for the release of previously 'arrested leaders of their gatherings, because the Chinese authorities didn’t allow them to gather for Meshrep,' she said. Meshrep, a traditional Uyghur community gathering, has been recognized by UNESCO as part of Uyghur intangible cultural heritage since 2010. Some Meshrep organizers, Shamseden said, had previously been arrested despite initial government approval to hold Meshrep gatherings. Speaking out about a drug crisis among fellow youths in the region had been the purpose of their gatherings. 'The Uyghur youth in Ghulja sought to address the growing heroin addiction crisis that spread in the early 1990s,' Shamseden said. 'They turned to Meshrep — traditional gatherings that included sports, music, performances, and other forms of entertainment — to help young Uyghurs struggling with addiction and alcohol.' Officials in Beijing, however, soon deemed the gatherings a threat. In August 1995, key organizers were arrested, prompting protests in Ghulja. Authorities responded by banning Meshrep and cracking down on other Uyghur-led initiatives. Uyghurs were later barred from holding events of any kind. Different perspective Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, described the protest as 'not a so-called massacre, but a serious incident of beating, smashing, and looting' carried out by a burgeoning terrorist group. 'Xinjiang was once a major area where extremist groups infiltrated and carried out violent terrorist activities,' Liu said, adding that China’s measures in the region have been aimed at countering terror-based insurgency within the framework of Chinese law. A 1997 Human Rights Watch report, however, linked the crackdown to a secret Chinese government directive known as 'Document No. 7.' Issued in March 1996 by the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the document laid out measures to strengthen control over Xinjiang, including restrictions on religious and cultural activities, increased military presence and tighter security enforcement. The Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs described the Chinese government crackdown on protesters as a massacre, stating that the policies behind that bloodshed have evolved into the genocide unfolding today. The Ghulja Massacre was 'a pivotal moment when the world had an opportunity to recognize China’s trajectory towards mass atrocities — and failed to act,' said Rushan Abbas, the group's executive director, in a statement issued Wednesday. 'That failure emboldened the [Chinese Communist Party],' said Abbas, who is also chairperson of the executive committee at World Uyghur Congress. 'Today, as Uyghurs endure genocide, history repeats itself. The price of inaction is paid in human lives, and every day without accountability reinforces the Chinese regime’s belief that it can commit atrocities without consequence.' According to Shamseden, who had been in Australia since 1993, visiting Ghulja only in the aftermath of the crackdown in 1998, mass arrests and collective punishment had by then become routine. This crackdown led to the arrest, torture and release of her sister for allegedly helping a Ghulja protester, the killing of her brother Sadirdin in Kazakhstan under mysterious circumstances, and the killing of her nephew Hemmat Muhammet by Chinese police in Ghulja. Shamseden’s nephew and brother were leading members of earlier Meshrep gatherings. In 1999, Shamseden said another younger brother, Abdurazzak was sentenced by the Chinese officials for being a separatist, receiving a sentence of life in prison. To this day, she said, she has been unable to learn any details about her brother’s current fate, including whether he is alive. According to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Abdurazzak’s sentence was commuted by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region High People's Court in August 2016. He had reportedly been serving time at Urumqi No.1 Prison, and is expected to be released in 2036, but his exact whereabouts remain unknown.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uyghurs-mark-28-years-since-ghulja-violence-condemn-ongoing-repression/7967538.html	2025-02-07T23:30:32-08:00	
Stradivari violin made in 1714 sells for $11.3M	NEW YORK — A violin made in 1714 by the legendary luthier Antonio Stradivari sold for $11.3 million at an auction in New York on Friday, short of estimates that would have made it the most expensive instrument ever sold. Sotheby's auction house had estimated that the 'Joachim-Ma Stradivarius' violin could sell for between $12 million and $18 million, with the higher end of the range potentially eclipsing the record-breaking $15.9 million someone paid for another Stradivari violin at auction more than a decade ago. The 'Joachim-Ma Stradivarius' is regarded as one of Stradivari's best works, built during his 'Golden Period' at the height of his craftsmanship and acoustic mastery, according to the auction house. Adding to the intrigue, the violin is believed to have influenced legendary composer Johannes Brahms when he wrote the famed 'Violin Concerto in D Major' and was actually played during the concerto's 1879 premiere. 'This extraordinary violin represents the pinnacle of craftsmanship and classical music history, its unparalleled sound and storied provenance captivating collectors and musicians alike,' Mari-Claudia Jimenez, chair at Sotheby's. 'The Joachim-Ma Stradivarius garnered global attention, achieving one of the highest prices ever for a musical instrument — an acknowledgment of its rarity and historical importance.' $2M increase in seconds Bidding at Sotheby's began at $8 million and within seconds shot up to $10 million, as auctioneer Phyllis Kao scanned the room, looking for someone to put up $10.5 million. 'Am I selling? At $10 million,' she said, looking to potential bidders. The room was quiet. 'Last chance, at $10 million,' she said. 'I can sell, and I will, at $10 million, unless you go on.' 'Sold. $10 million,' she said, banging a gavel. The final price includes auction house fees. Sale funds scholarships The name of the instrument comes from two of its famous violin virtuoso owners, Joseph Joachim of Hungary and Si-Hon Ma of China. Ma's estate gifted the violin to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. The conservatory will use the proceeds to fund student scholarships. 'The sale is transformational for future students, and proceeds will establish the largest named endowed scholarship at New England Conservatory,' said Andrea Kalyn, president of New England Conservatory. 'It has been an honor to have the Joachim-Ma Stradivari on campus, and we are eager to watch its legacy continue on the world stage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---stradivari-violin-made-in-1714-sells-for-11-3m-/7967516.html	2025-02-07T23:29:54-08:00	
Alaska lawmakers ask Trump to retain Denali's name, not change it to Mount McKinley	JUNEAU, ALASKA — The Alaska Legislature passed a resolution Friday urging President Donald Trump to reverse course and retain the name of North America's tallest peak as Denali rather than change it to Mount McKinley. Trump, on his first day in office, signed an executive order calling for the name to revert to Mount McKinley, an identifier inspired by President William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. He said he planned to 'restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.' The 19-0 vote in the state Senate came just over a week after the House passed the measure 31-8. The resolution was sponsored by Rep. Maxine Dibert, a Democrat who is Koyukon Athabascan. Members of that tribe bestowed the name Denali, or 'the high one,' on the mountain in interior Alaska. 'Denali is more than a mountain,' Dibert of Fairbanks said in a news release. 'It's a cornerstone of Alaska's history, a tribute to our diverse culture and a testament to the people who have cherished this land for millennia.' The Interior Department late last month announced efforts were underway to implement Trump's renaming order, even though state leaders haven't seen the matter as settled. An Interior spokesperson, J. Elizabeth Peace, earlier this week said the agency did not have any further updates. According to the National Park Service, a prospector in 1896 dubbed the peak Mount McKinley for William McKinley, who was elected president that year. Although there were challenges to the McKinley name at the time it was announced, maps had already been circulated with the mountain's name in place. The name was formally recognized by the U.S. government until it was changed in 2015 by the Obama administration to Denali. The name change reflected the traditions of Alaska Natives and the preference of many Alaskans, underscored by a push by state leaders decades earlier. The 6,190-meter mountain in Denali National Park and Preserve on clear days can be see from hundreds of kilometers away. 'Denali is the name of our mountain; a name of great importance to Alaska Natives and everyone across our state,' House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in the news release. 'It is clear from the bipartisan support in the legislature that Alaskans should decide.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/alaska-lawmakers-ask-trump-to-retain-denali-s-name-not-change-it-to-mount-mckinley/7967506.html	2025-02-07T23:29:17-08:00	
North Korea says its nuclear weapons not a 'bargaining chip' as Trump, Ishiba meet	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea said on Saturday its nuclear weapons are not meant for negotiations but are intended for combat use against enemies that threaten its people and world peace, its state media reported. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on Friday. The two leaders expressed their commitment to ensuring North Korea ends its nuclear weapons program. KCNA did not mention the meeting between the U.S. and Japanese leaders but instead cited reported comments by officials of NATO and the EU that reiterated demands for a complete denuclearization of North Korea. 'We say this clearly again: Our nuclear weapons are not an advertisement to get anyone's recognition and even less a bargaining chip to be exchanged for some money,' KCNA said in a statement. 'Our nuclear forces are for unwavering combat use to swiftly eliminate any attempts by enemy forces that infringe on our country's sovereignty and the safety of our people and threaten world peace,' it said. North Korea has not responded directly to overtures from Trump to resume contact with its leader Kim Jong Un and instead stressed its intention to 'bolster' its nuclear forces. Trump said on Friday he 'will have relations with North Korea and with Kim Jong Un,' adding he had a good rapport with Kim. The two held unprecedented summit meetings during Trump's first presidency. On Jan. 20 when he was inaugurated for his second term, Trump said the North was a 'nuclear power,' raising questions whether he would pursue arms reduction talks rather than denuclearization negotiations. 'The two leaders expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea,' a joint statement by Trump and Ishiba issued after their talks said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-its-nuclear-weapons-not-a-bargaining-chip-as-trump-ishiba-meet/7967579.html	2025-02-07T23:28:26-08:00	
US approves sale of $7.4B in bombs, missiles to Israel	WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday announced the approval of the sale of more than $7.4 billion in bombs, missiles and related equipment to Israel, which has used American-made weapons to devastating effect during the war in Gaza. The State Department has signed off on the sale of $6.75 billion in bombs, guidance kits and fuses, in addition to $660 million in Hellfire missiles, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The proposed sale of the bombs 'improves Israel's capability to meet current and future threats, strengthen its homeland defense, and serves as a deterrent to regional threats,' DSCA said in a statement. And the missile sale would 'improve Israel's capability to meet current and future threats by improving the ability of the Israeli Air Force to defend Israel's borders, vital infrastructure, and population centers,' it said. Israel launched a hugely destructive offensive against Hamas in Gaza in October 2023 in response to an unprecedented attack by the Palestinian militant group that month. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The war has devastated much of Gaza -- a narrow coastal territory on the Mediterranean -- resulting in the displacement of much of its population, but a ceasefire has been in effect since last month, bringing a halt to the deadly conflict and providing for the release of hostages seized by Hamas. In response to concerns over civilian deaths, then-President Joe Biden's administration blocked a shipment of 907-kilogram bombs to Israel -- larger than those in the latest proposed sale -- but his successor, Donald Trump, reportedly approved the shipment after returning to office. While the State Department has approved the sale of the bombs and missiles, the transactions still need to be approved by Congress, which is unlikely to block the provision of the weapons to Washington's closest ally in the Middle East.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-approves-sale-of-7-4b-in-bombs-missiles-to-israel/7967574.html	2025-02-07T23:06:01-08:00	
US Justice Department disbands teams investigating corruption, election interference	The U.S. Department of Justice will refocus much of its staff and resources on the 'total elimination' of drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations in the U.S. while disbanding units dedicated to prosecuting white-collar crime and kleptocrats and tracking foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections. The change, announced in a set of memos issued this week by newly sworn-in Attorney General Pam Bondi, is part of a major reorientation of a department that President Donald Trump says has been 'weaponized' against him since the end of his first term in office. In a memo issued Wednesday, her first day in office, Bondi called for a 'fundamental change in mindset and approach' when it comes to combating drug cartels. 'We must do more than try to mitigate the enormous harms these groups cause in America,' Bondi wrote. 'It is not enough to stem the tide of deadly poisons, such as fentanyl, that these groups distribute in our homeland. Rather, we must harness the resources of the Department of Justice and empower federal prosecutors throughout the country to work urgently with the Department of Homeland Security and other parts of the government toward the goal of eliminating these threats to U.S. sovereignty.' Kleptocracy programs eliminated The same memo outlined Bondi's moves to do away with specific units in the department. Among those eliminated were two dedicated to targeting kleptocrats — public figures who use their authority to steal resources from their own people. The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, established in 2010, worked to identify the assets of kleptocrats, seize them and return them to the countries from which they were stolen. Task Force KleptoCapture, a separate unit, was formed in early 2022 in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The unit targeted oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and enforced sanctions against Russia by the U.S. and its allies after the invasion. 'Attorneys assigned to those initiatives shall return to their prior posts,' Bondi's memo said, 'and resources currently devoted to those efforts shall be committed to the total elimination of Cartels and TCOs.' The Criminal Division's unit focused on bringing prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, she said, 'shall prioritize investigations related to foreign bribery that facilitates the criminal operations of Cartels and TCOs, and shift focus away from investigations and cases that do not involve such a connection.' In 2024 alone, the FCPA unit secured hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement payments from companies found guilty of bribing public officials. Prosecutions under the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act were also redirected under the new instructions. Anti-corruption groups concerned Gary Kalman, the executive director of Transparency International U.S., told VOA that the changes to DOJ priorities could have dire consequences for the global fight against public corruption. 'The elimination of kleptocracy initiatives is a concern in that those initiatives were providing valuable coordination and information-sharing services amongst different departments and with some of our overseas allies,' Kalman said. 'Those networks had some encouraging results and enabled investigations to move more quickly,' he said. 'Dismantling those programs will likely have a negative effect on our ability to investigate and prosecute cases.' Regarding the change in focus for FCPA and FEPA investigations, Kalman said, much will depend on how the administration chooses to define 'transnational criminal organizations.' FCPA and FEPA violations 'are by nature, transnational crimes,' he pointed out. So, he said, it's difficult to know for sure what kind of investigations will be prioritized. 'For example, do they consider the Iranian government an 'organization'?' he asked. In an analysis of the Justice Department's moves, a group of attorneys at the law firm Arnold & Porter argued that the department's new posture might lead to more FCPA cases. 'FCPA enforcement might actually increase, at least in certain areas,' they wrote. 'For example, DOJ might more aggressively prosecute FCPA violations related directly to Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as China — places that the Trump administration has identified publicly as sources of transnational criminal activity, including trafficking of illegal narcotics.' Foreign influence prosecutions refocused In a separate memo, Bondi revealed that the Department of Justice will also disband the Foreign Influence Task Force, established in 2017 to investigate efforts by state actors, such as Russia and China, to influence U.S. public opinion, particularly around elections. Trump has been highly critical of efforts by law enforcement to identify and root out foreign interference in U.S. elections, especially after a report by special counsel Robert Mueller, in 2019, found extensive evidence that Russian influence operations had been mounted to benefit Trump's candidacy during the 2016 presidential election. In her memo, Bondi wrote, 'To free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion, the Foreign Influence Task Force shall be disbanded.' Election integrity advocates were dismayed by the decision. Susannah Goodman, the director of election security for the activist organization Common Cause, said in a statement that the decision to disband FITF is a 'terrible mistake' that will leave state and local election infrastructure without critical support. 'The FITF provides critical protection to safeguard our votes and our elections from the intelligence services of hostile foreign governments including Russia, China and Iran,' Goodman said. 'We know that foreign governments have been interfering in our elections for decades and even more expansively beginning during the 2016 election cycle. It is hard to imagine a more pressing priority than protecting our elections from foreign interference,' she said. 'States and local officials — who run our elections — do not have the resources and expertise to go toe-to-toe with highly sophisticated foreign intelligence services,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-disbands-teams-investigating-corruption-election-interference/7967503.html	2025-02-07T21:42:27-08:00	
Hamas set to release 3 Israeli hostages as ceasefire deal holds	Hamas has identified three more Israeli hostages it plans to free on Saturday as part of a fragile ceasefire agreement, even as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to talk up his plan to take ownership of the Gaza Strip. The three men, captured by Hamas during its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, will be part of the fifth exchange since a ceasefire between Isreal and Hamas took effect last month. For its part, Isreal is set to release 183 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday. The three Israelis are Eli Sharabi, 52; Ohad Ben Ami, 56; and Or Levy, 34. Ami and Sharabi were both taken hostage from Kibbutz Beeri, a communal farm, while Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival. During the first phase of the ceasefire, set to last six weeks, Hamas is to gradually free 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. So far, 13 Israeli hostages and five Thai workers abducted during the Hamas attack have been freed. Details of the planned exchange Saturday came as Trump said his plan for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip should be viewed as a real estate transaction but offered no timetable for the plan, saying 'we’re in no rush on it.' The president made the comments Friday as he and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with reporters at the White House before the two leaders held talks. Responding to a question about his Gaza proposal, Trump said his plan has been 'very well received,' and as he envisioned it, there would be no need for the United States to have 'boots on the ground' in the region because Israel would provide security. Trump first announced his Gaza takeover plan earlier this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House news conference. Trump later offered more on the plan on his Truth Social platform, suggesting Israel should turn the Gaza Strip over to the United States after the war with Hamas ends. Under his plan, he said, the more than 2 million Palestinians who live there 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities.' In a video statement Thursday, during his visit to Washington, Netanyahu praised the plan, saying it was worth listening to and 'the first original idea to be raised in years.' The plan has been widely assailed by U.S. allies and adversaries alike, many of whom remain committed to the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, known as the 'two-state solution.' A large street protest was held in Amman, Jordan, on Friday in opposition to plan. At the demonstration, organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and other opposition parties, marchers carried posters and a banner condemning Trump and chanting pro- Palestinian slogans. On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called Trump’s idea a 'bold plan,' and said he has ordered the Israel Defense Forces to devise a plan for Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip, adding they could go 'to any country willing to accept them.' Meanwhile, the IDF announced Friday it has deployed forces from three divisions of its Southern Command to several points in the Gaza Strip to 'strengthen the layer of defense for Israeli citizens bordering the area.' In statement on its website, the IDF said the deployments were 'part of the ceasefire agreement' and added its forces 'are prepared for defense and will continue to act decisively against terrorist organizations, in order to ensure the security of the residents of the State of Israel.' It was unclear if the forces were related to the defense minister’s orders. Netanyahu wrapped his Washington visit Friday with a trip to Capitol Hill where he met with House Speaker Mike Johnson. During remarks following their meeting, Netanyahu thanked Trump for the executive order he issued placing sanctions on the International Criminal Court. Netanyahu called the ICC a 'scandalous and corrupt organization' that 'threatens the right of all democracies to defend themselves by themselves.' In the executive order, issued Thursday, Trump claimed the court 'has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.' The order also accused the ICC of abusing its power by issuing arrest warrants in November for Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defense minister who oversaw much of the war in Gaza. In a statement Friday, the ICC condemned the executive order. In a separate statement, Judge Tomoko Akane, president of the court, said the order was 'only the latest in a series of unprecedented and escalatory attacks aiming to undermine the ICC’s ability to administer justice in all situations.' The ICC was established in 2002 to serve as a permanent court to prosecute those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The court is governed by an international treaty called the Rome Statute, which was adopted by the U.N. in 1998. It took effect on July 1, 2002. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-set-to-release-3-israeli-hostages-as-ceasefire-deal-holds/7967559.html	2025-02-07T21:37:59-08:00	
Wreckage of missing Alaska plane found; no survivors	The wreckage of a small commuter plane missing in Alaska has been found, Coast Guard officials said Friday. All 10 people aboard the plane – nine passengers and a pilot – are dead, according to media reports. Coast Guard spokesman Mike Salerno said rescuers saw the crash from their helicopter as they flew over the Cessna 208 Caravan’s last known location. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate the scene, Salerno said. Several groups were involved in the search for the plane, including the Alaska State Troopers the U.S. Coast Guard, Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and local search teams. Authorities said a Jayhawk helicopter was brought in Friday morning to help with the search. The FBI provided technical assistance, including cellphone analysis to help locate the aircraft. The Bering Air flight was traveling in western Alaska, just south of the Artic Circle, from Unalakleet to Nome. Alaska State Troopers said they were notified Thursday at 4 p.m. about the missing plane. The U.S. Coast Guard said on X the flight’s last known position was 19 kilometers offshore. Early Friday, the Nome fire department posted on X that it was conducting a ground search, but weather and visibility conditions were hampering the department's air search. The department urged people not to form their own search parties because of hazardous weather conditions in the region, which is prone to sudden snow squalls and high winds. Airplanes are often the only method of transportation between rural Alaskan villages. Nome is well-known as the last stop in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. This is the third major U.S. aviation incident in recent days. On Jan. 29, a commercial airliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport outside Washington. Two days later, a medical transport plane crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood shortly after takeoff, killing six people onboard and another person on the street. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wreckage-of-missing-alaska-plane-found-no-survivors/7967549.html	2025-02-07T20:42:02-08:00	
Sweden wants to tighten gun laws after mass shooting	Sweden said Friday it wants to tighten its gun laws, following a lone gunman’s mass shooting of 10 people Tuesday with his licensed firearms at an education center in Orebro, about 200 kilometers west of Stockholm. After killing seven women and three men between the ages of 28 and 68, the attacker apparently killed himself with one of his weapons. The coalition government said in a statement that it has come to an agreement on a proposal restricting access to semiautomatic weapons, specifically citing the AR-15 rifle, which has been used in several U.S. shootings. It is 'an example of a weapon that is compatible with large magazines and can cause a lot of damage in a short time,' the statement said. 'There are certain types of weapons that are so dangerous that they should only be possessed for civilian purposes as an exception,' the government said. While it is not immediately clear what weapons were used in Tuesday’s shooting, Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told Reuters a ban on the AR-15 would be a 'preventative measure.' Sweden’s government also called for a reassessment of the requirements for hunting licenses that would allow Swedes to possess an AR-15, which could then be used, with some adjustments, in a mass shooting. AR-15 rifles have been allowed in Sweden for hunting since 2023, Reuters reported and since then 3,500 licenses have been issued. Police have not revealed what weapons were used in this week’s incident but have said that three rifles found near the suspect’s body were licensed to him. Police have seized a fourth gun also licensed to the suspect. Police say they have not determined a motive for the shootings. However, Broadcaster TV4 has shown a video shot by a student hiding in a bathroom during the ordeal. Someone can be heard in the video shouting, 'You will leave Europe.' The police have not released the nationalities of the victims, nor have they released the identity of the shooter. The Swedish press, however, has identified the suspect as 35-year-old Rickard Andersson, whom they describe as a recluse with mental health issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-wants-to-tighten-gun-laws-after-mass-shooting/7967547.html	2025-02-07T20:26:03-08:00

19 states sue to stop DOGE from accessing Americans' personal data	Nineteen Democratic attorneys general sued President Donald Trump on Friday to stop Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. The case, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges the Trump administration allowed Musk's team access to the Treasury Department's central payment system in violation of federal law. The payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars every year while containing an expansive network of Americans' personal and financial data. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending. DOGE's access to Treasury records, as well as its inspection of various government agencies, has ignited widespread concern among critics over the increasing power of Musk, while supporters have cheered the idea of reining in bloated government finances. Musk has made fun of criticism of DOGE on his X social media platform while saying it is saving taxpayers millions of dollars. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the lawsuit, said DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's data raises security problems and the possibility for an illegal freeze in federal funds. 'This unelected group, led by the world's richest man, is not authorized to have this information, and they explicitly sought this unauthorized access to illegally block payments that millions of Americans rely on, payments for health care, child care and other essential programs,' James said in a video message released by her office. James, a Democrat who has been one of Trump's chief antagonists, said the president does not have the power to give away American's private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress. Also on the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The suit alleges that DOGE's access to the Treasury records could interfere with funding appropriated by Congress, which would exceed the Treasury Department's statutory authority. The case also argues that the DOGE access violates federal administrative law and the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. It also accuses Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of changing the department's longstanding policy for protecting sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information to allow Musk's DOGE team access to its payment systems. 'This decision failed to account for legal obligations to protect such data and ignored the privacy expectations of federal fund recipients,' including states, veterans, retirees, and taxpayers, the lawsuit says. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said it's not clear what DOGE is doing with the information in the Treasury systems. 'This is the largest data breach in American history,' Tong said in a statement. 'DOGE is an unlawfully constituted band of renegade tech bros combing through confidential records, sensitive data and critical payment systems. What could go wrong?' The Treasury Department has said the review is about assessing the integrity of the system and that no changes are being made. According to two people familiar with the process, Musk's team began its inquiry looking for ways to suspend payments made by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and Musk are attempting to dismantle. The two people spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Separately, Democratic lawmakers are seeking a Treasury Department investigation of DOGE's access to the government's payment system. Also, labor unions and advocacy groups have sued to block the payments system review over concerns about its legality. A judge in Washington on Thursday temporarily restricted access to two employees with 'read only' privileges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/states-sue-to-stop-doge-from-accessing-americans-personal-data/7967515.html	2025-02-07T17:59:18-08:00	
Trump orders freeze of aid to South Africa, cites country's land expropriation law	washington — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday formalizing his announcement earlier this week that he'll freeze assistance to South Africa because of its law aiming to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era — a law the White House says amounts to discrimination against the country's white minority. 'As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,' the White House said in a summary of the order. The White House said Trump is also going to announce a program to resettle white South African farmers and their families as refugees. Trump was responding to a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people. The White House said the law 'blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority Afrikaners.' The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it were redistributed. It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when land was taken away from Black people and they were forced to live in areas designated for nonwhites. Elon Musk, who is a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority. Musk was born in South Africa. The order also references South Africa's role in bringing accusations of genocide against Israel before the International Court of Justice. The halt in foreign aid to South Africa comes amid a broader pause in most U.S. overseas assistance under Trump, as he looks to shift to what he calls an 'America First' foreign policy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-freeze-of-aid-to-south-africa-cites-country-s-land-expropriation-law/7967514.html	2025-02-07T17:58:48-08:00	
US homeland security leader official set to visit Guantanamo Bay	PENTAGON — The top U.S. homeland security official was set to get a firsthand look at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, visiting the U.S. naval base in Cuba a day after sending a second flight of 'high-threat illegal aliens' to be held there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the trip Friday in a social media post on X, while sharing photos of detainees she described as 'murderers & vicious gang members' being offloaded from a U.S. military transport jet before being taken to the prison facility. In a separate post earlier Friday, Noem said the detainees were all Venezuelan gang members. She said one detainee had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. A U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation, said Thursday's flight aboard a U.S. military C-130 cargo plane carried 13 'high-threat' individuals. The first 10 undocumented migrants, described by U.S. officials as the 'the worst of the worst,' arrived at the detention facility Tuesday, also on board a C-130. Officials have said all the migrants are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security officials said the 10 migrants who arrived Tuesday were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. U.S. defense officials have called the detention of the high-threat migrants at Guantanamo Bay detention facility a temporary measure. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday, though, emphasized the military's commitment under President Donald Trump to secure the U.S. southern border with Mexico. 'We've seen an invasion,' Hegseth told a town hall meeting with Pentagon employees. 'From people all around the world who I'm sure many of them want to seek a better life. I understand that. 'But we also don't know who millions of them are, what their intentions are, why they're here,' he said. 'That creates a very real national security threat.' Since Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed hundreds of Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. That includes preparing the detention center, known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. It also includes setting up tents and other facilities to house nonviolent migrants on another section of the base to prepare for as many as 30,000 migrants who will stay there until they can be deported to their countries of origin or other countries willing to take them. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the administration of former President George W. Bush in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Human rights groups have criticized the Trump administration's move to use Guantanamo as a holding center for migrants, with some warning it would amount to a human rights catastrophe. At its height during the global war on terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of Jan. 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-homeland-security-leader-official-set-to-visit-guantanamo-bay/7967295.html	2025-02-07T16:51:25-08:00	
Casino mogul asks US Supreme Court to revisit landmark defamation rule	washington — Casino mogul Steve Wynn has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal that, if granted, could give the justices a chance to revisit libel protections for journalists enshrined in a landmark 1964 ruling that has been questioned by two conservative justices and President Donald Trump. The court established a stringent limit on defamation claims by public figures more than 60 years ago in its New York Times v. Sullivan decision involving the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections for freedom of speech and the press. Wynn, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts and former finance chair of the Republican National Committee, is appealing a decision by Nevada's top court to dismiss his defamation suit against The Associated Press and one of its journalists. The court found Wynn failed to show a disputed 2018 news report containing allegations of sexual assault had been published with 'actual malice.' The Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan and subsequent decisions set a standard that in order to win a libel suit, a public figure must demonstrate the offending statement was made with 'actual malice,' meaning with knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard as to whether it was false. That standard has since been adopted in a number of state laws across the country, including in Nevada. Wynn's petition for appeal, which the court made public Tuesday, asks the justices to assess 'whether this court should overturn Sullivan’s actual-malice standard,' as well as a related prior court decision. At least four justices must vote to grant review for the court to hear an appeal. No date has been set for the justices to review or vote on whether to take up Wynn's case. Wynn's defamation lawsuit accused the defendants of publishing an article falsely alleging he committed sexual assault in the 1970s. Those claims first appeared in two separate citizens' complaints that an Associated Press reporter obtained from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, including one complaint that Wynn argued was implausible on its face and that a Nevada court in a separate proceeding found to have included 'clearly fanciful or delusional' allegations. Wynn has denied the sexual assault allegations. The Supreme Court in recent years has turned away other opportunities to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, including a 2021 denial that drew dissents from conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Citing a rapidly changing media environment increasingly rife with disinformation, Thomas and Gorsuch said in separate opinions the court should take a fresh look at its precedents that make it harder for public figures to sue for defamation. Since launching his first Republican presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has often attacked and even sued media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, and has repeatedly criticized U.S. defamation laws. A federal judge in 2023 threw out Trump's $475 million defamation lawsuit against CNN, in which the former president claimed the network's description of his election fraud as the 'big lie' associated him with Adolf Hitler. Trump's lawyers, in a 2022 filing in that case, had invited the judge to reconsider the legal standard set in New York Times v. Sullivan. 'The court should reconsider whether Sullivan’s standard truly protects the democratic values embodied by the First Amendment, or, instead, facilitates the pollution of the 'stream of information about public officials and public affairs' with false information,' Trump's lawyers wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/casino-mogul-asks-us-supreme-court-to-revisit-landmark-defamation-rule-/7967483.html	2025-02-07T16:16:33-08:00	
US defense secretary hosts Australian counterpart	pentagon — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth welcomed Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles to the Pentagon on Friday, after Australia made its first $500 million payment to the United States under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal involving Washington, Canberra and London. 'The check did clear,' Hegseth joked to Marles and reporters ahead of the defense ministers’ meeting. Marles said the 'strength of American leadership' in the Indo-Pacific region is 'critically important' to Australia. He added that the AUKUS submarine deal also represented an increase in Australian defense spending. 'We really understand the importance of building our capability, but in paying our way,' Marles told Hegseth. Marles was the first foreign defense counterpart that Hegseth had hosted since his confirmation. U.S. and Australian officials confirmed that Australia transferred the $500 million after a call between Marles and Hegseth late last month. AUKUS is a trilateral partnership that Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. announced in September 2021 to support a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' amid increased Chinese aggression. The first initiative under AUKUS was aimed at strengthening the U.S. submarine industrial base so that Australia can acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. It also provides for the rotational basing of American and British nuclear submarines in Australia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-secretary-hosts-australian-counterpart/7967472.html	2025-02-07T16:03:00-08:00	
Vietnam braces for fallout from US tariffs on Chinese goods	WASHINGTON — Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh instructed his Cabinet to prepare for a possible global trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 10% on all Chinese products. 'Prepare for the possibility of a world trade war this year,' the prime minister said at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to the Dan Tri online newspaper. Pham spoke after Trump announced a pause in his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days. Pham told the Cabinet that the situation in the world and the region was 'developing very unpredictably, directly affecting our country, especially on exports, production and business, and the macro economy.' He emphasized that if a global trade war were to occur, with countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on each other's exports, it could disrupt supply chains and shrink the country's export markets, posing significant risks to Vietnam's economy. Pham did not specifically mention Trump's tariffs on products from China, a strategic trade partner and a neighboring country of Vietnam. There are worries that Trump's tariffs may cause rising product prices and reduced consumer purchasing power in Vietnam, a highly open economy that relies heavily on exports and foreign direct investment, with China as its leading trade partner. Vietnamese businesses and consumers are bracing for U.S. tariffs on China to drive up the costs of some goods as the country imports machinery and electronic devices, such as computers and cellphones, from the U.S., with elements or pieces that originated from China. The country will also likely have to cope with pressure from Beijing to import more Chinese products, analysts said. 'Vietnam may be under pressure to import more products from China as Chinese products are levied higher tariffs by the U.S.,' Nguyen Quang A, an economic political observer and businessman in Hanoi, told VOA this week. Others predict that as American markets close to Chinese companies, they will increasingly turn to regional trading partners, like Vietnam. In 2024, Vietnam's exports to China totaled $61.2 billion. Meanwhile, imports from China surged to $144 billion, according to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. With the United States, the situation is reversed, with Vietnam's trade surplus in 2024 exceeding $123 billion, Reuters reported. According to analysts, Hanoi's pledges to import more from the U.S. as well as other offsetting measures could spare Vietnam from the Trump administration's tariffs. Nguyen noted a major hidden risk for Vietnam is that Chinese companies are setting up factories in Vietnam to import products for re-export, meaning they would repackage Chinese products with minimal labor by cheap Vietnamese workers and export them under the 'Made in Vietnam' label to avoid tariffs. 'Chinese businesses [are] moving to Vietnam and are processing their imported materials from China and then labeling their products as 'Made in Vietnam' before exporting to the U.S. The U.S. will definitely examine this issue carefully,' Nguyen said. Vietnam, which has long had geopolitical tensions with China, may face the risk of potential reprisal measures from China as Beijing said it would impose retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods as soon as next week. However, Vietnam seemed to win big in Trump's first-term trade war with China as the Southeast Asian country attracted manufacturers wanting to avoid Chinese tariffs. If Trump's tariffs are extended to Vietnam, the economic effects could ripple through trade balances, exchange rates, supply chains and foreign direct investment, said Vo Tri Thanh, former vice president at the Central Institute for Economic Management and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council, writing in Vietnam News. The sweeping tariffs have triggered the phenomenon of goods being stockpiled in Vietnam and in the region to avoid tax hikes, driving up demand for container shipping and pushing freight costs to new highs. Despite these pressures, Vietnam may find itself positioned to capitalize on global supply chain shifts, Nguyen Hong Dien, Vietnam's minister of industry and trade, told Tuoi Tre Online, explaining that the country could attract more investment in high-value sectors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-braces-for-fallout-from-us-tariffs-on-chinese-goods/7967258.html	2025-02-07T15:40:41-08:00	
Authorities continue search for plane missing in Alaska	Rescuers in Alaska continued their search Friday for an airplane that went missing Thursday with nine passengers and a pilot onboard. Several groups were involved in the search, including the Alaska State Troopers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Alaska Air National Guard, the Alaska Army National Guard and local search teams. Authorities said a Jayhawk helicopter was brought in Friday morning to help with the search. The FBI was also providing technical assistance, including cellphone analysis, to help locate the aircraft. The Bering Air Caravan flight was traveling in western Alaska, just south of the Arctic Circle, from Unalakleet to Nome. State troopers said they were notified Thursday at 4 p.m. about the plane's disappearance. The Coast Guard said on X that the flight was 19 kilometers offshore when its position was lost. The families of the passengers have been notified, according to the Nome Volunteer Fire Department, but passengers' names have not been released. The fire department posted on X that it was conducting an active ground search, but weather and visibility conditions were hampering the department's air search. The department urged people not to form their own search parties because of hazardous weather conditions in the region, which is prone to sudden snow squalls and high winds. Airplanes are often the only method of transportation between rural Alaskan villages. Nome is well-known as the last stop in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The missing flight is the third major U.S. aviation incident in recent days. On January 29, a commercial airliner and an Army helicopter collided near Washington's Reagan National Airport. Two days later, a medical transportation plane crashed into a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, neighborhood shortly after takeoff, killing six people onboard and another person on the street. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-continue-search-for-plane-missing-in-alaska/7967278.html	2025-02-07T15:33:35-08:00	
US judge to temporarily block Trump from taking some steps to dismantle USAID	WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Friday said he would enter a 'limited' order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from taking some steps to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, adding that 2,200 employees from the agency would not immediately be placed on administrative leave. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington, who was nominated by Trump during his first term, announced the decision at a hearing on a lawsuit from the largest U.S. government workers' union and an association of foreign service workers, who sued to stop the administration from dismantling the agency. Nichols said the written ruling would be issued later Friday. The administration in a notice sent to the foreign aid agency's workers on Thursday said it would keep 611 essential workers on board at USAID out of a worldwide workforce that totals more than 10,000. 'The major reduction in force, as well as the closure of offices, the forced relocation of these individuals were all done in excess of the executive’s authority in violation of the separation of powers,' Karla Gilbride, a lawyer for the unions, said at the hearing. A Justice Department official, Brett Shumate, told Nichols that about 2,200 USAID employees would be put on paid leave under the administration's plans, adding that 500 had already been placed on leave. 'The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID,' Shumate said. However, the judge said his order would prevent those 2,200 employees from being immediately placed on administrative leave and would also pause the relocation of certain humanitarian workers stationed outside the United States. Hours after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Trump ordered all U.S. foreign aid be paused to ensure it was aligned with his 'America First' policy. Chaos has since consumed USAID, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world. The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after the executive order was issued, effectively freezing all foreign aid with the exception of emergency food assistance. That brought USAID programs covering lifesaving aid around the globe to a grinding halt, in a move that experts warned risked killing people. The gutting of the agency has largely been overseen by businessman Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close Trump ally spearheading the president's effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy. In fiscal 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. The U.S. provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024, yet that represents less than 1% of its total budget.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-to-temporarily-block-trump-from-taking-some-steps-to-dismantle-usaid/7967290.html	2025-02-07T15:24:14-08:00

Trump pauses repeal of tariff on packages as they pile up at US customs	WASHINGTON/LONDON/LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change sparked chaos for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers. The cancellation of de minimis means low-value e-commerce packages arriving in the United States with goods from China must use the 'formal entry' process that requires additional information and duties before entering the country — a more time-consuming process. The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages — even those that had paid duties — at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport. 'Well, that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce,' said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors. The change, implemented with just 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China and Hong Kong earlier this week. Popular online retailers, including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service, fly packages direct from Chinese factories to U.S. shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low. Those retailers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published today, a White House spokesperson said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has the job of screening e-commerce packages and collecting duties on them, on Thursday held a meeting with logistics professionals to discuss the status of more than 1 million packages piling up at JFK Airport, according to a source familiar with the meeting. One logistics executive on Friday told Reuters that customs had begun releasing packages it was holding at JFK, which has been taking in about 60 million de minimis e-commerce packages annually. Trump scrapped the duty-free treatment for Chinese goods with the stated aim of stopping the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals into the United States. White House officials have said Canada and Mexico are conduits for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents. While fentanyl traffickers have exploited a U.S. trade law, public data shows 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the U.S. comes from the Canadian border, while the vast majority originates from the southern border. Many shipping experts and attorneys warned that switch would overwhelm customs inspections because the agency does not have systems and processes in place. Its staff are also stretched thin because they fall under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which also is responsible for border security. Companies like Shein and Temu had halted some air cargo flights, invoking force majeure to cancel agreements without penalties, said Kathy Liu, Director of Global sales and marketing, Asia-focused freight forwarder Dimerco. U.S. shoppers also got hit with bills for duties on purchases of dresses, tops and baby clothing that previously were exempt. It is not immediately clear whether those consumers would be eligible for refunds for any duties paid. 'We're navigating these significant changes to U.S. trade policy as they come, as best we can on behalf of our clients,' said Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer for SEKO Logistics, which moves e-commerce packages targeted with new duties. Delivery firms UPS, FedEx and DHL also handle those packages. Their representatives did not immediately comment on the Trump administration's pause on duty collection.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pauses-repeal-of-tariff-on-packages-as-they-pile-up-at-us-customs-/7967176.html	2025-02-07T14:19:33-08:00

Trump updates Iran peace deal effort to reflect new realities, analysts say	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace overtures toward Iran this week — made as he signed a directive to put the country under 'maximum pressure' for malign behavior — signal a revived policy that some analysts say has evolved from his first term as he adapts to Iran’s new circumstances. Trump made his overture in a Wednesday post on his Truth Social platform, saying he seeks a 'Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper' in return for ensuring that the Islamic Republic 'cannot have a Nuclear Weapon.' A day earlier, Trump also told a news conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 'I would love to be able to make a great deal [with Iran], a deal where you can get on with your lives, and you'll do wonderfully.' In 2020, during Trump’s first term, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and then a senior adviser, made a similar, if more muted, appeal to Iran's then-President Hassan Rouhani, in an interview with VOA. 'For President Rouhani, I would say it’s time for the region to move forward. Let’s stop being stuck in conflicts of the past. It’s time for people to get together and to make peace,' he said. At the time, Trump said a key goal of his original 'maximum pressure' campaign was to negotiate a new bilateral agreement to end Iran’s perceived malign behaviors that he said were not sufficiently addressed by Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Trump withdrew the United States from that deal in 2018 and started the pressure policy. Trump revived his 'maximum pressure' policy by signing a presidential memorandum Tuesday, directing a series of economic and legal measures to counter Iranian activities that threaten U.S. national interests. The document highlighted Iran’s development of nuclear weapons-related capabilities, ballistic missiles and its regional aggression through support of proxy forces. ‘Higher ambitions and more tools for pressure’ The new Iran policy is 'qualitatively different' from what Trump pursued in his first term, Brian Katulis, a senior fellow of the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told VOA. 'It has higher ambitions and more tools for pressure,' he said. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump's new policy Friday, saying Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal shows that negotiating with the U.S. 'is neither rational, nor intelligent, nor honorable, and [we] should not engage in negotiations with it.' Iranian state media said Khamenei made the comment while speaking to a gathering of air force personnel. They also quoted him as issuing the following warning to the U.S.: 'If they threaten us, we will threaten them. If they carry out their threat, we will carry out our threat. And if they disrupt the security of our nation, we will definitely disrupt their security as well.' Iran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said Iran suspended an active nuclear weapons program in 2003, but Israel, a U.S. ally, said in 2018 its agents in Tehran stole documents indicating the Iranian government had covertly continued that program. Trump’s new 'maximum pressure' memorandum includes two specific measures that were prominent features of his first term campaign — seeking to drive Iran’s export of oil, its highest revenue-earner, to zero and calling for a snapback, or return, of international sanctions the U.N. Security Council lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. In the first announcement of new sanctions in Trump’s second term, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, targeted Iran’s oil exports by sanctioning an international network it said facilitates the shipment of 'millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars' to China, Iran’s top oil customer. Trump’s goals of reducing Iranian oil exports to zero and restoring international sanctions on Iran were not fully achieved in his first term. An October 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports reached a low of 0.4 million barrels per day in 2020 'due to the U.S. reimposition of sanctions in November 2018 and the decline in demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic.' Trump’s first administration also unilaterally declared a restoration of international sanctions on Iran in September 2020, but most other U.N. Security Council members rejected the move. They asserted the U.S. had forfeited its right to trigger the return of international sanctions by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal that lifted those sanctions. One provision of Trump’s new Iran memorandum, setting a goal that was not explicitly stated in his first term, is ensuring neither Iraq nor the Gulf countries can be used by Tehran to evade sanctions. Trump’s first administration had tried to stop such evasion by Iran, according to Elliott Abrams, a Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow who served as U.S. special envoy for Iran at the end of Trump’s first term. Responding to a VOA question in a Federalist Society webinar on Thursday, Abrams said, 'There were points at which we said to the Emiratis, ‘Look, Dubai is being used by the Iranians to get around sanctions. Close that down.’' He said the second Trump administration appears to be giving that objective more public attention. Another new feature of Trump's pressure campaign is its order to 'modify or rescind sanctions waivers ... that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief ... related to Iran’s Chabahar port project.' India has been developing a terminal at the Iranian port under a 2016 agreement and secured a waiver from the first Trump administration in 2018 to continue the project to facilitate humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The Biden administration extended the waiver, but when India signed a deal last year to operate the Iranian port for a decade, Biden’s State Department said that 'anyone considering business deals with Iran, they need to be aware of the potential risk that they are opening themselves up to ... sanctions.' 'Enhanced' campaign seen Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, told VOA he expects to see Trump pursue an 'enhanced' maximum pressure campaign that is tailored to the 'changed geopolitical realities of 2025, rather than to 2018.' One of those new realities is a major rebound in Iranian oil exports, primarily due to what Brodsky said was lax Biden administration sanctions enforcement. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s October report, citing data from international energy analytics company Vortexa, said Iran’s oil exports increased to an average of 1.5 million barrels per day in the first eight months of last year. The Biden administration rejected accusations of lax sanctions enforcement made by critics of its Iran policy while it was in office, highlighting its sanctioning of hundreds of entities for Iran-related activities. But Biden’s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in April 2024 that Iran was 'continuing to export some oil' and added, 'there may be more that we could do.' Other new factors Brodsky cited as reasons for Trump to enhance his maximum pressure strategy include Iran’s progress in uranium enrichment during the Biden administration and Tehran’s recent regional losses. In the past year, Israel killed the leaders of Iran’s terror proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon and Gaza, while Islamist rebels in Syria ousted longtime Iran-backed leader Bashar al-Assad from power. But Brodsky said the new maximum pressure memorandum also raises questions about what Trump wants out of a potential new deal with Iran. He noted the document calls for ending the '[Iranian] regime’s nuclear extortion racket' and asked whether this means Trump will demand that Iran stop uranium enrichment, as Trump did in his first term. 'We don't have answers right now,' Brodsky said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-updates-iran-peace-deal-effort-to-reflect-new-realities-analysts-say/7967220.html	2025-02-07T14:08:27-08:00

Live poultry markets ordered shut in New York because of avian flu outbreak	NEW YORK — All live poultry markets in New York City and some of its suburbs were ordered Friday to close for a week after the detection of seven cases of avian flu, which has also hit farms nationwide. Governor Kathy Hochul said that there was no immediate threat to public health and that the temporary closure of bird markets in the city and its Westchester County and Long Island suburbs came out of an abundance of caution. No cases of avian flu have been detected among humans in New York, officials said. The birds infected with the virus were found during routine inspections of live bird markets in the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the virus poses low risk to the general public. The agency said there have been 67 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans in the U.S., with illnesses mild and mostly detected among farmworkers who were exposed to sick poultry or sick dairy cows. The first bird flu death in the U.S. was reported last month in Louisiana, with health officials saying the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. In New York, live bird markets where the virus was detected have to dispose of all poultry in a sanitary manner, according to the state's order. Other bird markets that do not have cases will have to sell off remaining poultry within three days, clean and disinfect their operations, and then remain closed for at least five days and be inspected by state officials before reopening. Ahead of the mandatory disposal order for markets with no cases, employees at La Granja, a halal-certified poultry market in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, raced to sell the remaining inventory: around 200 live chickens of different varieties, along with turkeys, quail, ducks, roosters, pigeons and rabbits. Any remaining animals would be slaughtered and given to employees and longtime customers, according to Jose Fernandez, the owner. 'We're going to lose money, for now,' he said. 'But the law is the law. They know what they're doing.' The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been spreading among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Officials have urged people who come into contact with sick or dead birds to wear respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry. More than 156 million birds nationwide have been affected by the outbreak, many at large farming operations that have had to slaughter their entire flocks. Despite growing attention on the avian flu, New York City's poultry markets appeared to be doing brisk business Friday. Outside the Wallabout Poultry market in Brooklyn, a line of customers took numbers and picked their chickens, which employees snatched from crowded cages, weighing them upside down, before taking them to a back room to be slaughtered. 'I'm not worried about any bird flu,' said Stan Tara, 42, of Brooklyn, as he purchased a large chicken for $22.50. 'It's the same as you buy from the supermarket. A little more expensive, but at least it's fresh.' Some animal rights groups, meanwhile, questioned the purpose of a state order that allowed the markets to continue selling fowl, rather than shutting them down immediately. 'The public is going into markets where no one knows if there are outbreaks of avian flu, then taking home dead birds that may or may not be infected,' said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of NYCLASS, which has long raised alarms about conditions within the city's roughly 70 live animal markets. 'It's ludicrous.' U.S. egg prices are likely to remain high past Easter and well into 2025, largely because of avian flu, according to CoBank, a Denver-based provider of loans and other financial services to the agriculture sector. The highly contagious virus has affected nearly 100 million egg-laying hens in the U.S. since 2022. But CoBank said other factors are also causing supply constraints and driving up prices, such as skyrocketing consumer demand for eggs in recent years. Fast-growing breakfast and brunch chains are also eating up supplies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/live-poultry-markets-ordered-shut-in-new-york-city-because-of-avian-flu-outbreak-/7967127.html	2025-02-07T12:53:51-08:00	
US flu season most intense in at least 15 years	NEW YORK — The U.S. winter virus season is in full force, and by one measure is the most intense in 15 years. One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor's office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. Last week, that number was clearly higher than the peak of any winter flu season since 2009-10, according to data posted Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of course, other viral infections can be mistaken for flu. But COVID-19 appears to be on the decline, according to hospital data and CDC modeling projections. Available data also suggests another respiratory illness, RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, has been fading nationally. The flu has forced schools to shut down in some states. The Godley Independent School District, a 3,200-student system near Fort Worth, Texas, last week closed for three days after 650 students and 60 staff were out Tuesday. Jeff Meador, a district spokesman, said most illnesses there have been flu, plus some strep throat. He called it the worst flu season he could remember. So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 24 million flu illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths — including at least 57 children. Traditionally, flu season peaks around February. Overall, 43 states reported high or very high flu activity last week. Flu was most intense in the South, Southwest and Western states. In Rochester, New York, the flu season has been intense but not necessarily worse than at the peak of other years, said Dr. Elizabeth Murray, a pediatric emergency medicine doctor at the University of Rochester Medical Center. She said there is a lot of flu, but there is also still a lot of RSV and a surprising number of babies with COVID-19. 'All of the respiratory illnesses are around, with a vengeance,' Murray added. The CDC declined to let an Associated Press reporter speak to an agency flu expert about recent trends. The Trump administration ordered a temporary 'pause' on health agency communications and has continued to refuse interview requests that were routinely granted in the past. U.S. health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination. About 44% of adults got flu shots this winter, the same as last winter. But coverage of children is down, at about 45% this winter. It's usually around 50%, according to CDC data. About 23% of U.S. adults were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations as of late January, up from about 20% at the same point in time the year before. COVID-19 vaccination rates for kids were about the same, at around 12%. The government has not yet reported its estimates of how well this season's flu vaccine is working. Testing results from patients indicate that two strains of seasonal flu are causing the most illnesses: type A H1N1 and H3N2. Health officials are closely watching a third strain — H5N1 bird flu — that has sickened tens of millions of animals and is known to have infected 67 people in the U.S. To avoid seasonal viruses, doctors say you should avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-flu-season-most-intense-in-at-least-15-years-/7967118.html	2025-02-07T12:51:57-08:00	
Plane crashes into street in Brazil, killing 2 on board	SAO PAULO — A small aircraft crashed on an avenue in Sao Paulo on Friday morning shortly after taking off from a nearby private airport, killing the pilot and the plane's owner, authorities said. The two were the only people on board. The plane went down in the busy Barra Funda neighborhood on the west side of the city, near its downtown. A piece of the plane hit a bus, injuring one woman inside, while a motorcyclist was struck by another piece of wreckage, the firefighters' statement said. Both were receiving medical care. A later statement said that four more people who were injured were taken to hospitals in the area with minor injuries. Governor Tarcisio de Freitas said on X that the two dead were the pilot, Gustavo Medeiros, and the owner of the aircraft, Marcio Carpena. A CCTV video obtained by the local television network TV Globo showed the moment of the crash. The plane slammed into the avenue a few meters past an intersection, where a line of cars was waiting to move forward. Images on local media showed the plane's fuselage and the bus on fire, with firefighters working to extinguish the blaze. The avenue is home to office buildings, and there is a bus, train and subway station nearby. There was no word as to what caused the plane to lose altitude less than 5 kilometers from the private airport from where it departed a few minutes earlier. It was bound to Porto Alegre in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state. The Brazilian air force said it would investigate the accident as fast as possible. Brazil has had several deadly, small aircraft crashes in recent years, including one last August in Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo that was particularly shocking. Images from that crash showed a passenger plane falling in a flat spin before crashing into the backyard of a home in a gated community, killing all 72 people on board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plane-crashes-into-street-in-brazil-killing-2-on-board/7967031.html	2025-02-07T11:58:15-08:00	
Initially exempted, US intelligence faces ‘fork in the road’	WASHINGTON — A handful of key U.S. intelligence agencies have given most of their employees a chance to walk away, offering them the opportunity to take the deferred resignation option extended to the government’s civilian workforce. Under the initial rollout of the plan, aimed at drastically reducing the size of the U.S. government, military and security employees were exempt, due to the critical nature of their work in protecting the United States. But over the past few days, at least five U.S. intelligence agencies have come forward, telling their workforces that they can choose to take the so-called 'fork in the road' deal, allowing them to get paid until September while no longer working on a daily basis. The list includes the CIA, the country’s premiere spy agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is charged with overseeing all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. The National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office also confirmed to VOA their participation in the downsizing program. A CIA spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the initiative, said it was triggered by the agency’s newly confirmed director, John Ratcliffe, to be more responsive to President Donald Trump’s priorities. 'These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission,' the spokesperson said in a statement. The other intelligence agencies taking part in the deferred resignation program declined to explain why workers initially seen as critical to U.S. national security are now deemed as expendable. Nor did they answer questions about the impact potential resignations could have on their missions. The White House National Security Council referred questions about the decision to make the intelligence agencies eligible for the program and the potential impact to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. OMB has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment. The move, though, has raised concern among some former intelligence officers and experts who fear the potential reductions could hamper the ability of U.S. intelligence agencies to gain information and insights that are vital to the security of the U.S. homeland. Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the impact on the CIA could be significant. 'If many employees take the option, it risks reducing the tremendous expertise the CIA has built up on a variety of areas,' he told VOA. 'It takes years to develop the operational and analytic expertise to be a good intelligence officer, and losing this would be a significant blow to U.S. capabilities during a turbulent time in the world,' Byman said, noting that proposed job cuts at the FBI could boost U.S. adversaries that 'try to exploit U.S. security vulnerabilities and influence U.S. public discourse.' Senior Democratic lawmakers such as Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner have likewise raised concerns — noting even Trump’s hiring freeze exempted national security jobs. Others describe the push to get U.S. intelligence officials to quit as 'crazy.' 'I think that's a great way to send some of our best talent packing,' said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. 'It’s a way to help our adversaries,' Krishnamoorthi told VOA. 'I hope that they reconsider this nutty HR [human resources] move and instead try to attract the best and brightest in the intelligence community because we need them.' But Republican Senator Thom Tillis called such fears 'overblown.' 'Really, if people think that special operators and clandestine operators are suddenly going to take it, they don't understand what’s trying to be happening here,' he told VOA. 'What they're trying to do is probably get less out of the head office and less out of administrative positions, so they can put more into the field.' 'The press is going for the worst-case scenario,' Tillis added. 'Most of these people are at the end of their career anyway, and so you're doing buyouts so that you can bring in new people and right-size.' Other former officials see an upside to the inclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies in the deferred resignation program, casting it as a clear message to U.S. adversaries to beware. 'What this says to a country like Russia or China or others, [is] Trump is a very strong leader,' said former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker. 'This is something that they did not see with President [Joe] Biden, who is a weak leader in their eyes,' Volker told VOA. 'In Trump, they see someone who is willing to go there. He is willing to break crockery. He's willing to escalate. He's willing to do what he wants in order to get his will accomplished. That sends a very strong message to adversaries.' The deferred resignation program’s numerical impact on U.S. intelligence agencies remains unclear. U.S. officials say that so far, 65,000 of the government’s approximately 2 million employees have chosen to accept the offer, although the number of intelligence agency employees is classified. The individual agencies are unlikely to release data. The original deadline for government employees — including at the intelligence agencies — to accept the deferred resignation offer was Thursday, but a court order has delayed that until at least Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/initially-exempted-us-intelligence-faces-fork-in-the-road-/7967024.html	2025-02-07T11:29:30-08:00	
Cyprus jails Syrian man over toddler death on overloaded migrant boat	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — A Cyprus court sentenced a Syrian national to three years in prison after finding him guilty of causing the death by negligence of a 3-year-old girl from dehydration aboard an overloaded migrant boat that was adrift for six days without adequate supplies of food and water. The Attorney General’s Office said Friday the Famagusta criminal court ruled that the 48-year-old captain had failed to ensure the safety of the 60 Syrian migrants aboard the small wooden craft that carried no navigational aids or appropriate communications equipment. According to the facts of the case, the captain had told the passengers at some point in the journey to throw any remaining bottles of water overboard in a bid to remove any indications that the boat had departed from Lebanon. The boat set sail on Jan. 18, 2024, but an engine failure left the vessel adrift for nearly a week in the eastern Mediterranean, where many of the desperate passengers began to drink sea water and their own urine to quench their thirst. Cypriot authorities had airlifted the little girl, who was accompanied by her mother, to a hospital after locating the boat but medical staff couldn’t save her. The number of people arriving in Cyprus as migrants has fallen precipitously over the past three years after the government in the European Union member took a string of get-tough measures. Authorities said the country’s ability to host and accommodate many thousands of new asylum-seekers was overwhelmed. According to the most recent government data, migrant arrivals to ethnically divided Cyprus — mostly through the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north where government authorities can’t exercise jurisdiction — dropped from 17,278 in 2022 to 6,102 in 2024. Equally, asylum applications plummeted from a record 21,565 to 6,769 over the same time while repatriations increased to nearly 11,000 from 7,700. Considering the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria late last year, Cyprus' Deputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said some 40 Syrian nationals on average are requesting to either withdraw their asylum application or to revoke their international protection status. Ioannides said some 755 Syrians have already returned to their homeland. But Cyprus has been taken to task for violating migrants’ human rights at sea. Last October, Europe’s top human rights court ruled that Cyprus breached the right of two Syrian nationals to seek asylum after keeping them, and more than two dozen other people, aboard a boat at sea for two days before sending them back to Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyprus-jails-syrian-man-over-toddler-death-on-overloaded-migrant-boat-/7966971.html	2025-02-07T10:45:49-08:00

Trump hosts Japan’s Ishiba amid early moves that have rattled some allies	WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on Friday, in a visit that Tokyo hopes will reaffirm the U.S.-Japan alliance amid Trump’s early foreign policy moves that have rattled allies and adversaries. Trump and Ishiba are expected to discuss increasing joint military exercises and cooperation on defense equipment and technology, ramping up Japanese investments to the United States, and American energy exports to Japan, a senior Trump administration official said in a briefing to reporters Friday. The official said they also will talk about improving cybersecurity capabilities, bolstering space cooperation and promoting joint business opportunities to develop critical technologies, including AI and semiconductors. Ishiba’s visit comes amid anxiety in Tokyo as Trump has put pressure on some U.S. allies and partners, saying he wants to absorb Canada as a U.S. state, acquire Greenland from Denmark and take control of the Panama Canal. 'We would like to first establish a higher relationship of trust and cooperation between two countries, especially the two leaders,' a senior Japanese government official told reporters during a briefing Thursday. The U.S. president has imposed fresh 10% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico — although the latter two have been at least temporarily delayed. He has warned of possible tariffs against other countries, especially those with whom the U.S. holds a trade deficit, such as Japan. 'We all know that President Trump pays a lot of attention to the deficit as an indication of the economic strength of the relationship. So, I'm sure discussions will happen about that,' the Trump administration official said. Other strains on the U.S.-Japan relationship include former President Joe Biden’s blocking of a $15 billion acquisition bid by Japan’s largest steel producer, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the deal during the final weeks of his term, citing national security concerns. Trump has said he also opposes the deal. The White House has not responded to VOA’s query on Trump’s current position on Nippon Steel. The Japanese prime minister’s office did not respond to VOA’s query on whether the issue will be raised today. Continuity on security front Under then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan became a key player in what the Biden administration called a 'lattice-like strategic architecture' to bolster deterrence against the two main U.S. adversaries in the Pacific: China and North Korea. Biden’s approach connected Tokyo with other allies in trilateral formats and other groupings, including with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, to deter regional threats in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea and Korean Peninsula. Japan is anxious to maintain ties forged in recent years, during which time Tokyo has increased defense spending and intensified joint military exercises with the U.S. and other regional allies. Japan needs a 'multilayered network of security' to defend itself, the senior Japanese official said. The Trump administration will continue to support trilateral efforts and some of the working groups that have come out from under those over the last few years, the Trump official said. 'There may be some adjustments to where the focus is on trilateral cooperation, but I think largely you will see continuity.' Under his first term, Trump and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed on the 'free and open Indo-Pacific' framework to promote peace and prosperity in the region. The two countries also agreed to elevate what’s known as the Quad grouping with India and Australia. The fact that the Trump administration sees those formats as a critical part of its strategy in the Pacific is important, said Jeffrey Hornung, the Japan Lead for the RAND National Security Research Division. A key indicator to watch is whether the leaders will come out with a joint statement on a free and open Indo-Pacific. While it may sound like a diplomatic cliché, it would deliver a strong message to Beijing to not be provocative toward Taiwan, Hornung told VOA. In dealing with the threats from Pyongyang, the Trump official underscored the U.S. is 'committed to the complete denuclearization of North Korea.' Making deals with Japan While maintaining the security alliance, analysts say Trump may use the visit as an opportunity to broker deals that would further his 'America First' agenda, using what he sees as Tokyo’s interests as leverage. 'Part of President Trump's negotiating stance for almost all issues is that we don't really know where he wants to land in the end,' said Kenji Kushida, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'If the promise to allow Nippon Steel to acquire U.S. Steel can be used as bargaining leverage, he may use this to get Japan to pay much more than they're already committed, to help contribute to U.S. military bases and other defense costs,' he told VOA. Ahead of Ishiba’s visit, Nippon Steel said its proposed acquisition is aligned with Trump's goals of a stronger United States. 'From Japan's perspective, they want to position themselves as the staunch ally of U.S. interests in Asia, and so fitting into that set of interests is Nippon Steel's strategy here,' Kushida said. Tokyo is aware of what Trump wants — investments in key industries such as AI and semiconductors, increasing Tokyo’s defense spending and American energy purchase. 'Those are all areas that Japan does have shared interests. They have technology. They have the money to invest in some of these areas, and so they're able to use their leverage in a very strategic manner,' Hornung said. 'At the same time, trying to promote with Trump the things that they're interested in: making sure that U.S. forces remain in Japan, making sure that the U.S. remains committed to the Indo-Pacific.' The best-case scenario for Ishiba is that Trump doesn’t ask beyond what Tokyo already expected, said Kushida. 'Perhaps an increase in the defense sharing burden, mainly buying U.S. military equipment, expansion of U.S. bases, perhaps, and then perhaps some other financial commitments, but nothing that would upset the sort of geopolitical status in East Asia to Japan's disadvantage,' Kushida said. 'Nothing very extreme, or to get mixed in with some of the issues In the Middle East in ways that Japan has been trying to keep out.' The leaders are expected to hold a press conference later Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-hosts-japan-s-ishiba-amid-early-moves-that-have-rattled-some-allies/7966846.html	2025-02-07T09:37:36-08:00	
US to push Russia to end war in Ukraine through sanctions	The U.S. special envoy to Russia and Ukraine said Thursday the U.S. plans to significantly step up pressure on Russia through sanctions to end the war in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the New York Post, Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said there is a lot of room to increase sanctions on Russia, particularly in Russia’s energy sector. He characterized sanctions enforcement on Russia as 'only about a 3' on a scale of 1 to 10 on 'how painful the economic pressure can be.' Kellogg told the Post he understands that both Moscow and Kyiv will have to make concessions to end what he called the 'industrial-sized' killing in the war. In the interview, Kellogg also was critical of the approach by the administration of former President Joe Biden of 'supporting Ukraine as long as it takes,' calling it 'a bumper sticker, not a strategy.' Kellogg said the Trump administration is focused on a 'holistic approach' to ending the war, combining support for Ukraine with increased pressure on Russia. Kellogg’s Chief of Staff Ludovic Hood echoed those sentiments when he told the GLOBSEC Transatlantic Forum in Washington on Thursday, 'Nothing's off the table at this stage' as far as negotiations for a peace deal. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s presidential website reported the U.S. special envoy also spoke Thursday with Ukraine's head of the office of the president, Andriy Yermak. In a statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said the two discussed Kellogg’s upcoming visit to Ukraine, as well as the situation on the front lines and security issues for Ukrainian civilians. The statement said the two gave 'special attention' in their conversation to the upcoming Munich Security Conference, scheduled to begin in one week. In a separate interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, Yermak stressed the importance of 'active engagement' between Ukraine and the Trump administration, particularly as any peace negotiations. Yermak emphasized the importance of keeping the Trump White House up to date and providing accurate information about the battlefield situation. He said direct communication with U.S. partners is crucial for establishing a shared position, because it is impossible to form any peace plans without Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the latest reports from the battlefield, Ukraine’s air force reported Friday – from its Telegram social media account – Russian attacks across multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least three civilians and injured five over the past 24 hours. The report said Ukrainian air defenses shot down 81 of 112 Shahed combat drones and decoy drones Russia launched over nine oblasts, or regions, while 31 other drones were lost without causing damage. From his Telegram account, Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said Russian shelling killed one person and wounded five others, and two high-rise buildings and six private houses were damaged. The regional administration in Sumy Oblast says two people were killed when Russian shelling destroyed a two-story apartment building. The report said the victims’ bodies were found in the rubble as rescue crews cleared the area and there are fears more bodies could be found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-push-russia-to-end-war-in-ukraine-through-sanctions/7966748.html	2025-02-07T08:22:39-08:00

African nations prepare for what's to come after pause on US aid	NAIROBI, KENYA — African governments are gearing up for what is to come following the 90-day pause on most U.S.-funded foreign aid as they worry about the potential effects. In Kenya, for instance, Health Cabinet Secretary Deborah Barasa said Wednesday in Nairobi that as her country navigates complex challenges, ensuring continuation of essential health services, especially with programs related to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, is essential. 'For more than 40 years, we’ve been able to depend on partners. PEPFAR has done a great job in ensuring that HIV patients, TB patients are receiving health services,' she said, referring to the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a program that works with partners in 55 countries worldwide. 'With more than 3.7 million being on HIV medication [in Kenya] … I believe it’s critical for us to think of sustainable solutions ... [and] alternative forms of funding,' Barasa said. While the freeze has been modified to allow waivers for 'life-saving humanitarian assistance,' including 'core life-saving medicine,' which may apply to health programs such as PEPFAR, many countries are working to assess the implications of what may amount to an end of U.S. foreign aid. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the waiver is clear: 'If it saves lives, if it’s emergency lifesaving aid — food, medicine, whatever — they have a waiver. I don’t know how much clearer we can be.' South Africa, with 7.8 million people with HIV, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the PEPFAR program the past two decades. Its health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, told reporters last week in Johannesburg that the country was taken by surprise by the pause in aid and that officials are still trying to decipher the full meaning. This week, Motsoaledi met with U.S. Embassy officials to discuss bilateral health cooperation and the new U.S. policies on assistance. The two sides promised to keep the communications channels open as they discuss lifesaving health partnerships, according to a joint statement after the meeting. Asanda Ngoasheng, a South African political analyst, said countries will be affected one way or the other because many public health systems exist only because of the PEPFAR program. 'Even in the case PEPFAR is not funding 100% of the programs, any money that is removed means that countries simply would not be able to afford programs that they were able to afford with the money that was being supplemented by PEPFAR before,' Ngoasheng said. Programs not related to health are also affected. In Senegal, for example, an infrastructure and development project financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an initiative that was started by Republican U.S. President George W. Bush, could lose funding. The $550 million power project being implemented by Millennium Challenge Account Senegal was designed to improve the country’s transmission network and increase electricity access in rural areas and to those on the outskirts of cities in the south and central regions. Mamadou Thior, a journalist and chair of the media watchdog CORED, told VOA: 'The financing coming from the U.S. for this second phase will impact about 12 million people.' Thior referred to a recent speech by Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko that emphasized the need for countries to work on being self-sufficient. 'It’s high time for Africans and other people to depend on themselves and not from Western aid because this is what can be the drawbacks,' Thior said. 'They will have to depend on national resources to go ahead with the rest of the [electricity] project because there’s no way to go backwards,' he said. In Nigeria, a country that received about $1 billion in U.S. foreign aid last year, officials this week launched a committee with members from finance, health and environmental ministries to develop an alternative for some U.S.-funded programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-nations-prepare-for-what-s-to-come-after-pause-on-us-aid/7966642.html	2025-02-07T07:22:39-08:00

US employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, jobless rate slips to 4% to start the year	Washington — U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate slipped to 4% to start 2025 and the government revised November and December payrolls higher. The first job report of Donald Trump’s second presidency suggested that he inherited a labor market that is solid but unspectacular. Economists had expected about 170,000 new jobs in January. It's a downshift from 2024 which averaged 186,000 new jobs a month, including a surge of 256,000 in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low at 4.1%. The future is cloudier. A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's plan to push out federal workers by offering them financial incentives, yet a federal hiring freeze that Trump imposed January 20 is a 'negative for employment growth,’’ Bradley Saunders, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a commentary last week. The freeze came after the Labor Department collected the January jobs numbers, so any impact would be revealed in upcoming employment data. Likewise, a cold snap that probably increased seasonal layoffs in the Midwest and Northeast occurred late in January and won’t register in government jobs data until the February numbers come out, Saunders wrote. Economists are also worried about Trump’s threat to wage a trade war against other countries. He’s already imposed a 10% tax on imports from China. Canada and Mexico — America’s two largest trading partners — remain in his crosshairs, although he gave them a 30-day reprieve from the 25% tariffs he was planning to sock them with on Tuesday, allowing time for negotiations. Trump says that America’s two neighbors and allies haven’t done enough to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States. Trump is also ready to slap tariffs on the European Union; pointing to America’s deficit in the trade of goods with the EU, which came to $236 billion last year, he says that Europe treats U.S. exporters unfairly. The tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers who generally try to pass along the cost to customers, could rekindle inflation – which has fallen from the four-decade high it reached in mid-2022 but is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. If the tariffs push prices higher, the Fed may cancel or postpone the two interest-rate cuts it had forecast for this year. And that would be bad for economic growth and job creation. The job market already has cooled from the red-hot days of 2021-2023. American payrolls increased by 2.2 million last year, down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The Labor Department also reports that employers are posting fewer jobs. Monthly job openings have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in December – still a decent number by historical standards. As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs. The number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million near the height of the hiring boom in April 2022, to December’s 3.2 million, which is below pre-pandemic levels. Still, layoffs remain below pre-pandemic levels, creating an unusual situation: If you are employed, you probably enjoy job security. If you’re looking for one, things have gotten tougher. The Labor Department also is expected to report annually released revisions Friday that will show job creation from April 2023 through March 2024 wasn’t as strong as originally reported. A preliminary version of the revisions, released in August, showed that 818,000 fewer jobs were created over those 12 months – lowering average monthly hiring during that span from 242,000 to 174,000. Because they are not final, the August estimates have not yet been added to the official government payroll numbers. The revisions out Friday will become official and part of the historic data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-employers-added-just-143-000-jobs-last-month-jobless-rate-slips-to-4-to-start-the-year-/7966610.html	2025-02-07T06:46:16-08:00	
Iran's supreme leader criticizes proposed nuclear talks with US	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran's supreme leader said Friday that negotiations with America 'are not intelligent, wise or honorable' after U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of nuclear talks with Tehran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also suggested that 'there should be no negotiations with such a government' but stopped short of issuing a direct order not to engage with Washington. Khamenei's remarks upend months of signals from Tehran to the United States that it wanted to negotiate over its rapidly advancing nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of crushing economic sanctions worth billions of dollars. What happens next remains unclear, particularly as reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian promised as recently as Thursday to enter a dialogue with the West. Khamenei’s remarks to air force officers in Tehran appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks in August that opened the door to talks. However, the 85-year-old Khamenei has always been careful with remarks about negotiating with the West. That includes balancing the demands of reformists within the country who want the talks against hard-line elements within Iran’s theocracy, including the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei noted that Trump unilaterally withdrew from the earlier nuclear deal under which Iran drastically limited its enrichment of uranium and overall stockpile of the material, in exchange for crushing sanctions being removed. 'The Americans did not uphold their end of the deal,' Khamenei said. 'The very person who is in office today tore up the agreement. He said he would, and he did.' He added: 'This is an experience we must learn from. We negotiated, we gave concessions, we compromised — but we did not achieve the results we aimed for. And despite all its flaws, the other side ultimately violated and destroyed the agreement.' Mixed messages from Trump It's not clear what sparked Khamenei's remarks. However, they come after Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran, even while signing an executive order to reimpose his 'maximum pressure' approach to Iran on Tuesday. 'I’m going to sign it, but hopefully we’re not going to have to use it very much,' he said from the Oval Office. 'We will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran. 'We don’t want to be tough on Iran. We don’t want to be tough on anybody,' Trump said. 'But they just can’t have a nuclear bomb.' Trump followed with another online message on Wednesday, saying: 'Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper,' he wrote on Truth Social. 'We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed.' He did not elaborate. Nuclear enrichment Khamenei, like other Iranian leaders, uses elliptical comments to indirectly govern policy while not boxing himself into any one decision. As supreme leader, he's also created a vast bureaucracy that competes with itself for influence, including with its civilian leadership under Pezeshkian. As recently as Thursday, Pezeshkian suggested Iran could open itself up to even more inspections from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 'They [can] come and inspect one hundred times more since we are not supposed to go after' a nuclear weapon, Pezeshkian told foreign diplomats. Iranian diplomats have long pointed to Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won't build an atomic bomb. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, it now enriches uranium to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian officials increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program but has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.' Gaza and oil sanctions Earlier in the week, Trump also said that displaced Palestinians in Gaza could be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take 'ownership' in redeveloping the area into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Khamenei appeared to reference Trump's Gaza proposal in his remarks. 'The Americans sit, redrawing the map of the world — but only on paper, as it has no basis in reality,' Khamenei said. 'They make statements about us, express opinions and issue threats. If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they act on their threats, we will act on ours. If they violate the security of our nation, we will, without a doubt, respond in kind.' Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry separately criticized the U.S. Treasury's move to levy sanctions Thursday against firms trading sanctioned Iranian crude oil to China. The Treasury described the firms as forming an 'international network for facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars.' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei called the Treasury's decision 'completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-supreme-leader-criticizes-proposed-nuclear-talks-with-us/7966585.html	2025-02-07T06:21:05-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: USAID freeze threatens security of Syria's al-Hol camp	The USAID freeze has had a direct impact on the al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, where 90% of the funding for organizations working in the camp depends on USAID. The camp administrator said that if aid is cut and no solution is found, the camp will get out of control, which would threaten the security of the region as a whole.

Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to detain migrants at Guantanamo	The Trump administration's expansion of migrant detention facilities, notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts. President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to curb legal migration and deport those in the U.S. without legal status. Late last month, he instructed his administration to prepare the facility for the detention of up to 30,000 'high-priority' unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. The first group arrived on Tuesday. Described as the 'the worst of the worst' by administration officials, the detainees were identified by the Department of Homeland Security as part of the transnational criminal organization 'Tren de Aragua,' which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization on January 20. VOA sent numerous requests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding what crimes the migrants committed. ICE directed VOA to contact the Department of Homeland Security, which has not responded to emails. Miriam Pensack, a historian who studies Latin America and the Caribbean and is a postgraduate scholar at Princeton University, said the U.S. government has been using Guantanamo Bay to hold migrants on and off for 30 years. 'There is an ICE office in Guantanamo. ... But obviously what we’re seeing now is a huge expansion of that capacity,' she said. Trump’s decision to use the naval base as a migrant detention center follows his signing of the Laken Riley Act, which mandates detention for those accused of theft or violent crimes while in the country unlawfully. Supporters say that using Guantanamo will alleviate pressure on overcrowded detention facilities and serve as a stronger deterrent against illegal crossings to the United States. Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described Guantanamo as the 'perfect place' to detain migrants as he visited the border with Mexico. The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets 'to support the expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally,' he told Agence France-Presse. Guantanamo and migrant detention The U.S. first used Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, mostly Haitian and Cuban asylum-seekers under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. Following a military coup in Haiti in 1991, thousands fled by boat to the U.S. but were intercepted at sea and taken to Guantanamo. In 1994, Guantanamo became the site of the world’s first and only prison camp for people with HIV, where more than 300 Haitian refugees, including children, were confined behind razor wire. 'These were refugees fleeing slaughter in their country, whose credible fear of persecution the U.S. officials who screened them acknowledged, who were held for no reason other than their HIV status. When these people protest detention, the response was brutal,' said Pardiss Kebriaei, senior staff attorney at the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights, to reporters during a press call last Thursday. Legal challenges eventually forced the U.S. government to release the detainees, setting a precedent that indefinite offshore detention without due process is legally dubious. In 2002, the George W. Bush administration built a detention camp in Guantanamo Bay to hold terror suspects following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. But Guantanamo’s use for migrant detention continued with at least two presidents, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, using the base. The Biden administration sought to close Guantanamo, but Congress never passed the legislation, leaving the base operational for future use. 'The idea of closing Guantanamo as a prison is one thing; closing Guantanamo as a 45-square-mile base held in Cuba is another,' Pensack said. Legal and human rights concerns Advocates warn that offshore detention facilities allow the U.S. to sidestep domestic constitutional protections and limit oversight. Eunice Cho, attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project, told reporters during the press call last Thursday that 'detaining immigrants on military bases in the United States and Guantanamo would subject people to dangerous conditions ... and attempt to avoid scrutiny by lawyers, the press, and congressional oversight.' Historically, legal challenges have helped curb indefinite detentions at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004) established that Guantanamo detainees have the right to challenge their detention in U.S. courts. However, the Trump administration could attempt to argue that civil immigration detainees fall outside this precedent. While prior administrations may have seen Guantanamo as a law-free zone, 'That is not the case today,' said Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights, adding that migrants at Guantanamo now 'have due process rights under the Constitution.' '[Meanwhile], people would be detained. … and [litigation] would go on and people would suffer during that time,' she said. In the meantime, the Trump' administration border czar Tom Homan told reporters outside the White House on Thursday that 'President Trump made a commitment that the worst of the worst will go to Gitmo.' Broader immigration, policy implications The Guantanamo facility has historically been used in moments of crisis, from Cuban and Haitian exoduses to post-9/11 military detention. The Trump administration’s decision to include Guantanamo in its mass detention strategy signals a shift toward increasingly punitive measures, according to some analysts. Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch Network, emphasized the link between detention expansion and deportations. 'Detention plays a crucial role in deportation. … More detention means more people would be deported,' she said. The Department of Homeland Security has yet to clarify whether the latest White House policy includes detention of migrants without criminal records or whether they would have access to asylum proceedings or be expelled outright. Homan said the U.S. has had a migrant processing at 'Gitmo for decades. So, we’re increasing our footprint there.' Legal response The administration's decision has sparked backlash from advocacy groups, legal experts, and members of Congress, many of whom are calling for oversight hearings and possibly legal action. Cho of the ACLU urged vigilance, saying there is a need for 'a robust response from both the press, from government oversight agencies, Congress, advocacy organizations, and the community.' With Guantanamo’s history of controversial and legally ambiguous detentions, experts predict judicial and political battles over its use for immigration enforcement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/historical-precedent-legal-questions-swirl-around-trump-plan-to-detain-migrants-at-guantanamo-/7966534.html	2025-02-07T05:47:04-08:00	
Israel orders army to plan to let Palestinians leave Gaza	Israel’s defense minister has ordered the Israel Defense Forces to devise a plan for Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for how the devastated territory would be administered. 'I have instructed the IDF to prepare a plan to enable voluntary departure for Gaza residents,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday, adding they could go 'to any country willing to accept them.' Katz said the plan 'will include options for exit and land crossings as well as special arrangement for exit by sea and air.' Katz welcomed what he characterized as Trump's 'bold plan' for Gaza residents to leave the territory, which has been devastated by Israeli ground and air attacks targeting Hamas militants. Trump on Thursday said Israel should turn the Gaza Strip over to the United States after the war with Hamas ends and that no U.S. soldiers would be needed there. Trump, who has called for U.S. ownership of the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea, issued the statement on Truth Social. Under his plan, he said, more than 2 million Palestinians 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region.' Trump did not say whether he meant in Gaza or in other countries that as of yet have not agreed to accept them. 'They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free,' he wrote. Meanwhile, Hamas on Thursday called on all Palestinian factions to unite against Trump's proposed Gaza takeover. Trump earlier this week said he could envision sending U.S. troops to Gaza to ease the American takeover but said in his new posting that with the Israeli handover of the land, 'No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!' Trump's surprise Gaza takeover plan, announced earlier this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House news conference, has been widely assailed by U.S. allies and adversaries alike, many of which remain committed to creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The two-state solution had been a long-held U.S. stance but one that Netanyahu opposes. Gaza has been decimated by the more than 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. But in his new comments, Trump said, 'The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth.' On Tuesday, Trump said a newly redeveloped Gaza would become the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio doubled down on Trump's plan on Thursday, saying that Gaza is 'not habitable' due to unexploded weapons and other dangers, and that people would have to live elsewhere while the region is rebuilt. Guterres: Don't make problem worse Trump's proposal has met widespread criticism, including from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 'In the search for solutions, we must not make the problem worse' by moving Palestinians out of Gaza, Guterres said. 'It is vital to stay true to the bedrock of international law. It is essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing.' Forcibly transferring populations is strictly prohibited under international law and can constitute ethnic cleansing. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Wednesday that Trump's proposals 'generate deep concern in some people, even horror' and would be 'unacceptable under international law.' The 22-member Arab League said Trump's plan 'represents a recipe for instability' and would not advance the prospects of Palestinian statehood. 'They must be allowed home,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Wednesday. 'They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild, on the way to a two-state solution.' Following Trump's Gaza ownership suggestion, Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Spain all said that they continue to support a two-state solution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Fighting in Gaza has halted, other than occasional outbursts, amid a planned six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Hamas sparked the war with the shock October 2023 attack on Israel, during which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 people, more than half women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 60 living captives. During the first phase of the ceasefire, the militants released 18 hostages, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. More people are due to be set free in the coming weeks, and negotiators are working on the details of a planned second phase of the ceasefire that would bring an end to the conflict, free the remaining hostages and see Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-orders-army-to-plan-to-let-palestinians-leave-gaza/7966390.html	2025-02-07T03:06:18-08:00	
Trump administration plans to slash all but a fraction of USAID jobs, officials say	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration presented a plan Thursday to dramatically cut staffing worldwide for U.S. aid projects as part of its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving fewer than 300 workers out of thousands. Late Thursday, federal workers associations filed suit asking a federal court to stop the shutdown, arguing that President Donald Trump lacks the authority to shut down an agency enshrined in congressional legislation. Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told The Associated Press of the administration's plan, presented to remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity due to a Trump administration order barring USAID staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency. The plan would leave fewer than 300 staffers on the job out of what are currently 8,000 direct hires and contractors. They, along with an unknown number of 5,000 locally hired international staffers abroad, would run the few life-saving programs that the administration says it intends to keep going for the time being. It was not immediately clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what the Trump administration says is a review of which aid and development programs it wants to resume. The administration earlier this week gave almost all USAID staffers posted overseas 30 days, starting Friday, to return to the U.S., with the government paying for their travel and moving costs. Workers who choose to stay longer, unless they received a specific hardship waiver, might have to cover their own expenses, a notice on the USAID website said late Thursday. Speaking to reporters Monday in El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the agency as historically 'unresponsive' to Congress and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to take its direction from the State Department. 'USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,' Rubio said. 'These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest.' Speaking in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Rubio said the U.S. government will continue providing foreign aid. 'But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest,' he told reporters. The Trump administration and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who is running a budget-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have targeted USAID hardest so far in an unprecedented challenge of the federal government and many of its programs. Since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, a sweeping funding freeze has shut down most of the agency’s programs worldwide, and almost all of its workers have been placed on administrative leave or furloughed. Musk and Trump have spoken of eliminating USAID as an independent agency and moving surviving programs under the State Department. Democratic lawmakers and others call the move illegal without congressional approval. The same argument was made by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees in their lawsuit, which asks the federal court in Washington to compel the reopening of USAID’s buildings, return its staffers to work and restore funding. Government officials 'failed to acknowledge the catastrophic consequences of their actions, both as they pertain to American workers, the lives of millions around the world, and to U.S. national interests,' the suit says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-plans-to-slash-all-but-a-fraction-of-usaid-jobs-officials-say/7966325.html	2025-02-07T01:33:49-08:00

Trump to create religious office in White House, target 'anti-Christian bias'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would create a White House faith office and direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead a task force on eradicating what he called anti-Christian bias within the federal government. Trump delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast at the U.S. Capitol and used his speech to call for unity, telling lawmakers his relationship with religion has changed since a pair of failed assassination attempts last year. At a second prayer breakfast in Washington, Trump struck a more partisan tone, took a victory lap for getting 'rid of woke over the last two weeks' and announced steps to protect Christians from what he said was religious discrimination. 'The mission of this task force will be to immediately halt all forms of anti-Christian targeting and discrimination within the federal government, including at the DOJ, which was absolutely terrible, the IRS, the FBI and other agencies,' Trump said. He vowed his attorney general would work to 'fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide.' The president did not cite specific examples of anti-Christian bias during his remarks but has previously claimed that the Biden administration used the federal government to target Christians specifically. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish the task force and its responsibilities, which include recommending steps to terminate 'violative policies, practices, or conduct.' Biden's administration announced a strategy in December for countering anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bigotry, and a similar plan to fight antisemitism in September 2023. The actions announced on Thursday could pose constitutional questions about the separation of church and state, with the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment limiting government endorsement of religion. In the last three election cycles, white evangelical Christian voters, who make up a critical piece of the Republican base, have supported Trump. He has embraced the conservative Christian world view and policies that speak to the bloc's anxiety about changing gender norms and family patterns. The president on Thursday also announced he will create a White House Faith Office, led by the Rev. Paula White, who has served as a religious adviser to him for many years. Trump established a similar office at the White House during his first term and regularly consulted with a tight group of evangelical advisers. Trump also said he would create a new commission on religious liberty, and he criticized the Biden administration for the 'persecution' of believers for prosecuting anti-abortion advocates. In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two events, the one on Capitol Hill attended by lawmakers and a separate private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom after some lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group following questions over how it was run and funded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-create-religious-office-in-white-house-target-anti-christian-bias-/7966209.html	2025-02-06T22:21:21-08:00	
Trump imposes sanctions on International Criminal Court	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on International Criminal Court investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies such as Israel, repeating action he took during his first term. The move coincides with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who -- along with his former defense minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas -- is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip. It was unclear how quickly the U.S. would announce names of people sanctioned. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides over the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan. The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sanctions include freezing any U.S. assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States. The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members. Trump signed the executive order after U.S. Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. The court has taken measures to shield staff from possible U.S. sanctions, paying salaries three months in advance, as it braced for financial restrictions that could cripple the war crimes tribunal, sources told Reuters last month. In December, the court's president, judge Tomoko Akane, warned that sanctions would 'rapidly undermine the Court's operations in all situations and cases, and jeopardize its very existence.' Russia has also taken aim at the court. In 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia has banned entry to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan and placed him and two ICC judges on its wanted list.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-imposes-sanctions-on-international-criminal-court/7966207.html	2025-02-06T22:06:51-08:00	
US Senate confirms Trump budget director pick Vought	WASHINGTON — The Republican-led U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's nominee Russell Vought as budget director on Thursday, placing the reins of government funding in the hands of a hard-line conservative who has advocated for reducing Congress's power over taxpayer dollars. The Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Vought after a marathon overnight session during which Democrats denounced him as a dangerous far-right ideologue and blasted Republicans for rubber-stamping Trump's nomination. Vought, who also headed the Office of Management and Budget during Trump's first presidential term, raised concerns among members of both parties by criticizing a 1974 law preventing presidents from unilaterally blocking congressionally approved funding, a practice known as 'impoundment.' In his two confirmation hearings, Vought repeatedly said he believed a 1974 law was unconstitutional, a position that even the Republican committee chairmen said they did not fully support. Last week, the White House Budget Office issued a memo freezing hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and loans. The White House said the freeze was necessary to ensure aid programs were aligned with Trump's priorities including his executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The White House rescinded the memo and a federal judge temporarily blocked the freeze, but not before the action raised widespread fears about the future critical government-funded services and concerns that Trump could take unilateral action against other government funding. Democrats sought to link Vought's role in the hard-right Project 2025 policy initiative to a range of administration actions, including the Trump administration's unilateral actions to essentially shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and fire prosecutors at the Justice Department. 'Whether it's with federal workers, whether it's at USAID, whether it's hurting Justice Department prosecutors, all of that is Russell Vought at work,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on a floor speech. 'He's working to hurt you, Mr. and Mrs. America.' Republicans championed Vought’s experience as budget director and the role they expect him to play in cutting wasteful government spending. 'Identifying ways to rein in our spending – and to target government waste – has to be a priority. And I’m confident that Mr. Vought will help lead that charge,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said this week. 'There is no question that he will be able to hit the ground running.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-confirms-trump-budget-director-pick-vought/7966203.html	2025-02-06T21:54:38-08:00	
Zelenskyy marks 6-month anniversary of Ukraine’s Kursk operation	Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid tribute to the country’s 'warriors' in the Kursk operation in an address Thursday marking the six-month anniversary of the operation in Russia. 'With our active operation on Russian territory, we have brought the war home to Russia, and it is there that they must feel what war is. And they do,' Zelenskyy said in his daily address. He said Ukrainian soldiers have shown that, even with limited resources, Ukraine can 'act decisively, unexpectedly, and effectively.' 'We are exposing Russia’s bluff for what it is – a bluff,' he said. In its description of the operation, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research and advocacy organization, cited the ability of a small group of Ukrainian troops in Kursk oblast to complicate Russian efforts to advance in Ukraine and undermine the Russian military to launch or renew offensive operations in what it called 'low-priority areas of the front line.' 'The war in Ukraine, in other words, is not permanently stalemated. Either side can potentially restore, maneuver and begin to gain or regain significant territory. Russia will be able to do so if the West reduces or cuts off aid. Ukraine may be able to do so if Western support continues to empower Ukrainian innovation,' the Institute said in a Thursday news release. Ukrainian officials reported damage Thursday at a market in the northeastern city of Kharkiv after the latest round of overnight Russian drone attacks targeting multiple parts of the country. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram that debris from a downed drone damaged power lines in the city. Ukraine’s military said its air defenses shot down 56 of the 77 total drones deployed by Russian forces. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, according to the military. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian drone attacks and shelling damaged more than 10 houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 28 Ukrainian drones overnight. About half of the drones were shot down over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said, while Russian forces destroyed the others of the Rostov, Krasnodar and Astrakhan regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone struck a car in the village of Logachyovka, killing three people.

200 Kenyan police officers arrive at UN mission in Haiti	Two hundred Kenyan police officers arrived in Haiti on Thursday to join the United Nations-backed mission to fight gangs in the crisis-plagued Caribbean country. More than 600 Kenyan officers had already been stationed in Haiti as part of a multinational force of police officers and soldiers from other countries — including Jamaica, Guatemala and El Salvador — who assist Haiti’s police in fighting the violent gangs in control of much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. 'The Haitian National Police are outnumbered and outgunned by the gangs,' William O'Neill, a U.N. expert on Haiti, told The Associated Press on Thursday. The U.N. mission plays a critical role in establishing security in Haiti, he said. The arrival of the newly deployed police officers from Kenya was cast into doubt earlier this week, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a freeze on U.S. foreign aid that included $13.3 million slated for the U.N. mission in Haiti. The U.S. State Department, however, announced it has approved waivers for $40.7 million in foreign aid for the Haitian mission and the police. The State Department also said it recently delivered 'much-needed heavy armored equipment' to the mission and the police. Godfrey Otunge, the U.N.’s mission's force commander in Haiti, said in a statement Wednesday that the frozen funds make up under 3% of ongoing assistance to the mission. Both the state and the defense departments 'remain actively engaged' in the mission, Otunge said. 'I want to assure everyone, especially the people of Haiti, that the mission remains on track,' the force commander said. According to Otunge, the U.S. and other partner countries are continuing to contribute logistical, financial, and equipment support to the Haitian mission. 'Steady and predictable funding for the [mission] requires all states to contribute, especially those in the region,' O'Neill, the U.N. expert on Haiti, said. 'More stability in Haiti will reduce the pressure to migrate, which is in everyone's interest.' The Kenyan-led U.N. mission faces a daunting task in a country that has never fully recovered from a devastating earthquake in 2010 and is now without a president or parliament. Haiti is ruled by a transitional body that faces enormous challenges, including gangs and extreme violence and poverty. Almost 6,000 people were killed in gang violence in the country last year. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Kenyan President William Ruto Thursday and thanked him for the country’s leadership of the mission in Haiti. Last year, nearly 1 million people in Haiti fled their homes due to gang violence, a figure that French news agency Agence France-Presse reports as three times higher than the previous year. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press and Agence France Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-police-officers-arrive-at-un-mission-in-haiti/7966157.html	2025-02-06T18:38:37-08:00

Confusion' in South Africa over US HIV funding	JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Some South African organizations that assist people with HIV are in limbo, after the United States put a 90-day freeze on most foreign aid. The U.S. State Department later added a waiver for 'lifesaving' aid, but NGOs that have already shut their doors say the next steps aren't clear, and they are worried this could set back years of progress. South Africa has the highest number of HIV-positive people in the world — about 8 million — but has also been a huge success story in terms of treatment and preventing new infections. That's largely due to the money poured into expert HIV care here, 17% of which comes from a U.S. program called the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR. But, a 90-day foreign aid funding freeze is in effect, following an executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump last month to check if U.S.-funded programs overseas are aligned with U.S. policies. This has caused some confusion in South Africa with health care organizations and their patients. Thamsanqa Siyo, an HIV-positive transgender woman in South Africa, is anxious. 'People are frustrated, they're living in fear, they don't know what's going to happen,' said Siyo. 'They don't know if it's stopped temporarily or not temporarily.' The Cape Town clinic that Siyo used to go to has now been closed for two weeks. While the State Department has issued a waiver to continue paying for 'lifesaving' services, what that includes remains unclear to many South African organizations that receive funding from PEPFAR. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that the waiver was clear. 'If it saves lives, if it's emergency lifesaving aid — food, medicine, whatever — they have a waiver,' said Rubio. 'I don't know how much clearer we can be.' The State Department also issued written clarification and guidance on February 1 regarding which activities are and are not covered by the waiver for PEPFAR programs. The South African government said it was blindsided by the U.S. aid freeze, according to Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, who convened a meeting about PEPFAR on Wednesday. Motsoaledi also said he has sought clarity on the waiver. 'If you say American money cannot be used for LGBTQWI+ and we do the counseling and testing and somebody who falls within that category, transgender, tests positive, can they not be helped?' he asked. 'Even if it's lifesaving?' Linda-Gail Bekker is a doctor and scientist who heads the Desmond Tutu HIV Center in South Africa. 'This is not one homogenous picture,' said Bekker. 'In some places, it's parts of services that have been stopped. In other places, the whole clinic, if it was supplied by PEPFAR, has been closed down.' She also said that some transgender health services have been completely closed, and in other areas, counselors haven't been able to come in. In addition, she said some services and drugs are no longer available, such as community-based testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis, a medicine that prevents people at high risk from contracting HIV. Ling Sheperd, who works for Triangle Project, an nongovernmental organization that provides services for the queer community, said there's a risk of 'undoing decades of progress.' 'The impact is devastating,' said Sheperd. 'The PEPFAR funding has been a lifeline for millions and it ensures access to HIV treatment, prevention services, and of course community-based health care. And without it we are seeing interruptions in medication supply, clinics are scaling back services, and community health workers have literally been losing their livelihoods.' About 5.5 million South Africans are on anti-retroviral medication for HIV. Motsoaledi noted that most of that is funded by the government here. However, he said, a PEPFAR shortfall will affect training, facilities and service delivery. The government said it is working on contingency plans that would reduce dependence on foreign aid in the HIV sector. On Wednesday, a group of health organizations sent a letter to the South African government saying at least 900,000 patients with HIV were directly affected by the U.S. stop-work orders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/confusion-in-south-africa-over-us-hiv-funding/7966133.html	2025-02-06T17:44:15-08:00	
Gunfight kills Pakistani soldier, 12 militants near Afghan border	islamabad — Pakistan reported Thursday that one soldier and 12 insurgents were killed in intense predawn clashes in a volatile northwestern district bordering Afghanistan. A military statement said the deadly shootout in North Waziristan occurred after security forces conducted an 'intelligence-based' raid against a 'khawarij' hideout, a term officially used to describe militants affiliated with the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. Insurgent attacks targeting security forces and government functionaries occur nearly daily in several districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, including the Waziristan region. The violence has killed hundreds of people in recent months, with TTP claiming responsibility for most of the attacks. Pakistan maintains that the TTP, recognized as a global terrorist group by the United Nations, conducts attacks from its sanctuaries in Afghanistan, allegedly with the backing of the Taliban authorities in that country. 'We have been emphasizing to Kabul authorities to address the question of sanctuaries on the Afghan territory,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Khan told a weekly news conference in Islamabad earlier Thursday. The violence caused by the TTP is a 'core problem' that is straining relations between the two countries, he said. Khan also confirmed that Islamabad had returned to Kabul on Wednesday the remains of an Afghan combatant killed in a counterterrorism operation against TTP in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa earlier this week. The slain man was identified as the son of the deputy Taliban governor of Badghis, a northwestern province of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, China joined Pakistan in renewing a call Thursday for the Taliban to uphold their counterterrorism pledges and prevent militants from using Afghan territory as a sanctuary. The statement was part of a joint declaration issued after a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Pakistani counterpart, Asif Ali Zardari, in Beijing. 'They called on the [Taliban] government to take visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security,' the statement said. Taliban officials did not immediately respond to the allegations. They have previously denied the presence of foreign militants on Afghan soil, asserting that no one is allowed to threaten neighboring countries from their territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunfight-kills-pakistani-soldier-12-militants-near-afghan-border-/7966135.html	2025-02-06T17:25:17-08:00	
Treaty obliges US to to defend Panama Canal, says Rubio	STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday, amid confusion and what Panama has described as 'lies' regarding whether U.S. Navy ships can transit the Panama Canal for free. 'I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict. Those are our expectations. … They were clearly understood in those conversations,' Rubio said during a press conference in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. He held talks with Panamanian President Jose Rauu Mulino in Panama City on Sunday. Rubio was referring to a treaty signed by the U.S. and Panama in 1977. The top U.S. diplomat told reporters that while he respects Panama's democratically elected government and acknowledges that it has 'a process of laws and procedures that it needs to follow,' the treaty obligation 'would have to be enforced by the armed forces the United States, particularly the U.S. Navy.' The U.S. intends to pursue an amicable resolution, Rubio said. Mulino posted on X that he planned to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said, via a social media post on X, that U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without incurring fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars annually. But the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, disputed the U.S. claim, saying that it has made no adjustments to these fees. It also expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue with relevant U.S. officials. During his weekly press conference on Thursday, the Panamanian president denied his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free, saying he completely rejected the State Department's statement. Belt and Road Initiative Meanwhile, Mulino told reporters that the Panamanian Embassy in Beijing had provided China with the required 90-day notice of its decision to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, also known as BRI. He denied that the decision was made at Washington's request, saying that he was taking time to assess Panama's relationship with China and decide what would best serve his country's interests. 'I don't know what the incentive was for the person who signed that agreement with China,' Mulino said in Spanish, adding that he did not think the BRI had brought major benefits to his country. Panama joined China's BRI under former President Juan Carlos Varela. The agreement was signed in 2018, following Panama's decision in 2017 to establish its diplomatic relations with China and sever ties with Taiwan. Rubio has welcomed Panama's decision not to renew its participation in China's BRI. China describes the BRI, which was launched in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, as a vast infrastructure initiative designed to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has warned that the project is driven by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit. In Beijing, Chinese officials dismissed what they called the U.S.'s 'irresponsible remarks on the Panama Canal issue' and accused Washington of intentionally distorting, attacking and mischaracterizing relevant cooperation. 'China firmly opposes it and made stern demarches to the U.S. side,' said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry. While in Santo Domingo, Rubio met with Dominican President Luis Abinader and Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez. The Dominican Republic is the final stop on Rubio's five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean, which focuses on curbing illegal immigration, combating drug trafficking and countering China's growing influence in the Western Hemisphere.

White House monitoring China’s complaint on Trump tariffs at WTO	white house — The White House on Thursday said it was monitoring a complaint by China to the World Trade Organization that accuses the United States of making 'unfounded and false allegations' about China’s role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products. The complaint was made Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%. The White House said the new duties on Chinese goods were aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals. China said it was imposing retaliatory tariffs on some American goods beginning February 10, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals and launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google. In the WTO filing, China said the U.S. tariff measures were 'discriminatory and protectionist' and violated international trade rules. Beijing has requested a consultation with Washington. China’s request will kick-start a process within the WTO’s Appellate Body, which has the final say on dispute settlements. A White House official told VOA the administration was monitoring Beijing’s file but did not provide further details. Analysts say Beijing’s move is largely performative and unlikely to yield much relief. The Appellate Body has been largely paralyzed following the first Trump administration’s 2019 move to block appointments of appellate judges over what it viewed as judicial overreach. The Biden administration continued the policy. China recognizes the WTO is not going to put a lot of pressure on the United States because Washington is fully capable of blocking any legal process there, said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'So instead, I think the Chinese reaction has been moderate in indicating that they will act tit for tat against U.S. trade,' he told VOA. Schott added that there’s 'a desire to keep things cool' and moderate the damage, just as what happened during the first Trump administration when a trade deal was agreed upon after initial retaliatory trade actions. On the U.S. side, the 10% tariffs against China are much lower than the up to 60% that Trump promised during his presidential campaign, he said. Trump-Xi call Trump imposed import duties on Beijing after delaying his actions to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada following conversations Monday with their leaders. Tariff critics are hoping that a conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could lead to similar results. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the call 'is being scheduled and will happen very soon.' However, Trump has dismissed the negative impact of China’s tariffs and said he was 'in no rush' to speak with Xi. 'We’ll speak to him at the appropriate time,' Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. Unlike Trump’s deal with Mexico and Canada, an agreement with Beijing is unlikely to come quickly, considering strong bipartisan support for placing tariffs on China because of concern about the influx of illegal drugs and other national security concerns, said Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. 'Even if they come up with some kind of agreement to settle this particular tariff or to remove the countertariffs, there will probably be more tariffs on China later in this administration,' she told VOA. The U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday announced that it was suspending acceptance of inbound packages from China and Hong Kong, closing a loophole that Chinese garment and other consumer goods companies have used in the past. These companies, including Shein and Temu as well as Amazon vendors, bypassed existing U.S. tariffs by shipping to American customers directly from China. On Wednesday, USPS reversed its decision, saying it would work with Customs and Border Protection on a way to collect the new tariffs. The Postal Service 'will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts,' it said. 'The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.' It is unclear how the fee will be collected in such direct transactions between Chinese sellers and American buyers. Trump’s trade actions on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as his threat to impose duties on all foreign shipments into the country, including from European allies, have caused confusion and uncertainty across global trade. Businesses usually respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on investments or passing on increased costs to customers. But the damage goes beyond small and large businesses domestically and abroad, Ziemba said. 'If one of the U.S. goals is relying less on China and Chinese supply chains for critical minerals, for energy, for other things like that, then the uncertainty about whether there’s going to be tariffs and investment restrictions on its allies fly in the face of that goal,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-monitoring-china-s-complaint-on-trump-tariffs-at-wto/7965848.html	2025-02-06T15:34:15-08:00

WHO: More routes out of Gaza needed to evacuate thousands who need lifesaving treatment	UNITED NATIONS — The top official for the World Health Organization in Gaza said Thursday that more routes out of the enclave are urgently needed for the medical evacuation of thousands of Palestinians, including children, in need of lifesaving medical treatment. 'There should be more patients going through Rafah into Egypt, but we also want other medical corridors,' Dr. Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in a video call from Gaza. 'And the first medical corridor we really want to see restored is the traditional referral pathway to the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The hospitals are ready in the east Jerusalem and West Bank to receive the patients.' Peeperkorn said under the ceasefire agreement, up to 50 Palestinian patients a day and their companions can be evacuated from Gaza. So far, they have been able to evacuate no more than 39 patients daily. He said it must be scaled up because 12,000 to 14,000 patients are in need of evacuation, including at least 5,000 children. The patients suffer from trauma, heart issues and diseases, including cancer. Prior to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack inside Israel that triggered the war, there were 50 to 100 patients in Gaza referred each day to hospitals in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, mainly for cardiology issues and cancer treatment, Peeperkorn said. During the first months of the war between Israel and Hamas, nearly 5,000 patients were medevaced through the Rafah crossing into Egypt — and some onto other countries — for treatment. But once the Israeli military shut the Rafah crossing in early May ahead of its offensive in the southern part of Gaza Strip, the numbers dropped dramatically. From May until the ceasefire went into effect in mid-January, fewer than 500 Palestinian patients were evacuated. 'In the meantime, people, and some critical patients including children, because they couldn't be medevaced, they were dying,' Peeperkorn said. Specialized treatment in war-devastated Gaza is difficult. The WHO says only 18 of the Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning. Some lie in ruins. Many lack basic supplies and adequate fuel. Critical equipment has been destroyed, Peeperkorn said, and there is only one remaining CT scanner and MRI machine left in all of Gaza. Health care needs are immense for all Palestinians in Gaza due to physical and psychological trauma, Peeperkorn said. The ceasefire is allowing WHO to scale-up its response to the general population, including plans to bring more beds into some working hospitals, he said. In the weeks since the ceasefire began, WHO has brought in 105 trucks with medical supplies to cover the health needs of 1.6 million Palestinians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-more-routes-out-of-gaza-needed-to-evacuate-thousands-who-need-lifesaving-treatment/7965802.html	2025-02-06T14:46:08-08:00	
Azerbaijan detains two more journalists as watchdogs denounce crackdown	Azerbaijani authorities detained two more journalists this week, bringing the number held in the past year to nearly two dozen. Police on Wednesday arrested Shamshad Agha, of the news website Argument, and Shahnaz Beylargizi of Toplum TV. A court in the capital, Baku, on Thursday ordered the journalists to be held in pretrial detention for two months and one day, and three months and 15 days respectively, according to their lawyers. The journalists are charged with smuggling — a charge used in several other cases since November 2023, as authorities detained at least 23 journalists. Many of those currently detained had worked for the independent outlets Abzas Media and Meydan TV. All the journalists being investigated since November 2023 have denied wrongdoing, and media watchdogs say they believe the cases are designed to silence media. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said that Agha’s arrest 'underscores a grim intent by Azerbaijani authorities to silence and further restrict the country’s small and embattled independent media community.' 'Azerbaijan’s government should immediately reverse its unprecedented media crackdown and release Agha along with all other unjustly jailed journalists,' said a statement from CPJ’s Gulnoza Said. Bashir Suleymanli, who is head of the Baku-based legal assistance group known as the Institute of Civil Rights, believes that the arrests are an attempt by authorities to stifle free speech. 'It seems that the process will continue until the complete elimination of independent journalism in the country,' he told VOA. Lawmaker Bahruz Maharramov, however, says the arrests are not a press freedom issue. 'Law enforcement agencies have taken relevant measures based on facts and irrefutable evidence, the authenticity of which is beyond doubt,' he told VOA. 'Of course, since such media organizations are formed more as instruments of influence of the West, the legal and judicial measures taken against them are observed with inadequate reactions from the West.' Based in Azerbaijan, human rights activist Samir Kazimli says that independent media and news outlets critical of the government are undergoing a difficult period. 'If this policy of repression does not stop, independent media in Azerbaijan may be completely destroyed,' he told VOA. Kazimli said that the international community, including rights groups, politicians and U.S. and European officials 'must take steps using urgent and effective mechanisms to stop the Azerbaijani authorities' attacks on civil society and independent media.' One of the journalists detained this week had recently spoken out about concerns for the future of independent media in Azerbaijan. 'The lives of all independent journalists are in danger,' Agha told VOA in January. The editor of Argument, a news website covering democracy, corruption and human rights, said he has been banned from leaving the country since July. The research organization Freedom House describes Azerbaijan as an 'authoritarian regime' and states that authorities have 'carried out an extensive crackdown on civil liberties in recent years.' Elshan Hasanov of the Political Prisoners Monitoring Center told VOA that the total number of detainees documented by the Azeri nonprofit is 331. Azerbaijani authorities reject criticism on detainees as biased. Parliamentarian Maharramov told VOA that media in the country are free and that conditions for providing everyone with information, including diversity of opinion and freedom of action in the media sector as a whole, are fully ensured. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, according to data by the CPJ. The country ranks 164 out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment for media.

US judge blocks Trump offer for government workers until at least Monday	A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's proposed incentive for federal workers until at least Monday, giving an initial win to labor unions that sued to stop it. The ruling by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston pushes back a midnight deadline set by the Trump administration, which is pressing federal workers to leave their jobs in an unprecedented drive to overhaul the federal government. O'Toole could opt to delay the buyout further or block it on a more permanent basis when he next considers the legal challenge by the unions at a hearing on Monday. The proposal has upended Washington, sparking street protests and accusations by labor unions and opposition Democrats that Republican President Donald Trump is violating multiple laws. The offer promises to pay employees' salaries until October, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14 and there is no guarantee that salaries will be funded beyond that point. The Education Department told staffers who accept it that their paychecks could stop at any time, media outlets reported. Labor unions and Democrats have said the offer is not trustworthy. Some federal employees said they were heartened by Thursday's court ruling. 'It's a glimmer of hope that the courts might help us and block the whole resignation program,' said an employee at the General Services Administration, which manages federal properties. The buyout encompasses not only employees at domestic agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency that have traditionally drawn the ire of Trump's Republicans, but intelligence agencies like the CIA as well. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said more than 40,000 federal employees had accepted the offer so far, roughly 2% of the federal government's 2.3 million civilian workforce. Roughly 6% of federal workers retire or resign in a typical year, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. The administration said earlier in the day that those who do not accept the buyout could lose their jobs. The White House has sought to identify workers hired within the last two years, who lack full civil-service protections and would be easier to fire. It has also ordered agency officials to identify those appointed by Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who remain in civil-service jobs, as well as those who have received poor performance ratings. Federal workers say they are operating in a climate of fear and uncertainty. Workers said they were downloading pay and benefit records that they feared could be erased from government computers as they weighed whether to take a buyout deal that might not be honored or stay on with the knowledge they could be fired. The White House says it is following through on Trump's campaign promise to cut wasteful spending and slim down a bureaucracy that many conservatives see as left-leaning and unresponsive to the president's agenda. Trump has tasked Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with leading the overhaul effort. Musk and his aides have moved rapidly, turning up at agencies throughout Washington to demand access to sensitive information, including personnel files. Their efforts have resulted in purges of staff in several departments and a significant scaling down of operations of America's main humanitarian aid agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development. Among the data Musk's team has been examining are Medicare and Medicaid payments to older Americans and lower-income enrollees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-blocks-trump-offer-for-government-workers-until-at-least-monday/7965807.html	2025-02-06T14:30:36-08:00	
Darfuri women face sexual violence in war, refuge	Aid groups say sexual violence is a constant threat for women in Sudan’s Darfur, but refugees also say it’s a problem for those who have fled the region.

Though China might aim to fill aid void left by USAID, its own challenges could limit it	WASHINGTON — The U.S. foreign aid agency broadly shut down by the Trump administration has long been criticized by Beijing. But as USAID projects wind down, will Beijing step in to try to build influence? Some analysts say although China will want to fill the vacuum, its own economic problems could limit what it will do. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is now the acting director of U.S. Agency for International Development, said he will bring the agency's activities in line with the agenda of the new government. 'These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest,' he told reporters while visiting El Salvador earlier this week. USAID had an annual budget of more than $40 billion and managed aid programs around the world, including a China-related program that has become a target of criticism by the White House. On a 'waste and abuse' fact sheet released on Feb. 3, the White House said USAID had given millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. organization working on protections against infectious disease. The organization has been accused of working with Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronavirus research that had caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Both EcoHealth Alliance and the Chinese government have rejected those accusations. Agency has framed funding as strategy In recent years, USAID has increasingly framed its funding for China-related programs as a strategy to contain China's global expansion through aid and investments. An archived page of USAID's now-closed website shows that the agency lauded its 'Countering Chinese Influence Fund' as one of its 'key accomplishments.' The fund 'will advance national-security goals' to 'build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the CCP and other malign actors.' Michael Schiffer, former USAID assistant administrator for Asia, told a congressional panel in 2023 that the agency had for more than a decade supported data collection on China's overseas investments through AidData, a research group at the College of William and Mary in the U.S. state of Virginia. The funding freeze has put at least one such USAID-funded project in financial trouble. Brian Eyler, a researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington, wrote in a public post on Facebook that his project, Mekong Dams Monitor, has difficulty continuing operation because of the freeze. 'We are ordered to stop work on those grants for 90 days pending further review. And that means our Southeast Asia program might not be able to keep the lights on,' he wrote. Eyler's project was launched by the State Department during the first Trump administration to study how dams built by China and other countries on the Mekong River in southeast Asia have negatively affected communities downstream. According to Eyler's post, the project received funding from both the State Department and USAID. Chinese state media had accused the project of smearing China. VOA Mandarin reached out to Stimson Center for more details but did not receive a response. On Wednesday, Rubio said the Trump administration is in the process of identifying programs that are exempted from the funding freeze. 'This [is] not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,' Rubio said during his multiday trip to Latin America. Critics of USAID USAID also has been a target of Beijing's ire. China's foreign ministry released a report last year accusing USAID programs of corruption and prioritizing the advancement of U.S. interests. The shutdown of USAID has been met with cheers and celebrations on the Chinese internet, where anti-U.S. narratives permeate. Many users praised Elon Musk, the billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, for closing the agency. Musk previously posted on X describing USAID as 'a criminal organization' and that it is time 'for it to die.' USAID critics Critics of the funding freeze and the shuttering of USAID worry that Beijing will see this as an opportunity to fill the void left by the U.S. 'China has spent trillions of dollars in numerous countries because it is interested in pulling them into its sphere of influence,' U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote in The Washington Post. Steven Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told VOA Mandarin he agrees with the assessment. But he said China's plan to expand foreign aid is likely to be hindered by its lingering domestic problems. 'You think about youth unemployment; you think about the real estate bubble and so forth,' he said. 'That might make it difficult for the Xi administration to aggressively expand into new parts of the world because the U.S is pulling back.' Some activists worry that even if China tries to fill the void, certain areas where there once were U.S. aid programs will not receive the same kind of funding, if at all. A former environmental lawyer in China who now lives in the U.S. told VOA Mandarin that, compared to U.S. aid programs, China's assistance is of a more transactional nature and seeks financial returns. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears harassment from Beijing. A 2021 report released by China shows that between 2013 and 2018, China had spent $376 billion on foreign aid, 45% of which went to Africa in areas such as agriculture, medical assistance, food supply, disease control, and climate change. The former environmental lawyer said if it is entirely left for China to provide aid, areas such as women's rights and natural resource management will lose a large portion of funding, if not entirely, because China is not interested in improving local governance. 'There will certainly be a very severe impact on the African people,' she said, 'which isn't something you'll be able to see within just a day or two.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-may-fill-aid-void-left-by-usaid-shutdown-but-its-own-challenges-could-limit-it/7965690.html	2025-02-06T13:13:44-08:00	
US imposes new sanctions targeting Iran oil exports	The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Thursday new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, targeting an international network that facilitates the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China. In a release, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, said the sanctions target Sepehr Energy, a front company through which Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff, or AFGS, ships the oil. The sanctions include entities and individuals in China, India and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several vessels. The office said Sepehr Energy and its affiliate companies, which operate under the AFGS, use 'deceitful evasion methods,' including the falsification of maritime documents, to disguise the Iranian origin of the oil that it trades and transports to overseas buyers, including China. The OFAC said each year, the illicit sales generate the equivalent of billions of dollars, which Iran uses to fund its destabilizing regional activities and support of multiple regional terrorist groups, including Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. In the statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Iran also uses the funds to develop its nuclear program and the production of deadly ballistic missiles and military drones. 'The United States is committed to aggressively targeting any attempt by Iran to secure funding for these malign activities,' he said. In a separate statement, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the United States will not tolerate Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior. 'We will use all tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable for its destabilizing activities and pursuit of nuclear weapons that threaten the civilized world,' she said. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating the U.S. government impose maximum pressure on Tehran to dissuade it from pursuing its nuclear program. Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-new-sanctions-targeting-iran-oil-exports/7965708.html	2025-02-06T13:00:44-08:00	
House lawmakers push to ban AI app DeepSeek from US government devices	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan duo in the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok. Lawmakers Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Darin LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, on Thursday introduced the 'No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,' which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks. 'The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,' Gottheimer said in a statement. 'We simply can't risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.' The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists. The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems, and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models. Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long-term solution before the legally required ban takes effect. In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices. 'The technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,' LaHood said in a statement. 'This commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers' phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans' data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.' The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek. Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, would bar the import or export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-lawmakers-push-to-ban-ai-app-deepseek-from-us-government-devices-/7965546.html	2025-02-06T11:04:35-08:00	
US service member, 3 contractors die in plane crash in Philippines	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — One U.S. service member and three defense contractors were killed Thursday when a plane contracted by the U.S. military crashed in a rice field in the southern Philippines, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said. The aircraft was conducting a routine mission 'providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support at the request of our Philippine allies,' the command said in a statement. It said the cause of the crash was under investigation. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also confirmed the crash of a light plane in Maguindanao del Sur province. It did not immediately provide other details. The bodies of the four people were retrieved from the wreckage in Ampatuan town, said Ameer Jehad Tim Ambolodto, a safety officer of Maguindanao del Sur. Indo-Pacific Command said the names of the crew were being withheld pending family notifications. Windy Beaty, a provincial disaster-mitigation officer, told The Associated Press that she received reports that residents saw smoke coming from the plane and heard an explosion before the aircraft plummeted to the ground less than a kilometer from a cluster of farmhouses. Nobody was reported injured on or near the crash site, which was cordoned off by troops, Beaty said. U.S. forces have been deployed in a Philippine military camp in the country's south for decades to help provide advice and training to Filipino forces battling Muslim militants. The region is the homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-service-member-3-contractors-die-in-plane-crash-in-philippines/7965438.html	2025-02-06T10:10:21-08:00	
UN chief appeals for peace in eastern DR Congo	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. secretary-general appealed Thursday for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a recent escalation of fighting between rebels and the national army has killed at least 2,900 people and displaced tens of thousands. 'It is time for mediation. It is time to end this crisis. It is time for peace,' Antonio Guterres told reporters. 'The stakes are too high.' A senior U.N. official in the DRC said Wednesday that nearly 3,000 people have been killed in recent fighting between the M23 movement and the national army over the eastern city of Goma, which fell to the rebels on Jan. 27. Guterres said hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes, and there are credible reports of grave human rights abuses, including rape. 'The humanitarian situation in and around Goma is perilous,' he said. The M23 is looking to expand its territorial gains and is reported to be about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside the South Kivu capital of Bukavu. Heavy fighting has been reported this week along the main route between the towns of Kinyezire and Nyabibwe. Guterres spoke a day ahead of a planned crisis summit in Tanzania of the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community. The secretary-general also said he would travel next week to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to participate in an African Union Peace and Security Council summit to discuss the DRC. 'As the summit in Tanzania gets under way, and as I prepare to leave for Addis Ababa, my message is clear: Silence the guns. Stop the escalation,' he said. The U.N. chief was adamant that there is no military solution to the crisis and called on the signatories of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the region to honor their commitments. The Congolese government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23, a claim that Rwanda denies but which U.N. observers have said is true. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appeals-for-peace-in-eastern-dr-congo/7965413.html	2025-02-06T09:51:13-08:00	
Trump's US trade negotiator pick vows hard-line policies	WASHINGTON — Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's choice to be the top U.S. trade negotiator, promised to pursue the president's hard-line trade policies in testimony Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee. But he faced pushback from senators unsettled by Trump's unpredictable actions on trade. Trump's protectionist approach — involving the heavy use of taxes on foreign goods — will give Americans 'the opportunity to work in good-paying jobs producing goods and services they can sell in this market and abroad to earn an honest living,' Greer said in remarks prepared ahead of his confirmation hearing. As U.S. trade representative, Greer would have responsibility along with commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick for one of Trump's top policy priorities: waging — or at least threatening — trade war with countries around the world, America's friends and foes alike. On Saturday, Trump signed orders imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico — America's two biggest trading partners. Then on Monday, he turned around and gave those countries a 30-day reprieve from the tariffs after their leaders made modest concessions on stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States. 'Trump governs by whim, and in trade that hurts American families,' said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the finance committee. 'His tariff bluff created huge uncertainty that is costing American businesses and putting the global economy on a month-to-month lease.' Trump believes that imposing tariffs — import taxes — on U.S. trade partners can reduce America's massive trade deficits, protect U.S. industry from competition, bring manufacturing back to the United States and pressure other countries into making concessions on a variety of issues, including reducing illegal immigration and cracking down on drug trafficking. The hostilities have already begun. On Tuesday, the United States imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of levies imposed in Trump’s first term. Beijing promptly lashed back, announcing tariffs on U.S. coal, crude oil and other products, restricting exports of critical minerals and launching an antitrust investigation of Google. But the Chinese tariffs don't take effect until Monday, buying time for the two countries to reach some kind of truce. That is what happened earlier this week. Trump had signed an order Saturday hitting imports from America's two biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico, with 25% tariffs. They were supposed to take effect Tuesday, too, but were called off — and delayed for 30 days — after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed Monday to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across U.S. borders. Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs would disrupt trade and drive up prices for American consumers. Democrats and others have also criticized the impulsive and unpredictable way that Trump conducts trade policy and his decision to target America's neighbors and allies, not limiting his tariff onslaught to U.S. geopolitical rival China. Wyden expressed concern about Trump's campaign promises to impose an across-the-board 'universal' tariff on imports as opposed to targeting China and other countries for unfair trade practices or protecting workers in specific industries struggling with foreign competition. The universal tariffs, Wyden said, amount to a 'prescription for hitting our citizens, small businesses, really hard and also raising inflationary pressures.' Greer responded that universal tariffs 'should be studied' as a way to possibly lower America's massive trade deficits. Greer was a veteran of Trump's first-term trade battles, serving as chief of staff to then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. In that position, Greer was involved in a U.S.-China trade brawl that saw the world's two biggest economies slap tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of each other's goods. He also played a role in Trump's contentious and successful campaign to rewrite a North American trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and to get Congress to approve the new pact. Earlier, Greer, a graduate of the University of Virginia law school, served as a lawyer in the U.S. Air Force's Advocate General's Corps, doing a tour in Iraq and serving as a prosecutor and defense counsel in criminal cases involving U.S. airmen. After Trump's first term, Greer joined the Washington law firm King & Spalding, representing clients in cases before the Commerce Department, the International Trade Commission and federal courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-us-trade-negotiator-pick-vows-hardline-policies/7965350.html	2025-02-06T09:24:20-08:00	
Iran leverages Hamas' release of hostages for propaganda purposes	An analysis shows Iran is using the release of U.S. citizen Keith Siegel and other hostages to further a misleading narrative – one that says U.S.-designated terror group Hamas has treated its captives fairly and another that Israel subjected Palestinian prisoners to systematic brutality. On Feb. 1, Hamas released three hostages from captivity in Gaza, including Siegel. Hamas abducted Siegel, who also is an Israeli citizen, from his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza in its Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. He spent more than 480 days in captivity. Hamas also released Yarden Bibas and Ofer Kalderon in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners amid a fragile ceasefire that went into effect on Jan. 19. Iranian media reports focused on a narrative that Palestinian prisoners exhibited signs of torture and abuse. By contrast, Iranian media said, Siegel and other hostages released in previous exchanges had shown appreciation to Hamas for treating them humanely. On Feb. 2, Iran’s Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) released an alleged statement from Siegel in which he thanked Hamas for meeting all of his medical and dietary needs. IRNA also claimed Siegel had 'criticized the Israeli regime for not doing enough to reach a deal to return the prisoners sooner and end the bloody war in Gaza.' A statement from Siegel’s family, however, published by the Times of Israel that same day, said he had been forced to sign off on the thank you letter to Hamas. 'Hamas terrorists forced Keith to write them a detailed thank you letter while holding him captive,' the statement from Siegel’s family read. 'This is just one example of many that demonstrates Hamas’s cruel and cynical behavior and highlights the urgency of bringing all remaining hostages back home.' While Iranian media focused on claims that Hamas had provided Siegel appropriate medical care, they omitted that Siegel’s ribs were broken and he was shot in the hand when militants abducted him on Oct. 7, 2023, along with the other 249 hostages. His wife, whom Hamas also took captive and freed in November 2023, recounted having to beg for food and water. Hamas also paraded Siegel on stage for propaganda purposes, before a banner reading 'Nazi Zionism Will Not Win.' Exploiting other hostages Meanwhile, an article from Iran’s state-run Press TV on Feb. 2 promoted other alleged statements made by hostages in Hamas custody to further Tehran’s propaganda goals. Press TV claimed Gaida Moses, 80, who was released on Jan. 30, 'lived in the same conditions as his captors and ate what they ate together.' Moses’ niece Efrat Machikawa told the BBC that Moses survived primarily on a piece of bread and an olive a day during his 15-plus months in captivity. 'I have no idea how he survived,' she said. 'He lost so much weight.' In December 2023, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad also released a propaganda video in which Moses pleaded for Israel to make a deal to secure his release. Additionally, Press TV focused on Danielle Aloni, a former hostage who was released with her 5-year-old daughter in November 2023 after a month in Hamas’ captivity. Aloni wrote a thank you letter to Hamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. That letter went viral in Arabic language media. Family and Israeli media said the letter was Hamas propaganda. The Times of Israel reported in November 2023 that Aloni’s family members were still in custody when she composed the letter, suggesting she may have been coerced to write it. Hamas also filmed other former captives smiling and waving at their captors while being released during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023. Those filmed gestures, the Times argued, 'were clearly demanded by the captors and made under duress' in a bid by Hamas to 'show the world it has been and is treating the hostages humanely.' The Wall Street Journal reported that Hamas’ attempts to turn the release of hostages into a spectacle was intended to showcase their strength and humiliate their enemy. This tactic, the Journal says, also risks derailing the fragile ceasefire. Press TV also cited a statement from Chen Almog-Goldstein, who was abducted by Hamas with three of her children. Goldstein reportedly said her captors 'protect[ed] us with their bodies from [Israeli] strikes.' That sentiment was reflected in interviews she gave to Western media. At the same time, Goldstein watched Hamas gunmen shoot and kill her husband and eldest daughter on Oct. 7, 2023. Chen’s daughter, Agam, who was taken hostage alongside her, recounted their captivity in far harsher terms. Press TV cites Chen as saying her Hamas captors claimed they would die before she did, signaling their duty to protect her. Press TV further cited Hamas, which claimed the Israeli military 'deliberately and repeatedly' targeted locations where the militants were holding Israeli captives. But Agam said Hamas was intentionally putting hostages in harm’s way. 'But then, in an instant, the low buzz of conversation was drowned out by Hamas launching rockets, just meters away from us, from inside the school compound. The hall erupted in joy, and as the Gazans celebrated, I realized that Hamas had moved us there to serve as human shields,' Agam wrote for The Washington Post in August. Agam also recounted Hamas guards sexually abusing women and hating her 'for being Jewish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-leverages-hamas-release-of-hostages-for-propaganda-purposes/7965320.html	2025-02-06T08:48:42-08:00	
Swedish police describe 'inferno' at scene of mass shooting	Police in Sweden investigating the nation’s worst mass shooting said at a news briefing Thursday that the scene at an adult learning center was an 'inferno' of smoke, with injured and dead victims. The attack on Tuesday left 10 people dead, including the suspected shooter, at Campus Risbergska in the city of Orebro, about 200 kilometers west of Stockholm. The facility offers adult courses, including Swedish language classes for immigrants. Law enforcement officials say the shooter, who Swedish media have identified as 35-year-old Rickard Andersson, may have been a student at the center. Law enforcement officials have not officially identified the suspect, whose cause of death remains unclear. Orebro police Chief Lars Wiren said at the news conference Thursday that about 130 officers arrived at the scene within 10 minutes of an alarm, where they found 'dead people, injured people, screams and smoke.' As officers entered the building, they reported it was partially filled with smoke, making it difficult for them to see. They reported gunfire that they believed was directed at them but reportedly did not return fire. Police said the smoke was not caused by fire but by 'some sort of pyrotechnics.' Several officers had to seek medical treatment for smoke inhalation. Chief investigator Anna Bergkvist said Thursday that the suspect had a license for four guns, all of which have been confiscated. 'Three of those weapons were next to him when police secured him inside the building,' she said. Bergkvist said investigators have not determined a motive for the mass shooting, telling Agence France-Presse that 'multiple nationalities, different genders and different ages' were among those who were killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-police-describe-inferno-at-scene-of-mass-shooting/7965271.html	2025-02-06T08:27:21-08:00

Islamabad, Beijing pledge counterterrorism cooperation for security of Chinese workers in Pakistan	Islamabad — Pakistan has assured China it will ensure the safety of Chinese personnel working on infrastructure and development projects in the South Asian country while seeking greater security and economic cooperation during President Asif Ali Zardari’s visit to Beijing. Zardari is in China on a five-day visit from February 4 to 8 along with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and other senior officials. Pakistani leaders met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang. Zardari also held delegation level talks with the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, Zhao Leji. The Pakistani leadership 'reaffirmed that ensuring the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan is the foremost responsibility of Pakistani government as China’s All-weather Strategic Cooperative partner and the host country,' according to a joint communique issued Thursday. Thousands of Chinese nationals are in Pakistan, working primarily on projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. At least 21 Chinese citizens, however, have been killed in targeted attacks since 2017. This has put pressure on bilateral ties and hurt the progress of the massive infrastructure and development project that has seen more than $25 billion in Chinese investment come to Pakistan. An October 2024 attack in Pakistan’s southern port city of Karachi killed two Chinese citizens. The incident came a few months after a March attack on a convoy killed five Chinese nationals in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While calling for increased cooperation on counterterrorism, the statement said Pakistan will bring to justice those responsible for attacking Chinese personnel. Pakistan also committed to 'further increase input into security, and take targeted and enhanced measures to effectively ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, and create a safe environment for cooperation between the two countries,' according to the communique. In the latest high-level meetings, Chinese officials offered counterterrorism cooperation to Pakistan. 'The Chinese side…expressed its willingness to provide necessary support for Pakistan’s counter terrorism capacity building,' the lengthy 24-point communique read. Official statements issued by the Pakistani side earlier show security remained a central part of discussions. In his opening statement Wednesday at the start of talks with Xi, Zardari said the friendship between the two countries had 'gone through ups and downs' but would not be broken down by militant attacks that have killed Chinese citizens. 'No matter how many terrors, how many issues crop up in the world, I will stand, Pakistani people will stand, with the people of China,' the Pakistan head of state said. Both sides discussed enhancing intelligence sharing, border security, and the transfer of technology to strengthen the Pakistani police’s capability to secure Chinese interests. 'Mohsin Naqvi said that Pakistan will purchase modern technology and equipment for the police from China,' a statement from the Pakistani interior minister’s office said after a meeting with Qi Yanjun, one of China’s top security officials. Naqvi also informed Xi about efforts to beef up security of the Chinese and boost counter terrorism operations in Pakistan. Pakistan is grappling with a deadly wave of militant attacks primarily targeting Pakistani security personnel since late 2021. On Saturday, militants allegedly affiliated with the Baloch Liberation Army killed 18 soldiers in the southwestern Balochistan province, home to the China-funded Gwadar deep sea port and the country’s largest airport. In January, the country saw 74 militant attacks resulting in 91 deaths, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Thirty-five of those killed were security personnel while 36 militants died in the incidents. In 2024, close to 1,200 people including almost 1000 civilians and security personnel were killed in militant attacks – a 40% increase in militant attacks compared to 2023. Much of the violence is concentrated in the two provinces bordering Afghanistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the proscribed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan has a strong foothold while the banned Baloch Liberation Army is behind much of the violence in Balochistan. Pakistan accuses the Afghan Taliban of taking insufficient measures to reign in anti-Pakistan militants present on Afghan soil, a charge the de facto rulers in Kabul reject. In Thursday’s joint communique, Pakistan and China again pressed Afghan authorities to take stronger counter-terrorism action. 'They called on the Interim Afghan Government to take visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist groups based in Afghanistan which continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security, and to prevent the use of Afghan territory against other countries,' the statement said. Despite Pakistan’s poor security situation that Beijing has publicly complained about, the joint statement said China would encourage its businesses to invest in Pakistan.

Trump attends National Prayer Breakfast	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that his relationship with religion had 'changed' after a pair of failed assassination attempts last year, as he advocated at the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol for Americans to 'bring God back into our lives.' Trump joined a Washington tradition of more than 70 years that brings together a bipartisan group of lawmakers for fellowship. He was also to speak at a separate prayer breakfast at a Washington hotel sponsored by a private group. 'I really believe you can't be happy without religion, without that belief,' Trump said. 'Let's bring religion back. Let's bring God back into our lives.' Trump reflected on having a bullet coming close to killing him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, telling lawmakers and attendees, 'It changed something in me, I feel.' He continued: 'I feel even stronger. I believed in God, but I feel, I feel much more strongly about it. Something happened.' He drew laughs when he expressed gratitude that the episode 'didn't affect my hair.' The president, who's a nondenominational Christian, called religious liberty 'part of the bedrock of American life' and called for protecting it with 'absolute devotion.' Trump and his administration have already clashed with religious leaders, including him disagreeing with the Reverend Mariann Budde's sermon the day after his inauguration, when she called for mercy for members of the LGBTQ+ community and migrants who are in the country illegally. Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, has sparred with top U.S. leaders of his own church over immigration issues. And many clergy members across the country are worried about the removal of churches from the sensitive-areas list, allowing federal officials to conduct immigration actions at places of worship. The Republican president made waves at the final prayer breakfast during his first term. That year the gathering came the day after the Senate acquitted him in his first impeachment trial. Trump in his remarks then threw not-so-subtle barbs at Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who publicly said she prayed for Trump, and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who had cited his faith in his decision to vote to convict Trump. 'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.' Trump said then in his winding speech, in which he also held up two newspapers with banner headlines about his acquittal. 'Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so.' Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to attend the prayer breakfast, in February 1953, and every president since has spoken at the gathering. Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas are the honorary co-chairs of this year's prayer breakfast. In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two dueling events, the one on Capitol Hill largely attended by lawmakers and government officials and a larger private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom. The split occurred when lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group that for decades had overseen the bigger event, due to questions about its organization and how it was funded. In 2023 and 2024, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, spoke at the Capitol Hill event, and his remarks were livestreamed to the other gathering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-attends-national-prayer-breakfast/7965175.html	2025-02-06T06:55:10-08:00	
California city breaks with state on shielding undocumented migrants	U.S. Border Patrol agents are detaining undocumented migrants as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Japan’s Ishiba faces balancing act in first meeting with Trump	Seoul, South Korea — When Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba meets with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, his goal, according to Japanese officials, will be straightforward: reaffirm the U.S.-Japan alliance and build a strong rapport with Trump. But many in Tokyo see Ishiba’s goal as even simpler: to avoid a diplomatic disaster with a newly re-elected Trump, whose 'America First' foreign policy has returned with even greater intensity than during his first term. Not even three weeks after retaking office, Trump has escalated pressure on U.S. allies and partners, often in abrupt and unpredictable ways. He has threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada while raising the possibility of military action against cartels and suggesting Canada become the 51st state. He has floated seizing Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, and warned Panama that if it doesn’t curb Chinese influence, the U.S. could forcibly take back control of the Panama Canal. The developments have rattled many in Tokyo, which relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and has long aligned itself with the concept of a U.S.-led, rules-based international order. 'If you watch Japanese media or listen to what Japanese people say, they’re just hoping that Ishiba can get out of this meeting without being a victim of some kind of new attack from America,' said Jeffrey J. Hall, a Japanese politics specialist at Kanda University of International Studies. Emulating Abe? So far, Japan has been spared Trump’s second-term criticism. Last week, while announcing his meeting with Ishiba, Trump declared, 'I like Japan,' citing his friendship with Shinzo Abe, the country’s deceased former prime minister. Abe, who led Japan for nearly all of Trump’s first term, carefully cultivated the relationship through personal diplomacy and flattery – often playing golf with Trump and even gifting him a gold-plated golf club. Many Japanese commentators hope Ishiba can take a similar approach to maintain smooth relations with Trump. But that may be difficult. Unlike Abe, Ishiba leads an unstable minority government and faces the possibility of his party losing its Upper House majority in crucial elections later this year. Analysts also say Ishiba’s less charismatic personality may make it hard for him to form a personal bond with Trump. 'He doesn’t do the bullet points and assertive style of communication that Trump seems to appreciate,' said Philip Turner, a former senior New Zealand diplomat now based in Tokyo. 'If flattery is the solution, then Ishiba probably is not very good at it.' Better to stay quiet? The situation is so volatile that some in Japan question whether Ishiba should be meeting Trump right now at all. Instead of walking into danger, they ask, why not try to stay off Trump’s radar for as long as possible? But a quiet approach may not work either, said Mieko Nakabayashi, a former Japanese lawmaker. 'Some people say, ‘Don’t wake the sleeping baby,’ but this time Ishiba may have to do it,' said Nakabayashi, a professor at Tokyo’s Waseda University. If Trump eventually threatens Japan with tariffs, Nakabayashi said it will be better for Ishiba to have established a personal relationship with him beforehand to manage the crisis. 'You have to take a risk if you want to have a better relationship with Mr. Trump,' she added. To head off potential pressure, analysts say Ishiba may highlight Japan’s role as the largest foreign investor in the United States. He may also want to raise economic issues like Nippon Steel’s attempted takeover of U.S. Steel, which was blocked by the administration of former U.S. president Joe Biden. But some analysts predict Ishiba may scale back his ambitions, aiming simply to pave the way for a Trump visit to Japan, where officials would try to demonstrate the importance of the alliance firsthand. Hall said that approach may be successful, if only because 'Trump seems to have his plate full with a lot of other things right now and Japan is a sort of reliable partner that doesn’t stir things up.' 'But we’ll have to see. We really can’t predict America and how it will act right now,' he added. 'It’s just at a level of uncertainty that Japan has never experienced before.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-ishiba-faces-balancing-act-in-first-meeting-with-trump/7964943.html	2025-02-06T04:21:24-08:00

Baltic nations count final hours to ending electricity ties to Russia	VILNIUS, LITHUANIA — Nearly 3 1/2 decades after leaving the Soviet Union, the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania this weekend will flip a switch to end electricity-grid connections to neighboring Russia and Belarus — and turn to their European Union allies. The severing of electricity ties to oil- and gas-rich Russia is steeped in geopolitical and symbolic significance. Work toward it sped up after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine three years ago, battering Moscow’s EU relations. 'This is physical disconnection from the last remaining element of our reliance on the Russian and Belarusian energy system,' Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda told The Associated Press in a recent interview. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and other dignitaries are expected at a ceremony on Sunday as a specially-made 9-meter-tall clock in downtown Vilnius counts down the final seconds of the Baltic states’ electricity ties to Russia. Chilly ties since the fall of the Soviet Union The Baltic countries, which are all NATO members, have often had chilly ties with Russia since declaring independence from the USSR in 1990 — and relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Sixteen power lines that used to connect the three Baltic states with Russia and Belarus were dismantled over the years as a new grid linking them with the rest of the EU was created, including underwater cables in the Baltic Sea. On Saturday, all remaining transmission lines between them and Russia, Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad — a Russian exclave wedged between EU members Poland and Lithuania and the sea — will be switched off one by one. Then, for 24 hours, the Baltic Power System will operate solo in an 'island operation mode.' The next day, the power system is set to merge with the Continental European and Nordic grids through several links with Finland, Sweden and Poland. The Kaliningrad region, which has no land ties to mainland Russia, already relies on its own power generation, according to Litgrid, Lithuania’s electricity transmission system operator. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the disconnection plan was announced in advance by the Baltic countries and the Russian energy sector had taken preparatory steps to ensure smooth operation on its side. 'Those plans were announced a long time ago, and they required certain actions by our and their electric companies,' Peskov told reporters. 'We have taken all necessary measures to ensure reliable and uninterrupted operation of our unified energy system.' Risks of troublemaking? The three Baltic countries, which together share a 1,633-kilometer-long border with Russia and Belarus, officially informed Moscow and Minsk of the disconnection plan in July. Their national transmission system operators credited 1.2 billion euros, or $1.25 billion, in EU and other support, to help the countries synchronize with the Continental Europe Synchronous Area. 'Lithuania has done a lot in the last 30 years to disconnect, to become independent,' Nausėda said. Three years ago, 'we stopped buying any kind of energy resources from Russia. It was our response to the war in Ukraine.' Despite the advance notice, the Baltic nations are still on watch for a possible response from their former Soviet partners. 'The risk of cyberattacks remains substantial,' Litgrid said last week, adding that continued vigilance, collaboration, defensive steps and 'robust' cybersecurity measures were needed to effectively mitigate potential threats. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa warned Wednesday of possible provocations, but said Latvia was well-prepared and services including the armed forces and national guard were stepping up their vigilance and security measures. 'Clearly there are risks, we understand that very well. But the risks are identified and there is a contingency plan in case these risks materialize,' Siliņa said. After the disconnection plans were announced, propaganda campaigns cropped up on social media and in printed leaflets in city streets that issued fake-news warnings about blackouts, severe energy shortages and sky-high energy bills for consumers. 'We heard those rumors, but we are used to such things already,' said Jolanta Karavaitiene, a retired teacher, in central Vilnius. 'Of course, we must disconnect from them. Given the geopolitical situation, I see no reason for us to be there (in the Russian grid).' Still, some in the region were taking precautionary measures. Estonia's public broadcaster ERR has reported surging sales of generators. Home appliance chain Bauhof sold dozens more generators last month compared to January a year ago, and rival Ehituse ABC had to limit their purchases the report said. A long road toward energy independence The Baltic countries’ steps toward energy independence have been decades in the making. In 2003, prior to joining the EU, Lithuania decided to shut down the Soviet-built Ignalina nuclear power plant in response to concerns in Brussels over its safety. It was decommissioned in 2009. Lithuania built an offshore oil terminal in the Baltic Sea in 1999. Seven years later, it became the country’s sole crude oil import point after Russia’s surprise move to halt supplies of oil to Lithuania through Russia’s vast Druzhba pipeline network. Rokas Masiulis, the CEO of Litgrid, said Lithuania has 'suffered a great deal' because of Russian actions in the past, such as through halting oil supplies and jacking up prices for gas that his country once depended on. He said Lithuania today has 'much more than we need' in terms of electricity capacity, from both fossil fuels but also increasingly solar and wind. 'So we are safe,' he said. The disconnection with Russia 'is neither bad for them, (nor) bad for us,' Masiulis said. 'We were sort of interconnected and interdependent on each other. Now we will just part our ways.' The three Baltic countries have rebuilt power lines and launched a vast construction and reconstruction program to turn their networks away from Russia and toward the West, the Litgrid CEO added, calling it a technological feat. 'Actions by Russia -- by them being aggressive and pushing their neighbors -- has really helped us,' Masiulis said. 'Maybe we’ve suffered a little with oil prices, with gas prices, but we were forced to act. So we built alternative routes.' 'Now we’re in much better state than we were before,' he added. 'So maybe they wished us ill, but ultimately everything worked very well for us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-nations-count-final-hours-to-ending-electricity-ties-to-russia/7964850.html	2025-02-06T01:48:13-08:00	
Mexico deploys the first of 10,000 troops to US border after Trump's tariff threat	CIUDAD JUÁREZ, MEXICO — A line of Mexican National Guard and Army trucks rumbled along the border separating Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas, on Wednesday, among the first of 10,000 troops Mexico has sent to its northern frontier following tariff threats by President Donald Trump. Masked and armed National Guard members picked through brush running along the border barrier on the outskirts of Ciudad Juárez, pulling out makeshift ladders and ropes tucked away in the trenches, and pulling them onto trucks. Patrols were also seen on other parts of the border near Tijuana. It comes after a turbulent week along the border after Trump announced he would delay imposing crippling tariffs on Mexico for at least a month. In exchange, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised she would send the country’s National Guard to reinforce the border and crack down on fentanyl smuggling. Trump has declared an emergency on the border despite migration levels and fentanyl overdoses significantly dipping over the past year. The U.S. said it would, in turn, do more to stop American guns from being trafficked into Mexico to fuel cartel violence, which has rippled to other parts of the country as criminal groups fight to control the lucrative migrant smuggling industry. On Tuesday, the first of those forces arrived in border cities, climbing out of government planes. Guard members in the Wednesday patrol confirmed that they were part of the new force. 'There will be permanent surveillance on the border,' José Luis Santos Iza, one of the National Guard leaders heading off the deployment in the city, told media upon the arrival of the first set of soldiers. 'This operation is primarily to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, mainly fentanyl.' At least 1,650 troops were expected to be sent to Ciudad Juárez, according to government figures, making it one of the biggest receivers of border reinforcements in the country, second only to Tijuana, where 1,949 are slated to be sent. During U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trip through Latin America — where migration was at the top of the agenda — the top American diplomat thanked the Mexican government for the forces, according to a statement by the Mexican government. The negotiation by Sheinbaum was viewed by observers as a bit of shrewd political maneuvering by the newly elected Mexican leader. Many had previously cast doubt that she’d be able to navigate Trump’s presidency as effectively as her predecessor and ally, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-deploys-the-first-of-10-000-national-guard-troops-to-us-border-after-trump-s-tariff-threat/7964846.html	2025-02-06T01:30:38-08:00	
Russian drone attack damages Kharkiv market	Ukrainian officials reported damage Thursday at a market in the northeastern city of Kharkiv after the latest round of overnight Russian drone attacks targeting multiple parts of the country. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram that debris from a downed drone damaged power lines in the city. Ukraine’s military said its air defenses shot down 56 of the 77 total drones deployed by Russian forces. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, according to the military. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian drone attacks and shelling damaged more than 10 houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 28 Ukrainian drones overnight. About half of the drones were shot down over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said, while Russian forces destroyed the others of the Rostov, Krasnodar and Astrakhan regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-damages-kharkiv-market/7964840.html	2025-02-06T01:13:56-08:00	
Israeli defense minister tells army to prepare for Palestinians to leave Gaza	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday he instructed the army to prepare plans for large numbers of Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip via land crossings as well as sea and air routes. Katz welcomed what he called U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'bold plan' for Gaza residents to leave the territory, which has been devastated by Israeli ground and air attacks targeting Hamas militants. Palestinian officials rejected Trump’s suggestion made in a Tuesday news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United States take ownership of the Gaza Strip, force 2 million Palestinians to move to other countries and then turn the territory along the Mediterranean Sea into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Netanyahu told Fox News late Wednesday that Palestinians could leave Gaza while it is rebuilt and then return. 'It's a remarkable idea, and I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone,' Netanyahu said. Trump’s proposal has met widespread criticism, including from the United Nations, with U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric telling reporters Wednesday that any forced displacement 'is tantamount to ethnic cleansing.' German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Wednesday that Trump’s proposals 'generate deep concern in some people, even horror,' and would be 'unacceptable under international law.' The 22-member Arab League said Trump’s plan 'represents a recipe for instability' and would not advance the prospects of Palestinian statehood. The United States has long supported a negotiated two-state solution to resolve decades of Israel-Palestinian conflict. 'They must be allowed home,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Wednesday. 'They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild, on the way to a two-state solution.' Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Spain all said following Trump’s proposal that they continue to support a two-state solution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Even before Trump called for U.S. ownership of Gaza, Egypt and Jordan had in recent days rejected his suggestion that Gaza’s Palestinian population be relocated to their countries. Egypt's foreign ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding in Gaza 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said Wednesday that deporting people from Israeli-occupied Gaza was illegal. 'The right to self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law and must be protected by all states, as the International Court of Justice recently underlined afresh,' Turk said in a statement. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' Later, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a speech that 'in the search for solutions, we must not make the problem worse. It is vital to stay true to the bedrock of international law. It is essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing.' Fighting in Gaza has halted amid a six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Hamas sparked the war with an October 2023 attack on Israel during which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 people, more than half women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 60 living captives. During the first phase of the ceasefire, the militants have released 18 hostages, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. More people are due to be set free in the coming weeks, and negotiators are working on the details of a planned second phase of the ceasefire that would bring an end to the conflict, free the remaining hostages and see Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-defense-minister-tells-army-to-prepare-for-palestinians-to-leave-gaza/7964838.html	2025-02-06T01:03:45-08:00	
China, Pakistan pledge to boost cooperation on infrastructure, mining projects	HONG KONG — China and Pakistan will upgrade and reconstruct Pakistan's railway network and further develop its Gwadar port, while Chinese companies can invest in the South Asian nation's offshore oil and gas developments, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. The comments came as Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari visits China from Feb. 4-8, where he also will attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Winter Games. Chinese investment and financial support for Pakistan since 2013 have been a boon for the South Asian nation's struggling economy. The two countries have had close ties underpinned by long-standing wariness of their common neighbor, India, and a desire to hedge against U.S. influence across the region. Pakistan and China recognized the importance of Pakistan's 'Gwadar Port and agreed to fully unleash its potential as a key node for connectivity and trade,' Xinhua said quoting a joint statement from the two countries. Chinese-funded enterprises would be encouraged to 'carry out mining investment cooperation in Pakistan' and cooperate in terrestrial and marine geological resources. 'Pakistan welcomes Chinese companies to participate in the development of offshore oil and gas resources in Pakistan.' Longtime Pakistan ally China has thousands of nationals working on projects grouped under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The $65 billion investment is part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, designed to expand Beijing's global reach by road, rail and sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-pakistan-pledge-to-boost-cooperation-on-infrastructure-mining-projects/7964832.html	2025-02-06T00:39:05-08:00	
UK's Grenfell Tower to be demolished more than seven years after blaze	LONDON — London's Grenfell Tower, which was engulfed in flames more than seven years ago in a disaster that killed 72 people, will be demolished, bereaved families and survivors said on Thursday. The fire ripped through the 23-story social housing block in one of London's richest areas during the early hours of June 14, 2017. It was Britain's deadliest blaze in a residential building since World War II. Grenfell Next of Kin (GNK), which represents relatives of nearly half of those who died, said Britain's deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, announced her decision to a room of families and survivors in a meeting on Wednesday evening. According to the group, the demolition of the tower, which remains standing but covered in protective wrap, will start after the eighth anniversary of the tragedy in June this year. Engineers advising the government said the structure of the tower would worsen over time, and that the building, or part of it that was significantly damaged, should be carefully taken down. 'Do we wish the whole tower could stand forever? Yes. Is that an option? Not from a structural point of view,' GNK said. Grenfell United said the voices of bereaved families and survivors were not heard or considered by Rayner, during what they described as a short four-week consultation. 'Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable,' it said. The department of housing, communities and local government did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the decision was confirmed by Joe Powell, the member of parliament for Kensington, the area where the tower is located. He said on X that the decision had not been taken lightly: 'Grenfell Tower will always be in our hearts as a community.' A public inquiry into the fire, which published its final report last year, blamed the disaster on failings by the government, by the construction industry and, most of all, by the firms involved in fitting the exterior with flammable cladding. Several survivors and families have said the inquiry has delayed any criminal proceedings. A commission looking at a future memorial on the site of the disaster said in its 2023 report that if the tower came down it should be 'dismantled with care and respect.' A final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. The decision on the tower's future came after some relatives of those who died raised concerns about a letter notifying them that a small quantity of human remains were still being stored by the police.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-grenfell-tower-to-be-demolished-more-than-seven-years-after-blaze/7964830.html	2025-02-06T00:30:25-08:00	
South Korea's impeached prime minister says Cabinet had concerns over martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's impeached prime minister told parliament on Thursday that 'everyone' in a hastily arranged meeting of ministers expressed concerns about President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law plan before he announced it on Dec. 3. Han Duck-soo, who was briefly acting president after Yoon was impeached and suspended from power on Dec. 14, before being impeached himself, on Thursday joined acting President Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister, in facing parliamentary questioning over their role in the shock martial law decision. 'Everyone objected and expressed worry and raised the problems with this decision to the president,' Han told a special committee, referring to the meeting where Yoon told some cabinet members of his intention to declare martial law. The martial law lasted around six hours before Yoon rescinded the order in the face of opposition from parliament, but it sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy and sparked a spiraling political crisis. Choi told the committee that the biggest challenges in the country right now include the livelihood of the people and changes in the international order. 'There's the need to stabilize government administration,' he said. Yoon appeared on Thursday at a hearing in his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether to reinstate him or remove him permanently from office. Senior military officials testified in the court about their role in deploying to parliament that night. 'My mission was to blockade the parliament building and the members' hall, and secure those buildings,' said Army Colonel Kim Hyun-tae, who personally led about 97 special forces troops on the ground. Kim said after they entered the building, his commander, Kwak Jong-geun, ordered him to get in the main chamber of the building where lawmakers had gathered to lift the martial law. '(My commander) asked if we could get in because he said there shouldn't be more than 150 people,' Kim testified, though he said he did not know the significance of that number at the time, or whether his commander meant lawmakers. Kwak, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, has said he was told to stop 150 lawmakers or more from gathering, the quorum needed to vote down the martial law decree. Kim said he told Kwak his troops were not able to enter the chamber. Eventually 190 lawmakers defied the cordon to vote against Yoon's decision. Kwak took the stand at the court later on Thursday and faced Yoon in the same courtroom. Kwak has been saying that Yoon directly ordered him to 'drag out' lawmakers but Yoon did not ask him to protect civilians or withdraw his troops, contradicting Yoon's claims. Yoon has flatly denied any wrongdoing and allegations about attempted arrests of politicians. He has defended the martial law announcement two months ago as his right as the head of the state. Yoon is in jail and separately faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-impeached-prime-minister-says-cabinet-had-concerns-over-martial-law/7964811.html	2025-02-05T23:16:05-08:00	
2 years after quake disaster, Turkey's painful recovery continues	ANKARA, TURKEY — Two years after the deadliest and most destructive earthquake in modern Turkish history, hundreds of thousands of people remain displaced, with many still living in temporary housing, as rebuilding efforts lag behind initial targets. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Feb. 6, 2023, and its aftershocks rattled 11 Turkish provinces and parts of northern Syria, killing more than 55,000 people and injuring more than 107,000. The disaster reduced entire towns to rubble, including homes, hospitals, and historical landmarks, with Hatay, Kahramanmaras and Adiyaman hardest hit. The government has pledged to build 650,000 homes, with President Tayyip Erdogan promising in the weeks after the tremor that 319,000 would be delivered within a year. 'We are fortunate to have delivered 201,431 independent units to their rightful owners less than two years after the earthquake,' Erdogan said after a Cabinet meeting on Monday. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said $75 billion had been spent on rebuilding across the quake region. The critical phases of reconstruction have been completed, he said, adding that housing and business projects were progressing rapidly. Many residents, however, remain in makeshift conditions, while others have left their home provinces entirely, disrupting communities and livelihoods. Ozgur Ozel, leader of the main opposition CHP, said only 30% of the pledged reconstruction had been completed. The housing completion rate in Hatay, one of the worst-hit provinces, was only 18%, he said. 'Only three out of 10 who believed in Erdogan now have homes, while the other seven are still in containers or seeking refuge in the homes of relatives,' Ozel said on Tuesday. 'How can they look into the eyes of those they forced to live in containers for two years and say, 'We have kept all our promises, thank God'?' Lingering hardships International and local aid groups say a full recovery remains far off, with thousands of Turks still facing barriers to returning home. The Hatay Earthquake Victims' Association said in a report that more than 400,000 people remain in container-home cities, facing poor sanitation, inadequate health care, and an uncertain future. It also raised concerns about asbestos exposure from unregulated demolitions and land seizures under emergency decrees. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that millions of people in Turkey and Syria were still struggling to rebuild their lives. It called the pace of reconstruction 'far too slow' for such a disaster. Delays in reconstruction hurt long-term stability and risk depopulation of the region, some aid groups say. In Hatay, in southernmost Turkey, empty streets, shuttered businesses, and demolition work still define the city, which was once a bustling mixture of cultures and religions, and a draw for tourism. Ankara says its response to the earthquake has been effective and on track. Kurum, the government minister, said 423,000 homes and workplaces will be handed over to survivors by the end of 2025, adding that Turkey had allocated $19 billion for recovery efforts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/years-after-quake-disaster-turkey-s-painful-recovery-continues/7964802.html	2025-02-05T22:35:31-08:00	
Philippine Senate can't hear impeachment until June	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Senate can act on the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte only on June 2, when Congress resumes after the midterm elections, Senate President Francis Escudero told a briefing on Thursday. Escudero said the senators who will act as jurors need to swear an oath while Congress is in session before they can convene as an impeachment court. 'Legally, it cannot be done,' Escudero said. The House of Representatives on Wednesday impeached Duterte, the daughter of the country's firebrand former leader Rodrigo Duterte. The impeachment complaint stemmed from allegations Duterte misused public funds while she was vice president and education minister, amassed unexplained wealth, and threatened the lives of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the first lady and the lower house speaker. She has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. She became the second-most-senior elected official in the Philippines to be impeached after former President Joseph Estrada in 2000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-senate-can-t-hear-impeachment-until-june/7964800.html	2025-02-05T22:25:17-08:00	
US government vessels can sail Panama Canal without fees, US says	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of State said on Wednesday American government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees. 'The government of Panama has agreed to no longer charge fees for U.S. government vessels to transit the Panama Canal,' the department said in a post on X. It said the agreement will save the U.S. government millions of dollars each year. The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday during a trip to Central America. Panama has become a focal point of the Trump administration as President Donald Trump has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its passage. 'If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question,' Trump said last month. Mulino has dismissed Trump's threat that the U.S. retake control of the canal, which it largely built. The U.S. administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the U.S. and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal's return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed it over in 1999 after a period of joint administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-government-vessels-can-sail-panama-canal-without-fees-us-says/7964750.html	2025-02-05T20:05:35-08:00	
What is birthright citizenship?	President Donald Trump is reigniting a fierce debate: Should everyone born on U.S. soil automatically become a citizen? This question strikes at the heart of American identity, history and law. Trump signed an executive order last month seeking to end the right, but two federal judges have placed injunctions on the order, pausing it indefinitely.

New attorney general orders review of Trump cases as she takes over the Justice Dept.	WASHINGTON — New Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday issued a series of directives designed to overhaul a Justice Department that President Donald Trump says is biased against conservatives. Hours after she was sworn in at the White House, Bondi called for the creation of 'weaponization working group' that will scrutinize the work of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump in two criminal cases. The group will also review 'unethical prosecutions' stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to the memo. Trump and his allies have contended that the Justice Department under the Biden administration had become weaponized against conservatives. Some of the department’s most high-profile probes concerned the Democratic president and his son, and there's been no evidence to support the idea that the prosecutions against Trump were launched for a partisan purpose. It was one of 14 directives signed by Bondi designed to roll back Biden administration policies and align the Justice Department with the priorities of a White House that seeks to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees it views as disloyal. Among other directives Bondi signed were orders to lift the moratorium on the federal death penalty and end federal grants administered by the Justice Department for jurisdictions that 'unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement.' The Justice Department will provide quarterly reports to the White House on the progress of the working group’s review, which will look for instances where agencies' actions 'appear to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice,' according to the memo. In another memo, Bondi wrote that prosecutors could face firings if they refuse to sign onto briefs or appear in court to argue on behalf of the administration, saying it's the department lawyers' job to 'vigorously defend presidential policies and actions against legal challenges.' The flurry of activity signals a dramatic reshaping of the Justice Department under Bondi, a longtime Trump ally and former Florida attorney general who defended the president during his first impeachment trial against allegations that he abused the power of his office. Democrats who opposed Bondi's confirmation have raised concerns about whether she would be able to lead a Justice Department free of influence from the White House given her close relationship with the president, who repeatedly suggested on the campaign trail that he would seek to use the justice system to exact revenge on his perceived enemies. Bondi has said that politics will play no role in her decision-making, but she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump's adversaries. She also has repeated Trump's claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, telling senators that the Justice Department 'had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it's got to stop.' Despite the wide-ranging ambitions of the 'weaponization working group' memo, there's no indication that the group will have prosecutorial powers or tools such as subpoenas that could compel subjects of the inquiries to cooperate with the new unit. And though the memo purports to take aim at the 'weaponization' of the Justice Department, it excludes from review investigations into Democrats by Biden's Justice Department, including special counsel probes into the former president's handling of classified information and his son Hunter's gun and tax allegations, which resulted in felony convictions before he was pardoned by his father in December. Smith's team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump's November presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. Bondi takes over department, which has been roiled by the firings of career prosecutors and senior FBI officials, along with the highly unusual scrutiny of thousands of agents involved in the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation. FBI agents this week sued after the Justice Department demanded that the bureau turn over the names of all agents involved in the Jan. 6 probe, which agents believe may be a precursor to mass firings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-attorney-general-orders-review-of-trump-cases-as-she-takes-over-the-justice-dept-/7964766.html	2025-02-05T19:15:31-08:00

British foreign minister meets with Zelenskyy, announces $68.7M financial package	British Foreign Minister David Lammy met Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv and announced a new $68.7 million financial package for Ukraine as its war with Russia continues. 'Our support for Ukraine remains unbreakable,' Lammy said. 'We are determined to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, both in its fight against Russia and beyond.' Later Wednesday, Zelenskyy told reporters that an international force of troops would be needed if forces were deployed to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire deal with Russia. It would be a 'major mistake' if U.S. troops were not included, the president said. 'This isn't just a matter of numbers. It's about sharing responsibility and ensuring security guarantees.' Ukraine and Russia exchanged captured soldiers on Wednesday. Each country returned 150 prisoners of war. Zelenskyy shared on Telegram photographs of some of the Ukrainian soldiers, saying, 'They are all from different sectors of the front, but they have one thing in common — they fought for Ukraine.' A Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia's Krasnodar region, the area's governor said Wednesday. The fire, which was later put out, happened in the village of Novominskaya. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said that debris from a destroyed drone caused the fire, and that there were no injuries. Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down two Ukrainian drones over the Kursk region and two more drones over Belgorod, both of which border Ukraine. Officials in Kursk reported damage to a building but no casualties. Ukraine's military said Wednesday it shot down 57 of the 104 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said the attacks damaged several buildings and injured one person. Officials also reported damage to buildings in Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad and Sumy.

Greenlanders explore Pacific Islands’ relationship with Washington	WASHINGTON — Greenland’s representative in the United States met recently with at least one ambassador from the Pacific Islands to learn more about a political arrangement that some think could create an opportunity for the Arctic island and Washington, VOA has learned. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in either buying or taking control of Greenland, a resource-rich semiautonomous territory of Denmark, noting its strategic importance and position in the Arctic Ocean where Russia and China are rapidly advancing. But there has been pushback from the island’s residents, political leaders, Denmark and Europe. Greenland representatives have declined to comment to VOA on their meeting that focused on a framework that Pacific Island nations have with Washington — known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. The compacts give the United States military access to three strategic Pacific Islands — the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau — in exchange for economic aid. Jackson Soram, ambassador to the United States from the Federated States of Micronesia, told VOA that the discussions took place at the end of January and focused on 'basic questions' on the 'provisions of economic assistance, and also the security and defense provisions of the compacts.' Soram said he met with representatives from Greenland and the Faroe Islands, another self-ruled Danish territory. Alexander Gray, a former National Security Council chief of staff during the first Trump administration who worked on Pacific Island issues, told VOA he encouraged the Pacific Islands’ ambassadors to conduct these meetings. '[The Greenlanders] want independence from Denmark,' Gray, who is now a managing partner of American Global Strategies, said in an emailed response. 'An independent Greenland, with a tiny population and the second-least densely populated geography on the planet, will quickly become dominated and its sovereignty undermined by Beijing and Moscow.' Russia has been reopening bases in the region even as Beijing has invested more than $90 billion in infrastructure projects in the Arctic Circle. Both the United States and Denmark have military bases in Greenland. Gray said arctic dominance by Moscow and Beijing poses 'a unique strategic threat' to the United States. He said a COFA 'would allow Greenland to maintain its sovereignty, while allowing the U.S. to ensure that sovereignty is truly protected.' Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly told Trump that Greenland is 'not for sale.' But Monday, she said Copenhagen welcomes additional U.S. military investment in the strategic island. 'So, if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,' she said. US-Greenland defense agreement Some analysts say that neither Washington nor Nuuk needs a COFA agreement to increase the U.S. military presence in Greenland. In 2004, the United States, Greenland and Denmark signed the Igaliku Agreement to reduce the U.S. military presence in Greenland to a single air base, the Thule Air Base, which has been renamed Pitfuffik Space Base. It provides Washington with missile defense and space surveillance. The 2004 agreement provides for 'any significant changes to U.S. military operations or facilities' in Greenland to be made through consultation between Washington, Nuuk and Copenhagen. 'Washington can already achieve its objectives through working with Greenland and Denmark,' Otto Svendsen, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last month on CSIS’s website. A Danish Institute for International Studies policy brief in 2022 pointed out that COFA has created economic dependence between the Marshall Islands and the United States, as U.S. donor money makes up 70% of the Marshall Islands’ total GDP. This is the opposite of what Greenland’s leaders say they want. Search for independence A 2009 law called the Act on Greenland Self-Government outlines a 'road map' —-drawn up by Nuuk and Copenhagen — for an independent Greenland, which requires a successful referendum. In his New Year’s address, Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede said, 'The upcoming new election period must, together with the citizens, create these new steps,' opening the door for a referendum during parliamentary elections in April. A 2019 survey suggested that more than two-thirds of Greenlanders want independence at some point. Yet in a poll released in January by two newspapers in Denmark and Greenland, 85% say they do not want to be part of the United States. Fifty-five percent, however, see Trump’s interest in Greenland as an opportunity. Gray told VOA that the U.S., Denmark and Greenland should enter trilateral discussions for a compact. 'Working together, Washington, Copenhagen, and Nuuk can find common ground and move forward on a post-independence arrangement that works for all parties,' he said in an emailed response. As far back as 2010, Greenland told the United Nations it was exploring the idea of negotiating independence through a 'free association' with Denmark. Egede said he is ready to meet with Trump, but, 'We do not want to be Danes. We do not want to be Americans.' Soram said he is trying to get ambassadors from Palau and the Marshall Islands to attend additional meetings with Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greenlanders-explore-pacific-islands-relationship-with-washington/7964723.html	2025-02-05T17:48:29-08:00	
Congressional Democrats vow to fight changes at USAID	Congressional Democrats warned President Donald Trump this week that they would use government funding talks as leverage to fight changes at agencies such as USAID, the nation's lead provider of humanitarian aid overseas.

US communications agency reinstates complaints, starts investigating media	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has launched investigations over the past two weeks into three news outlets and reinstated complaints against three others. Earlier this week, CBS News complied with an FCC request to hand over the raw footage and transcript from an October interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The FCC's request for the material was 'unusual,' according to Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under President Bill Clinton. 'The commission doesn't usually ask for transcripts,' he said. That interview is at the center of one FCC complaint — and a $10 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump — that says CBS doctored the interview. CBS denied any wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit, but its parent company, Paramount, is now considering a settlement, according to media reports. The FCC complaint against CBS is one of four that former FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, dismissed earlier in January, saying the complaints 'seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.' Rosenworcel's successor, Trump-appointed Republican chair Brendan Carr, revived the CBS complaint, plus complaints against NBC and ABC. He did not revive a complaint against Fox News, which Rosenworcel had also dismissed. In an interview with CNN, Carr defended the inquiry into CBS. 'I don't see how the FCC can reasonably adjudicate this claim of news distortion without seeing what was actually said,' Carr said. On Wednesday afternoon, CBS published the unedited transcripts on its website, showing that the shows '60 Minutes' and 'Face the Nation' used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common practice in journalism. FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, has said the move against CBS was 'designed to instill fear in broadcast stations.' On Wednesday, she called on the FCC to 'dismiss this fishing expedition to avoid further politicizing our enforcement actions' because the transcript and footage showed 'no evidence' that CBS and its affiliates had violated FCC rules. The 'news distortion' complaint against ABC claims fact-checking by the moderators in the preelection Harris-Trump TV debate favored Harris. The complaint against NBC claims Harris' appearance on the comedy show 'Saturday Night Live' shortly before the election violated 'equal time' rules that govern political programming. Soon after, NBC provided Trump with equal time by giving him a chance to directly address voters following a NASCAR race. ABC, CBS and NBC did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment. The Center for American Rights, which filed the three complaints, told VOA it applauded Carr's decision to reopen them. 'Broadcasters are required to serve the public interest in exchange for their access to the public airwaves,' Daniel Suhr, the group's president, said in an emailed statement. 'Free speech does not include blatantly distorting the news or violating long-standing commission rules,' Suhr added. 'We are encouraged to see Chairman Carr addressing these serious issues.' But Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, told VOA she believes the three complaints don't have any merit because NBC eventually gave Trump equal time, and the CBS and ABC complaints pertain to content. 'It's the idea that the FCC would punish news organizations for editorial decisions,' she said. 'It challenges almost the entire history of the FCC and how the FCC looks at content.' The FCC has also launched investigations into National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and radio station KCBS, which is based in San Francisco, California. 'It is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements,' Carr wrote in a January 29 letter notifying the two outlets about the investigations. The FCC does not directly regulate NPR, PBS or other major networks. But the independent government agency does evaluate the actions of public broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves. If an FCC investigation finds wrongdoing, the agency can impose a fine or revoke a station's broadcast license. Public broadcasting stations are not allowed to run commercials, so they run corporate underwriting spots, which are similar to commercials but don't include a 'call to action' urging listeners to do things such as buy a specific product. Both NPR and PBS have rejected any wrongdoing. What stood out to Zarkin about the NPR and PBS investigations is how broad they are, she said. These kinds of investigations are typically directed at specific member stations and refer to specific incidents, she said, but that's not the case here. 'The idea that they're sweepingly investigating NPR and PBS just in general — that's not how the FCC has historically done business,' said Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC. On Monday, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene invited the CEOs of NPR and PBS to testify at a subcommittee hearing on what she considers 'systemically biased news coverage' from the outlets. NPR and PBS receive a small amount of federal funding from the U.S.-chartered Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Their reporting should 'serve the entire public,' Greene said, 'not just a narrow slice of like-minded individuals.' In his letter to NPR and PBS, Carr said he was sharing it with lawmakers because he thought it could inform the debate about whether to cut funding to the two outlets. 'For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media marketplace,' Carr wrote. During his campaign, Trump threatened to revoke broadcasters' licenses if elected. The recent flurry of FCC investigations and complaints has raised press freedom concerns among media experts and current and former Democratic FCC commissioners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-communications-agency-reinstates-complaints-starts-investigating-media/7964421.html	2025-02-05T16:50:34-08:00	
Trump signs order intended to ban transgender athletes from female sports	U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. The order, titled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,' gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration's view, which interprets 'sex' as the gender someone was assigned at birth. 'With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over,' Trump said at a signing ceremony in the East Room that included lawmakers and female athletes who have come out in support of a ban, including former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order 'upholds the promise of Title IX' and will require 'immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations' that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms. Advocates condemn move The order was condemned by trans-rights advocates, including the National Women's Law Center and GLAAD. 'Contrary to what the president wants you to believe, trans students do not pose threats to sports, schools or this country, and they deserve the same opportunities as their peers to learn, play and grow up in safe environments,' said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center. The timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day and is the latest in a string of executive actions from the Republican president aimed at transgender people. The order offers some clarity. For example, it authorizes the Education Department to penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to compete, citing noncompliance with Title IX, which prohibits sexual discrimination in schools. Any school found in violation could potentially be ineligible for federal funding. Enforcing Trump's orders will be a priority of the department. In a call this week, the acting director of the Office for Civil Rights told staff they would need to align their investigations with Trump's priorities, according to people who were on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to AP for fear of reprisals. Since Trump took office, the department has opened an inquiry into Denver, Colorado, public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls' bathroom, while leaving another one exclusive to boys. Trump also issued a warning to the International Olympic Committee ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president said he had empowered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make it clear to the IOC that 'America categorically rejects transgender lunacy. We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.' The IOC has deferred to the international federations for each sport. That could change, however, when a new IOC president comes on to replace the retiring Thomas Bach. Former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics, is among the candidates up for election in March. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women. Trump also said that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will 'deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes to try and get into the Games.' Organizers for the 2028 Olympics did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Other actions focus on gender The order is the latest of a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting transgender people. Previous ones have sought to have the federal government reject the idea that people can transition to a gender other than the one assigned at birth. That has implications for areas including passports and prisons. Trump also has opened the door to barring transgender service members from the military; called to end federal health insurance and other funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people younger than 19; and restrict the way lessons on gender can be taught in schools. Pushback on some of the administration's initiatives has begun in court. Transgender people have sued over several of the policies, and more lawsuits are likely to come. Civil rights lawyers handling the cases have asserted that in some instances, Trump's orders violate laws adopted by Congress and protections in the Constitution — and that they overstep the authority of the president. There could be similar questions for this order, for instance: Can the president demand that the NCAA change its policies? NCAA President Charlie Baker said its Board of Governors was reviewing the order and 'will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration.' Baker, who said last year he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender, noted the order at least provides a uniform policy instead of a patchwork of state laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-ban-transgender-athletes-from-female-sports/7964689.html	2025-02-05T16:42:00-08:00	
Second bird flu strain found in US dairy cattle, agriculture agency says	U.S. dairy cattle tested positive for a strain of bird flu that previously had not been seen in cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday, ramping up concerns about the persistent spread of the virus. The H5N1 virus has reduced milk output in cattle, pushed up egg prices by wiping out millions of hens, and infected nearly 70 people since April as it has spread across the country. Genome sequencing of milk from Nevada identified the different strain, known as the D1.1 genotype, in dairy cows for the first time, the USDA said. Previously, all 957 bird flu infections among dairy herds reported since last March had been caused by another strain, the B3.13 genotype, according to the agency. Reuters reported news of the detection of the second strain on Wednesday ahead of USDA's announcement. The second strain was the predominant genotype among wild birds this past fall and winter and has also been found in poultry, the USDA said. It was identified in dairy cattle through an agency program that began testing milk for bird flu in December. 'We're seeing the H5N1 virus itself be smarter than all of us,' said Beth Thompson, South Dakota's state veterinarian. 'It's modifying itself so it's not just staying in the poultry and the wild waterfowl. It's picking up a home in the mammals.' Wild birds likely transmitted the second strain to cattle in Nevada, said J.J. Goicoechea, Nevada's agriculture director. Farmers need to ramp up safety and security measures to protect their animals, he said. 'We obviously aren't doing everything we can and everything we should or the virus wouldn't be getting in,' he said. The Nevada Department of Agriculture said on Jan. 31 that herds in two counties had been placed under quarantine because of bird flu detections. It is important for the USDA to contain the outbreak in the state quickly, so the strain does not spread to dairy cattle elsewhere, said Gail Hansen, a veterinary and public health consultant. Last year, bird flu spread across the country as infected cattle were shipped from Texas after the virus first leapt to cows from wild birds. 'We didn't get a hold on it before,' Hansen said. 'We want to avoid that same scenario from happening in Nevada.' Dairy herds that were formerly infected may be at risk again from the second strain, experts said. 'Now it looks like we have new strains of virus that may escape some of the immunity associated with the other strains of viruses that could exacerbate the epidemics among animals and wildlife,' said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. 'It's alarming.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-bird-flu-strain-found-in-us-dairy-cattle-agriculture-agency-says/7964683.html	2025-02-05T16:40:54-08:00

French PM survives no-confidence vote	France's prime minister survived a no-confidence vote by parliament on Wednesday after he invoked special constitutional powers to force through the country's 2025 budget. Only 128 lawmakers voted in favor of the no-confidence motion against Francois Bayrou, falling short of the 289 votes required to pass. Far-left lawmakers called for the measure after Bayrou invoked Article 49.3, which grants the minority government special constitutional powers to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote. The no-confidence motion appeared to have no chance of succeeding after the Socialists and the far-right National Rally lawmakers announced they would not support it. Under France's Constitution, the no-confidence motion's failure meant that the 2025 budget automatically became law. The French political scene has been challenging since President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections last year, a move that resulted in no party having a majority in parliament.

UN: Deaths near 3,000 in fighting for DRC's Goma	UNITED NATIONS — A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Wednesday that nearly 3,000 people have been killed in a fighting between M23 militants and the national army over control of a key eastern city. Vivian van de Perre, the deputy head of the United Nations mission in the DRC, told reporters in a video call from Goma that U.N. teams are 'actively helping' the M23 to collect the dead from the city’s streets. She said that, so far, 2,000 bodies have been retrieved and 900 others are in hospital morgues. 'We expect this number to go up,' she said. 'There are still many decomposing bodies in many areas. The World Health Organization is really worried about what kind of epidemic outbreaks that can contribute to.' In early January, the M23 broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the mineral-rich east with the support of the Rwandan army. On Jan. 27, the M23 said it had captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and a city of more than a million people, thousands of whom have been displaced from other conflict areas. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, an armed Hutu group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. M23 holds Goma Van de Perre said Goma is 'firmly under control at the moment of M23.' The Congolese government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. 'All exit routes from Goma are under their control, and the airport, also under M23 control, is closed until further notice,' she told reporters. 'The escalating violence has led to immense human suffering, displacement and a growing humanitarian crisis.' She said nearly 2,000 civilians are sheltering at U.N. peacekeeping bases in Goma and that 'our bases are full, full, full.' She said they cannot handle any more people, and they are concerned that the overcrowding and unsanitary conditions could lead to disease outbreaks at the bases. Water and electricity had been cut off to the city during the intense fighting but have been partially restored. Markets are also reopening, but van de Perre said prices have skyrocketed. She said peacekeepers with the U.N. mission, known as MONUSCO, are operating under limited movements imposed by the M23. They are not patrolling the city, but they are able to resupply their bases. 'Any movement we have to announce 48 hours in advance,' she said. Asked about reports that M23 rebels have suspended some aid work and are interfering with the work of journalists, she said that there are indications of harassment, but that she did not know the extent of it. On the move The M23 is reported to be progressing toward the South Kivu capital of Bukavu. Van de Perre said heavy fighting has been reported along the main route between Kinyezire and Nyabibwe. 'In Bukavu, tensions are rising as the M23 moves closer, just 50 kilometers north of the city,' she said. MONUSCO has been in the process of drawing down its peacekeepers at the request of the Congolese government. In June, it left South Kivu province entirely. 'While the 4 February unilateral ceasefire announced by the M23 offers assurances that Bukavu will not be taken, we are gravely concerned for Kavumu airport, which is critical for ongoing civilian and humanitarian use,' she said of South Kivu’s airport.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-deaths-near-3-000-in-fighting-for-drc--goma/7964371.html	2025-02-05T14:42:39-08:00

Rubio pledges support for Guatemala's infrastructure, issues foreign aid waivers	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday the U.S. plans to support Guatemala with new infrastructure projects and to sign waivers on foreign aid to strengthen the United States' partnership with the Central American country. Speaking alongside Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo in a joint press conference, Rubio said he had signed 'a letter of support' pledging full State Department cooperation on a partnership between Guatemala and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The initiative aims to 'begin preliminary planning for the expansion' of 'two new port facilities,' along with highway and railroad connections to position Guatemala as a regional trade hub and boost its economic opportunities. 'Today, I'll be signing waivers on foreign aid that will continue that partnership, and hope to build on it,' Rubio told reporters. Deportation flight Guatemala has reached a new migration agreement with the United States and will accept more deportation flights, Arevalo announced Wednesday after talks with Rubio. 'In this framework, we have agreed to increase by 40% the number of flights of deportees' of Guatemalan nationals and 'deportees from other nationalities' for repatriation, said the president through a translator. He clarified that the 'safe third country' was not discussed in title or content, emphasizing that the new arrangement with the U.S. ensures safe and humane conditions for repatriation. Safe third country agreement In 2019, former Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales signed an Asylum Cooperative Agreement, commonly known as the safe third country agreement, with the first Trump administration. The agreement was seen as part of Trump's strategy to curb the flow of migrants to the United States. In 2021, the Biden administration fulfilled a campaign promise and suspended the agreement, which allowed the U.S. to deny asylum seekers at the border and deport them to a designated third country, where they would be required to apply for asylum. Critics argued that the policy exposed asylum seekers to unsafe conditions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-pledges-support-for-guatemala-s-infrastructure-issues-foreign-aid-waivers/7964367.html	2025-02-05T14:19:33-08:00	
UN sounds alarm over Pakistan's new Afghan deportation plans	ISLAMABAD — The United Nations agencies focused on refugees and migration jointly voiced their concerns Wednesday over Pakistan's plans to begin a new round of mass deportations of Afghan refugees and asylum-seekers. The reaction came a week after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a multistage plan targeting nearly 3 million Afghan citizens residing in Pakistan. They include legally declared refugees, documented as well as undocumented migrants, and those who are awaiting promised relocation to the United States and other Western countries. The official plan seen by VOA mandates the immediate relocation of all Afghans from the national capital, Islamabad, and the adjacent city of Rawalpindi to designated camps before their repatriation to Afghanistan. The document emphasized without mentioning a timeline that no public announcement should be made regarding the deportations. In a joint statement Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration, IOM, said they 'are seeking clarity over the modality and timeframe of this relocation.' Both agencies urged Pakistan to consider human rights standards when implementing relocation measures. This includes ensuring due process for legal refugees and economic migrants who have been granted Afghan Citizen Cards or ACC, by Pakistan in collaboration with IOM, the statement explained. Official estimates put the ACC population at more than 800,000. 'Forced return to Afghanistan could place some people at increased risk. We urge Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,' said Philippa Candler, the UNHCR country representative. Mio Sato, the IOM chief of mission in Islamabad, said her organization is committed to working with the Pakistani government and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan. 'This will open the door to tailored solutions, including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country,' she said. In the first phase, the deportation plan requires authorities to relocate people possessing an ACC, along with undocumented Afghan migrants, from Islamabad and Rawalpindi and send them back to Afghanistan. Pakistan has allowed more than 1.4 million legal Afghan refugees to remain in the country until June 30, 2025. The new plan requires their relocation from the two cities in the second phase without stating whether they will also be deported to Afghanistan. Sharif has also ordered authorities to deport around 40,000 Afghans from Islamabad and Rawalpindi by March 31 in the third phase of the deportation plan and subsequently arrange for their repatriation if their relocation and resettlement cases to third countries are not processed expeditiously. These individuals fled Afghanistan after the Taliban regained control of the country in 2021, primarily seeking shelter from potential retribution due to their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces. Last month, President Donald Trump halted the U.S. Refugee Admission Program to assess whether reinstating it serves the interests of Washington, leaving at least 15,000 Afghan allies in Pakistan approved or being assessed for relocation to the U.S. in a state of uncertainty. Since 2023, Pakistani authorities have forcibly repatriated more than 800,000 undocumented Afghans from its territory. The deportations resulted from a government crackdown on foreigners living in the country without legal permission or whose visas had expired. Islamabad has attributed a recent rise in crimes and militancy in Pakistan to Afghan nationals. UNHCR and IOM said that they recognize the challenges Islamabad faces, especially in security, and that refugees, like all, must abide by Pakistan’s laws. 'The overwhelming majority of Afghan nationals in Pakistan are law-abiding individuals whose situation needs to be seen through a humanitarian lens,' they said in their joint statement. The two U.N. agencies expressed their particular concern for Afghan nationals who may face harm upon their return, including ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists and members of artistic professions such as musicians. The Islamist Taliban leaders have placed sweeping restrictions on women’s access to education, employment and public life and have banned music in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-sounds-alarm-over-pakistan-s-new-afghan-deportation-plans/7964352.html	2025-02-05T14:11:50-08:00	
Scores killed in Somalia in clash between security forces, Islamic State	WASHINGTON — Nearly 70 people were killed and up to 50 others wounded during 24 hours of fighting between Islamic State fighters and security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Wednesday. At least 15 Puntland soldiers and more than 50 militants were slain in the fierce fighting around the Dharin and Qurac areas of the Cal Miskaad mountains in Puntland’s Bari region, multiple Puntland security officials told VOA, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. In an interview Wednesday with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, said the fighting, which began Tuesday, was the heaviest since Puntland launched an offensive last month against Islamic State groups that have hideouts in the mountains. 'We have confirmed that at least 57 Islamic State militants, all of them foreigners, were killed during the fighting in the last 24 hours,' Ahmed said. Ahmed declined to say how many Puntland soldiers were wounded or lost but suggested casualties were heavy. 'The fighting is taking place in a mountainous area where the militants are using improvised explosives. The fighting of this nature in such an environment, the attacking force often suffers more casualties than the defenders,' he said. VOA could not independently verify the claim of 57 militants killed but graphic video circulated on social media was said to show scenes of militants’ bodies strewn in a mountainous area. Ahmed said Tuesday night the United Arab Emirates conducted a drone strike against the IS militants in the area to support Puntland forces. A statement from the Puntland forces said their troops have gained ground. 'Puntland forces have successfully captured the strategic village of Dharin in Togga Jecel, dealing a significant blow to the extremist group’s operational capabilities in the region,' the statement said. It added: 'The forces have expelled the enemy from the areas they fought along the Togga Jecel.' These latest clashes came just days after U.S. warplanes targeted the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the airstrike Saturday on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud thanked the U.S. for its 'unwavering support' in the 'fight against international terrorism.' Military campaign Puntland began a military offensive dubbed 'Hilac Campaign' last month against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. Claims by Puntland commanders made regarding different battles indicate more than 150 Islamic State militants have been killed. Puntland’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, appealed to the public to support the operation, which he said is aimed at dislodging the Islamic State militants from their hideouts in mountainous areas. The operation has garnered public support. Monday, hundreds of residents took to the streets of Bosaso, the commercial hub of Puntland state, to demonstrate against the terrorist group and show support for the military campaign. Puntland is a member state of Somalia but its relationship with the country’s federal government has been strained by political conflicts and the region is considered semi-autonomous. Analysts say the rift between the two sides has limited any collaboration between the federal government and the Puntland regional state, including the fight against terrorists. 'An operation like this needs logistical support and reinforcements, and the regional states alone cannot handle it. Federal government support and involvement is a must,' Somalia’s former Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmake told VOA. 'The Islamic State is a common enemy for Somalis. Politicians should separate the national interests and the political differences that can be later solved through negotiations. National interests including security and development should not be politicized,' former national intelligence chief Brigadier General Abdirahman Turyare told VOA. IS in Puntland Puntland has endured terrorist attacks perpetrated by al-Shabab and Islamic State militants, but the ongoing military operation appears to be focused on IS. The group has a relatively small presence in Somalia compared to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, but experts have warned of growing activity. U.S. military officials and Somali security experts reported that IS increased its membership numbers in Somalia last year. The group was previously estimated to have between 100 and 400 fighters, but Somali security and intelligence experts say the number has grown to between 500 and 600. Most of the newcomers are said to be from the Middle East and eastern and northern Africa.

10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrive at Guantanamo Bay	PENTAGON — The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the 'the worst of the worst' — are being held in jail cells at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. The Pentagon Wednesday confirmed 10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrived Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. VOA first reported on the transfer — and arrival — of the migrants, flown from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Guantanamo Bay aboard a U.S. military C-17 cargo plane Tuesday. According to the Pentagon, the detention of the high-threat migrants at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is a temporary measure. ICE 'is taking this measure to ensure the safe and secure detention of these individuals until they can be transported to their country of origin or other appropriate destination' the Pentagon said in a statement. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military cargo plane, calling them 'the worst of the worst,' and warning the effort to deport them is just getting started. The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on the military flight were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Noem, posting on X on Wednesday, said her department has overseen the arrest of 'convicted murderers, rapists, child abusers, drug traffickers, MS-13 gang members, cartel members,' in just the past few days. Since President Donald Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News. 'The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead federal agency,' U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a statement on Monday. The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. 'If you're a violent gang banger, and you've been taken out of our country, and we're waiting to bring you to your country, we're going to put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News this week. In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. 'Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So, we're going to send them out to Guantanamo,' Trump said. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the administration of former President George W. Bush in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 'The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,' Hendrickson said. At its height during the global war on terror campaign, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.

Trump's plan for US to take over Gaza meets mixed reactions	U.S. President Donald Trump’s idea for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip has shocked Israelis and Palestinians.

Trump's birthright citizenship order gets put on hold by 2nd federal judge	GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday ordered a second temporary pause on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in the country has endorsed the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. 'This court will not be the first,' she said. Trump's inauguration week order had already been on temporary hold nationally because of a separate lawsuit brought by four states in Washington state, where a judge called the order 'blatantly unconstitutional.' In total, 22 states, as well as other organizations, have sued to try to stop the executive action. Boardman, nominated by former President Joe Biden, agreed to the preliminary injunction after a hearing in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland. Bringing the suit before Boardman are immigrant-rights advocacy groups CASA and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and a handful of expectant mothers. At the heart of the lawsuits is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that determined Scott, a slave, wasn't a citizen. 'The principle of birthright citizenship is a foundation of our national democracy, is woven throughout the laws of our nation, and has shaped a shared sense of national belonging for generation after generation of citizens,' the plaintiffs argued in the suit. The Trump administration asserts that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. 'The Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to, inter alia: the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,' the government argued in reply to the Maryland plaintiffs' suit. The 14th Amendment was added in the aftermath of the Civil War to ensure citizenship for former slaves and free African Americans. It states: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' In addition to the 22 states with Democratic attorneys general seeking to stop the order, 18 Republican attorneys general announced this week that they're seeking to defend the president's order by joining one of the federal suits brought in New Hampshire. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. During his first week in office, Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration and issued edicts to carry out promises of mass deportations and border security. Some actions were felt immediately. Others face legal challenges. If they happen at all, other orders may take years to happen but have led to fear in immigrant communities. Whether Trump can enact his agenda could come down to money. Congress is expected to consider funding support soon. Trump may use emergency powers to tap the Defense Department, as he did for a border wall during his first term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order-gets-put-on-hold-by-2nd-federal-judge/7964060.html	2025-02-05T10:18:33-08:00	
Countries’ leaders denounce Trump proposal for US ownership of Gaza	U.S. allies and adversaries alike on Wednesday denounced President Donald Trump’s proposal for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip, force 2 million Palestinians to move to other countries and then turn the territory along the Mediterranean Sea into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' The world reaction to Trump’s suggestion, offered at a White House news conference Tuesday evening alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was swift and mostly universal in opposition to the idea advanced by the one-time New York real estate magnate. Britain, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia and Spain said they continue to support a two-state solution — creation of an independent Palestinian state that would include Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank existing next to Israel. The two-state proposal, aimed at ending decades of Middle East conflict and wars, has long been the bedrock of U.S. policy in the region even though Netanyahu’s government opposes it. Saudi Arabia, an important oil-producing American ally in the Middle East, weighed in quickly in a sharply worded statement, saying its call for an independent Palestinian state was a 'firm, steadfast and unwavering position.' 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year, as it was 10 years ago,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in support of a two-state solution. Netanyahu offered support for the plan, saying Tuesday that one of his war goals is to ensure that Palestinian militant group Hamas never again poses a threat to Israel. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is 'taking it to a much higher level.' 'I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,' he said. Trump was noncommittal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the two-state solution. His plan on Gaza 'doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one-state or any other state,' he said. Palestinians, nearby countries reject Trump ideas Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Even before Trump called for U.S. ownership of Gaza, Egypt and Jordan had in recent days rejected his suggestion that Gaza’s Palestinian population be relocated to their countries. Egypt's Foreign Ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding in Gaza 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said Wednesday that deporting people from Israeli-occupied Gaza was illegal. 'The right to self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law and must be protected by all states, as the International Court of Justice recently underlined afresh,' Turk said in a statement. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' Trump sees ‘unlimited jobs’ with Gaza development But Trump said at his news conference that Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would come around to his idea, contending they will 'open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done and people can live in harmony and in peace.' Trump’s Gaza proposal was his first major Middle East policy statement since taking office for a second four-year term two weeks ago. Trump said he envisioned building a resort on the shores of the Mediterranean where international communities could live in harmony. Much of the coastal territory currently lies in ruins, after more than 15 months of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 47,000 people, more than half women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Trump’s Gaza proposal comes amid a six-week ceasefire to halt the fighting that erupted Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 250 as hostages. About 60 living captives are still believed to be held by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. During the truce so far, Hamas has released 18 hostages, while Israel in exchange has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. At his news conference, Trump said, 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs. 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,' he said. Trump offered no details on how he plans to exert control over Gaza, which has been decimated by the war, but he did not rule out sending in U.S. troops. 'If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, and we’re going to develop it,' he said. Trump’s Gaza ownership idea was a pronounced shift from his past criticism of America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. Trump said he envisions a 'long-term ownership position' for the U.S. that would bring 'great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.' 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he said. The U.S. leader’s Gaza overture was his latest suggestion of an American show of force in far-flung reaches of the world. He has voiced the need for the U.S. to retake control of the Panama Canal from the Panamanian government; buy Greenland, for centuries a Danish territory, and for Canada to be annexed to become the 51st U.S. state. Panama, Denmark and Canada have all rejected his demands. Reactions in the United States Several U.S. lawmakers joined the chorus of world leaders opposing Trump’s Gaza offering. Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware called the comments 'offensive and insane and dangerous and foolish.' The idea, Coons said, 'risks the rest of the world thinking that we are an unbalanced and unreliable partner because our president makes insane proposals.' Coons noted the irony of the proposal coming shortly after Trump had moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, the prime conduit for U.S. foreign aid. Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American member of Congress from Michigan, accused Trump in a social media post of 'openly calling for ethnic cleansing' with the idea of resettling Gaza's entire population. But a Trump supporter, Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, adopted a light-hearted assessment, saying, 'Let’s turn Gaza into Mar-A-Lago,' referring to Trump’s Atlantic oceanside resort residence and club in south Florida that he calls the Winter White House. House Speaker Mike Johnson, the leader of the narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives, offered support for Trump’s Gaza takeover, saying, 'Yeah, we're trying to get the details of it, but I think this is a good development.' Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune, in a neutral view, said Trump 'wants a more peaceful and secure Middle East and put some ideas out there.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/countries-leaders-denounce-trump-proposal-for-us-ownership-of-gaza/7963989.html	2025-02-05T09:38:48-08:00	
Earthquakes keep rattling Greece's volcanic island of Santorini every few minutes	ATHENS, GREECE — Earthquakes rattled Greece's volcanic island of Santorini every few minutes through the night and into Wednesday as authorities bolstered their emergency plans in case the hundreds of temblors over the past few days are a harbinger of a larger quake to come. A coast guard vessel and a military landing craft were in the wider area as a contingency should an evacuation be required, Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said Wednesday during an emergency meeting with security officials, scientists and the prime minister in Athens. 'We are obliged to draw up scenarios for better and for worse regarding the prolonged seismic activity,' Kikilias said during the meeting, which was televised live. Predicting earthquakes is not scientifically possible, and experts cannot yet determine definitively whether the seismic activity between the islands of Santorini and Amorgos could be a precursor to a significantly larger earthquake, or is part of an earthquake swarm that could continue shaking the area with small or moderate intensity quakes for weeks or months. 'I understand the fear of what it means at the moment to be on a Santorini that is constantly moving,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, as he called on residents to remain calm and follow authorities' instructions. Rescue crews with a sniffer dog and drones have been deployed on Santorini as a precaution since Sunday, while authorities have banned access to several coastal areas and ordered schools on several islands to shut for the week. Public events on Santorini have been banned, and local authorities were restricting access to clifftop areas that are among the biggest tourist draws to the island. Thousands of residents and visitors have already left Santorini, frightened by the hundreds of earthquakes measuring between magnitude 3 and magnitude 5 that have struck the area since the weekend. Ferry lines and commercial airlines have added ships and flights to their schedules this week to accommodate the increased demand. However, ferry services were disrupted on Wednesday due to rough weather. The quakes, which all have epicenters beneath the seabed between Santorini and the Amorgos, have so far caused no injuries or major damage, although limited rockslides and cracks in some older buildings have been reported on Santorini. Greece lies in a highly seismically active part of the world and earthquakes are frequent. But it is extremely rare for any part of the country to experience such an intense barrage of frequent earthquakes. Last week, authorities said monitors had picked up increased volcanic activity within Santorini's caldera, or flooded crater, but scientists say this is unrelated to the current quakes. They have also said the seismic activity northeast of the island is unlikely to trigger either of the two volcanoes in the area. Southeast Aegean regional governor Giorgos Hatzimarkos told Greek state television that the country's electricity provider had sent staff and equipment to the island to prepare contingency plans in case of power cuts, while civil engineers were checking the road network. Digital Governance Deputy Minister Konstantinos Kyranakis said the government was working with telecommunications providers to ensure backup plans in case of a network outage in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquakes-keep-rattling-greece-s-volcanic-island-of-santorini-every-few-minutes/7963901.html	2025-02-05T08:12:18-08:00	
Argentina says it will withdraw from WHO, echoing Trump	BUENOS AIRES — President Javier Milei has ordered Argentina's withdrawal from the World Health Organization due to profound differences with the U.N. agency, a presidential spokesperson said Wednesday. Milei's action echoes that of his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, who began the process of pulling the United States out of the WHO with an executive order on his first day back in office on Jan. 21. Argentina's decision is based on 'profound differences in health management, especially during the [COVID19] pandemic,' spokesperson Manuel Adorni said at a news conference in Buenos Aires. He said that WHO guidelines at the time had led to the largest shutdown 'in the history of mankind.' He also said that the WHO lacked independence because of the political influence of some countries, without elaborating which countries. Argentina will not allow an international organization to intervene in its sovereignty 'and much less in our health,' Adorni said. The WHO is the United Nations’ specialized health agency and is the only organization mandated to coordinate global responses to acute health crises, particularly outbreaks of new diseases and persistent threats such as Ebola, AIDS and mpox.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-says-it-will-withdraw-from-who-echoing-trump/7963895.html	2025-02-05T08:11:09-08:00

Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson: A populist legacy revisited	One of U.S. President Donald Trump’s first moves upon returning to the Oval Office was restoring a portrait of Andrew Jackson, a president he often cites as a source of inspiration. But this act of decor is more than symbolic — it underscores striking parallels between Trump and Jackson in their governing styles, populist messaging and shared defiance of political elites. Here's how the two presidents compare and why the connection matters.

US deportation flight carrying illegal Indian migrants lands in Punjab	New Delhi — A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump administration launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants. The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104 deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner. New Delhi, which does not want to make illegal immigration a contentious issue with Washington, has said that it is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States if their nationality is verified. President Donald Trump said last week that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would 'do what's right' in taking back illegal immigrants. His comment came following a phone conversation with Modi. In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a media briefing on Friday that India and the United States are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration and 'cooperation between India and the U.S. is strong and effective in this domain. This will be evident in times to come.' Trade and migration are expected to be key issues during a meeting that could take place next week between Trump and Modi. 'India does not want to focus on the issue of illegal migrants being deported. We know it is big business in India, sending migrants illegally. Instead, the government’s interest is in ensuring that legal migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted by the Trump administration,' according to Manoj Joshi, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Those legal routes are H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for students. 'Both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration, while also creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the U.S.,' Jaiswal has said. The number of Indian migrants attempting to enter the U.S. unlawfully has grown in recent years, with India now accounting for the largest number of illegal immigrants to the United States from Asian countries, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Their overall numbers, however, are still small; Indians account for only about 3 percent of illegal crossings. The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, according to a Bloomberg report last week. Deportation flights to India are not new — between October 2023 and September 2024, more than 1,000 Indian nationals were repatriated, but Wednesday's flight was the first time that they were sent back via military aircraft. The deportation flight was routed to Amritsar city in Punjab, which is among the three states where much of the illegal migration from India to the U.S. originates. The others are Haryana in the north and the western state of Gujarat. Hours before the flight landed, Punjab’s minister for NRI (Non-Resident Indians) Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, urged people in the state to avoid illegal migration and instead focus on acquiring skills and education to access global opportunities through legal channels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportation-flight-carrying-illegal-indian-migrants-lands-in-punjab-/7963746.html	2025-02-05T06:09:08-08:00

US Postal Service suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong	HONG KONG/SEOUL/SHANGHAI — The U.S. Postal Service said it would temporarily suspend parcels from China and Hong Kong, after President Donald Trump ended a trade provision this week used by retailers including Temu and Shein to ship low-value packages duty-free to the U.S. The Trump administration imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods that came into effect on Tuesday and moved to close the 'de minimis' exemption that allows U.S. shoppers to avoid paying tariffs for shipments below $800. The extra tariff and the elimination of de minimis follow repeated warnings by Trump that Beijing was not doing enough to halt the flow of fentanyl, a dangerous synthetic opioid, into the U.S. Reuters reported previously that Chinese suppliers use the duty-free provision to export chemical materials for fentanyl by disguising them as gadgets and other low-cost goods. 'This is huge... People waiting for orders from Amazon, Shein and Temu have no way of knowing when they can receive those orders,' said Ram Ben Tzion, founder of Ultra Information Solution, the firm behind digital shipment vetting platform Publican. USPS said the change will not impact the flow of letters and 'flats' — mail that can be up to 15 inches (38 cm) long or 3/4 inches (1.9 cm) thick — from China and Hong Kong. It did not immediately comment on whether this was tied to Trump's change to ending de minimis shipments from China and other countries. 'The USPS would require some time to sort out how to execute the new taxes before allowing Chinese packages to arrive in the U.S. again,' said Chelsey Tam, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. 'This is a significant challenge for them because there were 4 million de minimis packages per day in 2024, and it is difficult to check all the packages — so it will take time.' At a Hong Kong post office, a businessman who had come to check the status of a package he sent to the U.S. earlier expressed frustration after a staffer told him it wasn't possible to ascertain where his delivery might be now. 'This political war is affecting the local people, not just in Hong Kong but in other places too. It's very disturbing for us,' John Khan, who has run a trading business for nearly 30 years, told Reuters. China's foreign ministry called on Wednesday for dialog and consultation between Beijing and Washington, adding that reducing demand for drugs at home and enhancing law enforcement cooperation was the fundamental way for the U.S. to solve its fentanyl crisis. Greater scrutiny Logistics provider Easyship warned clients who regularly send sub-$800 shipments to the U.S. were likely to face much greater scrutiny and advised them to set up distribution centers within the U.S., partner with a local warehouse or U.S. fulfillment center. Some other international couriers including FedEx FDX.N and SF Express, China's largest express delivery company, said they continue to send packages to the U.S. FedEx, however, added it had suspended its money-back guarantee for U.S. inbound shipments effective Jan. 29, citing recent regulatory changes, according to a notice on its website. Fast-fashion retailer Shein and online dollar-store Temu, both of which sell products ranging from toys to smartphones, have grown rapidly in the U.S. thanks in part to the de minimis exemption. The two firms together likely accounted for more than 30% of all packages shipped to the United States each day under the de minimis provision, the U.S. congressional committee on China said in a June 2023 report. Nearly half of all packages shipped under de minimis come from China, according to the report. Shein and Temu did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 'Doing the paperwork for customs declarations was not something these companies had to deal with very often before,' said Basile Ricard, operations director at Ceva Logistics Greater China. 'So this is a very new process for them. If this remains a largely manual process it will be incredibly difficult... It's really not clear for us at this stage how they are going to manage that.' Amazon also has a large seller base in China, with e-commerce consultancy Marketplace Pulse estimating in February that China-based sellers represent nearly half of the top 10,000 sellers on Amazon in the U.S. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In November, the U.S. company set up Amazon Haul to allow shoppers to purchase $5 handbags and $10 sweaters from China-based sellers. Delays in deliveries Trump's crackdown on de minimis would make the products sold by the likes of Shein and Temu more expensive but is unlikely to dramatically impact shipment volumes, experts said. 'E-commerce volumes out of China grew 20-30% last year, so it's going to take a sledgehammer to crack that level of consumer demand and I'm not sure de minimis alone is enough,' said Niall van de Wouw, Chief Airfreight Officer at freight platform Xeneta. 'They will still be cheaper than buying through retailers in the U.S. Delays in receiving the goods due to operational disruptions could have a bigger impact than price.' Shein has previously said it supports reform of the de minimis provision. Both Temu, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, and Singapore-headquartered Shein, which plans to list in London this year, have taken measures such as sourcing more products from outside China, opening U.S. warehouses and bringing more U.S. sellers on board, to mitigate the impact. In what would be another blow to the two China-founded e-commerce platforms, the U.S. is discussing whether to add Shein and Temu to the Department of Homeland Security's 'forced labor' list, Semafor reported on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-postal-service-suspends-inbound-parcels-from-china-hong-kong-/7963688.html	2025-02-05T05:12:38-08:00

The United States Agency for International Development’s regional efforts in Central Asia focus on five main sectors, which are foundational for regional prosperity and security: energy; trade and enterprise development; environment and transboundary water management; countering trafficking-in-persons; and countering violent extremism. Experts say the work in the five countries — Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan — is not as significant as in other regions. However, they believe the region is still suffering, including the lack of programs to train and retain essential personnel.

South Africa's unity government steady after stormy start	Johannesburg — In the seven months since it was formed, South Africa's unlikely unity government has been stretched and cracked but remains intact under the leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who delivers its first state of the nation address Thursday. Several loud quarrels have erupted over sticking points such as language education in schools and Ramaphosa's warm words towards Russia but nothing that has made real the threats and fears of collapse. 'They think we are at each other's throats. We are not. We continue to meet and talk,' Ramaphosa said in the wake of the latest crisis sparked by his signing of a property expropriation bill last month. The second-largest partner in the 10-party coalition, the Democratic Alliance, was angry that Ramaphosa signed the act without consulting his partners in the government of national unity (GNU). 'This is not how coalitions work,' DA leader John Steenhuisen fumed. 'We will not be reduced to being spectators.' But the party did not object to the need for land reform in the country, where most farmland is owned by whites. It also sided with Ramaphosa when the bill was attacked by US President Donald Trump for allowing the 'confiscation' of property, saying this was untrue. The DA has six ministries in exchange for propping up Ramaphosa's ANC in government after it failed to win enough votes in the May election to govern alone, a first since the party took power in 1994 and ended decades of white-minority apartheid rule. It was an unlikely collaboration, with the DA a long and critical rival of the African National Congress (ANC). But the GNU, which includes eight other smaller parties, has been credited with bringing some stability to the continent's most industrialized economy as it faces a host of challenges, from an unemployment rate topping 30%, to high rates of crime. Big business While it has fumed and flexed, the center-right DA is also aware that, should it quit the unity government, the ANC could find support from the radical-left EFF and the populist MK parties, now in opposition. It is a scenario it calls a 'doomsday coalition'. 'This is something the DA will move Table Mountain to avoid,' Sunday Times editor-in-chief Makhudu Sefara wrote in a weekend column. 'And therein lies the extent to which they're prepared to compromise.' The DA will not walk out, said political scientist Sandile Swana. 'It is the political party of big business,' he said. 'And the GNU was mandated, or demanded or directed, to come into existence by big business in South Africa.' Despite some cynical maneuvring at local government level -- for example, to push out the DA mayor of the city of Tshwane in September -- the coalition will even survive bitter local elections due in late 2026, said political scientist Susan Booysen told AFP. 'They could actually go into a poisonous, toxic local government election campaign and continue with the national coalition,' she said. 'It's such a schizophrenic type of coalition.' Ramaphosa, meanwhile, is walking a fine line within his own party, where a large faction of the ANC wants him to assert that it 'is not in the DA's pocket,' Booysen said. But even if Ramaphosa does not complete his term as president, with his future as head of the party not guaranteed after ANC leadership elections in 2027, his successor is also unlikely to end the fractious collaboration, Swana said. 'Even if Ramaphosa is removed, I do not think they will kick the DA out of government,' Swana said. 'The GNU, as things stand, will last the five-year period.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-s-unity-government-steady-after-stormy-start/7963593.html	2025-02-05T02:51:01-08:00	
China says it is willing to work with EU on 'global challenges'	BEIJING — China is willing to work with the European Union on boosting cooperation and responding to 'global challenges,' its foreign ministry said on Wednesday, as the bloc faces potential U.S. tariffs on its shipments to the world's largest economy. China attaches great importance to EU ties and hopes the bloc will become a reliable cooperation partner, said Lin Jian, spokesperson at the Chinese ministry. The EU's trade chief said on Tuesday that the bloc wanted to engage swiftly with the United States over President Donald Trump's planned tariffs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen forecast negotiations with Washington would be tough. As transatlantic ties come under strain with Trump's tariff threats, China hawks within the EU such as von der Leyen are showing signs of willingness to rethink the relationship between Beijing and Brussels, a bond that had been tested by trade tensions and China's ties with Russia. Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, von der Leyen said the EU would keep 'de-risking' its relationship with China but added that there was room to 'find solutions' in their mutual interest and 'find agreements' that could even expand trade and investment ties. She did not give details on what those agreements could be. In Davos, Switzerland, last month, von der Leyen also said both sides should find solutions of mutual interest. In October, the EU imposed double-digit tariffs on China-made electric vehicles after an anti-subsidy investigation, in addition to its standard car import duty of 10%. The move drew loud protests from Beijing, which in return, raised market entry barriers for certain EU products such as brandy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-is-willing-to-work-with-eu-on-global-challenges-/7963583.html	2025-02-05T02:40:02-08:00	
Thailand cuts power, fuel and internet supply to parts of Myanmar	Bangkok — Thailand has cut electricity, internet and fuel supplies to five border areas in Myanmar, a senior Thai minister said on Wednesday, as the Southeast Asian nation steps up efforts to choke scam centers that have become a growing security concern. 'They may face challenges of lower power supply, but we are at the point now where no one can blame Thailand for being part of or play a part in supporting illegal acts,' Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters. 'They may turn to other sources of power supply or generate their own electricity.' Scam compounds in Southeast Asia, including those along the Thai-Myanmar border, are suspected to have entrapped hundreds of thousands of people in illegal online operations, generating billions annually, according to a 2023 U.N. report. Myanmar's state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper in a rare article on scam centers last month said basic essentials, including power and internet, are not provided by Myanmar but by other countries, in a veiled reference to Thailand. International pressure to dismantle these centers has grown after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted after arriving in Thailand last month. He was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. For Thailand, the proliferation of these centers has impacted its vital tourism sector and the country has sought to allay safety concerns of visitors from China, a key source market. Thailand's Provincial Electricity Authority said it had cut a total of 20.37 megawatts of supply to five areas along the border starting from 9 a.m. on Wednesday, which would lead to a loss of 600 million baht ($17.84 million) in revenue per year. It said the affected locations in Myanmar include Tachileik, Myawaddy and Phaya Thonsu, which all lie along the border with Thailand. A resident of Phaya Thonsu, opposite Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, said many locals have faced power cuts since Wednesday morning, while Chinese businesses, including scam centers, continue to operate on generators. 'Since the last two days, we have seen big generators arriving into the town. Today, those generators are running and their businesses including scam centers are still operating,' he told Reuters, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. 'The businesses owned by locals have stopped and the town's people are in trouble.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-cuts-power-fuel-and-internet-supply-to-parts-of-myanmar/7963575.html	2025-02-05T02:23:21-08:00	
Philippine House votes to impeach VP Sara Duterte, process moves ahead	Manila, Philippines — Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday voted to impeach Vice President Sara Duterte, who has fallen out spectacularly with the country's leader, paving the way for a Senate trial that could see her removed from office. While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints in December accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the 'brazen misuse' of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos's assassination. 'Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved,' House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers. The fate of Duterte, daughter of the former president, now lies in the hands of the Philippines' 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to remove her from office and disqualify her from future public positions. A trial date has yet to be set. Wednesday's filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race. Whether 16 senators cast their vote for Duterte's impeachment could come down to President Marcos, Dennis Coronacion, chairman of the political science department at the University of Santo Tomas, told AFP. 'If (Marcos) is committed to this one, to the impeachment process ... I think getting the required number of Senate votes is possible,' he said, adding Wednesday's vote had come as something of a surprise. But should the administration stay hands-off, the chances of Duterte being impeached are closer to 50-50, Coronacion said, pointing to the sitting senators' need for votes from Duterte stronghold Mindanao in the coming election. Family feud The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation. But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a 'storm in a teacup' that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities. Marcos's executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said Monday that the Office of the President would 'not interfere' with the impeachment complaints. A public relations official told AFP the Senate was expecting the articles of impeachment to arrive at its security office late Wednesday. House of Representatives member Percival Cendana, who had backed one of the three impeachment complaints, urged his colleagues to take quick action, speaking Friday at a rally that drew thousands calling for Duterte's impeachment. Every day of inaction 'condones the impunity, the abuse of power and the harassment that Duterte is doing to our country's leaders,' he told reporters. But that rally was dwarfed by one a conservative sect organized that drew hundreds of thousands to the street on Jan. 13 opposing the vice president's impeachment. Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket. But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated. She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing 'consternation' with the administration's failures. The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged Dec. 19 by seven Manila-based Catholic priests. With her impeachment, Duterte becomes one of only four high-ranking officials to share that fate since the Philippines returned to democracy after the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr came to an end in 1986. Along with a Supreme Court justice and a high-profile prosecutor, then-president Joseph Estrada was impeached in November 2000 on charges of embezzlement and taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations. When the Senate tribunal refused to accept key evidence, Filipinos took to the streets in a bloodless revolt, leading Estrada to step down when the military withdrew its support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-house-votes-to-impeach-vp-sara-duterte-process-moves-ahead/7963572.html	2025-02-05T02:13:56-08:00	
Swedish police warn of online misinformation after mass school shooting	OREBRO, Sweden — Swedish police said on Wednesday there was no evidence of 'ideological motives' behind a mass shooting at an adult education center on Tuesday, and warned of misinformation spread on social media about the Nordic country's deadliest gun attack. At least 11 people died and many others were wounded in the shooting at the Risbergska school in Orebro, a town of over 100,000 people, where large numbers of police continued to cordon off the center and several schools located on its campus complex. A vigil with candles and flowers had been set up nearby. 'We want to be clear that based on investigative and intelligence information at present, there is no information pointing to the culprit acting on ideological motives,' police said in a brief statement on its website. Police have said the motive for the crime was not immediately known, and that they believed the suspected perpetrator, who was among the dead and was not known previously to the police, acted alone. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday said the attack was the worst mass shooting in Swedish history, calling it a 'painful day,' while King Carl XVI Gustav conveyed his condolences. Flags at official buildings in Orebro, some 200 km west of Stockholm, as well as at the Swedish parliament and the royal palace in the capital, were flying at half-mast as a sign of respect and mourning. 'Our task is to take care of those attending the affected school, those who work there as well as inhabitants of Orebro, who are worried and sad,' Orebro Municipal Director Peter Larsson said in a statement. Many students in Sweden's adult school system are immigrants seeking to improve their basic education and gain degrees to help them find jobs in the Nordic country while also learning Swedish. Police said in a statement it did not see any general threat against schools or pre-schools in the country, nor against adult education schools, including Swedish classes for immigrants. 'We also at present don't see any danger to the public, even if we understand that the incident raises concerns and many questions,' it said. Sweden has been struggling with a wave of shootings and bombings caused by an endemic gang crime problem that has seen the country of 10 million people record by far the highest per capita rate of gun violence in the EU in recent years. However, fatal attacks at schools are rare. Ten people were killed in seven incidents of deadly violence at schools between 2010 and 2022, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-police-warn-of-online-misinformation-after-mass-school-shooting/7963559.html	2025-02-05T01:44:13-08:00	
Islamic State members held for years in a Syria prison say they know nothing of the world	HASSAKEH, Syria — Men of various ages and nationalities sit silently in their cells, a small window in the metal doors their only opening to the world. All are alleged members of the Islamic State group, captured during the final days of the extremists' so-called caliphate declared in large parts of Iraq and Syria. The Gweiran Prison, now called Panorama, has held about 4,500 IS-linked detainees for years. The Associated Press was given an exclusive visit to the prison, nearly two months after the fall of the 54-year Assad dynasty in Syria — an upheaval the detainees might not even know about as prison officials try to limit outside information. Syrian President Bashar Assad's ouster during a lightning insurgent offensive in December has led to new attention, and new pressures, on such detention centers in the country's northeast that have been holding some 9,000 IS members without trial. The centers are guarded by members of the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, that in March 2019 captured the last sliver of land that IS members once held, the eastern town of Baghouz. SDF chief commander Mazloum Abdi told the AP that after the fall of Assad, IS members captured large amounts of weapons in eastern Syria from posts abandoned by forces loyal to the former president. An SDF security official warned that the extremists might attack detention facilities and try to free their comrades. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The detainees are 'a literal and figurative ‘ISIS army’ in detention,' Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of the U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to Syria last month. The prison visit occurred in a corridor with six cells on each side and with masked guards holding clubs. A window in a cell door was opened, and the detainees were told they could speak briefly to journalists. A young man moved forward and identified himself as Maher, a nurse from Melbourne, Australia. Prison authorities asked that only first names be used. 'I’d love to go back to Australia,' the man said, adding that he was not arrested in 2019 in Baghouz but gave himself up when the U.S.-led coalition opened a humanitarian corridor. 'I didn’t do anything to anyone. I’ve been here for seven years without judgment. Without anything,' he said, and expressed regret for 'a lot of things.' Maher said he married a Syrian woman and has two sons, and they are at one of the camps housing families of IS members in northeast Syria. He said he has not had information about them, and that he sent a letter to his parents via the International Committee of the Red Cross and never received an answer. The security of the detention centers is a growing question since Assad's fall. One of the most serious threats to the centers came in January 2022 when IS gunmen stormed the prison, leading to 10 days of battles with the SDF that left nearly 500 people dead. The prison, formerly the classrooms of a technical school, was later renovated with the help of the U.S.-led coalition. Security was tight when the AP visited, with armed fighters stationed on roads leading to the facility. But SDF officials have said that recent clashes between their fighters and Turkey-backed gunmen in northern Syria, which coincided with the insurgent offensive that led to Assad's fall, are affecting their ability to protect the prisons. During a visit to Turkey last month by Syria’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan told reporters that Ankara was ready to help Syrian authorities manage the detention centers as well as the camps where more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, with alleged IS links are held. But the SDF chief commander didn't welcome the idea. 'The way Turkey can help is to stop its attacks on us so that we concentrate on the protection of al-Hol and the prisons,' Abdi said. He added that the fate of al-Hol and other prisons can be solved within Syria. The country's future is being discussed in talks between the SDF, which controls nearly 25% of Syria, and the new government in Damascus led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. Inside the cells, the men wait for word on their own fate. A British prisoner from London, who asked that his name not be made public, said he wants to return to Britain and stand trial there. He was 18 when he came to Syria a decade ago after seeing media reports on 'the killings of kids' by Assad’s government forces during a popular uprising that turned into civil war. He said he later wanted to leave Syria but could not. 'Once you enter (IS), it's hard to leave,' he said. He claimed he had not been a fighter but instead bought and sold cars while living in IS-held areas. He said all men captured by the SDF in the Baghouz area in early 2019 were classified as IS members. Seven years have passed in detention. 'To survive a day in this place is a miracle,' he said, adding that he and fellow detainees know nothing of the world now, not even the date. Asked what day it was, he replied: 'We are in early 2025.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-members-held-for-years-in-a-syria-prison-say-they-know-nothing-of-the-world-/7963554.html	2025-02-05T01:32:50-08:00
