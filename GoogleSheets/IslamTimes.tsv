Resilience Versus Retreat: Why ‘Israeli’ Settlers Shun the North	Islam Times - The aftermath of conflict often reveals the true nature of resilience, fear, and determination in the face of destruction. In the case of northern 'Israel' the reluctance of 'Israeli' settlers to return to their 'homes' after periods of violence highlights deeper issues of insecurity, physical damage, and a lack of connection to the land they occupy. This hesitance stands in stark contrast to the resilience of Lebanese civilians, who, despite the ongoing 'Israeli' occupation of villages in southern Lebanon, returned to their homes the moment ceasefires were declared. Examining the reasons behind the settlers' fear, the destruction of their properties, and their inability to rebuild their lives reveals a broader narrative about the fragility of occupation and the strength of native populations.	https://www.islamtimes.com/en/news/1182942/resilience-versus-retreat-why-israeli-settlers-shun-the-north	2025-01-07T01:16:29-08:00	https://www.islamtimes.com/images/docs/001182/n01182942-s.jpg
