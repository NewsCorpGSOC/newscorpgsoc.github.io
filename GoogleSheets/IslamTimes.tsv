They would rather die and be buried in their homeland than depart from their ancestral home.	https://www.islamtimes.com/en/article/1184944/hamas-victory-in-gaza-a-symbol-of-resilience	2025-01-17T00:34:55-08:00	https://www.islamtimes.com/images/docs/001184/n01184944-s.jpg

Resilience Versus Retreat: Why ‘Israeli’ Settlers Shun the North	Islam Times - The aftermath of conflict often reveals the true nature of resilience, fear, and determination in the face of destruction.

Examining the reasons behind the settlers' fear, the destruction of their properties, and their inability to rebuild their lives reveals a broader narrative about the fragility of occupation and the strength of native populations.	https://www.islamtimes.com/en/news/1182942/resilience-versus-retreat-why-israeli-settlers-shun-the-north	2025-01-07T01:16:29-08:00	https://www.islamtimes.com/images/docs/001182/n01182942-s.jpg
