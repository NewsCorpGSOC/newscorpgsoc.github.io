’Israel’s’ History of Neglecting Commitments and Misjudging Hezbollah’s Capabilities	Islam Times - Throughout its history, 'Israel' has frequently disregarded international laws, treaties, and commitments made to other countries and groups. A recent example is 'Israel's' declaration that it may postpone its withdrawal from Lebanon, despite stipulating such a withdrawal in a ceasefire agreement. This behavior risks undermining regional stability and could regress the situation to pre-2000 conditions. This essay explores the implications of this development, potential miscalculations regarding Hezbollah's capabilities, and important lessons from the past.	https://www.islamtimes.com/en/article/1186508/israel-s-history-of-neglecting-commitments-and-misjudging-hezbollah-s-capabilities	2025-01-25T00:41:43-08:00	https://www.islamtimes.com/images/docs/001186/n01186508-s.jpg
