Media Bias and the Silence on Syria’s Alawite Massacres: Terrorism Labeling in the Shadow of Geopolitics	Islam Times - The Selective Use of 'Terrorism' The term ‘terrorism’ has become one of the most politically charged words in modern discourse, frequently used to justify military interventions and shape foreign policies. However, it is often applied selectively, depending on the interests of America and its allies. Consequently, the way violence is labeled and how atrocities are reported—or ignored—by global media varies significantly. This duality is sharply evident in the ongoing massacres of Syria’s Alawite minority, where over 1,300 civilians have been slaughtered in just 72 hours by forces loyal to Syria’s newly led government under Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham [HTS] leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Despite the scale of the violence, Western media coverage has been muted, highlighting a troubling pattern of neglect when victims of terrorism are non-Western. This essay examines the Alawite massacres as a case study in media bias, connecting it to historical critiques of how terrorism is framed and whose suffering merits global attention.	https://www.islamtimes.com/en/article/1195901/media-bias-and-the-silence-on-syria-s-alawite-massacres-terrorism-labeling-in-shadow-of-geopolitics	2025-03-12T02:43:43-07:00	https://www.islamtimes.com/images/docs/001195/n01195901-s.jpg
