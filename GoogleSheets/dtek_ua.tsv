A great tragedy for the entire family of Ukrainian energy workers. Yesterday, the Russian occupiers killed our colleague Gennadiy Musatov. Together with the brigade, Gennadiy came to restore power grids damaged by shelling. The occupiers fired a second artillery strike and hit a mobile crane driven by our colleague. Gennady Musatov was 56 years old, 20 of which he devoted to the profession of energy. There are no words to describe the pain. Deep condolences to relatives, friends, colleagues, everyone who knew and loved Gennady. Eternal and bright memory to everyone who died during the battle for light...	https://t.me/dtek_ua/2316	2025-02-21T02:31:45-08:00
