Forwarded From MINENERGO🕯 Unfortunately, today during an enemy attack, a tragedy occurred - two energy workers of NEC -Ukrenergo- - Dmytro Kaminnyi and Maksym Shargorodskyi - were killed. They worked at one of the company's substations in the Odesa region, which was hit by a direct enemy strike today. Dmytro Kaminny was 41 years old. He worked at NEC for 16 years, coming as an electrician for substation maintenance, after a few years he became a substation engineer on duty, and before the tragic event, he had already worked as a substation dispatcher for 12 years. Dmytro was a high-level professional, a reliable friend. He left behind a 10-year-old daughter. Maxim Shargorodsky was 44 years old. He gave almost 20 years of his life to the energy industry. Since 2005, he worked at a substation, having joined as an electrical fitter repairing switchgear equipment, in 6 years he became an electrician for substation maintenance, performed the duties of a substation dispatcher, and was an experienced specialist. From the beginning of the full-scale invasion until May 2023, Maksym was mobilized into the ranks of the Armed Forces, after his return he continued to work as an electrician. He left behind a 14-year-old daughter. The entire team of the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine and Ukrainian energy companies express their sincere condolences to the families and relatives of the victims. Unfortunately, such losses are a terrible reminder of the courage and dedication of Ukrainian energy workers who protect the light in the homes of Ukrainians.
