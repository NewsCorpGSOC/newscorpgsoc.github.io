On August 22, DTEK, together with other energy industry players, won the Ukrenergo auction. This opens up opportunities for the development of the energy storage market and the construction of new balancing capacities. 🔋Energy storage facilities are a strategic direction of DTEK development. - Despite the war and limited access to the foreign capital market, we continue to invest in Ukraine. This is not only the restoration of the destroyed, but also the construction of new facilities within the framework of our long-term development strategy. DTEK was the first in Ukraine to start building energy storage systems in 2021 and actually opened this market in Ukraine. Our priority remains unchanged — it is the development of green energy in Ukraine, the accelerated integration of our energy system into Europe, and the improvement of the energy security of our country, - noted the CEO of DTEK Maksym Timchenko.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/1836	2024-09-12T05:00:47-07:00
