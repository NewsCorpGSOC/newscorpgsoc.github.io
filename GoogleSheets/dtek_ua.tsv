Today, the Russian occupiers killed our colleague Dmytro Petlenko, an engineer who worked at one of the thermal power plants. After carrying out search operations, he was found under the rubble without signs of life. Dmitry was 51 years old. He devoted more than 30 years to the profession of energy. He worked for a long time at the Zaporizhzhia TPP. After the occupation of Energodaru, he got a job at another thermal power plant of the company, where he continued the battle for light for the last year and a half. A great loss for the family of Ukrainian energy workers. We express our deepest condolences to everyone who knew and loved Dmytro. We will never forget. We will never forgive the Russian invaders.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/2204	2024-12-25T01:59:53-08:00

This is a conscious choice not only of goals, but also of time and date. Today, Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack. What could be more inhuman? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic ones, and more than a hundred attack drones. Goals are our energy. They continue to fight for a blackout in Ukraine. According to preliminary data, our defenders managed to shoot down more than 50 missiles and a significant part of drones. Unfortunately, there is a hit. As of now, there are outages in several regions. Power engineers are working to restore light as soon as possible. Thank you to everyone who is currently working for the country, who is on combat duty, who protects our sky. Let's restore the maximum. Russian evil will not break Ukraine or distort Christmas.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/2198	2024-12-24T23:49:44-08:00

A symbolic event took place in Kyiv on Energy Day. Transformer Orest became the first movie screen on which excerpts of the documentary The Last Prometheus of Donbas were presented. The tape tells about the work of the Kurakhiv thermal power station near the front line. The film crew lived together with the energy workers at the power plant and came under constant fire. The TPP worked until the end, but after critical destruction, it was forced to stop. But the mission of the energy workers did not stop there - they continued the battle for light at other thermal power plants. The documentary will be released in 2025. Director: Anton Shtuka.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/2183	2024-12-23T09:34:08-08:00
