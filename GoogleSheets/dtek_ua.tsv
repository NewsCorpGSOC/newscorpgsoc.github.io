Comedian Felix Redka met with Vitaly Shayda, general director of DTEK Kyiv Regional Electric Networks. They talked about the de-occupation of Kyiv region: what to do when you have 10,000 kilometers of destroyed power lines and how to fix it all in 45 days. Who is the Irpinsky ghost that returned the light during the occupation? Why energy work is so dangerous in times of war and what awaits us next.
