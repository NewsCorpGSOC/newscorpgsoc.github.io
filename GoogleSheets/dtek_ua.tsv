In 2024, DTEK repaired and updated more than 14,000 km of lines and 6,000 energy facilities — 80% more than in 2023.

We continue to strengthen the Ukrainian energy industry during the war. This year, DTEK plans to speed up the construction of the Tyligul wind farm. The number of turbines of the wind farm will increase from 19 to 83, and the capacity will increase four times - from 114 to 500 MW. The total investment in the construction will amount to 650 million euros. At full capacity, the Tyligul wind farm will produce 1.7 TWh of electricity per year — this is enough to power 900,000 Ukrainian homes, which is equivalent to the energy needed to charge every smartphone in the EU for a year. We plan to complete the construction of the expanded wind farm by the end of 2026. ‼️This project will be the largest private sector investment in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion of Russia and the largest private investment in the country's energy sector in history.

At the most critical moment of the year, 90% of capacities were destroyed. ❓ What did DTEK do? The company invested UAH 11 billion of its own funds: ⏺ UAH 3 billion — for the restoration of the TPP. This made it possible to return to work more than half of the destroyed capacities before the start of the heating season. UAH 7.5 billion — for the operation of mines: major repairs, equipment renewal, modernization of transport. This provided coal reserves for the stable operation of the stations.
