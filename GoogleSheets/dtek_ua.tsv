At the most critical moment of the year, 90% of capacities were destroyed. ❓ What did DTEK do? The company invested UAH 11 billion of its own funds: ⏺ UAH 3 billion — for the restoration of the TPP. This made it possible to return to work more than half of the destroyed capacities before the start of the heating season. UAH 7.5 billion — for the operation of mines: major repairs, equipment renewal, modernization of transport. This provided coal reserves for the stable operation of the stations. The battle for light continues! 🔥	https://t.me/dtek_ua/2276	2025-01-17T00:37:39-08:00

DTEK invests €140 million in the construction of energy storage facilities to improve Ukraine's energy security. To implement this project, we chose the American company Fluence, which is a leader in the US and European markets. Six plants will be located in different regions of Ukraine, with a capacity of 20 MW to 50 MW. Together, they will be able to store up to 400 MWh of energy. -Energy storage systems are an important element in the creation of a decentralized energy system of Ukraine, which will help reduce carbon emissions and increase the country's energy security,- said DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko. We plan to complete the project by October 2025, so that the systems will be installed before the start of the 25/26 winter season to strengthen the Ukrainian power grid during the period of possible outages. The battle for light continues. Let's stand and win!	https://t.me/dtek_ua/2271	2025-01-13T05:35:20-08:00

Today, the Russian occupiers killed our colleague Dmytro Petlenko, an engineer who worked at one of the thermal power plants. After carrying out search operations, he was found under the rubble without signs of life. Dmitry was 51 years old. He devoted more than 30 years to the profession of energy. He worked for a long time at the Zaporizhzhia TPP. After the occupation of Energodaru, he got a job at another thermal power plant of the company, where he continued the battle for light for the last year and a half. A great loss for the family of Ukrainian energy workers. We express our deepest condolences to everyone who knew and loved Dmytro. We will never forget.

This is a conscious choice not only of goals, but also of time and date. Today, Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack. What could be more inhuman? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic ones, and more than a hundred attack drones. Goals are our energy. They continue to fight for a blackout in Ukraine. According to preliminary data, our defenders managed to shoot down more than 50 missiles and a significant part of drones. Unfortunately, there is a hit. As of now, there are outages in several regions. Power engineers are working to restore light as soon as possible. Thank you to everyone who is currently working for the country, who is on combat duty, who protects our sky. Let's restore the maximum.

A symbolic event took place in Kyiv on Energy Day. Transformer Orest became the first movie screen on which excerpts of the documentary The Last Prometheus of Donbas were presented. The tape tells about the work of the Kurakhiv thermal power station near the front line. The film crew lived together with the energy workers at the power plant and came under constant fire. The TPP worked until the end, but after critical destruction, it was forced to stop. But the mission of the energy workers did not stop there - they continued the battle for light at other thermal power plants. The documentary will be released in 2025.
