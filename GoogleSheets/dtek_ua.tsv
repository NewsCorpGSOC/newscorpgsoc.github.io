October 10, 2022 is a rainy day that energy workers will remember forever. We thank everyone who eliminated the consequences of the arrivals in their place and continues to do so now. For two years, we have been living in the conditions of the largest-scale attacks on energy facilities in world history. Only since the beginning of 2024, Russia has used more than 1,000 missiles and drones, trying to plunge Ukraine into darkness. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the air defense, DSNS and energy workers, the enemy cannot implement his plans. We continue round-the-clock to restore the destroyed and prepare for winter. We do everything possible to provide warmth and light to Ukrainian families.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/1889	2024-10-09T23:34:46-07:00

Like dozens of others, it suffered from Russian shelling - it survived several hits by shrapnel and was eventually completely destroyed. We called this installation -Battle for Light-. It gives Ukrainians the opportunity to personally see and assess the scale of the destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities, which have undergone more than 1,000 Russian attacks since October 2022. As a result, the enemy destroyed almost 90% of all thermal and 45% of hydro generation, and due to this year's shelling, our country lost 9 GW of capacity.-The exposed transformer has its own story - after the shelling, it burned for a day because it was impossible to put it out. And, unfortunately, due to extensive damage, it cannot be restored. We set it up in Kyiv so that everyone could see it with their own eyes, as the energy workers at the TPP and other energy facilities see.&nbsp;However, despite all the difficulties and daily risks of coming under enemy fire,&nbsp;Ukrainian energy workers continue their battle for light-,&nbsp;-&nbsp; said the executive director of DTEK Dmytro Saharuk. We are waiting for you at Kontraktova Square. Come with friends and families.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/1854	2024-09-19T05:14:29-07:00
