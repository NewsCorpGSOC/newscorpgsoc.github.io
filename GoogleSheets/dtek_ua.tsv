Like dozens of others, it suffered from Russian shelling - it survived several hits by shrapnel and was eventually completely destroyed. We called this installation -Battle for Light-. It gives Ukrainians the opportunity to personally see and assess the scale of the destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities, which have undergone more than 1,000 Russian attacks since October 2022. As a result, the enemy destroyed almost 90% of all thermal and 45% of hydro generation, and due to this year's shelling, our country lost 9 GW of capacity.-The exposed transformer has its own story - after the shelling, it burned for a day because it was impossible to put it out. And, unfortunately, due to extensive damage, it cannot be restored. We set it up in Kyiv so that everyone could see it with their own eyes, as the energy workers at the TPP and other energy facilities see.&nbsp;However, despite all the difficulties and daily risks of coming under enemy fire,&nbsp;Ukrainian energy workers continue their battle for light-,&nbsp;-&nbsp; said the executive director of DTEK Dmytro Saharuk. We are waiting for you at Kontraktova Square. Come with friends and families.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/1854	2024-09-19T05:14:29-07:00

On August 22, DTEK, together with other energy industry players, won the Ukrenergo auction. This opens up opportunities for the development of the energy storage market and the construction of new balancing capacities. 🔋Energy storage facilities are a strategic direction of DTEK development. - Despite the war and limited access to the foreign capital market, we continue to invest in Ukraine. This is not only the restoration of the destroyed, but also the construction of new facilities within the framework of our long-term development strategy. DTEK was the first in Ukraine to start building energy storage systems in 2021 and actually opened this market in Ukraine. Our priority remains unchanged — it is the development of green energy in Ukraine, the accelerated integration of our energy system into Europe, and the improvement of the energy security of our country, - noted the CEO of DTEK Maksym Timchenko.	https://t.me/dtek_ua/1836	2024-09-12T05:00:47-07:00
