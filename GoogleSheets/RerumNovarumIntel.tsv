🇱🇧🇮🇱 - WHY THE CEASEFIRE IS A DEFEAT FOR HEZBOLLAH / AXIS OF ...	🇱🇧🇮🇱 - WHY THE CEASEFIRE IS A DEFEAT FOR HEZBOLLAH / AXIS OF RESISTANCE:One cannot begin to unravel the timeline of the Third Lebanon War without going back further than October 8th, when Hezbollah began attacking northern Israel in support of Hamas. This began years ago, when Mossad implanted explosive devices inside pagers and walkie-talkies for Hezbollah operatives.What has been clear since October 7th is that Israel (more specifically, Netanyahu and his far-right coalition) knew that October 7th was actively being planned years in advance. They knew Hamas was going to attempt a large-scale incursion into Israel in an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible and, more importantly, court sympathy and intervention from the rest of the Middle East.Supporters / sympathizers of the Axis of Resistance (what we like to call -resistards-) like to frame the entirety of the Israel issue as one of Zionism, rather than the instinctual nature of the Jews to subvert and deceive their enemy until total victory is obtained. Anti-Zionism does not adequately explain the behaviors of Israel, but true recognition of the Jewish problem explains the behavior of Israel as well as the behavior of Jews.As Israel knew Hamas was planning October 7th, the pager explosions and the evidence that has emerged surrounding that event prove that Israel knew Hezbollah would get involved on Hamas' behalf. There is no other explanation for this intricate level of planning and execution other than preknowledge. Israel - more specifically, the Mossad - is the kingpin of preknowledge, and it doesn't just apply to Israel's proximate wars in the Middle East.An organization as dangerous and threatening as Hezbollah, in the eyes of Israel, is not to be left unscrutinised. It's plausible, if not definite, that Hezbollah has been, for many years, infiltrated through-and-through by Israeli spies, who may not tamper with the activities of Hezbollah, but feed knowledge to Tel Aviv on circumstantial and topical threats to Israeli security.If Israel knew Hamas was going to attack Israel on October 7th, which they did, then Israel most certainly knew Hezbollah would get involved as well. There is no debate.The only thing up for debate is how much worse it will get for the Axis of Resistance. Netanyahu made it clear in his speech today that Iran is the next target. The incoming Trump administration will give Netanyahu whatever he wants with regards to bringing Iran to its knees.The ceasefire being put into place today ends the Lebanon front for good. It's highly unlikely that Hezbollah will start shooting again. It's leadership has been decapitated, and while it's military strength has been tested, it hasn't been destroyed. In short- Hezbollah is still functional as an organization, and it hasn't lost its ability to threaten Israel, but the ceasefire being put in place makes Hezbollah a non-threat, at least for the time being. Israel has achieved its objective- they haven't destroyed Hezbollah, but pacification via a ceasefire arrangement is a victory for Israel nonetheless. Any statements to the contrary from -resistards- is a coping mechanism.It's hard to tell what else Israel has planned in terms of detailed strategy, but Iran is next on the chopping block. Trump will give Netanyahu whatever resources he needs to confront Iran. Iran had its chance to prevent this from happening, but it seems that Iran's existence will be put to the test in the coming months.	https://t.me/rnintel/21047	2024-11-26T11:57:38-08:00

With fighting ongoing in the center of Zorya, Russian forces are less than 2.5km away from the final line before the Dnepr region. The distance to the Dnepr border is less than 19km. As seen on the map, the number of fortifications beyond the final line are considerably less, which will make defending against a possible Russian offensive extremely difficult.

The state of the race, according to pollsters, are as follows:Final New York Times polls show a Harris win. 🔵Final Emerson College polls show a Trump win. 🔴Final YouGov polls show a Harris win. 🔵Final Morning Consult polls show a Trump win. 🔴Nate Silvers' model has reverted to 51/49 in favor of Trump. 🔴While Trump maintains a 0.1% lead in the RCP average. 🔴And the betting markets still expect a Trump win. 🔴The New York Times commented yesterday that the response bias from Democrats, especially White Democrats, is as bad as 2016 and 2020, potentially resulting in another poll error in favor of Republicans.The internal polling for the campaigns is a bit better for Trump as his campaign internals show him down only by 2 in Virginia and up with all swing states, despite a slight tie in Michigan and some cause for concern regarding North Carolina.Democrat internal polls agree with the public polling that Harris will win the Midwest, and therefore the election.Their final days of campaigning reflect this, as Harris is doing all 4 of her final rallies in Pennsylvania, while Trump is going to North Carolina, followed by 2 stops in Pennsylvania, and finishing off the race in Grand Rapids Michigan, the site of his grand finale in 2016.The early vote data in Florida, Nevada, and Pennsylvania look to be indicating a very strong Republican performance, although the gender gap in turnout is about a point or 2 more female than 2020 depending on the state.The RN Team will be following the final campaign events throughout the day to bring you breaking updates and will be out a prediction this evening.	https://t.me/rnintel/19271	2024-11-04T09:30:51-08:00
