Over the past few days Ukrainian forces in the north had also recaptured Snagost and Vishnevka. The pincer attack on Koronevo continues, with Ukraine's eastern flank capturing Olgovka, Zhuravli and Kalinov. Vetreno is now grey-zone as both sides claim control.In the center the lines have almost stabilized. The Kositsa-Pravda-Kubatkin axis has been confirmed to be under Ukrainian control. Yesterday Russia's Arbat unit recaptured Nachayev. Some of the fiercest battles took place along the Martynovka-Mikhailovka sector which Ukrainian forces won but took heavy losses, capturing both towns. Russian sources claim Ukraine has already begun attacking Pushkarnoe.In the south, the situation continues to deteriorate for the Ukrainian troops. A week ago Ukrainian forces were on the outskirts of Giri, however since then they have lost Kamyshnoe, Krupets and Spalnoe, with Borki now being contested by both sides.In the far-west, Ukrainian attempts to take Tetkino have all failed. Ukrainian forces have destroyed two bridges over the Seym river, with just the Zvannoe bridge remaining. While Russia quickly builds pontoon crossings, Ukraine is destroying them just as fast. The objective seems to be to trap over 3,000 Russian troops south of the river.Ukrainian forces control 850 sqkm in the Kursk region, excluding grey-zones and DRG operations - far shorter than Oleksandr Syrskyi's claim of 1,263 sqkm.	https://t.me/rnintel/13764	2024-08-22T02:37:24-07:00
