Forwarded From ShamS🇮🇱🇸🇾 Strategic Context of Israeli StrikesThese attacks come amid a volatile period in Syria following the abrupt collapse of Assad’s regime. Analysts suggest the strikes are part of a broader Israeli strategy to neutralize military capabilities in Syria as the country transitions to new leadership.Ashraf Akka, an expert in international relations, explained that the airstrikes appear designed to -deny the nascent governing authorities in Syria any military leverage, including advanced weaponry or infrastructure that could shift regional power dynamics.-The port of Latakia is a critical hub for Syrian and allied forces. It has frequently been used to transport military equipment from Iran, a close ally of Assad’s regime, to Syria and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. Its targeting underscores Israel’s ongoing concerns about Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the potential transfer of advanced weaponry to hostile groups.The Ya’four and Damascus sites, central to Syria’s former military elite, hold symbolic and strategic importance. The strikes on these locations signal Israel’s intent to dismantle remnants of the Assad regime’s military infrastructure.Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria over the years, targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces. These actions are part of what Israel refers to as its -campaign between wars- strategy, aimed at weakening its adversaries without provoking a full-scale conflict.The recent strikes come at a pivotal moment for Syria as the country grapples with political instability and security vacuums. Israel has not officially commented on the latest operations, in line with its policy of ambiguity regarding military actions in Syria.The escalation highlights the fragility of the post-Assad landscape in Syria. Human rights advocates and political analysts have called for international oversight to prevent further destabilization and ensure that power vacuums do not lead to unchecked violence.Telegram | XTelegramShamSFact-based news about Syria &amp; Independent opinionsAdmin: @ShamS_EditorOur chat: @ShamS_CHATOur X: https://x.com/sham_syrianews	https://t.me/rnintel/23074	2024-12-09T23:20:37-08:00

Forwarded From ShamS⚡️🇶🇦🇸🇾 Doha will decide the fate of Syria and Bashar al-AssadToday, 7 December, the Astana format meeting on Syria will be held in Qatar at the Doha Forum. The foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey will hold talks that could result in crucial decisions regarding the future of the Syrian Arab Republic and its President Bashar al-Assad.Based on the current situation in the country, Assad's chances of holding on to Syrian statehood are slim. Moreover, there are reports that he and his family have left Syria.Turkey is interested in weakening the positions of Russia and Iran in Syria and has used the offensive of the HTS and SNA controlled groups against the Syrian government forces to put pressure on Moscow and Tehran.Russia's priority will be to maintain control over the provinces of Latakia and Tartus, where military bases are located.In turn, Syria's ally Iran has realised that it cannot fight as an auxiliary force if the Syrian Army itself is unwilling to fight.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/22673	2024-12-06T20:18:26-08:00

In stark contrast, the United States operates only two heavy icebreakers, both of which rely on conventional propulsion.The newest addition to Russia’s nuclear icebreaker fleet, the Project 22220 Yakutiya, began sea trials this week. It joins three other vessels of the same class, along with four older nuclear-powered icebreakers, with two of them dating back to the Soviet era. Three additional Project 22220 icebreakers are currently in development.	https://t.me/rnintel/22458	2024-12-04T18:24:56-08:00

Skrmetti. The case is over Tennessee's ban on trans surgery for minors which was passed after heavy lobbying by Matt Walsh and conservative activists.The ACLU and the Biden Administration are arguing the ban violates the 14th Amendment. The ACLU lawyer, a trans named Chase Strangio is the first trans person to ever argue in front of the Supreme Court.In 2020 the last time a trans rights case was before the Court, they ruled 6-3 in favor of the ACLU agreeing that Civil Rights protections in hiring practices applied to transgenders.So far this morning the Conservative Justices are more reserved in their questioning of Strangio while the Liberal Justices Sotomayor, Jackson, and Kagan are bouncing off each other in heavily attacking Mathew Rice, the lawyer arguing in favor of Tennessee's law. Rice is holding his ground against them refusing to give up Tennessee's arguments.	https://t.me/rnintel/22417	2024-12-04T09:06:00-08:00

Those who follow the Russia-Ukraine conflict would already be aware, it's notorious for fabricating claims, and does so on purpose. It's a very unreliable source.For instance, on its current map, it has Russia at Borova gates. A vital city on the Oskol river. These are advances not even Russia claims. They are painted red, then a week or so later, a made-up Ukrainian counterattack repels Russia to the actual front-lines. Of course, there was no counterattack, as Russian forces weren't even there.

🇱🇧🇮🇱 - WHY THE CEASEFIRE IS A DEFEAT FOR HEZBOLLAH / AXIS OF ...	🇱🇧🇮🇱 - WHY THE CEASEFIRE IS A DEFEAT FOR HEZBOLLAH / AXIS OF RESISTANCE:One cannot begin to unravel the timeline of the Third Lebanon War without going back further than October 8th, when Hezbollah began attacking northern Israel in support of Hamas. This began years ago, when Mossad implanted explosive devices inside pagers and walkie-talkies for Hezbollah operatives.What has been clear since October 7th is that Israel (more specifically, Netanyahu and his far-right coalition) knew that October 7th was actively being planned years in advance. They knew Hamas was going to attempt a large-scale incursion into Israel in an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible and, more importantly, court sympathy and intervention from the rest of the Middle East.Supporters / sympathizers of the Axis of Resistance (what we like to call -resistards-) like to frame the entirety of the Israel issue as one of Zionism, rather than the instinctual nature of the Jews to subvert and deceive their enemy until total victory is obtained. Anti-Zionism does not adequately explain the behaviors of Israel, but true recognition of the Jewish problem explains the behavior of Israel as well as the behavior of Jews.As Israel knew Hamas was planning October 7th, the pager explosions and the evidence that has emerged surrounding that event prove that Israel knew Hezbollah would get involved on Hamas' behalf. There is no other explanation for this intricate level of planning and execution other than preknowledge. Israel - more specifically, the Mossad - is the kingpin of preknowledge, and it doesn't just apply to Israel's proximate wars in the Middle East.An organization as dangerous and threatening as Hezbollah, in the eyes of Israel, is not to be left unscrutinised. It's plausible, if not definite, that Hezbollah has been, for many years, infiltrated through-and-through by Israeli spies, who may not tamper with the activities of Hezbollah, but feed knowledge to Tel Aviv on circumstantial and topical threats to Israeli security.If Israel knew Hamas was going to attack Israel on October 7th, which they did, then Israel most certainly knew Hezbollah would get involved as well. There is no debate.The only thing up for debate is how much worse it will get for the Axis of Resistance. Netanyahu made it clear in his speech today that Iran is the next target. The incoming Trump administration will give Netanyahu whatever he wants with regards to bringing Iran to its knees.The ceasefire being put into place today ends the Lebanon front for good. It's highly unlikely that Hezbollah will start shooting again. It's leadership has been decapitated, and while it's military strength has been tested, it hasn't been destroyed. In short- Hezbollah is still functional as an organization, and it hasn't lost its ability to threaten Israel, but the ceasefire being put in place makes Hezbollah a non-threat, at least for the time being. Israel has achieved its objective- they haven't destroyed Hezbollah, but pacification via a ceasefire arrangement is a victory for Israel nonetheless. Any statements to the contrary from -resistards- is a coping mechanism.It's hard to tell what else Israel has planned in terms of detailed strategy, but Iran is next on the chopping block. Trump will give Netanyahu whatever resources he needs to confront Iran. Iran had its chance to prevent this from happening, but it seems that Iran's existence will be put to the test in the coming months.	https://t.me/rnintel/21047	2024-11-26T11:57:38-08:00
