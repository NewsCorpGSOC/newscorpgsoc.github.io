With fighting ongoing in the center of Zorya, Russian forces are less than 2.5km away from the final line before the Dnepr region. The distance to the Dnepr border is less than 19km. As seen on the map, the number of fortifications beyond the final line are considerably less, which will make defending against a possible Russian offensive extremely difficult.

The state of the race, according to pollsters, are as follows:Final New York Times polls show a Harris win. 🔵Final Emerson College polls show a Trump win. 🔴Final YouGov polls show a Harris win. 🔵Final Morning Consult polls show a Trump win. 🔴Nate Silvers' model has reverted to 51/49 in favor of Trump. 🔴While Trump maintains a 0.1% lead in the RCP average. 🔴And the betting markets still expect a Trump win. 🔴The New York Times commented yesterday that the response bias from Democrats, especially White Democrats, is as bad as 2016 and 2020, potentially resulting in another poll error in favor of Republicans.The internal polling for the campaigns is a bit better for Trump as his campaign internals show him down only by 2 in Virginia and up with all swing states, despite a slight tie in Michigan and some cause for concern regarding North Carolina.Democrat internal polls agree with the public polling that Harris will win the Midwest, and therefore the election.Their final days of campaigning reflect this, as Harris is doing all 4 of her final rallies in Pennsylvania, while Trump is going to North Carolina, followed by 2 stops in Pennsylvania, and finishing off the race in Grand Rapids Michigan, the site of his grand finale in 2016.The early vote data in Florida, Nevada, and Pennsylvania look to be indicating a very strong Republican performance, although the gender gap in turnout is about a point or 2 more female than 2020 depending on the state.The RN Team will be following the final campaign events throughout the day to bring you breaking updates and will be out a prediction this evening.	https://t.me/rnintel/19271	2024-11-04T09:30:51-08:00
