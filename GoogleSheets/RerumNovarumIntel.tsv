The entire Ukrainian group in Kursk is helping Russia seize the Donetsk region! My comrades and I generally think that it would be a good idea to check this Russian General Syrsky for treason, because due to the withdrawal of reserves we are just sitting here naked. No equipment, no reinforcements. We are sitting and waiting for a miracle. But it won't happen. It turns out that the Russians haven't withdrawn their reserves from Donetsk and don't seem to be planning to, so what the hell is all this Kursk attack for then?- – Ukrainian 79th Brigade, 'Cyborgs', who operate in the Mariinka-Ugledar direction.	https://t.me/rnintel/13723	2024-08-21T07:51:08-07:00
