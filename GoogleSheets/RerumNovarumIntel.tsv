The state of the race, according to pollsters, are as follows:Final New York Times polls show a Harris win. 🔵Final Emerson College polls show a Trump win. 🔴Final YouGov polls show a Harris win. 🔵Final Morning Consult polls show a Trump win. 🔴Nate Silvers' model has reverted to 51/49 in favor of Trump. 🔴While Trump maintains a 0.1% lead in the RCP average. 🔴And the betting markets still expect a Trump win. 🔴The New York Times commented yesterday that the response bias from Democrats, especially White Democrats, is as bad as 2016 and 2020, potentially resulting in another poll error in favor of Republicans.The internal polling for the campaigns is a bit better for Trump as his campaign internals show him down only by 2 in Virginia and up with all swing states, despite a slight tie in Michigan and some cause for concern regarding North Carolina.Democrat internal polls agree with the public polling that Harris will win the Midwest, and therefore the election.Their final days of campaigning reflect this, as Harris is doing all 4 of her final rallies in Pennsylvania, while Trump is going to North Carolina, followed by 2 stops in Pennsylvania, and finishing off the race in Grand Rapids Michigan, the site of his grand finale in 2016.The early vote data in Florida, Nevada, and Pennsylvania look to be indicating a very strong Republican performance, although the gender gap in turnout is about a point or 2 more female than 2020 depending on the state.The RN Team will be following the final campaign events throughout the day to bring you breaking updates and will be out a prediction this evening.	https://t.me/rnintel/19271	2024-11-04T09:30:51-08:00

Rerum Novarum // Intel, Breaking News, and Alerts: 🇸🇾⚡- Levant Forces have captured the city of Akhtarin, north Syria. 🇸🇾 - The situation in the north of Syria this morning:The Suqour al-Sham Brigades have entered the Turkish military stronghold of Kafr Jennah, fighting still ongoing. East of Azaz, the Suqour al-Sham Brigades have captured Joint Forces stronghold of Akhtarin.Media affiliated with the Sultan Murad Division (of the Joint Forces) claim they have captured Hawar Kilis, however there is no evidence of this yet. Their forces did however storm Suqour al-Sham Brigades headquarters in the north of the city last night.Although both sides were initially armed by Turkey, it seems Turkey has sided with the Sultan Murad Division and the rest of the Joint Forces. Large Turkish military convoys were seen moving towards Kafr Jennah last night as well as Turkish UAV strikes on Suqour al-Sham positions.The Suqour al-Sham Brigades are being supported by the US-backed Levant Forces. Essentially, the fighting has resulted in the end of the Syrian National Army (SNA), causing it to split - both sides were major subgroups of the SNA. Most of the smaller SNA units have remained neutral and have been calling for ceasefires, although some have sided with the Sultan Murad Division.Currently, the Turkish-backed Joint Forces are on the backfoot, with the US-backed Levant Forces gaining ground rapidly. There has been no infighting around Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has remained largely neutral but has voiced support for the Suqour al-Sham Brigades. And the Turkistan Islamic Party, Ansar al-Tawhid and the Uyghurs mercenaries have also remained largely neutral.Suqour al-Sham affiliated media claims Turkey has begun recalling Sultan Murad mercenaries (mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis and Uyghurs) from Libya back to Syria as reinforcements. However, there is no evidence of this yet.Russia has taken the opportunity to bombard both sides while they fight each other, with constant airstrikes throughout the night and into the morning.	https://t.me/rnintel/18219	2024-10-17T03:51:17-07:00
