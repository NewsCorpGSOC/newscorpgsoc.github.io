Israel's air defenses were completely overwhelmed, and in multiple cases simply did not fire on Iranian missiles.Israel will respond for this. This won't go unanswered. There's a very high likelihood that this leads to a kinetic exchange between Iran and Israel, and this very much could break out into a full-scale regional war.Only time will tell.	https://t.me/rnintel/17224	2024-10-01T10:58:14-07:00

🔁 Israel has had surprising success with its airstrikes, assassi...	Forwarded From Nicholas J. FuentesIsrael has had surprising success with its airstrikes, assassinations, and cyberattacks against Hezbollah— but if the War Cabinet is seriously considering a ground operation in south Lebanon that could be a different story.Israel certainly wants the world to think that this is imminent, whether or not they intend to follow through. Maybe it’s leverage, maybe it’s bait.If Israel is planning an invasion it will be a completely different story than the ongoing conflict. Israel can’t rely on airpower and tech -wizardry- alone, they’ll have to overcome the tactical problems that cost them the war in 2006.This leads me to believe the -invasion plans- might be a gambit to bait Iran or Hezbollah into a counterattack so that Israel can draw the United States further in before any major offensive in Lebanon. Then again, many said that Israel wouldn’t go into Gaza last year and then they did.But Hezbollah is much tougher than Hamas.	https://t.me/rnintel/16920	2024-09-30T05:39:48-07:00

SAF posted footage which was geolocated to Azhari Road, at 15.64179, 32.51896. The purpose of this offensive is likely to breach the encirclement of SAF in the al-Waburat district. In the south SAF crossed the Blue Nile Bridge. Geolocated footage shows SAF at 15.60303, 32.51335, on al-Gamhuriya Avenue. The advance therefore confirms SAF control over the National Museum and more importantly over the Tuti Bridge opposite the museum. Rapid Support Forces, RSF, on the Tuti Island have been completely cut off as the only access to the island is via the bridge. To the east of the museum fighting is still ongoing at al-Neelain University.	https://t.me/rnintel/16644	2024-09-27T03:25:33-07:00

Iran probably will as well. But, at this point, it will require near pin-point precise calculations and decision making on behalf of Hezbollah and Iran in order to avoid an all-out war.On a purely tactical and strategic basis, Hezbollah has an immense edge against Israel, especially if Israel decided to invade Lebanon. It would be a bloody and brutal war, for both sides, but Hezbollah would likely come out on top in a painful but nonetheless pyrrhic victory. This is only if Hezbollah decides to take decisive and bold action, which they have yet to do.	https://t.me/rnintel/15899	2024-09-21T12:49:55-07:00
🇱🇧🇮🇱 - Some commentary on the increasing tensions between Hez...	🇱🇧🇮🇱 - Some commentary on the increasing tensions between Hezbollah and Israel:It's very obvious that Israel is vigorously working to coax Hezbollah into a massive retaliation in order to acquire a justification to launch a full-scale war against Lebanon. Of course, this is not in Hezbollah's interest.Hezbollah has stated - since October 8th - that its entire objective is to thwart the ambitions of Israel and to support Hamas in Gaza. If Hezbollah were to launch a massive retaliation, they would be serving Israel exactly what they want on a silver platter, and it would allow Israel to invade Lebanon and turn Lebanon into the next Gaza.At the same time, however, Hezbollah has proven itself for the last 40 years to be the single greatest threat to Israel, besides Iran, as Iran does not share any land border or proximity to Israel. The only way that Hezbollah has maintained this image is by displaying its power and deterrence through occasional spikes in attacks, which Hezbollah has not fully committed to showing off since Israel has -moved the front- to the north.Hezbollah did not have to enter the conflict between Hamas and Israel on October 8th. However, they did, when they really did not have to. It was a very bold but risky move to make, and this move required immense calculus on behalf of Hezbollah's senior leadership in anticipating the worst case scenario, which has arrived. In retrospect, the ruling Likud regime in Israel more than likely wanted and expected Hezbollah to enter the conflict in some way, as this would justify wiping out all of Israel's closest threats, and ultimately finishing off the entire cycle by coaxing the United States into war with Iran, the one country Israel has no chance of defeating on its own.To summarize, Hezbollah is stuck. If they retaliate too strongly for the recent actions of Israel, they risk the entirety of Lebanon being decimated in the same way that Gaza was. If they don't retaliate at all, which is ostensibly what they have been doing for the last few weeks, then they risk being disregarded as a legitimate threat to Israel, they lose all of their deterrence against Israel, and are ultimately destroyed. In short- they're damned if they do, damned if they don't.Hezbollah hasn't miscalculated their actions, it would seem, but they are stuck in an impossible balance of maintaining their security deterrence and strength while also preventing all-out war in Lebanon. Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese political establishment, and so they have accountability to the Lebanese public and political system. It will be very difficult for Hezbollah to maintain any kind of prominence in Lebanon if they are disarmed - whether forcibly by Israel or forcibly by the public - and they will be destroyed in the end.This explains why Hezbollah has done next to nothing in response to the grotesque pager terrorist attacks, followed by the unprecedented airstrikes and decapitation strikes against Hezbollah military leadership. At once, they must retaliate to show their strength, but they also must prevent all-out war in some way shape or form.The only two factors that could break this position that Hezbollah finds itself in are the United States and Iran. If the United States makes it clear they will not support any Israeli incursions into Lebanon, Hezbollah has a lot more wiggle room. However, this is unlikely. If Iran steps in and declares guarantees for Hezbollah and promises to intervene if Israel invades, Israel itself may have to recalculate and that would, in due time, give Hezbollah the room they need to strike back.As we previously wrote, the inaction by the Axis of Resistance has resulted in this situation. Israel definitely fears Hezbollah and Iran, they have made that very clear. However, they also feel free to push around the Axis of Resistance with no consequences, as they have not been attacked properly for their incredibly destabilizing actions.	https://t.me/rnintel/15898	2024-09-21T12:45:02-07:00

FuentesIsrael-critical analysts say that Israel will surely suffer a catastrophic defeat in a war with Iran and its Axis of Resistance, but they seem to be ignoring the critical factor which is the potential involvement of the United States.The US has been getting drawn further into the conflict as its personnel have come under fire in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan, it has been forced to engage the Houthis to defend shipping in the Red Sea, Congress armed Israel with $26 billion in aid, and the US navy has mobilized to deter Iran's counter-attacks in April and August.So why is nobody talking about the obvious conclusion? Which is that the supposedly delusional, irrational hopes of Netanyahu to successfully confront Iran and Hezbollah in all likelihood rest on a blank check from the United States guaranteed by a Trump White House.Just as in 2016, Netanyahu is clearly putting his finger on the scale in this election in the hopes that the Zionist-controlled GOP will retake the White House and bail him out. How will they achieve that? False flags.	https://t.me/rnintel/15692	2024-09-20T09:19:00-07:00

Today should not have surprised them, and they likely won't even retaliate for today in an appropriate manner. 🇱🇧🇮🇱 - Israel has been stacking troops and equipment on the northern border for the last 10 months. Hezbollah has done next to nothing to scale this back, deal with it preemptively, or establish reliable deterrence with Israel at all. In short- Hezbollah has ignored the realities of Israel's ambitions, which is to destroy all of their neighboring threats, in one war.Hezbollah has had ample time to prepare defenses for something like today. They should have, and likely did know that Israel was planning on moving the frontline to the north. They clearly ignored all possible threats and chose to pretend they were king of the hill.Today, Israel carried out a grotesque and inhumane violation of not just Lebanon's sovereignty, but the dignity of humankind. Blowing up pagers and risking tens of thousands of civilians is something Israel is more than familiar with doing, but Hezbollah dug its head in the sand and pretended like everything was okay.Today's attacks in Lebanon have crippled Hezbollah. Hundreds, if not thousands of fighters are missing fingers, limbs, and eyesight. Those injured today will likely never go back to combat. Hospitals are now packed full of injured innocents, and Hezbollah will never attack Israel when their communications are crippled and their hospitals are filled with innocents.Hezbollah brought this on themselves. Resisting Israel with -strong words of condemnation- and miniscule, pussyfooted attacks is not enough to keep Israel in check. In fact, it energized Israel and made them push the envelope even further.Perhaps the Axis of Resistance wakes up to the reality of their ineptitude, inaction, and weakness- but they likely won't.

These explosions, the causes of which are still unknown, led to the martyrdom of a girl and two brothers, and the injury of a large number of people with various injuries.Hezbollah's competent agencies are currently conducting a wide-ranging security and scientific investigation to determine the causes that led to these simultaneous explosions. Likewise, medical and health agencies are treating the wounded and injured in a number of hospitals in various Lebanese regions.We ask God Almighty to have mercy on our righteous martyrs on the road to Jerusalem, and we pray for the wounded and injured to recover quickly, and we call on our honorable people to be aware of the rumors and false and misleading information that some parties are spreading in a way that serves the psychological war in the interest of the Zionist enemy, especially since this is accompanied by the Zionist enemy’s speeches of intimidation and threats and what it calls changing the situation in the north.We affirm that the resistance, at all its levels and various units, is at the highest level of readiness to defend Lebanon and its steadfast people.-	https://t.me/rnintel/15045	2024-09-17T08:10:29-07:00

There seems to be some evidence that this was personal and premeditated, given his somewhat obvious social media objections to Trump dating back to 2020. However, was the targeting of Trump something he was ordered to do by his handlers - who apparently are either State Department or some kind of military complex - or was this his own little venture?Given this attempted assassin actually survived and can be cross-examined, unlike the last shooter, we may find some answers, but given the nature of this man's background and the heavy involvement of the FBI, it's not likely we'll be given a lot of truth, in fact this entire case may end up being memory-holed as an -incident- rather than an attempt on Trump's life.	https://t.me/rnintel/14855	2024-09-15T19:11:48-07:00
