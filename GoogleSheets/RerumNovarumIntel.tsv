Rerum Novarum // Intel, Breaking News, and Alerts: 🇸🇾⚡- Levant Forces have captured the city of Akhtarin, north Syria. 🇸🇾 - The situation in the north of Syria this morning:The Suqour al-Sham Brigades have entered the Turkish military stronghold of Kafr Jennah, fighting still ongoing. East of Azaz, the Suqour al-Sham Brigades have captured Joint Forces stronghold of Akhtarin.Media affiliated with the Sultan Murad Division (of the Joint Forces) claim they have captured Hawar Kilis, however there is no evidence of this yet. Their forces did however storm Suqour al-Sham Brigades headquarters in the north of the city last night.Although both sides were initially armed by Turkey, it seems Turkey has sided with the Sultan Murad Division and the rest of the Joint Forces. Large Turkish military convoys were seen moving towards Kafr Jennah last night as well as Turkish UAV strikes on Suqour al-Sham positions.The Suqour al-Sham Brigades are being supported by the US-backed Levant Forces. Essentially, the fighting has resulted in the end of the Syrian National Army (SNA), causing it to split - both sides were major subgroups of the SNA. Most of the smaller SNA units have remained neutral and have been calling for ceasefires, although some have sided with the Sultan Murad Division.Currently, the Turkish-backed Joint Forces are on the backfoot, with the US-backed Levant Forces gaining ground rapidly. There has been no infighting around Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has remained largely neutral but has voiced support for the Suqour al-Sham Brigades. And the Turkistan Islamic Party, Ansar al-Tawhid and the Uyghurs mercenaries have also remained largely neutral.Suqour al-Sham affiliated media claims Turkey has begun recalling Sultan Murad mercenaries (mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis and Uyghurs) from Libya back to Syria as reinforcements. However, there is no evidence of this yet.Russia has taken the opportunity to bombard both sides while they fight each other, with constant airstrikes throughout the night and into the morning.	https://t.me/rnintel/18219	2024-10-17T03:51:17-07:00

Rerum Novarum // Intel, Breaking News, and Alerts: 🌩️⚡️- Scenes from Clewiston, Florida. 🌩⚡️- Multiple more tornados were triggered across south Florida due to Hurricane Milton, most notably in Fort Myers and West Palm Beach.Casualty counts are still being assessed in Fort Myers, while many rural areas of West Palm Beach - specifically Palm Beach Gardens, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington - suffered road closures and blackouts due to falling trees and power lines, although known casualties are minimal.Today was only a small part of what many south Florida communities will experience from Hurricane Milton, and tomorrow is likely to be substantially worse.	https://t.me/rnintel/17833	2024-10-09T17:39:48-07:00

Israel's air defenses were completely overwhelmed, and in multiple cases simply did not fire on Iranian missiles.Israel will respond for this. This won't go unanswered. There's a very high likelihood that this leads to a kinetic exchange between Iran and Israel, and this very much could break out into a full-scale regional war.Only time will tell.	https://t.me/rnintel/17224	2024-10-01T10:58:14-07:00

🔁 Israel has had surprising success with its airstrikes, assassi...	Forwarded From Nicholas J. FuentesIsrael has had surprising success with its airstrikes, assassinations, and cyberattacks against Hezbollah— but if the War Cabinet is seriously considering a ground operation in south Lebanon that could be a different story.Israel certainly wants the world to think that this is imminent, whether or not they intend to follow through. Maybe it’s leverage, maybe it’s bait.If Israel is planning an invasion it will be a completely different story than the ongoing conflict. Israel can’t rely on airpower and tech -wizardry- alone, they’ll have to overcome the tactical problems that cost them the war in 2006.This leads me to believe the -invasion plans- might be a gambit to bait Iran or Hezbollah into a counterattack so that Israel can draw the United States further in before any major offensive in Lebanon. Then again, many said that Israel wouldn’t go into Gaza last year and then they did.But Hezbollah is much tougher than Hamas.	https://t.me/rnintel/16920	2024-09-30T05:39:48-07:00
