The talks were held with Yulia Tymoshenko, a Ukrainian political veteran, and Petro Poroshenko, former Ukrainian President. 🇺🇸🇺🇦 - Ukrainian outlet, Kiev Independent, confirms Trump's team held secret talks with Ukrainian opposition figures on holding elections, in a bid to remove Zelensky from power.The talks were held with former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, a veteran of Ukrainian politics. Tymoshenko belongs to the Batkivshchyna, a far-right conservative party. The party is far more anti-Russia than Zelensky's Servant of the Peoples Party.Trump's team also spoke with Poroshenko, the former President of Ukraine, and post-Maidan President. Poroshenko's popularity in Ukraine plummeted after the 'Roshen Chocolate Company' scandal. Poroshenko's government was believed to have been influenced by Ukraine's far-right sectors, which was evident by several appointments he had made. Such as Azov-linked Avakov as Interior Minister, and Troyan as Kiev's Chief of Police (a former Azov Commander). Both figures are unpopular, and unlikely to replace Zelensky in an election. With the only real candidate of succeeding Zelensky being Zaluzhny. Zaluzhny will end up proving more difficult to negotiate with than Zelensky. The US witnessed Zaluzhny's stubbornness during Ukraine's '2023 Counteroffensive', when Zaluzhny blasted NATO's tactics as 'obsolete' after multiple failed attacks. Instead launched his own tactics, and saw mild success.All three opposition figures have rejected calls for an early election in Ukraine.	https://t.me/rnintel/28469	2025-03-06T02:46:30-08:00

Dubinsky, while working for '1+1 Channel', offered a very positive coverage of Zelensky in the lead-up to the 2019 elections. The two have since fallen out over Dubinsky's strong opposition towards the Ukrainian far-right and over Dubinsky's ties to Ihor Kolomoyskyi.Note, Kolomoyskyi, a former Ukrainian-Israeli oligarch, was stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship by Zelensky. Kolomoyskyi had long been accused corruption and of forming and financing anti-Maidan units in 2014, such as the 'Dnepr Gangs', which clashed with Azov on several occasions. Several Azov-linked politicians (such as Interior Minister Avakov) led for the nationalization of Kolomoyskyi's PrivatBank. Kolomoyskyi took the Poroshenko government to court in return. Kolomoyskyi was a large donor to 1+1 Channel, which Dubinsky worked for.	https://t.me/rnintel/28244	2025-03-04T00:33:58-08:00
