Forwarded From ShamS⚡️🇸🇦🇸🇾 Outcome of the Riyadh Meetings on Syria❗️Participants at the meeting called for immediate Israeli withdrawal from occupied Syrian territories in the south but ignored Turkish occupation in the north-eastThe foreign ministers and representatives of Arab and Western countries discussed the steps to support the Syrian people and provide them with all the aid and support in this critical phase of their history. The discussions also focused on helping Syrians to rebuild their country as a unified, independent and safe Arab state for all its citizens, with no place for terrorism, no breach of its sovereignty or aggression on its territorial integrity from any party.The participants discussed their support for a Syrian political transitional process represented by Syrian political and social forces that preserves the rights of all Syrians with the participation of various components of the Syrian people. This is also to work to address any challenges or sources of concern for various parties through dialogue and providing support, advice and consultation in a manner that respects Syria's independence and sovereignty, taking into account that the future of Syria is the concern of the Syrians, stressing their support for the choices of the Syrian people and respecting their will.❗️The ministers also expressed their concern about Israel's incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and the neighboring sites in Mount Hermon and Quneitra governorate, stressing the importance of respecting Syria's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.⁉️ However, the discussions noticeably avoided addressing Turkey's ongoing military operations and occupation of cities in NE Syria. The extensive attacks and alleged violations by Turkish forces were absent from the statement, despite their continued impact on the region and Syrian stability.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/25087	2025-01-12T14:11:21-08:00

Rerum Novarum // Intel, Breaking News, and Alerts: 🇱🇾⚡- Pro-GNA activists in Tajouri demand, in a statement, the -overthrow of Dbiebah- and the -arrest of Najla al-Mangoush- for admitting to meet Eli Cohen. 🇱🇾 - The situation in western Libya was likely orchestrated by Qatar purposefully.Former Tripoli's Foreign Minister, Najla al-Mangoush's interview in which she confesses to meeting Eli Cohen was published by the pro Muslim Brotherhood outlet, al-Jazeera, to cause unrest against the Misrata-based National Unity Government (NUG), led by 'Prime Minister' Dbiebah.The NUG was established after the escalation in fighting between 2019-2020. The NUG was to bring together the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR). The HoR was, and still is, supported militarily by Khalifa Haftar's LNA. The HoR pushed for Dbiebah to lead the newly established Misrata-based NUG. After Dbiebah began attacking US-backed Sadiq al-Kabir (then the Governor of Libya's Central Bank), the HoR withdrew their support and set-up a rival to the NUG, the Government of National Stability (GNS) based in Benghazi. The GNS is currently led by Osama Hamada.The NUG is no longer supported by the HoR (and therefore Khalifa Haftar) and lacks support amongst the GNA, as he wasn't their choice when the NUG was initially being established.The recent flare ups in western Libya look like they are aimed at toppling the NUG entirely, with Misrata falling back to the GNA. And as a result, things will return to pre-2021, two separate governments. Note, the GNA's military (mostly independent brigades) are mainly financed by Qatar and Turkey. With a majority of the mercenaries being the very same people who travelled to Syria to topple Bashar al-Assad.	https://t.me/rnintel/24839	2025-01-07T15:32:34-08:00

Local sources emphasized that the blast walls resembled those used around US bases in the region, and said that US troops had patrolled in the area in recent weeks.Construction of the US base continues. Apparently, the United States has decided to support SDF and prevent its NATO ally Turkey from invading Kobani for an operation to expand control in northern Syria.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/24609	2025-01-04T05:39:57-08:00

Forwarded From TabZ - Alternative Media (TabZ)🇺🇸🇮🇱⚠️ The FBI intercepted a potential plot targeting employees at a Florida office of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), according to court documents filed Monday.Forrest Kendall Pemberton was arrested after traveling to Plantation, Florida, with several firearms, including an AR-15 rifle, and allegedly scouting out AIPAC’s former office location. The affidavit, signed by FBI Special Agent Taylor Nicklin, states that Pemberton planned to return to the site with weapons but was stopped by law enforcement on December 25, the first night of Hanukkah.Pemberton's father alerted authorities on December 23 after discovering a letter left by his son, suggesting he intended to -close the loop- and -stoke the flames.- Further investigation revealed that Pemberton had searched for AIPAC’s former Plantation office on Google Maps, along with IRS locations in the area.After checking into a hotel near AIPAC's previous office on December 22 and leaving on December 23, Pemberton was later traced to a Tallahassee hotel. He was apprehended on December 25 while entering a ride-share vehicle with what appeared to be a soft rifle case.Pemberton admitted to targeting AIPAC due to its -political influence- and expressed frustration with the -status quo.- However, he claimed he had ultimately decided against carrying out any criminal action.The court documents describe AIPAC as an organization that -advocates and lobbies for pro-Israel policies,- echoing language on its website. Pemberton remains in custody as the investigation continues.@TabZLIVE	https://t.me/rnintel/24498	2025-01-02T10:37:42-08:00

The Turkish leader reasoned as if he had become the head of a neighbouring state, speaking of the need to lift sanctions on Syria as soon as possible and bring it back into the global community. Erdogan emphasised that Turkey is in close contact with the new Syrian authorities and will give them full support. Turkey intends to help Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to create a regular army of 300,000 people, which will be formed with the participation of Turkish military advisers and specialists. According to the Türkiye newspaper, the Turkish military contingent will be deployed in five vitally important areas in Syria, which indicates Turkey's intention to make Syria a springboard for resolving its geopolitical interests in other regions of the Middle East.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/24034	2024-12-25T04:32:31-08:00
