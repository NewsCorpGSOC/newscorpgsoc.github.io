Forwarded From Middle East Spectator— 🇮🇱/🇺🇸 NEW: Newly leaked documents reveal that in 2018, the Israeli government sought legal advice on how to avoid requirements of the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which mandates disclosure of foreign-backed lobbying campaigns. They proposed creating a new U.S. nonprofit to continue their activities while evading FARA disclosure. They also retained a prominent U.S. law firm, including the former DNC counsel, to analyze FARA risks and provide strategies to circumvent registration.@Middle_East_Spectator	https://t.me/rnintel/13603	2024-08-18T10:06:31-07:00
