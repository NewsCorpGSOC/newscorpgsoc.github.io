They raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenged they faced.- - President Trump.	https://t.me/rnintel/25488	2025-01-20T09:37:41-08:00

The discussions also focused on helping Syrians to rebuild their country as a unified, independent and safe Arab state for all its citizens, with no place for terrorism, no breach of its sovereignty or aggression on its territorial integrity from any party.The participants discussed their support for a Syrian political transitional process represented by Syrian political and social forces that preserves the rights of all Syrians with the participation of various components of the Syrian people. This is also to work to address any challenges or sources of concern for various parties through dialogue and providing support, advice and consultation in a manner that respects Syria's independence and sovereignty, taking into account that the future of Syria is the concern of the Syrians, stressing their support for the choices of the Syrian people and respecting their will.❗️The ministers also expressed their concern about Israel's incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and the neighboring sites in Mount Hermon and Quneitra governorate, stressing the importance of respecting Syria's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.⁉️ However, the discussions noticeably avoided addressing Turkey's ongoing military operations and occupation of cities in NE Syria. The extensive attacks and alleged violations by Turkish forces were absent from the statement, despite their continued impact on the region and Syrian stability.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/25087	2025-01-12T14:11:21-08:00
