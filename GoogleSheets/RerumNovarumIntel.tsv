It's very tiresome and annoying to see Iranians puff up their chest ahead of a retaliation, and do literally nothing for weeks, sometimes months.	https://t.me/rnintel/13619	2024-08-19T01:39:27-07:00

In other words, Iran is very quickly losing its window of opportunity. The more time Iran waits to respond, the more time the US and Israel can bulk up defenses and thwart or significantly reduce the damage caused by Iran's retaliation.On a similar note, as Iran is losing its window of opportunity, it means a response will either come soon or much later. It could happen this week, and at this rate it could happen next month. Genuinely, nobody knows. There will be signs that indicate an imminent response, with as little as an hour's notice, but regardless, there's a window that is closing very rapidly.	https://t.me/rnintel/13618	2024-08-19T01:31:57-07:00

Forwarded From Middle East Spectator— 🇮🇱/🇺🇸 NEW: Newly leaked documents reveal that in 2018, the Israeli government sought legal advice on how to avoid requirements of the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which mandates disclosure of foreign-backed lobbying campaigns. They proposed creating a new U.S. nonprofit to continue their activities while evading FARA disclosure. They also retained a prominent U.S. law firm, including the former DNC counsel, to analyze FARA risks and provide strategies to circumvent registration.@Middle_East_Spectator	https://t.me/rnintel/13603	2024-08-18T10:06:31-07:00
