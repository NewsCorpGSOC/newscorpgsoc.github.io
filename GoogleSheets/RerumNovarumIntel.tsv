In other words, Iran is very quickly losing its window of opportunity. The more time Iran waits to respond, the more time the US and Israel can bulk up defenses and thwart or significantly reduce the damage caused by Iran's retaliation.On a similar note, as Iran is losing its window of opportunity, it means a response will either come soon or much later. It could happen this week, and at this rate it could happen next month. Genuinely, nobody knows. There will be signs that indicate an imminent response, with as little as an hour's notice, but regardless, there's a window that is closing very rapidly.	https://t.me/rnintel/13618	2024-08-19T01:31:57-07:00
