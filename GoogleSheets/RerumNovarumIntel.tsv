Rerum Novarum // Intel, Breaking News, and Alerts: 🇸🇾⚡- Levant Forces have captured the city of Akhtarin, north Syria. 🇸🇾 - The situation in the north of Syria this morning:The Suqour al-Sham Brigades have entered the Turkish military stronghold of Kafr Jennah, fighting still ongoing. East of Azaz, the Suqour al-Sham Brigades have captured Joint Forces stronghold of Akhtarin.Media affiliated with the Sultan Murad Division (of the Joint Forces) claim they have captured Hawar Kilis, however there is no evidence of this yet. Their forces did however storm Suqour al-Sham Brigades headquarters in the north of the city last night.Although both sides were initially armed by Turkey, it seems Turkey has sided with the Sultan Murad Division and the rest of the Joint Forces. Large Turkish military convoys were seen moving towards Kafr Jennah last night as well as Turkish UAV strikes on Suqour al-Sham positions.The Suqour al-Sham Brigades are being supported by the US-backed Levant Forces. Essentially, the fighting has resulted in the end of the Syrian National Army (SNA), causing it to split - both sides were major subgroups of the SNA. Most of the smaller SNA units have remained neutral and have been calling for ceasefires, although some have sided with the Sultan Murad Division.Currently, the Turkish-backed Joint Forces are on the backfoot, with the US-backed Levant Forces gaining ground rapidly. There has been no infighting around Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has remained largely neutral but has voiced support for the Suqour al-Sham Brigades. And the Turkistan Islamic Party, Ansar al-Tawhid and the Uyghurs mercenaries have also remained largely neutral.Suqour al-Sham affiliated media claims Turkey has begun recalling Sultan Murad mercenaries (mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis and Uyghurs) from Libya back to Syria as reinforcements. However, there is no evidence of this yet.Russia has taken the opportunity to bombard both sides while they fight each other, with constant airstrikes throughout the night and into the morning.	https://t.me/rnintel/18219	2024-10-17T03:51:17-07:00
