Local sources emphasized that the blast walls resembled those used around US bases in the region, and said that US troops had patrolled in the area in recent weeks.Construction of the US base continues. Apparently, the United States has decided to support SDF and prevent its NATO ally Turkey from invading Kobani for an operation to expand control in northern Syria.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/24609	2025-01-04T05:39:57-08:00

Forwarded From TabZ - Alternative Media (TabZ)🇺🇸🇮🇱⚠️ The FBI intercepted a potential plot targeting employees at a Florida office of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), according to court documents filed Monday.Forrest Kendall Pemberton was arrested after traveling to Plantation, Florida, with several firearms, including an AR-15 rifle, and allegedly scouting out AIPAC’s former office location. The affidavit, signed by FBI Special Agent Taylor Nicklin, states that Pemberton planned to return to the site with weapons but was stopped by law enforcement on December 25, the first night of Hanukkah.Pemberton's father alerted authorities on December 23 after discovering a letter left by his son, suggesting he intended to -close the loop- and -stoke the flames.- Further investigation revealed that Pemberton had searched for AIPAC’s former Plantation office on Google Maps, along with IRS locations in the area.After checking into a hotel near AIPAC's previous office on December 22 and leaving on December 23, Pemberton was later traced to a Tallahassee hotel. He was apprehended on December 25 while entering a ride-share vehicle with what appeared to be a soft rifle case.Pemberton admitted to targeting AIPAC due to its -political influence- and expressed frustration with the -status quo.- However, he claimed he had ultimately decided against carrying out any criminal action.The court documents describe AIPAC as an organization that -advocates and lobbies for pro-Israel policies,- echoing language on its website. Pemberton remains in custody as the investigation continues.@TabZLIVE	https://t.me/rnintel/24498	2025-01-02T10:37:42-08:00

The Turkish leader reasoned as if he had become the head of a neighbouring state, speaking of the need to lift sanctions on Syria as soon as possible and bring it back into the global community. Erdogan emphasised that Turkey is in close contact with the new Syrian authorities and will give them full support. Turkey intends to help Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to create a regular army of 300,000 people, which will be formed with the participation of Turkish military advisers and specialists. According to the Türkiye newspaper, the Turkish military contingent will be deployed in five vitally important areas in Syria, which indicates Turkey's intention to make Syria a springboard for resolving its geopolitical interests in other regions of the Middle East.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/24034	2024-12-25T04:32:31-08:00

After the loss of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the fall of Assad, the last remaining active threat to Israel seems to be the Houthis.Israel is clearly trying to stifle this threat with airstrikes of their own against Yemen, however this has incited the Houthis to launch more missiles against Tel Aviv, directly.It will be interesting to see if Israel attempts to open another direct front against Ansarallah in Yemen, although this can only be done with the assistance of the United States.	https://t.me/rnintel/23871	2024-12-20T18:08:29-08:00

🔁 🇮🇱🇸🇾 Strategic Context of Israeli Strikes These attacks co...	Forwarded From ShamS🇮🇱🇸🇾 Strategic Context of Israeli StrikesThese attacks come amid a volatile period in Syria following the abrupt collapse of Assad’s regime. Analysts suggest the strikes are part of a broader Israeli strategy to neutralize military capabilities in Syria as the country transitions to new leadership.Ashraf Akka, an expert in international relations, explained that the airstrikes appear designed to -deny the nascent governing authorities in Syria any military leverage, including advanced weaponry or infrastructure that could shift regional power dynamics.-The port of Latakia is a critical hub for Syrian and allied forces. It has frequently been used to transport military equipment from Iran, a close ally of Assad’s regime, to Syria and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. Its targeting underscores Israel’s ongoing concerns about Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the potential transfer of advanced weaponry to hostile groups.The Ya’four and Damascus sites, central to Syria’s former military elite, hold symbolic and strategic importance. The strikes on these locations signal Israel’s intent to dismantle remnants of the Assad regime’s military infrastructure.Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria over the years, targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces. These actions are part of what Israel refers to as its -campaign between wars- strategy, aimed at weakening its adversaries without provoking a full-scale conflict.The recent strikes come at a pivotal moment for Syria as the country grapples with political instability and security vacuums. Israel has not officially commented on the latest operations, in line with its policy of ambiguity regarding military actions in Syria.The escalation highlights the fragility of the post-Assad landscape in Syria. Human rights advocates and political analysts have called for international oversight to prevent further destabilization and ensure that power vacuums do not lead to unchecked violence.Telegram | XTelegramShamSFact-based news about Syria &amp; Independent opinionsAdmin: @ShamS_EditorOur chat: @ShamS_CHATOur X: https://x.com/sham_syrianews	https://t.me/rnintel/23074	2024-12-09T23:20:37-08:00

The foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey will hold talks that could result in crucial decisions regarding the future of the Syrian Arab Republic and its President Bashar al-Assad.Based on the current situation in the country, Assad's chances of holding on to Syrian statehood are slim. Moreover, there are reports that he and his family have left Syria.Turkey is interested in weakening the positions of Russia and Iran in Syria and has used the offensive of the HTS and SNA controlled groups against the Syrian government forces to put pressure on Moscow and Tehran.Russia's priority will be to maintain control over the provinces of Latakia and Tartus, where military bases are located.In turn, Syria's ally Iran has realised that it cannot fight as an auxiliary force if the Syrian Army itself is unwilling to fight.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/22673	2024-12-06T20:18:26-08:00
