We instructed the Israeli Defense Force, IDF, to carry out a strong pre-emptive strike to remove this threat. The IDF destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rockets, which were intended to harm Israeli citizens and our forces. The IDF intercepted all Hezbollah drones that were intended to strike a strategic target in the center of our country.We are hitting Hezbollah with surprising urgency. Three weeks ago we eliminated Hezbollah's Chief of Staff and today we foiled its attack plan.Nasrallah in Beirut and Khamenei in Tehran should know that this is another step on the way to changing the situation in the north of Israel and return our residents safely to their homes. And I repeat - this is not the end.- Video is too big	https://t.me/rnintel/14046	2024-08-25T05:56:25-07:00
