Yemeni unity is essential to combat Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv’s conspiracies. The [Saudi-backed] Presidential Leadership Council, nor Saudi Arabia, nor even the US itself can resolve the ongoing crisis unless balance is restored in the southern political arena [referring to the Aden-based, UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council controlled Yemeni territory].Without this balance, the UAE-backed regionalist faction will not only control the south but will determine the fate of all Yemen. Today, we lament the loss of the state. If we do not act, tomorrow we will lose Yemen itself,- - Saleh al-Jabwani, former Minister of Transport for the Saudi-backed Yemeni Presidential Council.	https://t.me/rnintel/27009	2025-02-13T10:15:20-08:00
