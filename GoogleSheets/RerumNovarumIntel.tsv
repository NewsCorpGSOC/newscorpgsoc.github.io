The Turkish leader reasoned as if he had become the head of a neighbouring state, speaking of the need to lift sanctions on Syria as soon as possible and bring it back into the global community. Erdogan emphasised that Turkey is in close contact with the new Syrian authorities and will give them full support. Turkey intends to help Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to create a regular army of 300,000 people, which will be formed with the participation of Turkish military advisers and specialists. According to the Türkiye newspaper, the Turkish military contingent will be deployed in five vitally important areas in Syria, which indicates Turkey's intention to make Syria a springboard for resolving its geopolitical interests in other regions of the Middle East.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/24034	2024-12-25T04:32:31-08:00

🔁 🇮🇱🇸🇾 Strategic Context of Israeli Strikes These attacks co...	Forwarded From ShamS🇮🇱🇸🇾 Strategic Context of Israeli StrikesThese attacks come amid a volatile period in Syria following the abrupt collapse of Assad’s regime. Analysts suggest the strikes are part of a broader Israeli strategy to neutralize military capabilities in Syria as the country transitions to new leadership.Ashraf Akka, an expert in international relations, explained that the airstrikes appear designed to -deny the nascent governing authorities in Syria any military leverage, including advanced weaponry or infrastructure that could shift regional power dynamics.-The port of Latakia is a critical hub for Syrian and allied forces. It has frequently been used to transport military equipment from Iran, a close ally of Assad’s regime, to Syria and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. Its targeting underscores Israel’s ongoing concerns about Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the potential transfer of advanced weaponry to hostile groups.The Ya’four and Damascus sites, central to Syria’s former military elite, hold symbolic and strategic importance. The strikes on these locations signal Israel’s intent to dismantle remnants of the Assad regime’s military infrastructure.Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria over the years, targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces. These actions are part of what Israel refers to as its -campaign between wars- strategy, aimed at weakening its adversaries without provoking a full-scale conflict.The recent strikes come at a pivotal moment for Syria as the country grapples with political instability and security vacuums. Israel has not officially commented on the latest operations, in line with its policy of ambiguity regarding military actions in Syria.The escalation highlights the fragility of the post-Assad landscape in Syria. Human rights advocates and political analysts have called for international oversight to prevent further destabilization and ensure that power vacuums do not lead to unchecked violence.Telegram | XTelegramShamSFact-based news about Syria &amp; Independent opinionsAdmin: @ShamS_EditorOur chat: @ShamS_CHATOur X: https://x.com/sham_syrianews	https://t.me/rnintel/23074	2024-12-09T23:20:37-08:00

Forwarded From ShamS⚡️🇶🇦🇸🇾 Doha will decide the fate of Syria and Bashar al-AssadToday, 7 December, the Astana format meeting on Syria will be held in Qatar at the Doha Forum. The foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey will hold talks that could result in crucial decisions regarding the future of the Syrian Arab Republic and its President Bashar al-Assad.Based on the current situation in the country, Assad's chances of holding on to Syrian statehood are slim. Moreover, there are reports that he and his family have left Syria.Turkey is interested in weakening the positions of Russia and Iran in Syria and has used the offensive of the HTS and SNA controlled groups against the Syrian government forces to put pressure on Moscow and Tehran.Russia's priority will be to maintain control over the provinces of Latakia and Tartus, where military bases are located.In turn, Syria's ally Iran has realised that it cannot fight as an auxiliary force if the Syrian Army itself is unwilling to fight.Telegram | X	https://t.me/rnintel/22673	2024-12-06T20:18:26-08:00

In stark contrast, the United States operates only two heavy icebreakers, both of which rely on conventional propulsion.The newest addition to Russia’s nuclear icebreaker fleet, the Project 22220 Yakutiya, began sea trials this week. It joins three other vessels of the same class, along with four older nuclear-powered icebreakers, with two of them dating back to the Soviet era. Three additional Project 22220 icebreakers are currently in development.	https://t.me/rnintel/22458	2024-12-04T18:24:56-08:00

Skrmetti. The case is over Tennessee's ban on trans surgery for minors which was passed after heavy lobbying by Matt Walsh and conservative activists.The ACLU and the Biden Administration are arguing the ban violates the 14th Amendment. The ACLU lawyer, a trans named Chase Strangio is the first trans person to ever argue in front of the Supreme Court.In 2020 the last time a trans rights case was before the Court, they ruled 6-3 in favor of the ACLU agreeing that Civil Rights protections in hiring practices applied to transgenders.So far this morning the Conservative Justices are more reserved in their questioning of Strangio while the Liberal Justices Sotomayor, Jackson, and Kagan are bouncing off each other in heavily attacking Mathew Rice, the lawyer arguing in favor of Tennessee's law. Rice is holding his ground against them refusing to give up Tennessee's arguments.	https://t.me/rnintel/22417	2024-12-04T09:06:00-08:00

Those who follow the Russia-Ukraine conflict would already be aware, it's notorious for fabricating claims, and does so on purpose. It's a very unreliable source.For instance, on its current map, it has Russia at Borova gates. A vital city on the Oskol river. These are advances not even Russia claims. They are painted red, then a week or so later, a made-up Ukrainian counterattack repels Russia to the actual front-lines. Of course, there was no counterattack, as Russian forces weren't even there.
