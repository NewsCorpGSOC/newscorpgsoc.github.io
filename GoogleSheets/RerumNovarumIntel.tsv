Rerum Novarum // Intel, Breaking News, and Alerts: 🇱🇧🇮🇱 - Hezbollah suffered a devastating blow today, thanks to the entirety of the Axis of Resistance ignoring the reality of Israel's ambitions. Today should not have surprised them, and they likely won't even retaliate for today in an appropriate manner. 🇱🇧🇮🇱 - One last thing- none of this is to say Hezbollah is down and defeated. But it cannot be denied that the deterrence that not just Hezbollah but the AoR once held, the threat they once possessed, the check they held over Israel; that was unraveled today. While the pager attacks in Lebanon today were not massive, and certainly not enough to -cripple- Hezbollah, it's an embarrassment, a massive security failure, and one that the AoR set themselves up for.On a final note, our condolences and prayers are with all of the people of Lebanon as they are preparing to get thrown into the gauntlet of the Jewish war machine. We pray for those who lost loved ones today, in both the Christian and Muslim community.	https://t.me/rnintel/15143	2024-09-17T16:59:44-07:00

Today should not have surprised them, and they likely won't even retaliate for today in an appropriate manner. 🇱🇧🇮🇱 - Israel has been stacking troops and equipment on the northern border for the last 10 months. Hezbollah has done next to nothing to scale this back, deal with it preemptively, or establish reliable deterrence with Israel at all. In short- Hezbollah has ignored the realities of Israel's ambitions, which is to destroy all of their neighboring threats, in one war.Hezbollah has had ample time to prepare defenses for something like today. They should have, and likely did know that Israel was planning on moving the frontline to the north. They clearly ignored all possible threats and chose to pretend they were king of the hill.Today, Israel carried out a grotesque and inhumane violation of not just Lebanon's sovereignty, but the dignity of humankind. Blowing up pagers and risking tens of thousands of civilians is something Israel is more than familiar with doing, but Hezbollah dug its head in the sand and pretended like everything was okay.Today's attacks in Lebanon have crippled Hezbollah. Hundreds, if not thousands of fighters are missing fingers, limbs, and eyesight. Those injured today will likely never go back to combat. Hospitals are now packed full of injured innocents, and Hezbollah will never attack Israel when their communications are crippled and their hospitals are filled with innocents.Hezbollah brought this on themselves. Resisting Israel with -strong words of condemnation- and miniscule, pussyfooted attacks is not enough to keep Israel in check. In fact, it energized Israel and made them push the envelope even further.Perhaps the Axis of Resistance wakes up to the reality of their ineptitude, inaction, and weakness- but they likely won't. Eternal third world mindset.	https://t.me/rnintel/15137	2024-09-17T15:36:07-07:00

These explosions, the causes of which are still unknown, led to the martyrdom of a girl and two brothers, and the injury of a large number of people with various injuries.Hezbollah's competent agencies are currently conducting a wide-ranging security and scientific investigation to determine the causes that led to these simultaneous explosions. Likewise, medical and health agencies are treating the wounded and injured in a number of hospitals in various Lebanese regions.We ask God Almighty to have mercy on our righteous martyrs on the road to Jerusalem, and we pray for the wounded and injured to recover quickly, and we call on our honorable people to be aware of the rumors and false and misleading information that some parties are spreading in a way that serves the psychological war in the interest of the Zionist enemy, especially since this is accompanied by the Zionist enemy’s speeches of intimidation and threats and what it calls changing the situation in the north.We affirm that the resistance, at all its levels and various units, is at the highest level of readiness to defend Lebanon and its steadfast people.-	https://t.me/rnintel/15045	2024-09-17T08:10:29-07:00

There seems to be some evidence that this was personal and premeditated, given his somewhat obvious social media objections to Trump dating back to 2020. However, was the targeting of Trump something he was ordered to do by his handlers - who apparently are either State Department or some kind of military complex - or was this his own little venture?Given this attempted assassin actually survived and can be cross-examined, unlike the last shooter, we may find some answers, but given the nature of this man's background and the heavy involvement of the FBI, it's not likely we'll be given a lot of truth, in fact this entire case may end up being memory-holed as an -incident- rather than an attempt on Trump's life.	https://t.me/rnintel/14855	2024-09-15T19:11:48-07:00
