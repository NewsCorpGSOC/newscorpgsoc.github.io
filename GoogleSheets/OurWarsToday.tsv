However, the situation in #Donbas remains critical, with Russian forces steadily advancing despite well-established Ukrainian defenses. #Donetsk #Luhansk While exact figures on the number of Ukrainian forces committed to this operation remain unclear, Freuding described the Ukrainian strength as four brigades, roughly four to six thousand soldiers. These forces operating inside Russia are also supported by an additional two to four thousand troops inside Ukraine’s #Sumy region in logistics, air defense, and long-range fires support.Freuding described the operation as 65km wide, with advancements going as deep as 30km into Russian territory. He estimated that the total area in which Ukrainian forces are operating, not controlling, is around 1,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of ground lost to Russian forces in Ukraine since the beginning of the year.As the conflict progresses, the introduction of NATO-supplied equipment like F-16s may offer Ukraine a much-needed edge in countering Russian air assaults, though Freuding remains cautious about labeling them a -game changer.- Likewise, Ukraine and Russia are continuing to face challenges with air defense capabilities as strikes from either side largely go unabated. Additionally, evolving battlefield tactics, such as the use of buggies and motorbikes, underscore the adaptive nature of modern warfare as both sides react to advancements in drone technology and shifting combat dynamics.In short, the situation remains fluid. Freuding believes Ukraine is carrying out a calculated risk with its operations in Kursk, however, it must not jeopardize its ability to maintain and adapt defensive strategies in critical areas such as the Donbas.Read the full Atlas News analysis and details of Freuding's assessment here: https://theatlasnews.co/analysis/2024/08/16/what-is-the-german-militarys-perspective-on-the-kursk-offensive/Full video with English subtitles: https://youtu.be/xP3QTufqxzo Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37965	2024-08-16T20:56:28-07:00

Several other settlements have also been liberated. In total, more than eighty.- @ourwarstoday Zelensky claimed today, August 15, that Kyiv forces have taken full control of the vital energy crosspoint Russian town of Sudzha in the Kursk region.As the Kursk offensive continues, #Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov announced the deployment of additional forces to Belgorod Oblast to contain the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region, amid attempts by #Ukrainian forces to penetrate #Belgorod.It is still unclear where those troops may come from and how many of them will be diverted to ensure the defense of Kursk. According to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, relocated troops may represent several brigade-sized elements, each consisting of at least 1,000 troops. CNN, citing Western intelligence sources, reports that these reinforcements are primarily untrained conscripts, suggesting that they are being drawn from regions within Russia rather than from the frontlines in Donbas, where Moscow has been advancingFollowing this announcement, the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed on Telegram that several localities in Kursk Oblast previously captured by Ukrainian units have been retaken. These include the village of Kroupets, located 10 km from the Ukrainian border, and Martynovka, 8 km northeast of the strategic gas station in Sudzha.Additionally, Russian forces reportedly repelled attempts by Ukrainian mobile groups to advance deeper into Russian territory in the areas of Varvarovka, Safonovka, Sheptukhovka, Kauchuk, and Alekseevskoye.Read the full article and details here: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/16/russia-diverts-troops-to-counter-ukraines-kursk-offensive/theatlasnews.coRussia Diverts Troops to Counter Ukraine’s Kursk Offensive | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37963	2024-08-16T09:27:08-07:00

The military has already been given machine guns and is going to be sent into battle.The day before, at least 500 people were taken out of the military village of Kamenka near St. Petersburg, where the 138th separate motorized rifle brigade is based and where several hundred men who refused to fight were held. Their relatives told ASTRA about this. At the same time, criminal cases had already been opened against some of the refuseniks about leaving the unit, they were under investigation, and another part was awaiting a military commission. Among those under arrest are men with health problems, physical and mental: -They took away a man with category -D-, plus a man under the age of 70 who can barely walk, another man without an eye...-. According to relatives, yesterday at about 6 pm they received a message from the men who were there that they were suddenly called to the formation, and then, without explaining anything, they were put into KAMAZ trucks and taken away under guard to a military airfield. The first -batch- — about 300 people — was sent to an unknown destination. The second part — about 150 people — turned out to be 7 km from Kursk in the morning at a military training ground. -They took them, grabbed them like a parcel, put them in jail and took them away,- their wives and mothers say. Wives are afraid that they -will be thrown on the first line like meat, because they don't register anything, they don't say anything, everything is quiet.- -In the morning, my son wrote that now they are dressing us, they will give us a machine gun and most likely into battle,- says one of the interlocutors, whose mobilized son is being monitored by a psychiatrist after participating in the war. -If, God forbid, he has an explosion in his head and he shoots someone, who will be to blame for this?-–ASTRA---In related news, it was reported that western and U.S. officials believe Russia is not rotating or transferring more experienced units from the main frontline in Ukraine to Kursk, instead bolstering the incursion by Ukraine with lesser experienced or completely unexperienced conscripted troops.Ukrainian forces contrastly have reported issues of ammunition supply in regions such as Donetsk since the incursion into Kursk began. Also, they report the uptick of advance and constant pushing of Russian forces in the Pokrovsk direction.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37953	2024-08-16T08:18:04-07:00

These groups are the product of decades of instability in the DRC’s resource-rich east and vary from criminal groups to rebels against the government, civil defense militias, and ethnic militias. @ourwarstoday From an outside perspective, the conflict in the eastern DRC is, understandably, very difficult to grasp.While still forming a part of the larger problem, a number of these groups are largely insignificant when it comes to examining which groups actually have an impact on the security situation. The number of armed groups can be narrowed down significantly to a much smaller list of groups which are significant players in the eastern DRC, and in determining its path forward.So, let’s take a look at some of those groups.Read the full article and explainer here: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/11/clarifying-the-convoluted-eastern-congo/theatlasnews.coClarifying the Convoluted Eastern Congo | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37950	2024-08-15T21:39:32-07:00
