A Russian soldier headbutts a Ukrainian explosive FPV drone after it hovers and then plunges towards him, and then he just walks away. @ourwarstoday I've noticed a number of videos more recently appearing of FPV drones hovering/watching a soldier before striking. Interesting trend. Commentary by Russian milblogger Sasha Kots who published the footage:-Phenomenal shots! There are still heroes in Rus'!The enemy's FPV drone mockingly slowly flies up to our fighter and hovers at human height before attacking.Our fighter takes a stance as if it were a boxing ring.The drone attacks and the soldier lunges forward and headbutts the drone.Explosion. The smoke clears, and our hero calmly goes into the forest. How can you not believe that God is on our side!- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38064	2024-08-18T09:57:42-07:00

Russian milbloggers say New York has fallen again, I thought they had taken it over a week ago, but apparently there has been 10-20% contested by Ukrainian forces since then. #Donetsk @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38062	2024-08-18T08:58:10-07:00

The -Lyut 2.0- UGCV shown used by the 12th Azov Brigade, the Ukrainian ground drone reportedly has up -to 20 km range and the ability to work autonomously for 3 days.- @ourwarstoday Unmanned ground combat vehicle variants have increasingly shown up on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides of the frontline, from explosive RC cars all the way to autonomous turrets. Variants for carrying ammunition and supplies have appeared infrequently too.Via t.me/Tsaplienko/58870	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38054	2024-08-18T08:42:42-07:00

Russian soldiers ride into a storm on the frontlines in Ukraine, seemingly in a buggy, driving by fortifications, debris, and weaving through burnt out vehicle carcasses.

Our Wars, Today: A volcano has erupted in Russia 🇷🇺 🌋 The Shiveluch #volcano in #Russia has erupted, sending ash 8 kilometers into the sky and lava rolling down its side after a 7.0 magnitude #earthquake the Kamchatkatka region on Russia's east coast struck earlier. The volcano sits around 450 kilometers from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, minor damage to buildings closer to the volcano is reported. @ourwarstoday&nbsp;No casualties according to TASS, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake's epicenter was 55 miles from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and the depth of it was around 30 miles. Although Russia did not issue a #tsunami warning, the U.S. has, along the epicenter.Volcanic ash and minor lava eruptions are common at various times throughout the year; it's name means -smoking mountain- as it and the volcano Karymsky, also on the Kamchatka Peninsula, are some of the most active and continuously erupting volcanoes on the planet.Photos: Astra	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38050	2024-08-17T17:09:44-07:00

As pre-context for this, I couldn't find a version of this without the subtitles that it already had, I don't speak either language fluently so I'm not sure if they're accurate, since as you will see their source as well as their editor is a bit ideological. @ourwarstoday A pair of Ukrainian soldiers seemingly speaking a mix of German, and one disgustingly wearing an SS helmet, film an area of the border crossing into Russia boisterously and harass an elderly Russian man for no reason other than apparently their low moral characters. Subtitles and editing are done by Russian milbloggers. Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38045	2024-08-17T15:44:15-07:00
