🖼 🇩🇪 🇺🇦 Germany Charges Ukrainian for Nord Stream Pipelines ...	🇩🇪 🇺🇦 Germany Charges Ukrainian for Nord Stream Pipelines Explosion: theatlasnews.co As Atlas News reported in 2023, several Ukrainian suspects were being investigated after #German media broke the story of an intricate plot by #Ukrainian nationals to destroy the the Nord Stream 1 (NS1) and Nord Stream 2 (NS2) natural gas pipelines in September 2022. @ourwarstoday That investigation has borne fruit as the German Federal Prosecutor General announced it has obtained an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian national in connection with the sabotage. The man has been named as Volodymyr Z, driving instructor from Kyiv. and he was last reported to be in #Poland. This suspect and two others, a man and a woman are confirmed to have been near the pipelines on a German yacht called Andromeda, which we previously reported. The suspect was reportedly identified by the white van he used to transport the diving material to the marina where the Andromeda set off from.According to Russian Telegram page SHOT, Vladimir Zhuravlev is the aforementioned suspect. He reportedly attempted to gain Russian citizenship in 2009. The clandestine nature of the operation and the ability of the suspects to evade German and Polish authorities indicates a possible connection with Ukrainian intelligence services. However, it is not clear how the suspects were able to receive the highly technical training and equipment to carry out such an operation. Via theatlasnews.co ---Politico:German authorities transmitted the arrest warrant for Zhuravlev to #Poland in June after they were able to identify him thanks to photos and statements from witnesses, Die Zeit reported.Zhuravlov was not arrested because he had left Poland for #Ukraine in early July, Anna Adamiak, a spokesperson for Poland's prosecutor general, told Polish media. She added that #Germany had not entered his name into a law enforcement database, which is why Polish border guards were not aware he was wanted when he crossed the border.Tagesschau also named two other people as suspects alongside Zhuravlev — the married couple Svitlana and Yevhen U., who run a diving school in Ukraine and for whom Zhuravlov was said to have worked as a diver.In an interview with POLITICO on Wednesday morning, Svitlana Uspenska said that neither she nor her husband were involved in the attack, insisting she was in Kyiv at the time.Uspenska confirmed that she was a diver, -but my maximum depth is 30 meters.- The explosions happened at a depth of 70 to 80 meters, something she said might have been done by special forces but not by her. She added she plans to sue German media outlets for -a couple of million euros- for naming her in the case.She fled her home country after the Russian invasion and lived with her children in Austria and Bulgaria, among other places. Uspenska is now in Poland. Her husband Yevhen is a soldier fighting against Russian troops.Uspenska provided POLITICO with several photos and associated geodata showing her at various locations in Ukraine in the fall of 2022. It is unclear what role the German authorities attribute to her and her husband in the planning and execution of the attack. Zhuravlev did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37850	2024-08-14T08:48:12-07:00
🇻🇪 How Venezuela May Be Using Google Analytics to Track Politic...	🇻🇪 How Venezuela May Be Using Google Analytics to Track Political Dissidents: via theatlasnews.co On July 28, #Venezuela’s National Electoral Council declared that President Nicolas #Maduro had secured victory in the country’s disputed election with a 51 percent to 44 percent lead over oppositional candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. The election results were ultimately rejected by the opposition amid claims of fraud and ballot rigging. @ourwarstoday Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who had previously been barred from running for office by the Supreme Court earlier this year, has come out to claim that independently collected voter tallies show that Gonzalez won in a landslide with a 37 percent lead. With that, the opposition declared Gonzalez as the rightful winner.Protests against the results of the election quickly spun up within hours of Maduro declaring victory, which grew in size and intensity over the next several nights. The protests saw an intense crackdown by Venezuelan authorities and pro-Maduro Colectivos paramilitary forces as clashes across Caracas and its surrounding areas sprung up.The crackdown resulted in security forces arresting thousands of people and sending them to various prisons for detention. President Maduro announced on August 1st, during a televised address, that the country would build two prisons that would function as reeducation camps where the prisoners would conduct forced labor. While detainees have the ability to list their family members as part of the booking process to inform them of their whereabouts, they rarely do so out of fears the family members would also be arrested. However, one more option that family members and friends have to locate the detainees is the Venezuelan penitentiary website. This presents a significant threat because the Venezuelan government could monitor and target them using digital tools.A cyber investigation identified information that indicates the Venezuelan government is likely leveraging Google Analytics for surveillance purposes, which presents -significant privacy and security concerns associated with the Venezuelan government’s prison administration website,- http://www. ipsfa. gob[.]ve. There is -irrefutable evidence- that points to this, according to Chris Kubecka, a cybersecurity expert and freelance journalist.Read the full story and details about digital security exploits here: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/14/how-venezuela-may-be-using-google-analytics-to-track-political-dissidents/theatlasnews.coHow Venezuela May Be Using Google Analytics to Track Political Dissidents | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37849	2024-08-14T08:36:30-07:00
🇺🇸 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 🇮🇷 U.S. Approves $20 Billion Arms Sale to Israel...	🇺🇸 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 🇮🇷 U.S. Approves $20 Billion Arms Sale to Israel:WASHINGTON (AP) — The #UnitedStates has approved $20 billion in arms sales to #Israel, including scores of fighter jets and advanced air-to-air missiles, the State Department announced Tuesday. @ourwarstoday Congress was notified of the impending sale, which includes more than 50 F-15 fighter jets, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMs, 120 mm tank ammunition and high explosive mortars and tactical vehicles and comes at a time of intense concern that Israel may become involved in a wider Middle East war with #Iran and it's allies. However, the weapons are not expected to get to Israel anytime soon, they are contracts that will take years to fulfill. Much of what is being sold is to help Israel increase its military capability in the long term.-The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,- the State Department said in a release on the sale.The Biden administration has had to balance its continued support for Israel with a growing number of calls from lawmakers and the U.S. public to curb military support there due to the high number of civilian deaths in #Gaza, #Palestine. It has curbed one delivery of 2,000-pound weapons amid continued airstrikes by Israel in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza.The contracts will cover not only the sale of new 50 aircraft to be produced by Boeing. It will also include upgrade kits for Israel to modify its existing fleet of two dozen F-15 fighter jets with new engines and radars, among other upgrades. The jets comprise the biggest portion of the $20 billion in sales with the first deliveries expected in 2029.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37848	2024-08-13T14:33:43-07:00
