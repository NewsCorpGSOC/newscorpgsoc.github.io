Russian soldiers ride into a storm on the frontlines in Ukraine, seemingly in a buggy, driving by fortifications, debris, and weaving through burnt out vehicle carcasses. The passenger riding shotgun holds a shotgun to fend off drones. @ourwarstoday Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38052	2024-08-17T18:15:52-07:00

Our Wars, Today: A volcano has erupted in Russia 🇷🇺 🌋 The Shiveluch #volcano in #Russia has erupted, sending ash 8 kilometers into the sky and lava rolling down its side after a 7.0 magnitude #earthquake the Kamchatkatka region on Russia's east coast struck earlier. The volcano sits around 450 kilometers from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, minor damage to buildings closer to the volcano is reported. @ourwarstoday&nbsp;No casualties according to TASS, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake's epicenter was 55 miles from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and the depth of it was around 30 miles. Although Russia did not issue a #tsunami warning, the U.S. has, along the epicenter.Volcanic ash and minor lava eruptions are common at various times throughout the year; it's name means -smoking mountain- as it and the volcano Karymsky, also on the Kamchatka Peninsula, are some of the most active and continuously erupting volcanoes on the planet.Photos: Astra	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38050	2024-08-17T17:09:44-07:00

As pre-context for this, I couldn't find a version of this without the subtitles that it already had, I don't speak either language fluently so I'm not sure if they're accurate, since as you will see their source as well as their editor is a bit ideological. @ourwarstoday A pair of Ukrainian soldiers seemingly speaking a mix of German, and one disgustingly wearing an SS helmet, film an area of the border crossing into Russia boisterously and harass an elderly Russian man for no reason other than apparently their low moral characters. Subtitles and editing are done by Russian milbloggers. Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38045	2024-08-17T15:44:15-07:00

The Russian soldier is said to from Yakutia, Republic of Sakha, and part of the 1461st Motorized Rifle -Sedoy- Regiment.

Chechen Assault Cybertruck:Leader of the #Russian-aligned #Chechen Republic Ramzan #Kadyrov recently showed off his modified Cybertruck that has a mounted heavy machine gun, a Kord 12.7mm. He promises to bring this improvised fighting vehicle/NSTV/technical to the frontlines in #Ukraine where it will be -in demand- according to him. Posted today August 17th. @ourwarstodayKadyrov: -We received a Tesla cybertruck from the respected Elon Musk.I was happy to test the new equipment and personally saw that it is not by chance that it is called the -Cyberbeast-. A real invulnerable and fast animal. A maneuverable vehicle, it develops excellent speed and overcomes obstacles. A very comfortable car. Based on such excellent characteristics, the cybertruck will soon be sent to the SVO zone, where it will be in demand in appropriate conditions. I am sure that this -beast- will bring a lot of benefit to our soldiers.I express my sincere gratitude to Elon Musk! He is, of course, the strongest genius of our time and a specialist. A great man! Well, the cybertruck turned out to be a powerful project. Undoubtedly one of the best cars in the world! I literally fell in love with this car.Elon, thank you! Come to Grozny, I will receive you as the most dear guest! I do not think that our Russian MFA will be against such a trip. And, of course, we are waiting for your new developments that will contribute to the completion of the SVO.-Source: t.me/RKadyrov_95/4999 Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38027	2024-08-17T11:05:31-07:00
