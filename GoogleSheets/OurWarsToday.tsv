🖼 🇺🇸 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 #NEW U.S. Joins Russian Federation in Vote Agai...	🇺🇸 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 #NEW U.S. Joins Russian Federation in Vote Against Condemnation of Russo-Ukrainian War, Proposes Diplomacy Over Punitive Measures For U.N. Conflict Resolution:The #UnitedNations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning #Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the U.S. among 18 countries opposing it. The measure, titled -Advancing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in #Ukraine,- received 93 votes in favor and 65 abstentions, including from China. Ukraine’s European allies supported the resolution, which is non-binding but signals a shift in U.S. policy under the #Trump administration toward improving relations with Russia.⁠⁠Trump has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr #Zelenskiy for the war, calling him a -dictator without elections.- His administration’s diplomats have avoided directly criticizing Russian President Vladimir #Putin, widening a divide within the Republican Party. Meanwhile, the #UnitedStates introduced a competing resolution, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating it aligns with Trump’s view that the U.N. should focus on maintaining peace through diplomatic settlement rather than punitive resolutions.⁠⁠Ambassador Dorothy Shea, a Biden appointee, argued that past resolutions have failed to stop the war. She urged all member states, including Ukraine and Russia, to back the U.S. proposal, which she described as a -historic statement- focused on ending the conflict. The confirmation of Trump’s nominee for U.N. ambassador, Rep. Elise Stefanik, remains stalled in the Senate due to Democratic opposition to the administration’s policy shifts.⁠⁠Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, escalating a conflict that began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and support for separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. The invasion triggered widespread international sanctions against Moscow and military aid to Kyiv from Western nations. ⁠–Ground News - instagran.com/groundnews---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40730	2025-02-24T15:26:21-08:00

↩️🖼 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — #Russia launched more strike ...	Our Wars, Today: Russia launches a record number of drones into Ukraine on the eve of the war's 3-year anniversary Russia has launched a record number of drones into Ukraine on the eve of the three-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion. t.me/ourwarstoday – t.m… 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — #Russia launched more strike drones into #Ukraine overnight on Saturday than in any other single attack of the war, Ukrainian President #Zelenskiy said on Sunday, one day before the three-year anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion.Writing on social media, Zelenskyy said 267 strike drones had been sent in what he called -the largest attack since Iranian drones began hitting Ukrainian cities and villages.- Ukraine’s air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets.Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in a missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration.The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.Ukraine fears Trump’s policy shift toward Putin:#Trump’s engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy which had previously sought to isolate Russia and its president, Vladimir #Putin, over the war.Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelenskyy was acting as a -dictator- since the country has not held elections in accordance with Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law.Russia’s deputy foreign minister on Saturday said preparations were underway for a Trump-Putin meeting, a further sign that the Russian leader’s isolation, at least for the Trump administration, was beginning to thaw.Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, however, Andrii Sybiha‎, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the overnight strikes against civilian and military targets -demonstrates that avoiding calling Russia an aggressor does not change the fact that it is one.--No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead,- Sybiha‎ said in a statement on social media.Putin praises soldiers fighting in Ukraine:Zelenskyy and other officials will participate in a forum in Kyiv on Sunday where they will discuss the state of the country a day before the war reaches its three-year mark. Zelenskyy will conclude the forum with a news conference.The forum comes at a sensitive moment for Kyiv as Trump’s administration pushes Ukraine’s leaders to agree to a deal that would allow the U.S. to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal Zelenskyy earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees.-We must do our utmost to bring a lasting and just peace to Ukraine,- Zelenskyy wrote on social media on Sunday. -This is possible with the unity of all partners — we need the strength of all of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all who want a reliable peace.-Meanwhile, Putin in a special televised message Sunday praised Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine for defending -their native land, the national interests and the future of Russia.-Putin’s speech marked Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day, which falls a day before the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. He used the holiday greeting to pledge greater social support for military personnel and new weapons and equipment for Russian forces.–APRead more: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-anniversary-putin-trump-c8f73a98d071055be52a1b22b0785ecc---Telegram: t.me/ourwarstoday ---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40713	2025-02-23T06:32:04-08:00
