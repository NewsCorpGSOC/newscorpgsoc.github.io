At least 102 Russian POWs were taken yesterday, August 14th, in the Kursk region of #Russia during #Ukraine’s offensive, according to Ukrainian channels. Reportedly those captured are members of the Russian 488th Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment and Kadyrov's -#Akhmat-. Some Ukrainian milbloggers claim this is the single largest capture of Russian POWs so far in the war. @ourwarstoday Ukrainian military sources say that the soldiers fled their command and surrendered to them.First photos and videos show the initial capture. The last two videos show the large underground base the soldiers were purportedly housed in. One section of the base is filled with corpses shown in the last video, said to be the bodies of Russian soldiers and FSB who wouldn't surrender.Ukrainian milbloggers continue to report advances of their forces in Kursk, other videos of Russian and Ukrainian POWs taken recently continue to emerge.
