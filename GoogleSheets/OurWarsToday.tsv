Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.-- Via Instagram.com/the.war.blog---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40788	2025-02-28T15:09:25-08:00

🖼 🇺🇸💰New U.S. Spending Bill Recap: -The #UnitedStates House o...	🇺🇸💰New U.S. Spending Bill Recap: -The #UnitedStates House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion-dollar spending bill backed by President Donald Trump, with a 217-215 vote. ⁠Via Ground News – instagram.com/groundnews ⁠The bill extends tax cuts from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which were set to expire, and introduces new reductions, including relief for the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, tax breaks for domestic manufacturing, and cuts on income from tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. ⁠⁠Without further offsets, the total cost of #Trump’s tax priorities is projected to fall between $5 trillion and $11 trillion over the next decade, with estimates suggesting it could push federal debt to as high as 149% of GDP by 2035. Approximately $4 trillion of that cost comes from the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.⁠ Trump argues that his tax cuts will not be this costly as they will stimulate economic growth and, as a result, increase government revenue. ⁠⁠The legislation proposes $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next ten years to fund tax reductions along with other aspects of Trump’s agenda, including increased military and immigration enforcement spending. ⁠⁠While the budget does not explicitly mention Medicaid, it directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in reductions, potentially affecting eligibility and benefits for the over 20% of #American citizens who rely on the program. Trump assured that -Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched,- but critics argue that such deep budget cuts will be difficult to achieve without impacting major social programs. ⁠⁠Democrats opposed the bill, calling it a tax break for the wealthy that could shift financial burdens onto lower-income Americans.⁠⁠With House approval secured, the bill now moves to the Senate, where it must be reconciled with a separate budget proposal. Negotiations between the Senate and House are ongoing, and the compromise bill between the two chambers will likely have major differences from this current House bill.⁠-–Ground News---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40770	2025-02-27T14:09:05-08:00

This is Russian, and this is Ukrainian.’ This will not happen. We have a Constitution based on the will of the people,- Lavrov said at a press conference, referring to Moscow’s illegal referendums in Ukraine.In late 2022, #Russia announced the annexation of Ukraine’s #Donetsk, #Luhansk, #Kherson and #Zaporizhzhia regions after holding what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine. #Kyiv and Western governments said the votes breached international law and ruled them as illegitimate and non-representative.At present, Russia controls almost the entirety of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and the majority of the Donetsk region.During his speech, Lavrov once again rejected notions of Western troop deployments to Ukraine as part of security guarantees and called for the so-called -root causes- of the invasion to be addressed.-There are also people who remain there who find it more convenient to speak Russian, who want to preserve the traditions of their ancestors, who were brought up in Russian culture. Therefore, such simple mechanical things as the deployment of [foreign] troops will not do – we need to talk about the root causes,- Lavrov added.Russia has been attempting to justify its Ukraine invasion by claiming to protect Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine, a claim that is largely unfounded.At Monday’s UN General Assembly, Russia attempted to request an amendment to a UN draft resolution by adding a clause to address the so-called -root cause- of the invasion that was ultimately rejected.-Via: https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47871 ---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40762	2025-02-26T13:36:46-08:00

In addition to this area, which can already be considered a permanent occupation, Israeli forces maintain an area of operations that is extending further and further into southern Syria.Following Netanyahu's statements on the status of the south of the country, today Israeli forces began operations to demilitarize the governorates of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda, where all military elements belonging to the transitional government and which had been inherited from the SAA will be destroyed.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40756	2025-02-25T21:06:28-08:00

Conflict Resolution:The #UnitedNations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning #Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the U.S. among 18 countries opposing it. The measure, titled -Advancing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in #Ukraine,- received 93 votes in favor and 65 abstentions, including from China. Ukraine’s European allies supported the resolution, which is non-binding but signals a shift in U.S. policy under the #Trump administration toward improving relations with Russia.⁠⁠Trump has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr #Zelenskiy for the war, calling him a -dictator without elections.- His administration’s diplomats have avoided directly criticizing Russian President Vladimir #Putin, widening a divide within the Republican Party. Meanwhile, the #UnitedStates introduced a competing resolution, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating it aligns with Trump’s view that the U.N. should focus on maintaining peace through diplomatic settlement rather than punitive resolutions.⁠⁠Ambassador Dorothy Shea, a Biden appointee, argued that past resolutions have failed to stop the war. She urged all member states, including Ukraine and Russia, to back the U.S. proposal, which she described as a -historic statement- focused on ending the conflict. The confirmation of Trump’s nominee for U.N. ambassador, Rep. Elise Stefanik, remains stalled in the Senate due to Democratic opposition to the administration’s policy shifts.⁠⁠Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, escalating a conflict that began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and support for separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. The invasion triggered widespread international sanctions against Moscow and military aid to Kyiv from Western nations. ⁠–Ground News - instagran.com/groundnews---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40730	2025-02-24T15:26:21-08:00

↩️🖼 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — #Russia launched more strike ...	Our Wars, Today: Russia launches a record number of drones into Ukraine on the eve of the war's 3-year anniversary Russia has launched a record number of drones into Ukraine on the eve of the three-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion. t.me/ourwarstoday – t.m… 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — #Russia launched more strike drones into #Ukraine overnight on Saturday than in any other single attack of the war, Ukrainian President #Zelenskiy said on Sunday, one day before the three-year anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion.Writing on social media, Zelenskyy said 267 strike drones had been sent in what he called -the largest attack since Iranian drones began hitting Ukrainian cities and villages.- Ukraine’s air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets.Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in a missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration.The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.Ukraine fears Trump’s policy shift toward Putin:#Trump’s engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy which had previously sought to isolate Russia and its president, Vladimir #Putin, over the war.Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelenskyy was acting as a -dictator- since the country has not held elections in accordance with Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law.Russia’s deputy foreign minister on Saturday said preparations were underway for a Trump-Putin meeting, a further sign that the Russian leader’s isolation, at least for the Trump administration, was beginning to thaw.Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, however, Andrii Sybiha‎, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the overnight strikes against civilian and military targets -demonstrates that avoiding calling Russia an aggressor does not change the fact that it is one.--No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead,- Sybiha‎ said in a statement on social media.Putin praises soldiers fighting in Ukraine:Zelenskyy and other officials will participate in a forum in Kyiv on Sunday where they will discuss the state of the country a day before the war reaches its three-year mark. Zelenskyy will conclude the forum with a news conference.The forum comes at a sensitive moment for Kyiv as Trump’s administration pushes Ukraine’s leaders to agree to a deal that would allow the U.S. to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal Zelenskyy earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees.-We must do our utmost to bring a lasting and just peace to Ukraine,- Zelenskyy wrote on social media on Sunday. -This is possible with the unity of all partners — we need the strength of all of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all who want a reliable peace.-Meanwhile, Putin in a special televised message Sunday praised Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine for defending -their native land, the national interests and the future of Russia.-Putin’s speech marked Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day, which falls a day before the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. He used the holiday greeting to pledge greater social support for military personnel and new weapons and equipment for Russian forces.–APRead more: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-anniversary-putin-trump-c8f73a98d071055be52a1b22b0785ecc---Telegram: t.me/ourwarstoday ---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40713	2025-02-23T06:32:04-08:00
