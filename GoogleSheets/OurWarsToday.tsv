The enemy is dragging artillery into our territoryThis, of course, was to be expected. In different sectors of the front, the enemy began to dig in. And to tighten heavy artillery because of the ribbon. Before that, he made do with mortars. But here on the frames of objective control is the ACS, which is reset by our ixologists.Along with the attempt to isolate the Glushkovsky district, all this looks like preparation for the transition to defensive actions. There is a feeling that the enemy did not expect that he would be able to advance so far. But at the same time, there is a concentration of forces in other areas.Now the Armed Forces of Ukraine is focusing on the removal of crossings, which our heroic pontoons, without exaggeration, lead with the tenacity of the doomed. Among journalists, filming the guidance of pontoons has always been something secondary. But today, this job is in the full sense of the word deadly. They are covered both on marches and in the area of crossing guidance. Contrary to Kh*khl's expectations, our garrison in the Glushkovsky district did not run to the northern shore of the Sejm and continues to hold positions, do not let the enemy advance to the west. This means that you can wait for the enemy to open a new direction. As I wrote earlier, this may be the southwestern corner of the Kursk region - Tetkino with an eye on Karyzh.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38074	2024-08-21T07:11:38-07:00

The air defense forces intercepted 45 enemy UAVs, while most of them were shot down over the territories of the Bryansk and Moscow regions. - 23 drones of Ukrainian formations were intercepted in the sky over the Bryansk region. The first targets were recorded in the airspace of the region around one o'clock in the morning, the work of the air defense of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued until seven in the morning, since the UAVs were involved in -waves-. Nevertheless, casualties and destruction in the region were avoided. - 11 more drones were shot down in the airspace of the Moscow region, in the Podolsk area south of Moscow. Similarly with the Bryansk region, the UAVs moved wave after wave and strayed as they approached the area of operation of the local air defense system. No damage or casualties have been detected in the region either.- In the Kaluga region, near the border with the Bryansk region, 3 drones were intercepted, in the Kursk region, air defense forces shot down two UAVs, as well as two missiles. Six more drones were intercepted in the Belgorod region. - In the area of Novoshakhtinsk in the Rostov region, air defense units, according to some information, shot down an ATACMS missile of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The munition fell on a vacant lot and caused a fire of dry grass, nearby buildings suffered damage to windows due to the blast wave. There were no casualties. To date, this is the first recorded case of the use of ATACMS by the enemy against objects in internationally recognized territories of Russia. It was probably just a test launch and in the near future the enemy will launch combined attacks using this type of missiles.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38073	2024-08-21T07:10:42-07:00

🎬 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 Iskander Strike Claims Second Ever HIMARS Destructio...	🇷🇺 🇺🇦 Iskander Strike Claims Second Ever HIMARS Destruction: theatlasnews.co #Russian state media last week released footage showing the destruction of a US-supplied, #Ukrainian-operated M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), allegedly by an Iskander strike near the Russian border in #Sumy Oblast. This strike, however, would only mark the second-ever visually confirmed HIMARS destruction since they began service in Ukraine over two years ago. @ourwarstoday When looking at the first HIMARS loss, which occurred back in March, there is much to compare. Footage released by Russian military sources, which was also taken by an overhead drone, tracks a HIMARS before it is eventually struck by an Iskander missile. In both instances, Russian drones were able to operate freely over Ukrainian-controlled territory and direct an Iskander missile strike on the launchers.To date, we have seen only four visually confirmed losses out of the 39 HIMARS supplied by the US. Two have been destroyed, as seen in the footage above. The other two were seen being unloaded at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania with battle damage, likely to be repaired.Read more analysis and details in the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/16/iskander-strike-claims-second-ever-himars-destruction/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38067	2024-08-19T08:35:33-07:00

Previously, he had said the operation aimed to protect communities in the bordering #Sumy region from constant shelling.Zelenskyy said -it is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much #Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions. This includes creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory -– our operation in the Kursk region,- he said in his nightly address.This weekend, Ukraine has destroyed a key bridge in the region and struck a second one nearby, disrupting supply lines as it pressed a stunning cross-border incursion that began Aug. 6, officials said. According to Russia’s Mash news site, the attacks left only one intact bridge in the area. Kyiv previously has said little about the goals of its push into Russia with tanks and other armored vehicles, the largest attack on the country since World War II, which took the Kremlin by surprise and saw scores of villages and hundreds of prisoners fall into Ukrainian hands.The Ukrainians drove deep into the region in several directions, facing little resistance and sowing chaos and panic as tens of thousands of civilians fled. Ukraine’s Commander in Chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed last week that his forces had advanced across 1,000 square kilometers (390 square miles) of the region, although it was not possible to independently verify what Ukrainian forces effectively control.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38066	2024-08-18T13:25:30-07:00

First-person footage of #Ukrainian commander repelling a #Russian attack, combined with drone footage. @ourwarstoday – subtitles by @wartranslatedFrom the Ukrainian 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after the Knights of the First Winter Campaign: -The other day, the enemy made an attempt to storm one of our positions. After artillery preparation, two enemy groups moved forward, but were spotted by UAV operators in time.The enemy was lucky to avoid the blows of our artillery and approach the position, but as soon as the first occupier came into the field of view of our infantry - he immediately became -200-. His -colleagues- decided not to tempt fate and immediately began to withdraw, trying to regroup, but drones and infantry nullified their plans.It is interesting that, unlike ordinary units, these characters were well equipped and prepared. The enemy expected to do everything quickly, but thanks to the coordinated actions of the infantry, artillery and UAV operators, the plan of the occupiers literally fell apart from the very beginning.Five occupiers were killed, several were wounded.- t.me/ombr_28/1227 Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38065	2024-08-18T10:15:40-07:00

A #Russian soldier headbutts a #Ukrainian explosive FPV drone after it hovers and then plunges towards him, and apparently he just walks away. @ourwarstoday I've noticed a number of videos more recently appearing of FPV drones hovering/watching a soldier before striking. Interesting trend. Commentary by Russian milblogger Sasha Kots who published the footage:-Phenomenal shots! There are still heroes in Rus'!The enemy's FPV drone mockingly slowly flies up to our fighter and hovers at human height before attacking.Our fighter takes a stance as if it were a boxing ring.The drone attacks and the soldier lunges forward and headbutts the drone.Explosion. The smoke clears, and our hero calmly goes into the forest. How can you not believe that God is on our side!- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38064	2024-08-18T09:57:42-07:00

The -Lyut 2.0- UGCV shown used by the 12th Azov Brigade, the Ukrainian ground drone reportedly has up -to 20 km range and the ability to work autonomously for 3 days.- @ourwarstoday Unmanned ground combat vehicle variants have increasingly shown up on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides of the frontline, from explosive RC cars all the way to autonomous turrets. Variants for carrying ammunition and supplies have appeared infrequently too.Via t.me/Tsaplienko/58870	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38054	2024-08-18T08:42:42-07:00
