The military has already been given machine guns and is going to be sent into battle.The day before, at least 500 people were taken out of the military village of Kamenka near St. Petersburg, where the 138th separate motorized rifle brigade is based and where several hundred men who refused to fight were held. Their relatives told ASTRA about this. At the same time, criminal cases had already been opened against some of the refuseniks about leaving the unit, they were under investigation, and another part was awaiting a military commission. Among those under arrest are men with health problems, physical and mental: -They took away a man with category -D-, plus a man under the age of 70 who can barely walk, another man without an eye...-. According to relatives, yesterday at about 6 pm they received a message from the men who were there that they were suddenly called to the formation, and then, without explaining anything, they were put into KAMAZ trucks and taken away under guard to a military airfield. The first -batch- — about 300 people — was sent to an unknown destination. The second part — about 150 people — turned out to be 7 km from Kursk in the morning at a military training ground. -They took them, grabbed them like a parcel, put them in jail and took them away,- their wives and mothers say. Wives are afraid that they -will be thrown on the first line like meat, because they don't register anything, they don't say anything, everything is quiet.- -In the morning, my son wrote that now they are dressing us, they will give us a machine gun and most likely into battle,- says one of the interlocutors, whose mobilized son is being monitored by a psychiatrist after participating in the war. -If, God forbid, he has an explosion in his head and he shoots someone, who will be to blame for this?-–ASTRA---In related news, it was reported that western and U.S. officials believe Russia is not rotating or transferring more experienced units from the main frontline in Ukraine to Kursk, instead bolstering the incursion by Ukraine with lesser experienced or completely unexperienced conscripted troops.Ukrainian forces contrastly have reported issues of ammunition supply in regions such as Donetsk since the incursion into Kursk began. Also, they report the uptick of advance and constant pushing of Russian forces in the Pokrovsk direction.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37953	2024-08-16T08:18:04-07:00

These groups are the product of decades of instability in the DRC’s resource-rich east and vary from criminal groups to rebels against the government, civil defense militias, and ethnic militias. @ourwarstoday From an outside perspective, the conflict in the eastern DRC is, understandably, very difficult to grasp.While still forming a part of the larger problem, a number of these groups are largely insignificant when it comes to examining which groups actually have an impact on the security situation. The number of armed groups can be narrowed down significantly to a much smaller list of groups which are significant players in the eastern DRC, and in determining its path forward.So, let’s take a look at some of those groups.Read the full article and explainer here: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/11/clarifying-the-convoluted-eastern-congo/theatlasnews.coClarifying the Convoluted Eastern Congo | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37950	2024-08-15T21:39:32-07:00
