Ukrainian SOF shown ambushing a military truck and taking Russian prisoners in Kursk early in the offensive after crossing behind the frontlines. @ourwarstoday It's unclear how many but a number of infiltrations, sabotages, and ambushes by Ukrainian special forces reportedly took place just before and at the beginning of the Kursk incursion. t.me/ukr_sof Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38068	2024-08-19T08:52:20-07:00
🎬 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 Iskander Strike Claims Second Ever HIMARS Destructio...	🇷🇺 🇺🇦 Iskander Strike Claims Second Ever HIMARS Destruction: theatlasnews.co #Russian state media last week released footage showing the destruction of a US-supplied, #Ukrainian-operated M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), allegedly by an Iskander strike near the Russian border in #Sumy Oblast. This strike, however, would only mark the second-ever visually confirmed HIMARS destruction since they began service in Ukraine over two years ago. @ourwarstoday When looking at the first HIMARS loss, which occurred back in March, there is much to compare. Footage released by Russian military sources, which was also taken by an overhead drone, tracks a HIMARS before it is eventually struck by an Iskander missile. In both instances, Russian drones were able to operate freely over Ukrainian-controlled territory and direct an Iskander missile strike on the launchers.To date, we have seen only four visually confirmed losses out of the 39 HIMARS supplied by the US. Two have been destroyed, as seen in the footage above. The other two were seen being unloaded at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania with battle damage, likely to be repaired.Read more analysis and details in the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/16/iskander-strike-claims-second-ever-himars-destruction/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38067	2024-08-19T08:35:33-07:00

Previously, he had said the operation aimed to protect communities in the bordering #Sumy region from constant shelling.Zelenskyy said -it is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much #Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions. This includes creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory -– our operation in the Kursk region,- he said in his nightly address.This weekend, Ukraine has destroyed a key bridge in the region and struck a second one nearby, disrupting supply lines as it pressed a stunning cross-border incursion that began Aug. 6, officials said. According to Russia’s Mash news site, the attacks left only one intact bridge in the area. Kyiv previously has said little about the goals of its push into Russia with tanks and other armored vehicles, the largest attack on the country since World War II, which took the Kremlin by surprise and saw scores of villages and hundreds of prisoners fall into Ukrainian hands.The Ukrainians drove deep into the region in several directions, facing little resistance and sowing chaos and panic as tens of thousands of civilians fled. Ukraine’s Commander in Chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed last week that his forces had advanced across 1,000 square kilometers (390 square miles) of the region, although it was not possible to independently verify what Ukrainian forces effectively control.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38066	2024-08-18T13:25:30-07:00

First-person footage of #Ukrainian commander repelling a #Russian attack, combined with drone footage. @ourwarstoday – subtitles by @wartranslatedFrom the Ukrainian 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after the Knights of the First Winter Campaign: -The other day, the enemy made an attempt to storm one of our positions. After artillery preparation, two enemy groups moved forward, but were spotted by UAV operators in time.The enemy was lucky to avoid the blows of our artillery and approach the position, but as soon as the first occupier came into the field of view of our infantry - he immediately became -200-. His -colleagues- decided not to tempt fate and immediately began to withdraw, trying to regroup, but drones and infantry nullified their plans.It is interesting that, unlike ordinary units, these characters were well equipped and prepared. The enemy expected to do everything quickly, but thanks to the coordinated actions of the infantry, artillery and UAV operators, the plan of the occupiers literally fell apart from the very beginning.Five occupiers were killed, several were wounded.- t.me/ombr_28/1227 Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38065	2024-08-18T10:15:40-07:00

A #Russian soldier headbutts a #Ukrainian explosive FPV drone after it hovers and then plunges towards him, and apparently he just walks away. @ourwarstoday I've noticed a number of videos more recently appearing of FPV drones hovering/watching a soldier before striking. Interesting trend. Commentary by Russian milblogger Sasha Kots who published the footage:-Phenomenal shots! There are still heroes in Rus'!The enemy's FPV drone mockingly slowly flies up to our fighter and hovers at human height before attacking.Our fighter takes a stance as if it were a boxing ring.The drone attacks and the soldier lunges forward and headbutts the drone.Explosion. The smoke clears, and our hero calmly goes into the forest. How can you not believe that God is on our side!- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38064	2024-08-18T09:57:42-07:00

The -Lyut 2.0- UGCV shown used by the 12th Azov Brigade, the Ukrainian ground drone reportedly has up -to 20 km range and the ability to work autonomously for 3 days.- @ourwarstoday Unmanned ground combat vehicle variants have increasingly shown up on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides of the frontline, from explosive RC cars all the way to autonomous turrets. Variants for carrying ammunition and supplies have appeared infrequently too.Via t.me/Tsaplienko/58870	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38054	2024-08-18T08:42:42-07:00

Our Wars, Today: A volcano has erupted in Russia 🇷🇺 🌋 The Shiveluch #volcano in #Russia has erupted, sending ash 8 kilometers into the sky and lava rolling down its side after a 7.0 magnitude #earthquake the Kamchatkatka region on Russia's east coast struck earlier. The volcano sits around 450 kilometers from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, minor damage to buildings closer to the volcano is reported. @ourwarstoday&nbsp;No casualties according to TASS, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake's epicenter was 55 miles from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and the depth of it was around 30 miles. Although Russia did not issue a #tsunami warning, the U.S. has, along the epicenter.Volcanic ash and minor lava eruptions are common at various times throughout the year; it's name means -smoking mountain- as it and the volcano Karymsky, also on the Kamchatka Peninsula, are some of the most active and continuously erupting volcanoes on the planet.Photos: Astra	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38050	2024-08-17T17:09:44-07:00
