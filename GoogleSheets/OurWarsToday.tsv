The hurricane, expected to hit late Wednesday, is predicted to bring winds up to 129 mph and cause storm surges of 10-15 feet along #Florida’s west coast.⁠ Via instagram.com/GroundNews. ⁠Mandatory evacuations have been ordered as residents brace for the first major hurricane to directly strike the Tampa area in over a century. The storm, which briefly intensified to a Category 5 before being downgraded to Category 4, remains dangerous. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced the suspension of tolls to assist with evacuations as traffic builds on major highways.⁠⁠Hurricane Milton comes just days after Hurricane Helene hit Florida as a Category 4 storm, adding to the region’s challenges. Authorities are urging residents to leave evacuation zones immediately, warning of severe flooding and wind damage.---@ourwarstoday ---AP: Hurricane Milton remained on course Tuesday evening for Florida’s west coast, traveling northeast across the Gulf of Mexico at about 10 mph (17 kph), according to the #UnitedStates National Hurricane Center’s latest advisory.As of 8 p.m. EDT, the storm was 440 miles (710 kilometers) southwest of Tampa. Its maximum sustained windspeeds were 165 mph (270 kph), making it a Category 5 hurricane still.-Fluctuations in intensity are likely while Milton moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida Wednesday night,- the hurricane center said.Storm surge and hurricane warnings on Florida’s west and east coasts remained in effect.Evacuations: Eleven Florida counties, home to about 5.9 million people, were under mandatory evacuation orders as of Tuesday afternoon. Officials are warning residents not to bank on the storm weakening.Landfall: Milton is expected to make landfall on the west coast of Florida late Wednesday as a Category 3 storm, which have winds of 111-129 mph (180-210 kph).Path: The storm is forecast to cross central Florida and to dump as much as 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain while heading toward the Atlantic Ocean. That track would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Carolinas.https://apnews.com/live/hurricane-milton-florida-tracker-updates---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/39182	2024-10-08T17:39:31-07:00

Possible wind speeds of sustained 180+ mph for late Monday, early Tuesday. @ourwarstoday The center of the storm could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region, which has not endured a head-on hit by a major hurricane in more than a century. As of 11 p.m. Monday, Hurricane Milton had 165 mph maximum sustained winds, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It's about 35 miles from Progreso, Mexico, and about 630 miles from Tampa, Florida. It continued moving along at 9 mph. The minimum central pressure was 914 MB.-Milton is a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale,- the NHC said. -While fluctuations in intensity are expected, Milton is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane through landfall in Florida.-Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles.It's expected to bring life-threatening storm surge, flooding, and damaging winds to the Gulf coast, as well as heavy rain, damaging winds, and the potential for tornadoes as it crosses the state this week, the NHC said.Ahead of Milton, Florida will see increasing periods of rainfall and increasing winds as tropical storm-force winds and the hurricane's outer bands begin to spread across the state.Those impacts will get worse as Milton gets closer to the coast.Storm surges, flooding, and damaging winds are the main threats for those on the Gulf Coast. Those inland, such as Orlando and nearby counties, will see periods of heavy rainfall, localized flooding, damaging winds, flooding, and the potential for tornadoes.Exactly where Milton ultimately makes landfall may change how much rain areas get.As evacuation orders were issued, forecasters warned of a possible 8- to 12-foot storm surge (2.4 to 3.6 meters) in Tampa Bay and widespread flooding from 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in mainland Florida and the Keys, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) in places. The Tampa metro area has a population of more than 3.2 million people.Much of Florida’s west coast was under hurricane and storm surge watches. Florida’s Lake Okeechobee, which often floods during intense storms, was also under a hurricane watch. A hurricane warning was issued for parts of Mexico’s Yucatan state, which expected to get sideswiped.---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/39174	2024-10-07T21:39:11-07:00

According to the Wall Street Journal, Bout is involved in brokering a $10 million deal to sell small arms to Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants. The sale, however, has not yet been completed and does not involve more advanced weaponry like missiles, which could pose a greater threat to U.S. military efforts in the region.⁠ @ourwarstoday ⁠The report, which cites unnamed European security sources, states that Bout met with Houthi emissaries in Moscow in August to negotiate the deal. Bout’s U.S. attorney declined to comment on whether the meeting took place, while Houthi representatives also remained silent. Bout, who was convicted in the U.S. in 2012 for arms trafficking and sentenced to 25 years, has kept a low profile since returning to Russia, where he joined the Kremlin-loyal Liberal Democratic Party.⁠⁠Bout’s history as an international arms dealer spans decades, with clients ranging from rogue states to rebel groups across Africa, Asia, and South America. His story even inspired the 2005 Hollywood film Lord of War, with Nicolas Cage playing a character based on Bout’s life. The Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry have yet to comment on the recent allegations.⁠ Via Ground News.---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/39168	2024-10-07T10:42:48-07:00

AJ: -When they entered Gaza on October 27, after three weeks of aerial bombardment following Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, Israeli troops took their iPhones with them. Via instagram.com/aj_i_unit – @ourwarstoday In the year since, Israeli soldiers have posted thousands of videos and photos on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.These videos and photos form the foundation of the AJ I-Unit’s new film, which investigates Israeli war crimes primarily through the medium of the evidence Israeli soldiers themselves have provided.As journalists in the West sought to portray the war on Gaza as complex and nuanced, a flood of social media posts from Israeli soldiers suggested they regarded it as anything but. The I-Unit decided to investigate these posts.The I-Unit began collecting these videos and photos, compiling a database of more than 2,500 social media accounts.The behavior displayed in the photos and videos ranges from crass jokes and soldiers rifling through women’s underwear drawers to what appears to be the murder of unarmed civilians.The videos frequently show soldiers smashing up and destroying property and possessions. Others show houses being set alight. The most commonly recurring feature was the detonation of buildings.It will be for prosecutors to decide the guilt or otherwise of the soldiers.Most of the photos and videos fell into one of three categories: wanton destruction, the mistreatment of detainees and the use of human shields. All three may be violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.The unit expected to have to dedicate considerable resources to geolocation and to the use of facial recognition software to scan the internet to identify the soldiers featured in the photos and videos. What it found, however, was that, for the most part, soldiers posted material in their own names on publicly accessible platforms and often gave details of when and where the incidents depicted took place.-–AJFull hour and a half documentary: https://www.ajiunit.com/investigation/gaza/---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/39143	2024-10-06T07:32:29-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Photo -The S-70 made its maiden flight on Aug. 3, 2019 and was reportedly developed by Sukhoi in approximately three years. Actually, according to some sources its development began much earlier, around 2011, when the Russian Ministry of Defense first allocated funds for the Sukhoi UCAV program. Additionally, the S-70’s design is rooted in the 2005 prototype from Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG), called the -Skat,- which was publicly displayed as a mock-up at the 2007 MAKS international air show. Via The Aviationist. @ourwarstoday The Okhotnik is Russia’s first drone fully built with low-observability features and special composite materials. This development was a partial response to Russia’s longstanding lag in the advanced aviation sector, which has left the country trailing behind the U.S. and China in the development of fifth-generation aircraft and UAV technology.The S-70 incorporates a specialized composite material developed specifically for this project, likely similar to the materials used in the Sukhoi Su-57 -Felon.- Despite this, the Okhotnik is quite heavy for its class, weighing close to 20 tons—nearly twice the weight of a MiG-29 or an F-16, and four times heavier than comparable drones like the X-47B. Its wingspan is approximately 20 meters, and it has a length of about 14 meters.In December 2020, RIA Novosti said Okhotnik had conducted simulated tests with infrared (IR) and radar-seeker air-to-air missiles to test the UCAV’s fire-control systems at the 185th Combat Application and Training Center at Ashuluk.The UCAV conducted its first live-fire test by releasing unguided bombs on a target at the Ashuluk training ground near the Caspian Sea, according to a report in January 2021. On May 28, 2022, RIA Novosti again reported a -series of guided missile firing- tests, which Janes concluded was the Kh-59MK2 standoff cruise missile.In 2021, reports emerged that the Russian Ministry of Defense planned to integrate the Okhotnik with Su-57 squadrons, with each squadron potentially having one UCAV unit. This integration aimed to establish a manned-unmanned teaming (MUM/T) system, enabling Su-57 pilots to coordinate missions with the UCAV. This move further supports the idea that the S-70 would act as a -Loyal Wingman- to the Su-57 Felon, enhancing combat capabilities through manned-unmanned collaboration.- Via https://theaviationist.com/2024/10/05/s-70-ucav-shot-down-over-ukraine/---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/39142	2024-10-05T10:07:18-07:00

Among the 250 Hezbollah fighters killed since Monday are at least 21 field commanders, according to the IDF, including five brigade-level commanders, ten company commanders, and six platoon commanders. Via https://t.me/manniefabianThe IDF's 98th and 36th divisions are currently operating in several Lebanese villages close to the Israeli border, where the military says troops have located a large amount of weapons and infrastructure that Hezbollah left behind. More than half a million Lebanese civilians have fled southern Lebanon, following IDF evacuation warnings, according to military assessments.Troops have mostly come under anti-tank missile fire and mortar attacks amid the operations, though there have also been several close-quarters engagements.In one incident yesterday, IDF paratroopers killed some 15 Hezbollah operatives who were spotted in buildings and tunnel shafts in a village in southern Lebanon. Only one soldier was wounded in the engagement.The ground operations come simultaneously as Israel continues to carry out strikes on the terror group’s top commanders in the capital Beirut, capabilities across the country, and weapon shipments from Iran. In southern Lebanon, amid the ground operations, more than 2,000 Hezbollah sites have been struck from the air, the IDF adds.----@ourwarstoday----Lebanese channels say Israeli forces as part of their ground invasion have made small advances a few dozen or hundred meters at certain areas, but not further.

The population of the city since 2022 has steadily declined from death and fleeing citizens, from over 15,000 to estimated under 100 and likely even less. Every single building has been greatly damaged or entirely destroyed in the city. Largely damage on the city in such extreme form was inflicted during #Russia's renewed attacks throughout 2023, several of which the ground ones saw large losses of Russian vehicles in mechanized and armored convoy assaults.Over 200 million tonnes of coal sit beneath the city, and many of the former inhabitants of the city were coal workers or worked in associated factories. Reportedly, a number of citizens from the town also volunteered to fight in the Donbas war during the Russian invasion of 2014.---Via instagram/tessaron_news_3: -#Vuhledar has fallen. Russian war bloggers as well as Ukrainian war bloggers and Ukrainian politicians have confirmed that as of 1200 EST October 1st, Russian Federation infantry have raised the tri-color above the central administration buildings in Vuhledar, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. This page reported yesterday that Ukrainian infantry described their situation as -hell.-A series of military engagements have taken place in and around the town of Vuhledar in western Donetsk Oblast over the course of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian commanders have described the clashes as -the largest tank battle- of the Russo-Ukrainian War to date.In late August 2024, Russia restarted offensive operations towards Vuhledar, with bombardments of the city increasing significantly while large armored assaults were launched in the city’s direction. The defending 72nd Mechanized Brigade said that these attacks -were among the most intense and firepower-heavy in more than a year-.On 1 October, the head of the Donetsk Oblast Military Administration, Vadym Filashkin, reported that Russian troops were fighting in the city center.---The Ukrainian Khortytsia operational-strategic group has issued the following statement on the fall of Vuhledar: -Having suffered numerous losses as a result of prolonged battles, the enemy did not stop trying to capture Vuhledar.In an effort to take control of the city at any cost, he managed to direct the reserves to carry out flanking attacks, which exhausted the defense of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As a result of the enemy’s actions, the encirclement of the city was threatened.The higher command has given permission to carry out a maneuver to withdraw units from Ugledar in order to preserve personnel and combat equipment, to take a position for further actions.-The Khortytsia operational-strategic group is a formation of the Ukrainian Ground Forces active in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, led by Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, who also serves as the Commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 19, 2023, Colonel General Syrskyi was part of a staff meeting alongside numerous commanders and important government leaders alongside President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

🖼 🇺🇸 ⚓️ U.S Dockworkers Have Upper Hand in Strike: @ourwarstod...	🇺🇸 ⚓️ U.S Dockworkers Have Upper Hand in Strike: @ourwarstoday PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The 45,000 dockworkers who went on strike Tuesday for the first time in decades at 36 #UnitedStates ports from Maine to Texas may wield the upper hand in their standoff with port operators over wages and the use of automation.Organized labor enjoys rising public support and has had a string of recent victories in other industries, in addition to the backing of the pro-union administration of President Joe Biden. The dockworkers’ negotiating stand is likely further strengthened by the nation’s supply chain of goods being under pressure in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has coincided with the peak shipping season for holiday goods.The union is also pointing to shipping companies’ record profits, which have come in part because of shortages resulting from the pandemic, and to a more generous contract that West Coast dockworkers achieved last year. The longshoremen’s workloads also have increased, and the effects of inflation have eroded their pay in recent years.In addition, commerce into and out of the United States has been growing, playing to the union’s advantage. Further enhancing its leverage is a still-tight job market, with workers in some industries demanding, and in some cases receiving, a larger share of companies’ outsize profits.-I think this work group has a lot of bargaining power,- said Harry Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University. -They’re essential workers that can’t be replaced, and also the ports are doing well.-The dockworkers’ strike, their first since 1977, could snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. Beginning after midnight, the workers walked picket lines Tuesday and carried signs calling for more money and a ban on automation that could cost workers their jobs.Experts say consumers won’t likely notice shortages for at least a few weeks, if the strike lasts that long, though some perishable items such as bananas could disappear from grocery stores — although at this time of year, most other fruits and vegetables are domestically grown and not processed at ports, according to Alan Siger, president of the Produce Distributors Association.In anticipation of a strike, most major retailers also stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.The strike, coming weeks before a tight presidential election, could also become a factor in the race if shortages begin to affect many voters. Pressure could eventually grow for the Biden administration to intervene to try to force a temporary suspension of the strike.Little progress was reported in the talks until just hours before the strike began at 12:01 a.m. The U.S. Maritime Alliance, the group negotiating for the ports, said both sides did budge from their initial positions. The alliance offered 50% raises over the six-year life of the contract. Comments from the union’s leadership had briefly suggested a move to 61.5%, but the union has since signaled that it’s sticking with its initial demand for a 77% pay increase over six years.-We have demonstrated a commitment to doing our part to end the completely avoidable ILA strike,- the alliance said Tuesday. The ports’ pay offer is more than every other recent union settlement, the group said.-We look forward to hearing from the Union about how we can return to the table and actually bargain, which is the only way to reach a resolution,- the statement said.In early picketing, workers outside the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle and chanted, -No work without a fair contract.- The union posted message boards on the side of a truck reading: -Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.- 1/2---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/39059	2024-10-01T21:09:26-07:00

Most residents on the first floor left before their units were submerged, while other relocated to stay with residents on higher floors.-We all really need help here. We need water, power of sorts, food, gas. Anything.- he said, -We just don’t really know what to do.-Hollander and his family attempted to drive north Saturday, but road closures forced them to return to the apartment. The family only has four water bottles left and little nonperishable food, Hollander said.In Black Mountain, North Carolina, Sofia Grace Kunst contended with another problem: a landslide she said tore through the window and wall of a dining hall where she was playing Uno with six friends while on a weeklong trip.It was exactly 9:10 a.m. Friday when mud and debris shattered a window and poured into the room, she said.Landslide! Everybody run,- someone yelled.-I see this giant wave of like mud and trees and rocks just coming towards us,- Kunst told CNN, estimating it was 5 or 6 feet high.She ran into the main room of the dining hall, only to see the wall completely cave in. The group fled to the porch, where many of her peers were crying. Kunst sat in shock, barefoot.It was only then she realized she still had her Uno cards in hand.The group eventually trekked through muddy water, seeking refuge in a parking lot on higher ground. They were stranded there for some time, but eventually reached a shelter.-That’s when it hit most people. There were a lot of tears,- Kunst said. -For me, it really didn’t hit me emotionally, but my body started reacting. I started shaking like crazy. I felt like I had to, like, scream or let off energy,- Kunst said.As day broke Saturday, Patrick McNamara, who runs a small milk distribution business in Asheville, got his first glimpse at the destruction left by Helene.-The floodwaters were 4 feet above the dock,- McNamara said. -So the entire building has been wiped out.-His business machinery was strewn across the warehouse, milk spoiled and inches of mud pilled all over the floor. McNamara estimates he’ll have to get rid of thousands of gallons of milk.McNamara, concerned about access to resources, said he may have to consider relocating the business to another facility.As he begins a lengthy cleanup process, McNamara said he is confident the community will be able to patch itself together and have a successful tourist season despite the devastation. @ourwarstodayPhotos: AP	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38974	2024-09-29T15:13:28-07:00

Piles of thick mud and floating debris blocked streets as torrential rains collapsed roadways and washed out bridges. It’s left hundreds of people in North Carolina stranded in homes, hospitals or transportation systems, awaiting rescue.-The priority is getting people out,- North Carolina Gov.

In hard-hit North Carolina, days of unrelenting flooding have turned roads into waterways, left many without basic necessities and strained state resources reports CNN. More than 60 dead across 5 states: Deaths have been reported in #SouthCarolina, #Georgia, Florida, #NorthCarolina and #Virginia. At least 11 people are dead in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said Sunday. At least 23 are dead in South Carolina, including two firefighters in Saluda County, authorities said. In Georgia, at least 17 people have died, two of them killed by a tornado in Alamo, according to a spokesperson for Gov. Brian Kemp. In Florida, at least 11 people have died, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday, including several people who drowned in Pinellas County. One person died in Craig County, Virginia, in a storm-related tree fall and building collapse, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Friday.Scores of missing persons reports filed amid water outages: Officials in Buncombe County, North Carolina, have received more than a thousand missing persons reports through an online form, County Manager Avril Pinder said Sunday, cautioning that figure likely includes duplicate submissions and that communications outages mean people are struggling to reach one another. But authorities remain unable to perform wellness checks. -We’re still trying to save every single person we can,- said Pinder, who a day earlier referred to Helene as the county’s -own Hurricane Katrina.- In the meantime, the city of Weaverville has no water and no power, according to Mayor Patrick Fitzsimmons, after a water plant was inundated by 8 feet of water. The county, which includes Asheville, has been anticipating -several tractor trailer loads off water,- but those deliveries were delayed, Pinder said. FEMA has sent bottled water to North Carolina, Administrator Deanne Criswell told CBS News on Sunday.Hundreds of roads closed in the Carolinas: About 300 roads are closed in North Carolina and another 150 are closed in South Carolina, acting Federal Highway Administrator Kristin White of the US Department of Transportation said Sunday. Access to clean drinking water is another problem: Seven water plants across North Carolina – in Avery, Burke, Haywood, Jackson, Rutherford, Watauga and Yancey counties – are closed, impacting nearly 70,000 households, Gov. Cooper’s office said Saturday. Seventeen water plants reported having no power. There are 50 boil water advisories in effect across western communities.Millions without power in Southeast: The remnants of Helene continued to knock out power for several states across the eastern US on Saturday, with about 2.5 million customers left in the dark in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us. On Sunday, a US Department of Energy spokesperson said there was no estimated timeframe for the restoration of power, saying widespread flooding and debris has impeded access to damaged infrastructure. @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38972	2024-09-29T15:12:34-07:00

Supreme Leader of #Iran Khamenei reportedly -moved to safety- according to regional officials. @ourwarstoday Tribune India: Iran announced on Saturday that a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sanctioned by the #UnitedStates also died in the Israeli airstrike that killed #Hezbollah leader Hassan #Nasrallah in Beirut.Ali Khamenei Abbas Nilforushan, 58, was killed on Friday in #Lebanon, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The U.S. Treasury had identified Nilforushan as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard. It had sanctioned him in 2022 and said he had led an organisation -directly in charge of protest suppression, which has played a critical role in arresting protest leaders during previous protests-.Those sanctions came amid months-long protests over the death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police.Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar #Assad in his country’s decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring that swept the wider Middle East. He served in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s like many of his colleagues.Meanwhile, Iran Air cancelled all flights to Beirut until further notice, the airline’s spokesman told local media, including the Tasnim news agency, on Saturday.In 2020, Iranian state television called him -comrade- of Gen Qassem #Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in 2020 US drone attack in Baghdad. In 2021, Nilforushan told state TV that #Israel was not in a capacity to pose a threat against Iran over what he described as Israel’s weakness. Meanwhile, two regional officials briefed by Tehran said Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali #Khamenei had been transferred to a secure location inside the country, with heightened security measures in place. The sources said Iran was in constant contact with Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other regional proxy groups to determine the next step after Nasrallah’s killing.Via: https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/top-iran-commander-among-casualties-in-beirut-strike-khamenei-moved-to-safety/---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38969	2024-09-28T22:59:04-07:00

If a ground operation happens, its scope will likely be limited, sources said. The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home. To do that, decapitating Hezbollah is not enough, the officials said.U.S. officials received a -few minutes notice- at best, before Hassan Nasrallah's assassination on Friday, the officials said.In response to reports that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin blew up when Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed him about Nasrallah, the officials said, -We do bear a lot of risks- in the region, and their people were not given a lot of notice to prepare for possible hostile responses to the assassination, which did not please U.S. officials.One of the officials noted that there is tolerance right now and that U.S. -interests in the region could be badly harmed- if U.S. officials lose their contacts with the Israelis.The sources said Nasrallah, until the very end, had demanded a Hezbollah ceasefire be tied to a #Gaza cease-fire.Diplomacy remains the only viable long-term solution, even if a military campaign sets the stage for it, officials said.

Karaki had survived another Israeli assassination attempt days earlier.Israeli officials and Iranian media reports also said Iranian Brigadier Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guard commander in Lebanon, was killed. Tehran has not confirmed that.In an operation codenamed -New Order,- the IDF dropped dozens of 2000-lb. bunker-buster bombs on Hezbollah central headquarters, which it said was located in an underground bunker below a compound of six residential buildings in southern Beirut.Lebanon's health ministry said at least six people were killed and 91 wounded in the massive strike, which leveled multiple large apartment buildings. That toll is likely to increase.More than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon as 11 days of intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated into war.The White House had been pushing for an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire prior to the Israeli strike, and President Biden and other top officials denied an Israeli claim that they were notified prior to the attack. IDF Chief of Staff Gen. Herzi Halevi said Nasrallah's killing -is not the end of our toolbox. The message is simple: anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel — we will know how to reach them.-Nasrallah was appointed Hezbollah leader in 1992 at just 32, and over three decades turned his militia into a formidable military and political force. Nasrallah became a kingmaker in Lebanon with effective veto power over senior political appointments.Hezbollah also extended its regional influence, sending thousands of fighters to Syria to help save President Bashar al-Assad's regime, to Iraq to fight with Shia militias, and to Yemen to fight alongside the Houthis and against Saudi Arabia.Under Nasrallah, Iran armed Hezbollah with sophisticated weapons including rockets, missiles and drones, making the militia a larger and better equipped military than many controlled by nation states. Nasrallah's close ties to Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, make it likely that Iran will seek to retaliate, particularly if an Iranian general is confirmed to have been killed alongside him.One potential successor for Nasrallah is Hashim Safi al-Din, who heads Hezbollah's executive council. It's unclear if he was in the bunker during the Israeli attack. –Axios---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38954	2024-09-28T06:32:27-07:00
🎬 🇮🇱 ⚠️ 🇱🇧 #Israeli bombardment of #Beirut suburbs and south...	🇮🇱 ⚠️ 🇱🇧 #Israeli bombardment of #Beirut suburbs and southern #Lebanon has been ongoing for seven hours, with several recent hours of non-stop strikes. #IDF says they are targeting #Hezbollah weapon storage and launch sites, lots of building destruction, and structural damage reported.Developing as strikes are still ongoing as of posting, several targeted areas. @ourwarstoday ---AP: The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings. The biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war. At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon’s health ministry said.Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes on the group’s headquarters, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity, including one U.S. official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams are still combing through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon’s national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Beirut.Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000 pound American-made -Bunker Buster- guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign since Monday has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children at least over a hundred total, and wounded over 1,835, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was -in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.- The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman suffered mild shrapnel wounds.The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes around the south of Lebanon Friday, targeting targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias.In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women – 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan – from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.Full article: https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-suburb-617575d9c5d7c711bc02e7b81d2ba4ad---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38946	2024-09-27T18:29:56-07:00

It was the heaviest attack in Beirut in almost a year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.The strikes hit Beirut shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin #Netanyahu vowed to continue Israel's attacks on Iranian-backed fighters in Lebanon in a closely watched United Nations speech, as hopes faded for a ceasefire that could head off an all-out regional war.A year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated sharply this week, raising fears of an even more destructive conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday Videos and additional info via: t.me/LebUpdate and t.me/manniefabian	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38931	2024-09-27T09:05:22-07:00

Our Wars, Today: More deadly than wind, storm surge from Hurricane Helene could be devastating Storm surge is a bigger killer than wind when a major hurricane hits shore. The areas in the path of Hurricane Helene are more susceptible to surge than other parts of Florida's… 🇺🇸 🌀 Helene will make landfall on Thursday evening along #Florida’s Big Bend coast and is expected to be the worst storm to ever hit the region. Currently a Category 4 hurricane with 130-mile-per-hour winds, the storm had already brought heavy rainfall and flooding to parts of the #UnitedStates state as of Thursday morning reported the New York Times. @ourwarstoday Many residents of the region, even hardened veterans of Florida hurricanes, have chosen to evacuate, leaving some areas deserted.In his 58 years, John Posey, a lifelong resident of the Forgotten Coast of Florida on the remote eastern edge of the Panhandle, had never evacuated for a hurricane — neither for Dennis in 2005, nor for Michael in 2018.But on Wednesday, as he stood outside his namesake seafood restaurant in Panacea, Fla., a community of about 800 near the marshy shores of Ochlockonee Bay, Mr. Posey admitted that this hurricane felt different. Helene was closing in and, for the first time, he wasn’t sure he could stay.Across Florida’s Big Bend region, which has already endured two other hurricanes in 13 months, many more people appeared to be heeding evacuation orders this time, leaving the small towns that dot the coast eerily empty on Thursday.That was especially true in three rural counties that had taken the rare step of ordering mandatory countywide evacuations. Homes and businesses in Wakulla County, where Panacea is, were boarded up. In Crawfordville, even the local Waffle House was covered with plywood.The Florida National Guard arrived on Thursday morning in Cedar Key, a tiny city that sits on a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico, to alert the remaining residents about the approaching danger.-In the last storm here, people would walk by us with beer and we’d say, ‘There’s a hurricane here,’- Capt. John Meacham said. -They’d say, ‘We’ll stick it out.’-He noticed fewer such people on Thursday.John MacDonald, the director of emergency management for Levy County, which includes Cedar Key, said he had hoped to see more residents in emergency shelters. -But I know some people seek shelter with family or somewhere else,- he added.Capt. Jeff Yarbrough, a spokesman for the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office, said deputies had been thorough in going door to door beginning on Wednesday to urge people to get out, especially if they live south of U.S. 98, which runs parallel to the Gulf Coast.-The conditions for our county are pretty severe, more so than we’ve had in recent memory,- he said. Perhaps 200 people whom deputies had contacted in the county of about 35,000 said they planned to stay, he estimated early on Thursday afternoon.To the southeast in Steinhatchee, a fishing town of a few hundred people, Tyler Rayborn, 31, bluntly summarized the feel of the place as he worked with a friend to anchor down the sign for his family’s hardware store: -It’s dead.

He said he would stay at his home, a short drive inland, before heading back to reopen as soon as possible so people could get supplies.Many who own homes in the small community are relatively new to the state, he said, and spooked by the threat of the storm.-Us, born and raised, we just stay here,- said Mr. Rayborn, who had a University of Florida alligator tattoo and an elaborate artistic sketch of the state visible on his left arm. -There’s nowhere for us to go.-A little bit further north, near Keaton Beach, Donna and Greg Staab sat on their porch on Thursday morning enjoying a cool breeze. They planned to head for a neighbor’s homemade bunker in the afternoon.-We’re just hoping for the best, that’s all you can do at this point,- Ms. Staab said. -Just stay and pray.-Further south, near Tampa Bay, which is far from Hurricane Helene’s winds but was already experiencing storm surge on Thursday, some residents accustomed to street flooding said they would stay. –NYT---RSS feed: t.me/ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38911	2024-09-26T17:36:55-07:00

🖼 🇺🇸 ⚠️ 🌀 #Hurricane Helene has strengthened into a Category ...	🇺🇸 ⚠️ 🌀 #Hurricane Helene has strengthened into a Category 2 storm with -significant additional strengthening expected- before it arrives along #Florida's Gulf Coast late Thursday night, the #UnitedStates National Hurricane Center said. @ourwarstoday The NHC said in its 8 a.m. ET advisory Thursday that -preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion- in Florida Thursday in anticipation of the storm's arrival reports USA Today.As of Thursday morning, Helene was located about 320 miles southwest of #Tampa, Florida and was moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph, according to the hurricane center. This motion is expected to continue with a -significant increase in forward speed- during the next 24 hours.Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph with higher gusts, the NHC said, and with additional strengthening forecast, Helene is expected to be a major hurricane upon its arrival in Florida's Big Bend coast.Helene is forecast to move across the eastern #GulfofMexico Thursday and across the Florida Big Bend coast Thursday evening or early Friday morning, according to the NHC. Around 8-12 inches of rain are expected where Helene makes landfall with some isolated areas possibly facing 2 feet of rain, according to AccuWeather.After landfall, the storm is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the #Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.-Weakening is expected after landfall, but Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians,- the center said in the advisory Thursday morning. Helene's path includes urban areas like #Tallahassee, Florida, and #Atlanta, #Georgia, as well as Asheville, #NorthCarolina, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.---BBC reported that: -The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the hurricane was expected to strengthen rapidly, threatening to unleash catastrophic winds and storm surge to the north-eastern Gulf Coast.Hurricanes need sea surface temperatures of more than 27C (80F) to fuel them. With exceptionally warm waters of the Gulf at 30-32C (86-89F), the sea surface is about two degrees Celsius above normal for the time of year.This will supercharge Helene's development and bring about what meteorologists call -rapid intensification-.The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee said surges caused by the storm could reach a height of up to 6m (20ft) in Apalachee Bay in Florida. It described these potential surges as -catastrophic and unsurvivable- for anyone caught in them. Storm surges can also be life-threatening further inland, when floodwaters move inland from the coastline.At a news conference, the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, also warned residents to be prepared.-We have no more time left to wait,- Mayor John Dailey said. -We urge you to stay weather aware as we’re on the verge of what could be… a historic event.-----Winds of over 300 miles per hour, and an estimated massive storm surge of 15-20 feet, make this Hurricanes' potentiality for death and destruction great.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38903	2024-09-26T06:42:01-07:00

The contents of that package are still in flux, the officials said.Reuters&nbsp;reported this month&nbsp;that the Biden administration was considering a backup plan under which it would announce plans for shipments for Ukraine, but with an extended delivery timeline for the weapons and equipment, allowing for a more gradual transfer of resources to Ukraine without missing the Sept. 30 deadline.A second announcement slated for Thursday will be for $2.4 billion worth of aid under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative program, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from U.S. stocks.That aid will include munitions, weapons to combat drones and material to support munitions production in Ukraine, one of the U.S. officials said.In addition, the U.S. announced on Wednesday $375 million worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine. The package will include the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb with a range of up to 81 miles (130 km) called the Joint Standoff Weapon, two U.S. officials said. The inclusion of that weapon was not disclosed in the announcement.The package, which&nbsp;Reuters first reported&nbsp;on last week, includes patrol boats, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, spare parts and other weapons.The Joint Standoff Weapon would be dropped from fighter jets, and is capable of striking targets with high accuracy. Ukraine has been largely prohibited from using U.S.-supplied weapons in strikes into Russia.Presidential Drawdown Authority allows the president to draw from current weapons stocks to help allies in an emergency. In August, as Ukraine was pressing an incursion into Russia and losing territory in its east to Russian advances, Washington announced two packages, both for $125 million each.Congress has approved nearly $175 billion of aid and military assistance for Ukraine and allied nations in the 2-1/2 years since Russia's full-scale invasion, and many lawmakers say they expect Washington will need to approve more money to help the government in #Kyiv in the next several months.U.S. companies that might benefit from increased weapons shipments to Ukraine include arms makers like RTX&nbsp;(RTX.N), Lockheed Martin&nbsp;(LMT.N), General Dynamics&nbsp;(GD.N), and Northrop Grumman&nbsp;(NOC.N).Via: https://www.reuters.com/world/us-prepares-8-billion-arms-aid-packages-zelenskiy-visit-sources-say-2024-09-25/---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38897	2024-09-25T23:46:56-07:00

Via instagram.com/atlas.news3 – @ourwarstoday Karaki is one of the last surviving leaders of Hezbollah’s Military High Command and is believed to have recently replaced military operational commander Ibrahim Aqil following his death last Friday.Karaki’s status remains unknown at this time, however, his death would mark a near complete elimination by the #IDF of senior military leadership under Hassan #Nasrallah.----The Israeli cabinet of ministers has also just now reportedly voted to declare a -special situation on the homefront- across the entirety of Israel, this was confirmed by Israeli news channel N12.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says the Israeli army is -crushing- Hezbollah infrastructure that had been built up for decades in today's strikes in Lebanon, and that the leader of the terror group, Hassan Nasrallah, now remains alone.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38817	2024-09-23T09:33:00-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank Israeli troops have raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, ordering the bureau to shut down. t.me/ourwarstoday JON GAMBRELL… 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 AJ: -#Israeli forces have raided Al Jazeera’s offices in Ramallah in the occupied #WestBank, #Palestine, and imposed a 45-day closure, in the latest push to curtail the news network’s coverage. @ourwarstoday Heavily armed and masked Israeli soldiers entered the building and handed the closure order to the network’s West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari early on Sunday. They did not provide a reason for the decision.-There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,- a soldier told al-Omari as Al Jazeera Arabic broadcast the conversation live on television.-I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment,- the soldier said in Arabic.Sunday’s raid comes just months after the Israeli government banned Al Jazeera from operating inside Israel in May.That initial closure order was also for 45 days, but it has been renewed and Al Jazeera journalists are still unable to report from inside the country.Speaking over the phone from Ramallah on Sunday, Al Jazeera’s correspondent Nida Ibrahim said the West Bank raid and closure order -comes as no surprise- after the earlier ban on reporting from inside Israel.-We’ve heard Israeli officials threatening to close down the bureau. We’ve heard the government discussing this, asking the military ruler in the occupied West Bank to close down and shut down the channel. But we [had] not been expecting it to happen today,- Ibrahim said.After the raid, al-Omari – the bureau chief – raised concerns about what Israeli soldiers may do to the office.-Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,- he said.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38713	2024-09-21T19:56:56-07:00

The crew was not injured.-This event represents an unprecedented escalation of Russia's illegal and unjustified war against #Ukraine,- the ministry's statement read.-Deliberately attacking a cargo ship is a serious violation of international humanitarian legal norms governing the conduct of war at sea.-Bucharest also condemned Russia's violations of the U.N. Charter through the -systematic and irresponsible bombing of Ukrainian infrastructure and grain-carrying ships,- adding these attacks -threaten global food security.-The incident comes as another sign of Russia's war against Ukraine spilling over to NATO territory. Romanian authorities have repeatedly uncovered drone wreckage on its soil following Russia's mass attack against Ukrainian Danube ports, lying in the vicinity of the Romanian border.While #Bucharest said it sees no intent behind Russian drones crashing on Romanian territory, it presented the Russian attack against the vessel as deliberate.The attack on the ship marked the first missile strike on a civilian vessel transporting grain through the #BlackSea since the start of the full-scale invasion. Some vessels have been previously damaged by mines or while moored in Ukrainian ports.President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is one of the key global contributors to food security and that the Ukrainian government will continue to do -everything possible- to protect Ukrainian ports and supply food to the global market.-We are waiting for the world's reaction. Wheat and food security should never be a target for missiles,- the president added.Ukraine has exported over 64 million metric tons of goods to 46 countries since the temporary Black Sea corridor began operating, according to the Infrastructure Ministry.-Ensuring the safety and sustainability of agricultural exports passing through the Black Sea remains critical for supporting global food security and keeping global prices under control,- U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.----In response the #Kremlin has feigned ignorance: -The Kremlin is not familiar with accusations from Kyiv that Russia allegedly attacked a grain ship in the Black Sea,- Russian state-owned TASS news outlet quoted Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov as saying.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38394	2024-09-13T07:20:11-07:00

Vadym Filashkin said.The previous day, Russians destroyed a natural gas distribution station near Pokrovsk, Filashkin said. Some 18,000 people remain in the city, including 522 children, he said. More than 20,000 people have left in the past six weeks as Russian forces creep closer to residential areas, Filashkin said.-Evacuation is the only … choice for civilians,- he added.Pokrovsk is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region, which lies on part of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defensive abilities and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated goal of capturing the entire Donetsk region, which it partially occupies.Russian troops backed by artillery and powerful glide bombs have turned Donetsk cities and towns such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka into bombed-out shells, though the push has cost Russia heavily in troops and armor.The United States and Britain pledged nearly $1.5 billion in additional aid to Ukraine on Wednesday during a visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats. Much of that will go to restoring the electricity supply.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, -we’re again seeing Putin dust off his winter playbook, targeting Ukrainian energy and electricity systems to weaponize the cold against the Ukrainian people.-Russia launched a total of 64 Shahed drones and five missiles over eastern, central, and northern regions of Ukraine, Ukraine’s air force said in its Thursday morning report.Notably on Tuesday, over 140 Ukrainian drones targeted multiple Russian regions overnight, including Moscow and surrounding areas, killing at least one person and injuring eight, officials said, in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russian soil of the past two and half years of #Russia's invasion war of #Ukraine.- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38389	2024-09-12T06:59:21-07:00

This isn’t a dismissal of the Global War on Terror, or the racist killings that came as a result of American rage fuelled by belligerent policy.

Stan Honda snapped this photo of her shrouded in dust shorty after the collapse of the second tower, and her likeness was widely circulated in papers and magazines around the world.Borders would die of stomach cancer in 2015 at the age of 42. Her cancer was directly tied to toxic chemical exposure in the WTC’s debris cloud. Her cancer had resulted in a $190,000 medical debt—even though she had not yet received any surgeries and she still needed additional chemotherapy. Incapacitated due to the medications, Borders said she could not afford to get her prescriptions filled.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38385	2024-09-11T07:34:14-07:00
