Our Wars, Today: Photo 🇲🇲 🔥The fire rises in #Myanmar... as resistance forces continue to advance across the country and close to the capital, against the unlawful Burmese military junta that overthrew the democratic government in 2021 in a shocking coup d’état that saw mass youth protests violently suppressed and widespread demonstrations. This resistance uproar eventually triggered a widespread revival of older and longing running anti-junta militias and EAOs (ethnic armed organizations), as well as the birth of new militant groups and alliances, as people took up arms against the illegal government, and the slew of war crimes and abuse committed by the State Administration Council (#SAC) and the #Tatmadaw military, leading to total civil war. @ourwarstoday Via Thomas Van Linge on Twitter:-MAP UPDATE: the situation in Myanmar / #Burma as of 01/09/2024. In the past month the resistance made several gains across the country, fully seizing the city of Lashio as well as towns in Kachin, Sagaing, Rakhine and Shan states.A more generalized version of the situation in Myanmar, dividing the different faction up into #NUG and its allies, the #3BHA, and neutral or ceasefire factions.

Our Wars, Today: Photo A #Moscow oil refinery also was struck by #Ukrainian drones today. @ourwarstoday Russian milblogger drone channel -Game of Drones- writes: -About the mass raid on Russian regions and MoscowThe morning of September 1 began with alarming news, which concerned Muscovites as well. Ukrainian UAVs attacked objects not only in the Moscow region, but also for the first time hit an object within the Moscow Ring Road - the oil refinery in Kapotnya.In total, the Defense Ministry reported the downing of 158 UAVs in 16 Russian regions. Two more power plants were hit: Kashirskaya and Konakovskaya, the Zhukovsky airfield, and several villages in the Moscow region.It is difficult to judge whether electronic warfare systems were used to shoot down the drones. Judging by the published videos, they definitely tried to shoot them down with small arms fire. Most likely, these were automatic weapons and machine guns.Everything that happened once again raises questions that we have written about many times. About the need to create a system for detecting enemy UAVs. About certification of electronic warfare systems. Until these problems are resolved at the very top, Ukrainian drones will fly to the Moscow region and even to the capital itself.- t.me/droneswar/9275	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38281	2024-09-01T09:37:40-07:00

But political analysts are discussing it now. And even [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky said, he sometimes makes Freudian slips, that they will need this for future exchanges. That's why they are taking prisoners and want to seize square kilometers. It's so simple-minded and naive. We do not discuss our territory with anyone. We do not negotiate about our territory,- the minister said, as he commented on Ukraine's attack on the Kursk Region.He quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin as saying a year and a half ago that Russia -is not against talks, but those who are against them should realize that the longer they procrastinate, the harder it will be to reach an agreement.--In Istanbul, less than a month after the start of our special military operation, compared to what we see now, it was very easy to reach an agreement. They did not want that,- the minister said.-About everything else, the president said on June 14, speaking at the Russian Foreign Ministry, that we are ready to resolve the situation on the basis of the reality. The reality on the ground, the reality of the Russian Constitution, which clearly states that we now have four new constituents of the federation in addition to Crimea. Of course, with all this, there can also be no talk of Ukraine joining NATO,- Lavrov said.The minister also stated that Russia is currently not seeking any talks.-The Russian president has repeatedly said that those who make statements insinuating that Russia rejects negotiations, while Ukraine is ready for them - he has already said this many times - you at least tell this Zelensky, when he is in his right mind, if such situations happen on any day of the week, tell him to cancel his decree prohibiting negotiations,- Lavrov said.-https://tass.com/defense/1836591TASSRussia won’t exchange territory after attack on Kursk Region — LavrovIt is very hard to tell what goal and intent they were pursuing	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38266	2024-08-31T16:53:23-07:00

🖼 Regarding the video of the Russian soldier attempting to shoot...	Regarding the video of the Russian soldier attempting to shoot himself that I posted on Instagram with the comments and likes off: -Just saw this and thought I'd explain my post, at least from the perspective of posting it. I generally keep most graphic and depressing war content on my graphic Telegram page but occasionally I will post it on Instagram. The point is not to be sensational but to show what is happening elsewhere, and if it's interrupted otherwise as war-profiteering or trivalizing that's my fault and I will try to do better.I don't mean for my posts to be war p*rn, and that's partially the reason why I disable comments on particularly morbid or emotional intense videos. People often escape to the comments to distract themselves from what they are seeing, or make gross jokes, or attack and insult others. I don't post these things for people to be disrespectful to the dead. I'm sure my online desensitization to these things plays into it, and if that's a shortsighted issue of mine I can't truly recognize, I'm apologetic.I've been using my warning disclaimer about content since 2022 and it's purpose is to simply have enough keywords in it to be picked up by Meta/Instagram's algorithm so that the post doesn't get zucced to oblivion. Not much more to it than that. I'm truly sorry to anyone who has felt like I've been trying to trivialize or make light/minimize the deaths or suffering of anyone or avoid discussions on morality of posting such content. That is not my intention whatsoever, and I will make more efforts to try to avoid that going forward. Anyway, just my words----I know on Telegram this type of video is pretty tame compared to many channels content but I thought I would still share my thoughts on it.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38250	2024-08-31T11:21:59-07:00

Syrskiy led the defense of Kyiv that repelled Russia’s assault in early 2022, and a successful counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region that autumn. But some blamed him for heavy losses in the defense of the eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia captured in May 2023 after months of brutal fighting. @ourwarstoday The Kursk operation has won the general plaudits for its planning, secrecy and speed. Analysts and Ukrainian officers said Syrskiy had evidently drawn conclusions from Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive during the summer of 2023, when Ukraine consulted with the U.S. and other Western partners, deployed newly formed brigades and telegraphed its plans with videos and public comments.Only a small number of senior officers took part in the meetings, led by Syrskiy, to thrash out detailed plans for the incursion. Syrskiy tapped battle-hardened units, such as the 80th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades, to lead the incursion and didn’t inform the U.S. of plans.While last year’s counteroffensive assaulted Russia’s strongest fortifications in the south, this time Syrskiy picked a target that Moscow had assumed was untouchable and left weakly defended primarily by conscripts.-The strong point of Syrskiy is that he is a general who can act unusually, suddenly, unexpectedly for the enemy,- said Serhiy Cherevatiy, Syrskiy’s former communications adviser. -He knows we don’t have parity and can’t go head-to-head, so he uses cunning and any advantage we have.-Before Syrskiy’s July meeting with senior officers from units selected for the operation, troops from the 61st Brigade had spent months training in the east for what officers assumed would be another defensive engagement. Even after the general’s disclosure that they would be going into Russia, Kholodkevych, the brigade’s chief of staff, thought it might simply be a bluff, meant to deceive the Russians.The transfer of the 61st Brigade from the east was accompanied by a disinformation campaign indicating they were headed for Vovchansk, a northern city under assault since May, when Russia launched its own cross-border incursion.Instead, the brigade was in the second wave of Ukrainian troops into Kursk on Aug. 7. As assault troops on fast-moving armored vehicles drove deeper into Russia avoiding head-on assaults in towns and villages, the 61st mopped up pockets of soldiers cut off by the quick advance.The rapid operation bears similarities to Syrskiy’s Kharkiv offensive, which took advantage of Russian weak points to break through their lines, cut off troops and take back swaths of territory.Now, Ukraine is taking advantage of Russian unpreparedness to strike deeper into the rear, creating what Zelensky has called a buffer zone to impede Russian military operations against Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces are still taking more prisoners to add to a pool that Ukraine hopes to trade for its own people detained in Russia.Ukraine is using new tactics and equipment to gain an upper hand where Russian defenses are weaker, including using small explosive drones to strike down helicopters and Russian surveillance drones.The commander of a drone unit, call sign Aristarkh, said that was allowing Ukrainian artillery to move more freely and hit more targets as the threat of discovery is lower. Aristarkh’s teams operate strike drones with a range of 30 miles that can drop aerial bombs on high-value targets such as artillery guns.Russia has a total of 30,000 troops in the area to counter the offensive, Syrskiy said Tuesday, some of them transferred from Ukraine.Still, Syrskiy said Russia wasn’t redeploying troops from the Pokrovsk front to Kursk, as Ukraine had hoped it would, and is instead not strengthening its forces there.That has provoked complaints from soldiers in the east that their defensive efforts have been starved in favor of the Kursk offensive.Hodges, the retired U.S. Army Europe commander, said that is a risk that Syrskiy and his advisers will have foreseen and decided it was worth taking.Via: https://archive.is/gs9VV	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38248	2024-08-31T08:40:39-07:00
↩️ Ukraine General’s Plan Surprised the Russians—and His Own Troo...	Our Wars, Today: Syrskyi Thoughts? Ukraine General’s Plan Surprised the Russians—and His Own Troops:#Ukraine’s top military commander gathered senior officers for a secret meeting in late July where he disclosed an audacious plan to revive the country’s flagging war effort. @ourwarstoday Ukraine’s army, Gen. Oleksandr #Syrskyi told them, would turn the tables on Moscow by launching the first large-scale invasion of #Russia since World War II.One attendee, the chief of staff of the 61st Mechanized Brigade, said his initial reaction was shock. -Where are we going?- Lt. Col. Artem Kholodkevych recalled thinking.The brazen operation also stunned Russia when it launched on Aug. 6, overrunning weak border defenses and quickly seizing around 100 towns and villages in Russia’s #Kursk region. The invasion embarrassed Russian President Vladimir #Putin, raised Ukrainians’ morale after a year of grinding defensive war, and showed the U.S. and other backers that Ukraine still has plenty of fight in it.-We exploded the myth that Russia is an invincible country,- Kholodkevych said in an interview. -We did something that no one has done for 80 years.-The operation has brought a brighter spotlight on its architect, Syrskiy. The 59-year-old career military officer faced a challenging proposition when he took over in February. He was replacing a popular predecessor, Gen. Valeriy #Zaluzhniy, and since then has sought largely to manage a war of attrition against a much larger foe.The incursion has, for now, upended the narrative of the war, putting Ukraine back on the offensive. But the success of the operation will ultimately be determined by whether it leads to lasting gains, or greater losses, on the battlefield—or yields political dividends that bring more military support from the U.S. and its allies or strengthen Ukraine’s position in any future peace negotiations.Now in its fourth week, the incursion is continuing to make gains even as Russia has sent reinforcements. At least 2,000 #Russian troops are hemmed in against a river, where repeated attempts to relieve them using pontoon bridges have failed, according to #Ukrainian soldiers.Some military strategists and soldiers have questioned the Kursk operation, saying Syrskiy is committing precious reserves of manpower and equipment to a new front while Russia is taking advantage of Ukraine’s threadbare defensive lines on the eastern front to press forward. Russia has withdrawn several thousand troops from Ukraine in response to the incursion, but has intensified assaults on its main target, Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub for Ukrainian operations in the east.Others have praised the move, saying that Ukraine needed to play a joker to change the momentum of a war.Ukraine couldn’t afford simply to keep trying to buy time by throwing more men into defensive lines, said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe. -Nobody has enough resources to do everything,- he said. -You are constantly having to make decisions about priorities, where to accept risk.-The operation is also a bold gambit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr #Zelenskiy, who was trapped between a slow but relentless advance by Russia, which wants to take control of Ukraine, and the West’s unwillingness to provide sufficient weaponry to reverse Russian gains.-He saw that only one actor can change the status quo,- said Mick Ryan, a military strategist and retired major general in the Australian Army. -It’s risky but audacious.-Zelensky said Tuesday he is planning to travel to the U.S. in September to present a peace plan that has been spurred, in part, by the positive dynamic of the invasion.Syrskiy, a fitness buff with a passion for military history, had an ambiguous reputation among Ukrainian soldiers. His stern, clipped style contrasts with his predecessor, who would pose for selfies and flash V signs for victory.Via https://archive.is/gs9VVarchive.isExclusive | Ukraine General’s Plan Surprised the Russians—and His Own…archived 31 Aug 2024 06:36:06 UTC	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38247	2024-08-31T08:40:39-07:00

🇮🇱 🇵🇸 Hundreds of Israeli troops are active in the occupied #...	🇮🇱 🇵🇸 Hundreds of Israeli troops are active in the occupied #WestBank, #Palestine, and #Israeli drones are being flown as the #IDF has launched one of its largest raids in the West Bank since the #Gaza War began in October. The raid began on August 28th, and is still ongoing. Israeli officials have said it is likely to continue, with the end date of the operation unknown. Via theatlasnews.co @ourwarstoday The Israeli operation has spanned several different cities. #Jenin and #Tulkarem appear to be the cities with the largest IDF activity, however Israeli raids have also occurred in #Nablus, Tubas, and Al-Fara’a.The IDF stated that they carried out the raids after detecting an -immediate threat- to civilians, but also as a larger crackdown amidst heightened militant activity in recent months.Across several of the besieged cities, #Israel has deployed armored bulldozers to carry out significant amounts of infrastructure destruction. While not present in every raid, Israel rather frequently deploys armored construction equipment to accompany their troops. The armored bulldozers dig up streets, crush cars, and, at times, demolish houses.Unique to the ongoing raid is that Israeli troops have surrounded the Jenin government hospital and blocked access to the building with mounds of dirt. Palestinian health officials further claimed that Israel prevented an ambulance from reaching the hospital. Israeli military sources have stated that this measure has been taken in order to prevent militant forces from seeking refuge in the hospital.Palestinian sources have claimed that Israeli bulldozers have also destroyed electricity transmitters for the Jenin refugee camp, causing a blackout in the camp.Israeli forces have thus far been primarily engaged by Saraya Al-Quds (the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s (#PIJ) militant wing), the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade (a #Palestinian militant group that was a part of Fatah until 2007 that has become one of the key Palestinian militant factions in recent years), and elements of the Al-Qassam Brigades, #Hamas’ militant wing. Other smaller groups have also engaged Israeli forces.Amidst the ongoing Israeli raids, Israel’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Israel Katz, released a statement claiming that the Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank are Iranian proxies that are funded and supplied directly by Iran through the Jordanian border, comparing it to the -proxy model- that was set up by Iran -in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq.-To counter this, Katz called for a security fence to be built on the Israeli-Jordanian border and for -the US and Western countries- to -strengthen the Kingdom of Jordan against Iranian subversion and enable it to defend its borders,- though he did not specify what exactly this meant.In a separate statement, Katz called for the -temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents- in order to allow for Israel to properly tackle ongoing security threats. Further, he stated that -this is a war for everything and we must win it.-The Foreign Minister’s statements, in particular that calling for the evacuation of Palestinian civilians, have drawn condemnation from international diplomats, including from the EU’s High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security and Vice President of the EU Commission, Josep Borrell.Read the full article here: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/29/israel-launches-massive-west-bank-raid/theatlasnews.coIsrael Launches Massive West Bank Raid | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38245	2024-08-31T08:06:18-07:00

If a spill occurs, it has the potential to be among the largest from a ship in recorded history and could cause an environmental catastrophe in an area that is particularly dangerous to access.-What was decided yesterday is an initial game plan, of the operation starting in 48 hours,- one of the sources said. A second source said the operation was likely to be complex, given Houthis have planted explosives on board.#Greece said in a letter circulated through the U.N. shipping agency on Friday that what it called a -potential spill- of 2.2 nautical miles (4.2 km) in length had been detected in the area matching the location of the Sounion in the Red Sea. However, an official with the European Union's ASPIDES naval monitoring mission told Reuters that the potential spill was from the vessel’s engine and not from the oil cargo onboard.-The potential spill is from the tanker's engine after the first hit,- the ASPIDES official said. Greece urged -all nations and all actors involved to assist in preventing the environmental hazard and resolving the situation the soonest possible- in its letter dated Aug. 29 and published on Friday by the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization.#Yemen's Houthi militants carried out multiple assaults, including planting bombs on the already disabled 900-foot (274-metre) Sounion, which is operated by Athens-based Delta Tankers.On Wednesday, the Iran-aligned militants said they would allow salvage teams to tow the ship - which has been on fire since Aug. 23 - to safety. The ship's crew has been evacuated.The sources said the priority of the operation - to decide whether to tow the vessel to a port or arrange a transfer of its cargo - depended on an inspection of the vessel. -It is not an easy task, transferring the oil cargo to another ship, when there are explosives on it,- said one of the sources. -In any case, ASPIDES ships will protect and escort the vessel to a safe port.-Greece has also been in touch with Saudi Arabia, a key player in the region, to ask for assistance.-Delta Tankers is doing everything it can to move the vessel (and cargo). For security reasons, we are not in a position to comment further,- a spokesperson for the tanker operator said.–Reuters----High-resolution satellite imagery of Maxar, taken today, shows the Greek-flagged tanker SOUNION in the Red Sea, recently attacked by Houthi rebels. Fires are visible on the deck, with an oil slick near the bow. The ship reportedly carries over one million barrels of crude oil.The fires visible on the SOUNION's deck were caused by explosives set off by Houthi rebels, as shown in a video they released earlier.There are currently no indications of a salvage operation visible on satellite imagery.- Above text and images via: x.com/trbrtc/status/1829219521699455395 and x.com/tom_bike/status/1829534810483962014 Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38240	2024-08-30T18:41:55-07:00

Take care of all our soldiers,-&nbsp;Lieutenant General Anatolii Kryvonozhko has been appointed Commander of Ukraine's Air Force in the wake of Oleshchuk's dismissal.&nbsp;The pilot who died, Oleksii Mes, call sign -Moonfish,- reportedly went down over Ukraine on the 26th of August during a Russian missile and drone attack wave. The cause of his crash has been disputed; Ukraine's Defense Ministry and the U.S. are reportedly working to investigate the crash circumstances.Reuters previously reported a U.S. official said pilot error and mechanical failure were involved and that it didn't appear to be caused by Russian fire. A majority party-exiled and controversial Ukrainian MP, Mariana Bezuhla, on the other hand, claimed online following the news breaking that a Ukrainian-operated Patriot air defense system had friendly fired and shot down the jet.&nbsp;Prior to his dismissal, Oleshchuk had said that he would investigate the crash and that -no one has hidden anything [or is] hiding anything [now].- theatlasnews.co &nbsp;Photo: Alamy, Zelenskiy and Oleshchuk.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38239	2024-08-30T16:41:40-07:00

Several cars parked outside were gutted by fire.Emergency services and rescue volunteers rushed to carry survivors out of the building. The body of one of the victims lay under a carpet on the ground outside, surrounded by police.Residents of all ages, some of them covered in blood, sat stunned on benches and walls outside as medics attended to their injuries.The authorities did not give the circumstances in which the two other people died in the strikes, which hit four areas of the city.---Daily and weekly waves of Russian drones and missiles are not uncommon for Kharkiv, as well as mass casualty events of civilians as a result of such attacks. Since early May of 2024 Russia has focused on an offensive targeting Kharkiv and Sumy regions, forcing the evacuation of over 10,000, and causing hundreds of civilian casualties. War crimes committed by Russian soldiers have also been alleged by Ukrainian survivors during this offensive.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38214	2024-08-30T11:05:36-07:00

The exact circumstances of the crash have not been reported.The #Russian Ministry of Defense has not publicly commented on the loss, but social media is already aflame with triumphant comments from circles critical of U.S. deliveries to Ukraine.

The ads are not covert and prominently feature the U.S. Central Command logo, linking to a tweet with images of fighter jets. This comes after recent flares of exchanges of attacks over the Israel-Lebanon border.

Telegram CEO Indicted on Criminal Charges in France: theatlasnews.co Pavel Durov, the Russian-born CEO and founder of the Telegram messaging and social media app (and co-founder of widely used Russian social media platform VK), has been indicted today by French authorities for six charges of criminal activity related to the app. The charges included complicity in his Dubai-based platform's enabling of illegal transactions, organized crime, distribution of illegal images of minors presenting, child sexual abuse images, and drug trafficking. Telegram has long been accused by state and non-state groups of allowing a wide range of illegal or fraudulent activities to continue without much crackdown. @ourwarstoday After his was charged, he was reportedly released from custody on €5 million bail, according to POLITICO. He must check in with French police at a station twice a week and cannot leave the country.Telegram is among the world's most used messaging platforms with 950 million active users in July 2024 according to Durov.Warrants were originally issued in March by France for Durov and his brother Nikolai, according to POLITICO. Durov was detained on Saturday night in Paris at the Le Bourget airport.Durov’s lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said after the indictment: -The only statement I’d wish to make is that Telegram is in conformity with every aspect of European norms on digital matters. It is absurd to think that the head of a social network is being charged,-. Telegram released a statement reiterating the same points, also saying Durov had nothing to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;A French and Emirate citizen since 2021, Durov moved to the UAE in 2017 after leaving Russia in 2014 indefinitely following a number of confrontations with the Russian government.&nbsp;Durov in 2014 notably had a publicized departure from his position as CEO of the Facebook equivalent VK platform, which he helped found. This came after his selling of shares to VK in late 2013, a fakeout April's Fool of his resignation in 2014, then the refusal to hand over data on Ukrainian demonstrators in the Euromaiden protests to Russian authorities also in April, as well as refusing to block Alex Nalvany's page. He was dismissed from the company later that month after calling the requests unlawful. Durov claimed the company had been taken over by those aligned with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Forwarded From ⚠️ Our Wars, GRAPHIC ⚠️🇧🇫 An attack by the al-#Qaeda linked militant group Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen (#JNIM) on Barsalogho village, in #BurkinaFaso’s Sanmatenga Province on Saturday has left at least 200 dead and at least 100 more injured, according to official sources, while local sources point to at least 400 fatalities from the mass killing of civilians. Via theatlasnews.co Barsalogho is located an approximate 25 miles north of Kaya–a strategically significant town which acts as the last military bulwark against the militant group–as the capital, #Ouagadougo, lies just 78 miles ahead. @ourwarstoday Military authorities in the area had allegedly forcibly tasked the village’s civilians with digging a defensive trench around the community due to intelligence on an impending attack on the locality which local sources claim has been -virtually under terrorist blockade for two years.-Sources inside the community stated, -it is no longer possible to go in any direction from Barsalogho more than 3km (1.8 miles) without being killed. However, in this case, the population was forced to go 3km (1.8 miles) outside the city to dig the ditch.-Taking place over seven hours, it is believed that between tens to hundreds of civilians bled to death after the initial massacre took place, with military reinforcements heading to the village on Sunday at approximately 10 a.m. and arriving at 2 p.m., nearly 24 hours after the onset of the massacre.Survivors were transported to Kaya’s regional hospital to receive treatment and were visited by a government team consisting of the Minister of State, Minister of Security, the Minister of Humanitarian Action, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, and a government spokesperson.On its media channels, JNIM announced, -full control over the headquarters of the Burkinabe militias in Barsalogho this morning, praise and gratitude be to God.-Notably, is the use of the term ‘Burkinabe militias’ to refer to the deceased civilians.Earlier this month, JNIM conducted an attack on a convoy of the Burkinabe armed forces (FDS) while traveling between Boungou and Ougarou in the country’s east. The attack left at least 140 military personnel dead.In its statement on the attack, JNIM denounced the mistreatment of the civilian populous by the Burkinabe government, stating, -This blessed jihadist act comes in response to the heinous crimes committed by the ruling clique against innocent, defenseless people in retaliation for the blood of our Muslim peoples in Burkina, Mali, and Niger and in an effort to stop the campaign of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and forced displacement that our families and brothers are suffering in this region. God is Great, and Glory belongs to God.-It is clear that the militant group classifies any individual connected to Ibrahim Traore’s military junta as a combatant, despite the fact that local sources pointed to the fact that -the leaders of the [military] detachment on site forced the people to participate in the work, against their will, through threats. Since the start of the work, the people were reprimanded and beaten by the FDS elements to force them to come and take part in the work.-Taking power through a military coup in 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traore and his newly formed military government vowed to respond decisively to the terrorist threat in the nation but has since struggled to make gains at a rate inferior to his predecessors.Requesting the populous on August 8th to report on any suspicious individuals, movements, or objects, in an attempt to establish an informal civilian surveillance force, the use of civilians to dig defensive trenches highlights the extent of the FDS’ manpower and resource shortages and its deadly consequences.

🖼 🇵🇰 🇨🇳 Does #Pakistan Underestimate #Balochistan’s Rebels?:...	🇵🇰 🇨🇳 Does #Pakistan Underestimate #Balochistan’s Rebels?: theatlasnews.co Fragments of the Balochistan landscape––a Chinese-controlled Gwadar port, an under-examined human rights crisis, and continual IED attacks––all connect to each other. The human rights crisis, exacerbated by poverty, encourages locals to join militant movements, often the only chance at income or upward mobility. These militant movements prompt aggressive counter-insurgency action, which intensifies the human rights crisis. @ourwarstoday The region is resource-rich; one undeveloped copper-gold reserve called Reko Diq holds 12.3 million metric tons of copper and 20.9 million ounces of gold. But these resources are dominated by foreign mining companies, particularly #Chinese ones, causing locals to complain not only of misappropriation of resources but also pollution.Over the past few days, scores were killed in Balochistan as a series of attacks rocked the region. Attacks targeting key infrastructure and Pakistani security forces were quickly claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army (#BLA), an infamous Baloch separatist group. Last Thursday, the Pakistani Army raided a BLA camp in the mountainous areas of Gishk, which turned into a 2-day affair claiming both Pakistani and Baloch lives. More recently, dozens more were killed in BLA operations on a major highway in Bela, a road near Musakhel, a railway in Bolan, and a police station in Kalat. In the wake of the violence, the BLA announced the end of the first phase of Operation Herouf. Not only did the operation allegedly kill 130 Pakistan military personnel, the BLA also controlled checkpoints on highways for 12 hours and a Pakistani military camp for 20 hours.In response, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi decried the attacks (some of which allegedly targeted Pubjabi citizens), promised retribution, and called on the provincial governments of Balochistan to repress terrorism. Today, President Asif Ali Zardari ordered the Interior Minister to completely eliminate terrorists, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an aggressive response. In clearance operations, the Pakistani Army reports to have killed 21 Baloch militants and says 14 of its own troops died in the attacks.But the BLA tells a different story. An official statement by the BLA claims that the coordinated attacks of Operation Herof were a success and well over a hundred Pakistani military personnel and military collaborators were killed, versus the 14 reported by Pakistani authorities.Baloch separatist groups have contributed to a violent insurgency, often called a low-intensity one, in the region for years. The only question is what to believe. In the midst of recent firewalls installed on Pakistani internet, information slowly trickles out of the media blackhole in Balochistan. Building a picture of what’s happening in the region is difficult.

Largest Russian Strikes on Ukraine: theatlasnews.co In the early hours this morning, August 26th, #Russian forces launched a massive wave of missile and drone strikes across 15 #Ukrainian oblasts, targeting critical energy infrastructures and prompting a nationwide air raid alert.&nbsp;#Ukraine celebrated independence from the Soviet Union on Saturday, and some form of attacks from #Russia around the date were anticipated. Reportedly, the wave of attacks was the largest ever by Russia against Ukraine during their ongoing war of invasion, with over 236 incoming aerial attacks. @ourwarstoday Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko confirmed the attack’s extensive impacts. In response, Ukrenergo, a major Ukrainian energy provider, initiated emergency power outages to manage the crisis. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal elaborated on the widespread impact of the attack, reporting extensive damage across the affected regions and conveying his condolences to the victims’ families.Explosions were reported in the capital city of Kyiv. Although Kyiv’s air defenses reportedly successfully intercepted a dozen missiles and fifteen drones, the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, headed by Ruslan Kravchenko, reported significant hits on infrastructure facilities, leading to power outages and water supply problems, particularly on the city’s right bank. To support residents impacted by these disruptions, authorities have established community stations offering essential services like phone charging and internet access.Allegedly, the Hydroelectric Power Station in Vyshhorod, near Kyiv, was also targeted in the recent Russian strikes. While there are reports of damage to the dam’s roadway and machine hall, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation Andriy Kovalenko assured&nbsp;on Telegram&nbsp;that&nbsp;the damage is not considered critical due to the impossibility to destroy the dam with missiles. He also stated that the Russian media are using this topic to stir up panic.Explosions were also reported in multiple other cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Kremenchuk, Dnipro, Khmelnytskyi, Kropyvnytskyi, and Kryvyi Rih, as well as in Lviv, Rivne, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts.Ukraine's emergency services reported 7 people were killed and 47 injured as a result of the Russian attack, including 3 children aged 10, 7, and a less than a year old baby.Energy provider DTEK has now announced rolling electrical blackouts in Kyiv, Odesa, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions in an effort to stabilize the power grid. In addition to the strikes, Russian forces have reportedly made advancements in the #Toretsk area, #Donetsk Oblast.&nbsp;In response, Vadim Filashkin, the Kyiv-appointed head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, reported a mandatory evacuation of the population in Toretsk.Read more in the full article at: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/26/massive-russian-strikes-in-ukraine-what-are-the-consequences/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38130	2024-08-26T14:42:59-07:00

Via Reuters. @ourwarstoday The type 2 virus (cVDPV2), while not inherently more dangerous than types 1 and 3, has been responsible, opens new tab for most outbreaks in recent years, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.U.N. agencies have called for Israel and Gaza's dominant Palestinian militant group Hummus to agree to a seven-day humanitarian pause in their 10-month-old war to allow vaccination campaigns to proceed in the territory.-Polio does not distinguish between Palestinian and Israeli children,- the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday.-Delaying a humanitarian pause will increase the risk of spread among children,- Philippe Lazzarini added. The baby, who has lost movement in his lower left leg, is currently in stable condition, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.The WHO has announced that two rounds of a polio vaccination campaign are set to begin in late August and September 2024 across the densely populated Gaza Strip, #Palestine.

Other uniformed members are holding the man down with the crack of the whips echoing in the background. @ourwarstoday It is unclear if the video was filmed by a Russian mercenary themselves or the video obtained from a different source and then watermarked by the mercenary channel.The video speaks to concerns first raised by UN Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk in May. Turk noted a 71 percent increase in violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law compared to the previous six months. Moreover, 65 percent of the victims in these abuses were victims of unlawful killings.Additionally, the incident may have been brought about by a request on August 8th from #BurkinaFaso’s Security Ministry to the populous to report on any suspicious individual, movement or activity.Read the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/23/burkinabe-armed-forces-filmed-torturing-an-alleged-infiltrated-fighter/theatlasnews.coBurkinabe Armed Forces Filmed Torturing an alleged ‘Infiltrated Fighter’ | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38118	2024-08-24T09:32:47-07:00

They accuse American journalists and those of other nationalities of provocative behavior. Additionally, Russia has claimed there is an American PMC operating in #Kursk. @ourwarstoday Photo shows Americans in the Ukrainian International Legion holding the U.S. flag in Kursk, Russia. There have been several reported cases of volunteer soldiers from the U.S. fighting in an International Legion capacity in the offensive. ---WaPo:-The U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday rejected Russian accusations of U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s Kursk incursion, after the Foreign Ministry summoned Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Holmes to protest the -provocative actions- of American journalists who reported from the Russian region of Kursk under Ukrainian controlThe ministry condemned the actions of American journalists who reported from Kursk after Ukrainian forces took control of the region and complained that an American private military company was operating there as well.In response, the embassy said that independent news organizations -make their own operational and personnel decisions,- in a statement Wednesday. -The U.S. government plays no role.--In fact, we actively discourage all U.S. citizens from traveling to Russia, including for reporting purposes, as we have stated in our Travel Advisory for Russia, which is currently at Level 4: Do Not Travel.-The statement added that -we were not engaged in any aspect of the planning or preparation of this operation. We refer you to the Ukrainians to speak about their own military operations.-The ministry on Tuesday told Holmes that the journalists had entered the region illegally -for propaganda coverage of the crimes of the [Ukrainian] regime.- Its statement Tuesday said the Russian law enforcement agencies would investigate Americans -involved in these crimes- and bring them to justice. The ministry did not name any journalists or media outlets.The European Federation of Journalists on Tuesday strongly condemned earlier Russian threats to prosecute Italian journalists who covered the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk.-The EFJ considers that these intimidations amount to censorship and are aimed at preventing public opinion from being informed about ongoing operations,- the federation said in a statement.The Washington Post and several other U.S. news organizations have reported from inside Kursk in recent days. The Post said in a story published Aug. 18 that its team traveled to Ukrainian-held territory in Russia to document the extent of Ukrainian control and witness firsthand the conditions remaining Russian civilians face.-We are proud of our reporting on the Ukraine-Russia war and remain committed to covering all aspects of this important, evolving conflict,- a Post spokesperson said.Russia’s Foreign Ministry also complained that an American private military company was fighting on Ukraine’s side in Kursk and participating -in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation.- The ministry statement did not name the company but warned that any foreign military specialists or mercenaries illegally crossing into Russia were legitimate military targets.According to the ministry, Holmes was warned that these actions, -which run counter to the claims of the Biden administration about its alleged noninvolvement in the attack of Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia, clearly prove the involvement of the United States as a direct participant in the conflict.--Full article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/21/us-russia-journalists-kursk/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38081	2024-08-23T00:34:23-07:00

David Allvin told airmen in a newly released memo that officials are focusing on updating family and mental health resources for airmen as they continue to highlight the urgent preparation needed for a potential future conflict in the #Pacific. @ourwarstodayThe memo, provided first to Military.com and shared publicly Tuesday, was titled -Refocusing Family Readiness.- Amid the Air Force's latest shift to reorganize the force for great power competition -- the service's term for increased spending and strategy against adversaries such as #Russia and, most notably, #China -- it offered an inward look at how it plans to support airmen and families during the sweeping changes.-We cannot afford to be in that situation again,- Allvin wrote. -The insights I gained then have been validated in the years since, and serve as motivation for what we in the Air Force community need to strive to achieve when it comes to family readiness.--While our efforts to prepare the force for future challenges are essential, they will be incomplete without a parallel focus on family readiness,- Allvin wrote. -In order to meet the moment in this time of consequence, we need to ensure that families and communities connected to the Air Force are as well prepared as our service members for the possible challenges that lay ahead.-A number of programs have been rolled out and revamped in recent months, and Allvin hinted that others are currently underway including combining the Air Force’s True North programs and Operational Support Team programs to best support airmen and their families.Allvin pointed to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when he was serving as a squadron commander at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, as an example for -how collectively unprepared- service members and their families were for that change.Sweeping changes to the force came earlier this year. In February, Allvin and other Department of the Air Force leaders rolled out numerous changes ranging from bringing back warrant officers, reorganizing training organizations and creating new offices. The changes all underscore the need to prepare for a looming conflict: potential control and invasion of #Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party.The memo is one of the first indications of some family- and mental health-related changes the force is making in that reorganization effort.-We cannot afford to be in that situation again,- Allvin wrote. -The insights I gained then have been validated in the years since, and serve as motivation for what we in the Air Force community need to strive to achieve when it comes to family readiness.-In a related change, airmen and Guardians with dependents who go to a professional military education or training location can now collect per diem at a Basic Allowance for Housing rate while also still receiving a housing allowance at their prior duty station for their families.Full article: https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/08/20/air-force-chiefs-memo-highlights-need-family-readiness-service-preps-possible-pacific-conflict.htmlMilitary.comAir Force Families Must Be Prepared for Catastrophic Events Amid Shift to Potential Pacific Conflict, Service Chief SaysAmid the Air Force's latest shift to reorganize the force for great power competition, a newly released memo offers an inward look at how it plans to support airmen and families during the sweeping changes.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38075	2024-08-22T14:10:31-07:00

The enemy is dragging artillery into our territoryThis, of course, was to be expected. In different sectors of the front, the enemy began to dig in. And to tighten heavy artillery because of the ribbon. Before that, he made do with mortars. But here on the frames of objective control is the ACS, which is reset by our ixologists.Along with the attempt to isolate the Glushkovsky district, all this looks like preparation for the transition to defensive actions. There is a feeling that the enemy did not expect that he would be able to advance so far. But at the same time, there is a concentration of forces in other areas.Now the Armed Forces of Ukraine is focusing on the removal of crossings, which our heroic pontoons, without exaggeration, lead with the tenacity of the doomed. Among journalists, filming the guidance of pontoons has always been something secondary. But today, this job is in the full sense of the word deadly. They are covered both on marches and in the area of crossing guidance. Contrary to Kh*khl's expectations, our garrison in the Glushkovsky district did not run to the northern shore of the Sejm and continues to hold positions, do not let the enemy advance to the west. This means that you can wait for the enemy to open a new direction. As I wrote earlier, this may be the southwestern corner of the Kursk region - Tetkino with an eye on Karyzh.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38074	2024-08-21T07:11:38-07:00

The air defense forces intercepted 45 enemy UAVs, while most of them were shot down over the territories of the Bryansk and Moscow regions. - 23 drones of Ukrainian formations were intercepted in the sky over the Bryansk region. The first targets were recorded in the airspace of the region around one o'clock in the morning, the work of the air defense of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued until seven in the morning, since the UAVs were involved in -waves-. Nevertheless, casualties and destruction in the region were avoided. - 11 more drones were shot down in the airspace of the Moscow region, in the Podolsk area south of Moscow. Similarly with the Bryansk region, the UAVs moved wave after wave and strayed as they approached the area of operation of the local air defense system. No damage or casualties have been detected in the region either.- In the Kaluga region, near the border with the Bryansk region, 3 drones were intercepted, in the Kursk region, air defense forces shot down two UAVs, as well as two missiles. Six more drones were intercepted in the Belgorod region. - In the area of Novoshakhtinsk in the Rostov region, air defense units, according to some information, shot down an ATACMS missile of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The munition fell on a vacant lot and caused a fire of dry grass, nearby buildings suffered damage to windows due to the blast wave. There were no casualties. To date, this is the first recorded case of the use of ATACMS by the enemy against objects in internationally recognized territories of Russia. It was probably just a test launch and in the near future the enemy will launch combined attacks using this type of missiles.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38073	2024-08-21T07:10:42-07:00
