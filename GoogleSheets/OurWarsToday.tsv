The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that the Ukrainian 22nd Motorized Rifle Brigade and elements of the 80th and 82nd Airborne Assault Brigades sustained more than 260 casualties near Martynovka, Borki, and Korenevo in Kursk Oblast today alone.However, Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers have also recognized the success of Russian shock troops in the vicinity of Niu York, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, with the Russians claiming that Ukrainian troops are encircled. Ukrainian bloggers confirmed Russian infantry entered #Toretsk at approximately 0220 EST this morning.

🖼 #Kursk Incursions Update and Map: Russian miblogger/mapper Ryb...	#Kursk Incursions Update and Map:Russian miblogger/mapper Rybar: -❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: the battles at Belitsa and the situation on the outskirts of Korenevowhat is known at 13:00 (Moscow Time) on August 12, 2024 @ourwarstoday In the Kursk direction, the enemy continues to make attempts to build on the successes of the previous days. Despite the transfer of additional formations of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, it has not yet been possible to finally stabilize the front line. The enemy is saturating the area with sabotage groups in armored vehicles, which are seeping into frontline villages along the entire line of contact.The situation in Sudzha has become more complicated in the Sudzha district. Footage has appeared indicating the presence of the enemy on the ring road already in the city center. Despite the statements that the video was allegedly shot on the first day of the Ukrainian offensive, given the incoming reports of the battles for Martynovka, where the enemy's attack was repelled, it would not have been possible for the AFU to advance there without control over most of the Sudzha.Apparently, there remains at least a focal presence of Russian troops and volunteers in the city. The situation in the area of Mirny, which is a suburb of Sudzha, as well as at Mikhaylovka remains to be clarified. There is currently no information about the enemy's control over these settlements.There are battles on the outskirts of Korenevo in the Korenevsky district, the enemy does not stop trying to gain a foothold on its outskirts. At the same time, there is no information about the entry of the APU into the settlement itself.In Kremyanoye, the soldiers of the Akhmat Joint Venture, together with the 810th Marine brigade, conducted a sweep of the surrounding area. The footage published online captures the moment of the search of an armored vehicle next to the liquidated members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The enemy lost several more BBMs on the approaches.At the turn of the Cranes — Sheptukhovka — Semenovka, the gradual insertion of maneuverable groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continues further north in the direction of the route to Kromsky Bulls. An AFU tank was destroyed in the Otradnoye area, an enemy armored vehicle position was covered in the forest belt near Semenovka, and a column of armored personnel carriers was hit by drones near Cranes.As for the Belovsky district, judging by objective evidence, the Ukrainian Armed Forces penetrated beyond the state border, although not on the same scale as described earlier. The enemy has pinned down Russian units at the Borka — Sleeping — Kamyshnoye line with battles. At the same time, according to some reports, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation had to retreat from these villages. In the Village of Giryi, a single BTR-4E of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was noted moving in the direction of the settlement of Belitsa. It is not yet known how many pieces of equipment the enemy used in the area. Later, reports began to arrive that allegedly the same armored personnel carrier was taken as a trophy in one of the settlements. It is impossible to reliably confirm this, it is likely that there were several cars. Meanwhile, local authorities announced the evacuation of the population from the area, but such a decision is hardly dictated by the presence of a single enemy armored vehicle.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37833	2024-08-12T05:01:35-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Mr. President, a second incursion just hit Kursk Ukrainian forces are assaulting through a new border breach at Tetkino, Kursk region, reportedly, with notices from soldiers and locals from the past days being filled with heavy bombardment and shelling of the Russian border village. Communication was reportedly cut off according to several large Russian milbloggers earlier today. @ourwarstoday Clashes also continued at the first incursion point, with some progress claimed by Ukrainian milbloggers and acknowledged by a few Russian channels but not all.https://t.me/pograni4nik_iz_adahttps://t.me/dva_majorsRussian miblogger/mapper Rybar writes only shortly ago:-❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the breakthrough of another section of the front in the Kursk direction: half an hour laterIn fact, just half an hour after the news of the -breakthrough- appeared, what was happening turned out to be more and more like -elephant radio,- as we said .▪️Sounds of fighting can be heard in the vicinity of Belaya Sloboda : local residents say that the sounds are distant, -somewhere about 20 kilometers away.- You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that we are talking about the state border and the Sudzhansky district .▪️Single reports of clashes have come from Milaevka and Goptarovka . At the same time, the Kucherov farm located to the north reports that everything is calm .▪️Some sources speak of a certain mobile armored group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from three to six units of equipment. Here it is appropriate to recall the described tactics of action . It is not yet possible to determine its exact location: we are talking about a nomadic sabotage and reconnaissance group.▪️With a high degree of probability, the battles were still in the vicinity of Guevo and Plekhovo : acting from the side of Miropolye , the Ukrainian Armed Forces could have tried to expand the zone of penetration to the east in the direction of the village of Borki . There are enough forces and resources.📍This does not mean that there are no risks : far from it .In our analysis today, we explained in detail that it is too early to relax, showing cause-and-effect relationships. Moreover, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, alas, have enough forces in the area to stretch our troops. And the entry of a single sabotage and reconnaissance group may actually become an attempt to break through in a new area. Alas, at the current moment this must be taken into account without fail.📌The saddest result of the panic injection was that the information instantly spread through city and yard chats. A small panic began in Belaya Sloboda and the surrounding areas, people began to pack their things, which did not add peace to this difficult period.❗️Telegram colleagues: we kindly ask you to check information from several sources , take the necessary pause to clarify the situation, estimate the probable nature of the enemy's actions and know that your words are often relied on more than statements by official authorities that everything is calm (well, that's how it turned out historically in Russia, what can you do).At this moment, everyone's nerves are frayed. Both ordinary citizens and military personnel with border guards and Rosgvardiya, not to mention the caring warriors of the information front. @rybar-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37813	2024-08-10T14:19:35-07:00
