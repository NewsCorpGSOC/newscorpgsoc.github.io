A Ukrainian convoy of BTR-4s and other armored vehicles apart of an assault on the village of Giri, Kursk region, Russia, are shown taking heavy losses as Russian FPV and dropper drones take out one vehicle after another. @ourwarstoday A number of Ukrainian IFVs, APCs, Humvees, and MRAPs have been shown destroyed, abandoned, or captured by Russian forces in the Kursk region during Ukraine’s incursions. Often these vehicles are taken out in groupings of columns that are targeted. Unclear how comparable, but a few reactionary Russian columns sent to reinforce or retake Kursk settlements have suffered the same fate. Vehicles are often bombarded by drones similarly and then overrun by infantry, which has also been shown for cases of Ukrainian vehicles lost. Artillery of shells, rockets, and missile fire is also frequently reportedly still throughout the incursion lines. Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37836	2024-08-12T20:58:39-07:00

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that the Ukrainian 22nd Motorized Rifle Brigade and elements of the 80th and 82nd Airborne Assault Brigades sustained more than 260 casualties near Martynovka, Borki, and Korenevo in Kursk Oblast today alone.However, Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers have also recognized the success of Russian shock troops in the vicinity of Niu York, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, with the Russians claiming that Ukrainian troops are encircled. Ukrainian bloggers confirmed Russian infantry entered #Toretsk at approximately 0220 EST this morning.

Despite the transfer of additional formations of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, it has not yet been possible to finally stabilize the front line. The enemy is saturating the area with sabotage groups in armored vehicles, which are seeping into frontline villages along the entire line of contact.The situation in Sudzha has become more complicated in the Sudzha district. Footage has appeared indicating the presence of the enemy on the ring road already in the city center. Despite the statements that the video was allegedly shot on the first day of the Ukrainian offensive, given the incoming reports of the battles for Martynovka, where the enemy's attack was repelled, it would not have been possible for the AFU to advance there without control over most of the Sudzha.Apparently, there remains at least a focal presence of Russian troops and volunteers in the city. The situation in the area of Mirny, which is a suburb of Sudzha, as well as at Mikhaylovka remains to be clarified. There is currently no information about the enemy's control over these settlements.There are battles on the outskirts of Korenevo in the Korenevsky district, the enemy does not stop trying to gain a foothold on its outskirts. At the same time, there is no information about the entry of the APU into the settlement itself.In Kremyanoye, the soldiers of the Akhmat Joint Venture, together with the 810th Marine brigade, conducted a sweep of the surrounding area. The footage published online captures the moment of the search of an armored vehicle next to the liquidated members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The enemy lost several more BBMs on the approaches.At the turn of the Cranes — Sheptukhovka — Semenovka, the gradual insertion of maneuverable groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continues further north in the direction of the route to Kromsky Bulls. An AFU tank was destroyed in the Otradnoye area, an enemy armored vehicle position was covered in the forest belt near Semenovka, and a column of armored personnel carriers was hit by drones near Cranes.As for the Belovsky district, judging by objective evidence, the Ukrainian Armed Forces penetrated beyond the state border, although not on the same scale as described earlier. The enemy has pinned down Russian units at the Borka — Sleeping — Kamyshnoye line with battles. At the same time, according to some reports, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation had to retreat from these villages. In the Village of Giryi, a single BTR-4E of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was noted moving in the direction of the settlement of Belitsa. It is not yet known how many pieces of equipment the enemy used in the area. Later, reports began to arrive that allegedly the same armored personnel carrier was taken as a trophy in one of the settlements. It is impossible to reliably confirm this, it is likely that there were several cars. Meanwhile, local authorities announced the evacuation of the population from the area, but such a decision is hardly dictated by the presence of a single enemy armored vehicle.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/37833	2024-08-12T05:01:35-07:00
