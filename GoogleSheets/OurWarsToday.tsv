(AP) — The tails of the Alabama Air National Guard’s F-35 Lightnings are painted red, like those of the Guard’s F-16s before them. It’s an homage to the famed Alabama-based unit of the Tuskegee Airmen, who flew red-tailed P-51 Mustangs during World War II.The squadron, which trained in the state, was the nation’s first to be comprised of Black military pilots, shattering racial barriers and racist beliefs about the capabilities of Black pilots. Their success in combat paved the way for the desegregation of the U.S. military, a story that is interwoven in state and U.S. history. Yet for a moment after President Donald Trump took office, that history was almost scrubbed by the Air Force.The service removed training videos of the Tuskegee Airmen along with ones showing the World War II contributions of the Women’s Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs, at its basic training base in San Antonio, where airmen have passed through for generations.Although the move was swiftly rescinded after a bipartisan outcry, the fact that it happened even momentarily is evidence of the confusion resulting from the avalanche of executive orders and other actions from Trump since he began his second term in the White House.https://apnews.com/article/trump-dei-tuskegee-airmen-women-war-history-88a92c8485281d7c088c5eafe5dbf002AP NewsTrump wants to undo diversity programs. Some agencies react by scrubbing US history and cultureDonald Trump’s efforts to undo diversity, equity and inclusion efforts throughout the federal government have had a trickle-down effect far beyond formal DEI programs.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/41100	2025-03-17T13:55:09-07:00

However, it said fighting was continuing on the outskirts.A Ukrainian military spokesperson declined to comment.Ukraine's top commander denied this week that his forces were being encircled, but said they were taking up better defensive positions.Skadovskyi Defender, a Ukrainian military blogger, posted on Telegram: -Ukraine's Armed Forces are leaving Kursk. There will be no Ukrainian soldier there by Friday.-The same channel said, however, that Ukraine was continuing to conduct heavy strikes on Sudzha.The Russian governor of the region said four civilian employees of a feed mill had been killed northeast of Sudzha on Wednesday.Reuters could not verify the accounts from either side because of reporting restrictions.Independent Russian analyst Ruslan Leviev said the Ukrainian incursion was drawing to a close.-Maybe this story will end today. Maybe they will try to hold the border villages for another couple of days. But overall, the story of the #Kursk bridgehead is coming to an end, and Ukrainian troops are leaving,- he told Dozhd TV.Ukraine agreed on Tuesday to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war, which has dragged on for more than three years. The Kremlin said it needed to be briefed by the U.S. side before it would comment on whether the ceasefire terms were acceptable.- Via https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-verge-losing-kursk-pocket-its-foothold-inside-russia-2025-03-12/---Maps: Suriyak_maps, ISW, RybarFlags held by Russian troops are Wagner PMC flag, Imperial/RIM flag, VDV flag, and Russian tricolor.---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/41034	2025-03-12T08:56:50-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Syrians flee sectarian killing into Lebanon Fearing for their lives, Syrian men, women and children waded through a river to safety in Lebanon on Tuesday, among hundreds of people who have fled to the neighbouring country to escape sectarian killing targeting… 🇸🇾 🇱🇧 Syrians Flee Militant Mass Killings Targeting Alawite Communities, Indiscriminate Slaughter Destroys Families, Nearby Non-Alawite Christians and Others Not Spared: MASOUDIYEH, #Lebanon, March 11 (Reuters) - Fearing for their lives, #Syrian men, women and children waded through a river to safety in Lebanon on Tuesday, among hundreds of people who have fled to the neighbouring country to escape sectarian killing targeting their Alawite community.A woman who made the crossing on Sunday said she'd seen the bodies of seven slain people in her village. Another said she'd spent three days trapped at home by heavy gunfire. A man said militants had threatened to kill all the people in his village because they are members of the minority Alawite community.Days after the killing began in #Syria's coastal region, the steady stream of refugees continued: Reuters reporters saw more than 50 cross the knee-high waters of the Nahr El Kabir River into Lebanon during a half-hour period on Tuesday, carrying children and whatever possessions they could gather.Nada Mohammed, who crossed into Lebanon on Sunday, said her village near the border, Karto, was woken up by a phone call at 4 a.m. from relatives telling her the militants had arrived in the village and she should pack her things.-We saw seven people they slaughtered,- she said.Her daughter, Sally Rajab Abboud, described bearded foreigners with long hair who spoke formal Arabic rather than Syrian dialect.More than 350 families had made the same journey into Lebanon in recent days, according to local #Lebanese authorities, fleeing the violence in which the #UnitedNations human rights office said entire families including women and children had been killed.Violence began to spread through the coastal region, home to many Alawites, on Thursday, when Syria's Sunni Islamist-led government said its forces were attacked by remnants of the regime of Syria's ousted leader Bashar al-Assad, an Alawite.Security forces poured into the region to crush the insurrection, while mosques in areas loyal to the government issued calls for jihad, or holy struggle. During violence that followed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 1,200 civilians were killed, the vast majority of them Alawites.Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Monday promised to punish those responsible, including his own allies if necessary. Sharaa said he could not yet say whether forces from the defence ministry - which has merged former rebels into one structure - were involved in the sectarian killings.Abou Jaafar Sakkour, who fled to Lebanon from the village of Khirbet al-Hamam near the Lebanese border, said militants had threatened to slaughter its residents because they are Alawites, whose faith is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.Some of the militants were Syrian while others were foreign, he said. The attackers had ordered the women to leave the village, and declared that it belonged to them.-What are we guilty of? We want international protection, whether it's #Israel, #Russia, from #France. Anything that will protect us,- Sakkour said.Lebanese from nearby Alawite villages assisted the Syrian refugees as they crossed the river into Lebanon on Tuesday.Lebanon received more than a million Syrian refugees after the eruption of the Syrian conflict in 2011 as people fled Assad's rule.Crossing the river with her two children on Tuesday, a woman said she had fled her home in the city of Tartous after being trapped indoors for three days by heavy gunfire.-We didn’t go out, we didn’t even stand in front of the windows, we shut the curtains, and we didn’t go out at all, all the doors were locked, but we haven’t slept for three nights,- she said, declining to give her name.-There’s fear.- Via: https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrians-flee-sectarian-killing-into-lebanon-2025-03-11/---Telegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/41027	2025-03-11T19:56:51-07:00

Rubio said Russia will receive the ceasefire terms through -multiple channels- for review.-The deadline is we hope to do this as soon as possible,- Rubio said.Last week, the U.S. paused hundreds of millions of dollars in American security assistance to Ukraine and stopped sharing intelligence, with President Donald #Trump claiming Kyiv wasn’t -ready for peace.- The drastic step followed a catastrophic meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr #Zelenskiy in the Oval Office, which devolved into a shouting match.If extended indefinitely, the pause could have sapped Ukraine’s stocks of ammunition while also hindering its ability to target Russian positions. #European officials across the continent reacted to the decision with alarm and have begun multiple rounds of meetings on how they can sustain Ukraine’s self-defense without U.S. assistance.Aside from the ceasefire proposal, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said the U.S and Ukraine also discussed humanitarian concerns and what security guarantees Ukraine is seeking. To this point, Kyiv has sought an American military commitment to enforce any peace deal signed with Russia, which has broken past ceasefires and launched a full-scale invasion three years ago.The Trump administration has been adamant that any security guarantees must come from Europe, part of an overall pivot away from U.S. military support for the continent. European countries have increased military spending in recent years but would still struggle to take on such an expansive role without American aid.Meanwhile, Trump told reporters last week that America would question whether countries in #NATO spent enough on defense before coming to their aid, a core part of the alliance.-If you’re not going to pay your bills, we’re not going to defend you,- Trump said.-Via: https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2025/03/11/us-agrees-to-resume-military-aid-intel-sharing-with-ukraine/📸: Ukrainian soldiers hold posters expressing thanks for U.S. support on the front line near Toretsk, Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Monday March 10th 2025.

Carney is widely expected to trigger an election the coming days or weeks amid Trump’s sweeping tariff threats.Canada ‘didn’t ask for this fight’:-We didn’t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,- Carney said. -The Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.-Carney said Canada will keep its initial retaliatory tariffs in place until -the Americans show us respect.-Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. He helped managed the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K.The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.Canadian nationalism surges:The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving in opinion polls.-The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about it. If they succeed they would destroy our way of life,- Carney said. -In America health care is big business. In Canada it is a right.-Carney said America is -a melting pot. Canada is mosaic,- he said. -America is not Canada. And Canada will never, ever will be a part of America in any way, shape or form.-After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.-These are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,- Carney said. -We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.-Trump has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month, amid widespread fears of a broader trade war. But he has threatened other tariffs on steel, aluminum, dairy and other products.Carney picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.Trudeau previously offered to make him finance minister. Carney has said former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper also offered to make him finance minister.Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.In 2020, he began serving as the United Nations’ special envoy for climate action and finance.–APFull Article---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40991	2025-03-09T22:52:26-07:00

Those employees could be targeted by foreign adversaries for nuclear espionage, and could be vulnerable to approaches since they have lost their source of income, the source said.Elon Musk and SpaceX face at least three federal reviews over whether they have complied with federal reporting rules aimed at protecting national security, the New York Times reported in December.In 2019, the Pentagon reviewed Musk's security clearance after the billionaire smoked marijuana on comedian Joe Rogan's live show. Such reviews ordinarily occur once instances of a potential infraction come to light, Pentagon officials have said. Musk was able to apply for his security clearance to be reinstated, sources said. Musk said on X that he had agreed to do random drug testing for three years.Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The fired USAID specialist with top-secret clearance to work on programs designed to avert conflicts and bolster stability in Southeast Asia and the Middle East said they were terminated without being given the standard exit security briefing or forms to sign.The specialist started at USAID some eight years ago as a contractor before being hired full-time in a civil service position in the Bureau of Conflict Prevention and Stabilization.The worker, terminated on Feb. 24, needed clearance to access classified intelligence reports that helped make -informed strategic decisions- on poverty reduction and humanitarian programs for people who might otherwise be driven to extremism. –Reuters 2/2Full article: https://archive.is/Ii1nR---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtodayarchive.isExclusive: Fired US government workers with top security clearances w…archived 4 Mar 2025 15:02:24 UTC	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40872	2025-03-04T07:17:17-08:00

They would also sign forms acknowledging that disclosing any kind of classified information is illegal and turn in their laptops, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.Two sources with top security clearances dismissed by DOGE, one at the Department of Energy and one former senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development, told Reuters they were not debriefed.Another worker still at the DOE, said several of the 28 workers fired on Feb. 14 at the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear arsenal, had clearances and were not debriefed. The fourth source is a person familiar with the situation at USAID.Both DOE sources said the laptops of fired workers had been cut off from access to department data but that they were not immediately required to hand those in.There were more than 1.25 million U.S. government workers, contractors and others who held top-secret clearances as of October 2019, according to the most recent unclassified report published on the issue by the U.S. Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC).It is not known how many were fired by DOGE without being given the final security debriefing.A DOE spokesperson said the department -is taking the appropriate steps to ensure all recently dismissed Energy employees are reminded of their obligations to the United States as defined by federal law.-The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Kevin Carroll, a former undercover CIA officer who is now a lawyer at Fluet, said the failure to conduct final briefings for U.S. officials holding top-secret clearances was a -terrible counterintelligence risk.--When you get read off the program, they remind you that you agreed to keep information confidential and it would violate the Espionage Act if you don't,- he said.Officials at the briefing also instruct outgoing personnel what to do if approached by a foreign intelligence service and offered money to provide classified material.The U.S. government is on heightened alert about foreign adversaries attempting to steal U.S. data and technology and recruit Americans as spies.-Foreign spies routinely pose as commercial head-hunters on professional networking sites to target individuals for recruitment or information gathering purposes,- NCSC posted on X on Feb. 25.U.S. law enforcement and counterintelligence officials have long said Chinese espionage agencies are using social media accounts to try to recruit Americans with access to government and commercial secrets. –Reuters 1/2Full article: https://archive.is/Ii1nR---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40871	2025-03-04T07:16:15-08:00

This comes following an announcement of 20% tariffs against Chinese imports by the U.S.Imports of #UnitedStates-grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, it said. The tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.Also Tuesday, China added 15 U.S. companies to its unreliable entities list, which could potentially bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.–Associated Press---CNBC: U.S. exports of agricultural products such as soybeans to China account for the largest share of U.S. goods exported to China at 1.2%, or $22.3 billion, as of 2023, according to Allianz Research analysis.---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40858	2025-03-03T23:07:57-08:00
🖼 🇺🇸 ⚠️ 🇨🇳 🇨🇦 🇲🇽 #NEW U.S. Trade War Begun – Tariffs on ...	🇺🇸 ⚠️ 🇨🇳 🇨🇦 🇲🇽 #NEW U.S. Trade War Begun – Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, Take Effect: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald #Trump’s long-threatened tariffs against #Canada and Mexico finally went into effect Tuesday, putting global markets on edge and setting up costly retaliations by the #UnitedStates’ North American allies.Starting just past midnight, imports from Canada and #Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products getting tariffed at 10%. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February is doubling to 20%.In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin #Trudeau said his country would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. Mexico and #China didn’t immediately detail any retaliatory measures.The U.S. president’s moves raised fears of higher inflation and the prospect of a devastating trade war even as he promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity. He has shown a willingness to buck the warnings of mainstream economists and put his own public approval on the line, believing that tariffs can fix what ails the country.-It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,- Trump said Monday at the White House. -And now we’re using them.-The Canada and Mexico tariffs were originally supposed to begin in February, but Trump agreed to a 30-day suspension to negotiate further with the two largest U.S. trading partners. The stated reason for the tariffs is to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and both countries say they’ve made progress on those issues. But Trump has also said the tariffs will only come down if the U.S. trade imbalance closes, a process unlikely to be settled on a political timeline.There is the possibility of the tariffs being short-lived if the U.S. economy suffers, just as there is the possibility of more tariffs to come on the European Union, India, computer chips, autos and pharmaceutical drugs, as Trump has promised. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he’ll do next.-It’s chaotic, especially compared to the way we saw tariffs rolled out in the first (Trump) administration,- said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. -It’s unpredictable. We don’t know, in fact, what the president will do.’’To resolve the tariffs being imposed Tuesday, the White House would like to see a drop in the seizures of fentanyl inside the United States, not just on the northern and southern borders. Administration officials say that seizures of fentanyl last month in everywhere from Louisiana to New Jersey had ties to foreign cartels.Damon Pike, technical practice leader for customs and trade services at the tax and consulting firm BDO, suggested that how other countries respond to the tariffs with their own import taxes could escalate the tensions and possibly increase the economic pain points.-Canada has their list ready,- Pike said. -The EU has their list ready. It’s going to be tit for tat.’’The Trump administration has suggested that inflation will not be as bad as economists claim, saying that tariffs give a reason for foreign companies to open factories in the United States. On Monday, Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the computer chipmaker, would be investing $100 billion in domestic production.Still, it can take time to relocate factories spread across the world and train workers with the skills they need.The world economy is now caught in the fog of what appears to be a trade war.–Associated Press Full article and details: https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-643086a6dc7ff716d876b3c83e3255b0---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40853	2025-03-03T22:46:16-08:00

This strike in particular was carried out on February 23 and killed senior Hurr@s al-D!n (HaD) leader Muhammed Yusuf Ziya Talay in #Idlib, #Syria.Dubbed the -flying ginsu- or -ninja bomb,- the R9X is a modified AGM-114 Hellfire missile retrofitted with six metal blades that deploy outwards moments before impact. The R9X does not use the typical 20 lb. explosive payload of a regular Hellfire, but rather utilizes kinetic energy to destroy its target. The force generated by the missile not only crushes its target, but the blades completely eviscerate whatever is below.The use of kinetic energy also reduces the risk of unintended civilian casualties and collateral damage, which is why the weapon has been increasingly used on high value targets in densely populated urban areas where conventional explosives would not be a viable option. R9X deployments in Syria have historically targeted militants of HaD, an AQ affiliate.- Via instagram.com/the.war.blog	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40817	2025-03-01T20:09:21-08:00

Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.-- Via Instagram.com/the.war.blog---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40788	2025-02-28T15:09:25-08:00

Approximately $4 trillion of that cost comes from the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.⁠ Trump argues that his tax cuts will not be this costly as they will stimulate economic growth and, as a result, increase government revenue. ⁠⁠The legislation proposes $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next ten years to fund tax reductions along with other aspects of Trump’s agenda, including increased military and immigration enforcement spending. ⁠⁠While the budget does not explicitly mention Medicaid, it directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in reductions, potentially affecting eligibility and benefits for the over 20% of #American citizens who rely on the program. Trump assured that -Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched,- but critics argue that such deep budget cuts will be difficult to achieve without impacting major social programs. ⁠⁠Democrats opposed the bill, calling it a tax break for the wealthy that could shift financial burdens onto lower-income Americans.⁠⁠With House approval secured, the bill now moves to the Senate, where it must be reconciled with a separate budget proposal. Negotiations between the Senate and House are ongoing, and the compromise bill between the two chambers will likely have major differences from this current House bill.⁠-–Ground News---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40770	2025-02-27T14:09:05-08:00

This is Russian, and this is Ukrainian.’ This will not happen. We have a Constitution based on the will of the people,- Lavrov said at a press conference, referring to Moscow’s illegal referendums in Ukraine.In late 2022, #Russia announced the annexation of Ukraine’s #Donetsk, #Luhansk, #Kherson and #Zaporizhzhia regions after holding what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine. #Kyiv and Western governments said the votes breached international law and ruled them as illegitimate and non-representative.At present, Russia controls almost the entirety of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and the majority of the Donetsk region.During his speech, Lavrov once again rejected notions of Western troop deployments to Ukraine as part of security guarantees and called for the so-called -root causes- of the invasion to be addressed.-There are also people who remain there who find it more convenient to speak Russian, who want to preserve the traditions of their ancestors, who were brought up in Russian culture. Therefore, such simple mechanical things as the deployment of [foreign] troops will not do – we need to talk about the root causes,- Lavrov added.Russia has been attempting to justify its Ukraine invasion by claiming to protect Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine, a claim that is largely unfounded.At Monday’s UN General Assembly, Russia attempted to request an amendment to a UN draft resolution by adding a clause to address the so-called -root cause- of the invasion that was ultimately rejected.-Via: https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47871 ---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40762	2025-02-26T13:36:46-08:00

Conflict Resolution:The #UnitedNations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning #Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the U.S. among 18 countries opposing it. The measure, titled -Advancing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in #Ukraine,- received 93 votes in favor and 65 abstentions, including from China. Ukraine’s European allies supported the resolution, which is non-binding but signals a shift in U.S. policy under the #Trump administration toward improving relations with Russia.⁠⁠Trump has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr #Zelenskiy for the war, calling him a -dictator without elections.- His administration’s diplomats have avoided directly criticizing Russian President Vladimir #Putin, widening a divide within the Republican Party. Meanwhile, the #UnitedStates introduced a competing resolution, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating it aligns with Trump’s view that the U.N. should focus on maintaining peace through diplomatic settlement rather than punitive resolutions.⁠⁠Ambassador Dorothy Shea, a Biden appointee, argued that past resolutions have failed to stop the war. She urged all member states, including Ukraine and Russia, to back the U.S. proposal, which she described as a -historic statement- focused on ending the conflict. The confirmation of Trump’s nominee for U.N. ambassador, Rep. Elise Stefanik, remains stalled in the Senate due to Democratic opposition to the administration’s policy shifts.⁠⁠Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, escalating a conflict that began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and support for separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. The invasion triggered widespread international sanctions against Moscow and military aid to Kyiv from Western nations. ⁠–Ground News - instagran.com/groundnews---Tees: our-wars-today.teemill.comTelegram: t.me/ourwarstoday More: linktr.ee/ourwarstoday---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40730	2025-02-24T15:26:21-08:00

↩️🖼 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — #Russia launched more strike ...	Our Wars, Today: Russia launches a record number of drones into Ukraine on the eve of the war's 3-year anniversary Russia has launched a record number of drones into Ukraine on the eve of the three-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion. t.me/ourwarstoday – t.m… 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — #Russia launched more strike drones into #Ukraine overnight on Saturday than in any other single attack of the war, Ukrainian President #Zelenskiy said on Sunday, one day before the three-year anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion.Writing on social media, Zelenskyy said 267 strike drones had been sent in what he called -the largest attack since Iranian drones began hitting Ukrainian cities and villages.- Ukraine’s air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets.Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in a missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration.The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.Ukraine fears Trump’s policy shift toward Putin:#Trump’s engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy which had previously sought to isolate Russia and its president, Vladimir #Putin, over the war.Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelenskyy was acting as a -dictator- since the country has not held elections in accordance with Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law.Russia’s deputy foreign minister on Saturday said preparations were underway for a Trump-Putin meeting, a further sign that the Russian leader’s isolation, at least for the Trump administration, was beginning to thaw.Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, however, Andrii Sybiha‎, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the overnight strikes against civilian and military targets -demonstrates that avoiding calling Russia an aggressor does not change the fact that it is one.--No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead,- Sybiha‎ said in a statement on social media.Putin praises soldiers fighting in Ukraine:Zelenskyy and other officials will participate in a forum in Kyiv on Sunday where they will discuss the state of the country a day before the war reaches its three-year mark. Zelenskyy will conclude the forum with a news conference.The forum comes at a sensitive moment for Kyiv as Trump’s administration pushes Ukraine’s leaders to agree to a deal that would allow the U.S. to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal Zelenskyy earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees.-We must do our utmost to bring a lasting and just peace to Ukraine,- Zelenskyy wrote on social media on Sunday. -This is possible with the unity of all partners — we need the strength of all of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all who want a reliable peace.-Meanwhile, Putin in a special televised message Sunday praised Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine for defending -their native land, the national interests and the future of Russia.-Putin’s speech marked Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day, which falls a day before the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. He used the holiday greeting to pledge greater social support for military personnel and new weapons and equipment for Russian forces.–APRead more: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-anniversary-putin-trump-c8f73a98d071055be52a1b22b0785ecc---Telegram: t.me/ourwarstoday ---24/7 LIVE News RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/40713	2025-02-23T06:32:04-08:00
