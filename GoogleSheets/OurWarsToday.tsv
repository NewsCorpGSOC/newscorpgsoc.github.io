Among the 17 people who died in Georgia was a mother and her 1-month-old twin boys, a 7-year-old boy and 4-year-old girl, and a 58-year-old man, according… On Friday, Stevie Hollander watched as floodwaters inundated his Asheville apartment complex, where he lives on the second floor with his sister and her fiancé.-The water almost reached us but thankfully went down,- he told CNN. Most residents on the first floor left before their units were submerged, while other relocated to stay with residents on higher floors.-We all really need help here. We need water, power of sorts, food, gas. Anything.- he said, -We just don’t really know what to do.-Hollander and his family attempted to drive north Saturday, but road closures forced them to return to the apartment. The family only has four water bottles left and little nonperishable food, Hollander said.In Black Mountain, North Carolina, Sofia Grace Kunst contended with another problem: a landslide she said tore through the window and wall of a dining hall where she was playing Uno with six friends while on a weeklong trip.It was exactly 9:10 a.m. Friday when mud and debris shattered a window and poured into the room, she said.Landslide! Everybody run,- someone yelled.-I see this giant wave of like mud and trees and rocks just coming towards us,- Kunst told CNN, estimating it was 5 or 6 feet high.She ran into the main room of the dining hall, only to see the wall completely cave in. The group fled to the porch, where many of her peers were crying. Kunst sat in shock, barefoot.It was only then she realized she still had her Uno cards in hand.The group eventually trekked through muddy water, seeking refuge in a parking lot on higher ground. They were stranded there for some time, but eventually reached a shelter.-That’s when it hit most people. There were a lot of tears,- Kunst said. -For me, it really didn’t hit me emotionally, but my body started reacting. I started shaking like crazy. I felt like I had to, like, scream or let off energy,- Kunst said.As day broke Saturday, Patrick McNamara, who runs a small milk distribution business in Asheville, got his first glimpse at the destruction left by Helene.-The floodwaters were 4 feet above the dock,- McNamara said. -So the entire building has been wiped out.-His business machinery was strewn across the warehouse, milk spoiled and inches of mud pilled all over the floor. McNamara estimates he’ll have to get rid of thousands of gallons of milk.McNamara, concerned about access to resources, said he may have to consider relocating the business to another facility.As he begins a lengthy cleanup process, McNamara said he is confident the community will be able to patch itself together and have a successful tourist season despite the devastation. @ourwarstodayPhotos: AP	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38974	2024-09-29T15:13:28-07:00

Brian Kemp said Saturday. Among the 17 people who died in Georgia was a mother and her 1-month-old twin boys, a 7-year-old boy and 4-year-old girl, and a 58-year-old man, according to Kemp. -It looks like a tornado went off, it looks like a bomb went off,- Kemp said.• South Carolina ‘devastated’ by Helene: The National Weather Service Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, said Saturday it is -devastated by the horrific flooding and widespread wind damage that was caused by Hurricane Helene.- The agency called it -the worst event in our office’s history,- in a Facebook post Saturday evening.• ‘Complete obliteration’ along Florida coast: Days after Helene slammed Florida on Thursday night as a Category 4 hurricane, countless residents are displaced, boil water notices are in place in multiple counties and power is out for over 230,000 customers. -You see some just complete obliteration for homes,- DeSantis said Saturday, noting Helene impacted some of the same communities affected by hurricanes Idalia last year and Debby last month.‘We all really need help here’Since Helene started swamping the region, it’s turned neighborhoods into lakes, lifted cars like toys, snapped trees like twigs and left businesses underwater. Piles of thick mud and floating debris blocked streets as torrential rains collapsed roadways and washed out bridges. It’s left hundreds of people in North Carolina stranded in homes, hospitals or transportation systems, awaiting rescue.-The priority is getting people out,- North Carolina Gov. Cooper told CNN affiliate Spectrum News. -And getting supplies in.-But officials face a major hurdle: -Everything is flooded. It is very difficult for them to see exactly what the problems are,- Cooper said. @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38973	2024-09-29T15:13:04-07:00

In hard-hit North Carolina, days of unrelenting flooding have turned roads into waterways, left many without basic necessities and strained state resources reports CNN. More than 60 dead across 5 states: Deaths have been reported in #SouthCarolina, #Georgia, Florida, #NorthCarolina and #Virginia. At least 11 people are dead in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said Sunday. At least 23 are dead in South Carolina, including two firefighters in Saluda County, authorities said. In Georgia, at least 17 people have died, two of them killed by a tornado in Alamo, according to a spokesperson for Gov. Brian Kemp. In Florida, at least 11 people have died, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday, including several people who drowned in Pinellas County. One person died in Craig County, Virginia, in a storm-related tree fall and building collapse, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Friday.Scores of missing persons reports filed amid water outages: Officials in Buncombe County, North Carolina, have received more than a thousand missing persons reports through an online form, County Manager Avril Pinder said Sunday, cautioning that figure likely includes duplicate submissions and that communications outages mean people are struggling to reach one another. But authorities remain unable to perform wellness checks. -We’re still trying to save every single person we can,- said Pinder, who a day earlier referred to Helene as the county’s -own Hurricane Katrina.- In the meantime, the city of Weaverville has no water and no power, according to Mayor Patrick Fitzsimmons, after a water plant was inundated by 8 feet of water. The county, which includes Asheville, has been anticipating -several tractor trailer loads off water,- but those deliveries were delayed, Pinder said. FEMA has sent bottled water to North Carolina, Administrator Deanne Criswell told CBS News on Sunday.Hundreds of roads closed in the Carolinas: About 300 roads are closed in North Carolina and another 150 are closed in South Carolina, acting Federal Highway Administrator Kristin White of the US Department of Transportation said Sunday. Access to clean drinking water is another problem: Seven water plants across North Carolina – in Avery, Burke, Haywood, Jackson, Rutherford, Watauga and Yancey counties – are closed, impacting nearly 70,000 households, Gov. Cooper’s office said Saturday. Seventeen water plants reported having no power. There are 50 boil water advisories in effect across western communities.Millions without power in Southeast: The remnants of Helene continued to knock out power for several states across the eastern US on Saturday, with about 2.5 million customers left in the dark in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us. On Sunday, a US Department of Energy spokesperson said there was no estimated timeframe for the restoration of power, saying widespread flooding and debris has impeded access to damaged infrastructure. @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38972	2024-09-29T15:12:34-07:00

Supreme Leader of #Iran Khamenei reportedly -moved to safety- according to regional officials. @ourwarstoday Tribune India: Iran announced on Saturday that a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sanctioned by the #UnitedStates also died in the Israeli airstrike that killed #Hezbollah leader Hassan #Nasrallah in Beirut.Ali Khamenei Abbas Nilforushan, 58, was killed on Friday in #Lebanon, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The U.S. Treasury had identified Nilforushan as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard. It had sanctioned him in 2022 and said he had led an organisation -directly in charge of protest suppression, which has played a critical role in arresting protest leaders during previous protests-.Those sanctions came amid months-long protests over the death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police.Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar #Assad in his country’s decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring that swept the wider Middle East. He served in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s like many of his colleagues.Meanwhile, Iran Air cancelled all flights to Beirut until further notice, the airline’s spokesman told local media, including the Tasnim news agency, on Saturday.In 2020, Iranian state television called him -comrade- of Gen Qassem #Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in 2020 US drone attack in Baghdad. In 2021, Nilforushan told state TV that #Israel was not in a capacity to pose a threat against Iran over what he described as Israel’s weakness. Meanwhile, two regional officials briefed by Tehran said Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali #Khamenei had been transferred to a secure location inside the country, with heightened security measures in place. The sources said Iran was in constant contact with Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other regional proxy groups to determine the next step after Nasrallah’s killing.Via: https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/top-iran-commander-among-casualties-in-beirut-strike-khamenei-moved-to-safety/---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38969	2024-09-28T22:59:04-07:00

If a ground operation happens, its scope will likely be limited, sources said. The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home. To do that, decapitating Hezbollah is not enough, the officials said.U.S. officials received a -few minutes notice- at best, before Hassan Nasrallah's assassination on Friday, the officials said.In response to reports that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin blew up when Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed him about Nasrallah, the officials said, -We do bear a lot of risks- in the region, and their people were not given a lot of notice to prepare for possible hostile responses to the assassination, which did not please U.S. officials.One of the officials noted that there is tolerance right now and that U.S. -interests in the region could be badly harmed- if U.S. officials lose their contacts with the Israelis.The sources said Nasrallah, until the very end, had demanded a Hezbollah ceasefire be tied to a #Gaza cease-fire.Diplomacy remains the only viable long-term solution, even if a military campaign sets the stage for it, officials said.

Karaki had survived another Israeli assassination attempt days earlier.Israeli officials and Iranian media reports also said Iranian Brigadier Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guard commander in Lebanon, was killed. Tehran has not confirmed that.In an operation codenamed -New Order,- the IDF dropped dozens of 2000-lb. bunker-buster bombs on Hezbollah central headquarters, which it said was located in an underground bunker below a compound of six residential buildings in southern Beirut.Lebanon's health ministry said at least six people were killed and 91 wounded in the massive strike, which leveled multiple large apartment buildings. That toll is likely to increase.More than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon as 11 days of intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated into war.The White House had been pushing for an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire prior to the Israeli strike, and President Biden and other top officials denied an Israeli claim that they were notified prior to the attack. IDF Chief of Staff Gen. Herzi Halevi said Nasrallah's killing -is not the end of our toolbox. The message is simple: anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel — we will know how to reach them.-Nasrallah was appointed Hezbollah leader in 1992 at just 32, and over three decades turned his militia into a formidable military and political force. Nasrallah became a kingmaker in Lebanon with effective veto power over senior political appointments.Hezbollah also extended its regional influence, sending thousands of fighters to Syria to help save President Bashar al-Assad's regime, to Iraq to fight with Shia militias, and to Yemen to fight alongside the Houthis and against Saudi Arabia.Under Nasrallah, Iran armed Hezbollah with sophisticated weapons including rockets, missiles and drones, making the militia a larger and better equipped military than many controlled by nation states. Nasrallah's close ties to Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, make it likely that Iran will seek to retaliate, particularly if an Iranian general is confirmed to have been killed alongside him.One potential successor for Nasrallah is Hashim Safi al-Din, who heads Hezbollah's executive council. It's unclear if he was in the bunker during the Israeli attack. –Axios---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38954	2024-09-28T06:32:27-07:00

The biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war. At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon’s health ministry said.Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes on the group’s headquarters, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity, including one U.S. official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams are still combing through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon’s national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Beirut.Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000 pound American-made -Bunker Buster- guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign since Monday has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children at least over a hundred total, and wounded over 1,835, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was -in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.- The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman suffered mild shrapnel wounds.The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes around the south of Lebanon Friday, targeting targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias.In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women – 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan – from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.Full article: https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-suburb-617575d9c5d7c711bc02e7b81d2ba4ad---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38946	2024-09-27T18:29:56-07:00

Our Wars, Today: More deadly than wind, storm surge from Hurricane Helene could be devastating Storm surge is a bigger killer than wind when a major hurricane hits shore. The areas in the path of Hurricane Helene are more susceptible to surge than other parts of Florida's… 🇺🇸 🌀 Helene will make landfall on Thursday evening along #Florida’s Big Bend coast and is expected to be the worst storm to ever hit the region. Currently a Category 4 hurricane with 130-mile-per-hour winds, the storm had already brought heavy rainfall and flooding to parts of the #UnitedStates state as of Thursday morning reported the New York Times. @ourwarstoday Many residents of the region, even hardened veterans of Florida hurricanes, have chosen to evacuate, leaving some areas deserted.In his 58 years, John Posey, a lifelong resident of the Forgotten Coast of Florida on the remote eastern edge of the Panhandle, had never evacuated for a hurricane — neither for Dennis in 2005, nor for Michael in 2018.But on Wednesday, as he stood outside his namesake seafood restaurant in Panacea, Fla., a community of about 800 near the marshy shores of Ochlockonee Bay, Mr. Posey admitted that this hurricane felt different. Helene was closing in and, for the first time, he wasn’t sure he could stay.Across Florida’s Big Bend region, which has already endured two other hurricanes in 13 months, many more people appeared to be heeding evacuation orders this time, leaving the small towns that dot the coast eerily empty on Thursday.That was especially true in three rural counties that had taken the rare step of ordering mandatory countywide evacuations. Homes and businesses in Wakulla County, where Panacea is, were boarded up. In Crawfordville, even the local Waffle House was covered with plywood.The Florida National Guard arrived on Thursday morning in Cedar Key, a tiny city that sits on a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico, to alert the remaining residents about the approaching danger.-In the last storm here, people would walk by us with beer and we’d say, ‘There’s a hurricane here,’- Capt. John Meacham said. -They’d say, ‘We’ll stick it out.’-He noticed fewer such people on Thursday.John MacDonald, the director of emergency management for Levy County, which includes Cedar Key, said he had hoped to see more residents in emergency shelters. -But I know some people seek shelter with family or somewhere else,- he added.Capt. Jeff Yarbrough, a spokesman for the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office, said deputies had been thorough in going door to door beginning on Wednesday to urge people to get out, especially if they live south of U.S. 98, which runs parallel to the Gulf Coast.-The conditions for our county are pretty severe, more so than we’ve had in recent memory,- he said. Perhaps 200 people whom deputies had contacted in the county of about 35,000 said they planned to stay, he estimated early on Thursday afternoon.To the southeast in Steinhatchee, a fishing town of a few hundred people, Tyler Rayborn, 31, bluntly summarized the feel of the place as he worked with a friend to anchor down the sign for his family’s hardware store: -It’s dead. Town’s dead.-However, not everyone was planning to leave, Mr. Rayborn said, including himself. He said he would stay at his home, a short drive inland, before heading back to reopen as soon as possible so people could get supplies.Many who own homes in the small community are relatively new to the state, he said, and spooked by the threat of the storm.-Us, born and raised, we just stay here,- said Mr. Rayborn, who had a University of Florida alligator tattoo and an elaborate artistic sketch of the state visible on his left arm. -There’s nowhere for us to go.-A little bit further north, near Keaton Beach, Donna and Greg Staab sat on their porch on Thursday morning enjoying a cool breeze. They planned to head for a neighbor’s homemade bunker in the afternoon.-We’re just hoping for the best, that’s all you can do at this point,- Ms. Staab said. -Just stay and pray.-Further south, near Tampa Bay, which is far from Hurricane Helene’s winds but was already experiencing storm surge on Thursday, some residents accustomed to street flooding said they would stay. –NYT---RSS feed: t.me/ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38911	2024-09-26T17:36:55-07:00

🖼 🇺🇸 ⚠️ 🌀 #Hurricane Helene has strengthened into a Category ...	🇺🇸 ⚠️ 🌀 #Hurricane Helene has strengthened into a Category 2 storm with -significant additional strengthening expected- before it arrives along #Florida's Gulf Coast late Thursday night, the #UnitedStates National Hurricane Center said. @ourwarstoday The NHC said in its 8 a.m. ET advisory Thursday that -preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion- in Florida Thursday in anticipation of the storm's arrival reports USA Today.As of Thursday morning, Helene was located about 320 miles southwest of #Tampa, Florida and was moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph, according to the hurricane center. This motion is expected to continue with a -significant increase in forward speed- during the next 24 hours.Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph with higher gusts, the NHC said, and with additional strengthening forecast, Helene is expected to be a major hurricane upon its arrival in Florida's Big Bend coast.Helene is forecast to move across the eastern #GulfofMexico Thursday and across the Florida Big Bend coast Thursday evening or early Friday morning, according to the NHC. Around 8-12 inches of rain are expected where Helene makes landfall with some isolated areas possibly facing 2 feet of rain, according to AccuWeather.After landfall, the storm is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the #Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.-Weakening is expected after landfall, but Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians,- the center said in the advisory Thursday morning. Helene's path includes urban areas like #Tallahassee, Florida, and #Atlanta, #Georgia, as well as Asheville, #NorthCarolina, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.---BBC reported that: -The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the hurricane was expected to strengthen rapidly, threatening to unleash catastrophic winds and storm surge to the north-eastern Gulf Coast.Hurricanes need sea surface temperatures of more than 27C (80F) to fuel them. With exceptionally warm waters of the Gulf at 30-32C (86-89F), the sea surface is about two degrees Celsius above normal for the time of year.This will supercharge Helene's development and bring about what meteorologists call -rapid intensification-.The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee said surges caused by the storm could reach a height of up to 6m (20ft) in Apalachee Bay in Florida. It described these potential surges as -catastrophic and unsurvivable- for anyone caught in them. Storm surges can also be life-threatening further inland, when floodwaters move inland from the coastline.At a news conference, the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, also warned residents to be prepared.-We have no more time left to wait,- Mayor John Dailey said. -We urge you to stay weather aware as we’re on the verge of what could be… a historic event.-----Winds of over 300 miles per hour, and an estimated massive storm surge of 15-20 feet, make this Hurricanes' potentiality for death and destruction great.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38903	2024-09-26T06:42:01-07:00

The contents of that package are still in flux, the officials said.Reuters&nbsp;reported this month&nbsp;that the Biden administration was considering a backup plan under which it would announce plans for shipments for Ukraine, but with an extended delivery timeline for the weapons and equipment, allowing for a more gradual transfer of resources to Ukraine without missing the Sept. 30 deadline.A second announcement slated for Thursday will be for $2.4 billion worth of aid under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative program, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from U.S. stocks.That aid will include munitions, weapons to combat drones and material to support munitions production in Ukraine, one of the U.S. officials said.In addition, the U.S. announced on Wednesday $375 million worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine. The package will include the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb with a range of up to 81 miles (130 km) called the Joint Standoff Weapon, two U.S. officials said. The inclusion of that weapon was not disclosed in the announcement.The package, which&nbsp;Reuters first reported&nbsp;on last week, includes patrol boats, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, spare parts and other weapons.The Joint Standoff Weapon would be dropped from fighter jets, and is capable of striking targets with high accuracy. Ukraine has been largely prohibited from using U.S.-supplied weapons in strikes into Russia.Presidential Drawdown Authority allows the president to draw from current weapons stocks to help allies in an emergency. In August, as Ukraine was pressing an incursion into Russia and losing territory in its east to Russian advances, Washington announced two packages, both for $125 million each.Congress has approved nearly $175 billion of aid and military assistance for Ukraine and allied nations in the 2-1/2 years since Russia's full-scale invasion, and many lawmakers say they expect Washington will need to approve more money to help the government in #Kyiv in the next several months.U.S. companies that might benefit from increased weapons shipments to Ukraine include arms makers like RTX&nbsp;(RTX.N), Lockheed Martin&nbsp;(LMT.N), General Dynamics&nbsp;(GD.N), and Northrop Grumman&nbsp;(NOC.N).Via: https://www.reuters.com/world/us-prepares-8-billion-arms-aid-packages-zelenskiy-visit-sources-say-2024-09-25/---RSS feed: t.me/ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38897	2024-09-25T23:46:56-07:00

The Israeli military warned residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of its widening air campaign against Hezbollah.Thousands of #Lebanese fled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading toward Beirut in the biggest exodus since 2006.Lebanon’s health ministry said the strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 people — a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.In a recorded message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate, saying -take this warning seriously.--Please get out of harm’s way now,- Netanyahu said. -Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.-Israel’s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army will do -whatever is necessary- to push Hezbollah from Lebanon’s border with Israel.Hagari claimed Monday’s widespread airstrikes had inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah. But he would not give a timeline for the ongoing operation and said Israel was prepared to launch a ground invasion of Lebanon if needed.Hagari said Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 rockets and drones into Israel since last October, including 250 on Monday alone.The military spokesman said Israeli warplanes struck 1,300 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones. He said many were hidden in residential areas, showing photos of what he said were weapons hidden in private homes.-Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a war zone,- he told a news conference.Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.Earlier Monday evening, the Israeli military said it had carried out a targeted strike in Beirut. It did not give details. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported three missiles hit southern Beirut’s Beir al-Abed neighborhood. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said six people were wounded.Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said the earlier strikes hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for the displaced.Some strikes hit residential areas in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos, more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border north of Beirut.Israel said it was expanding the airstrikes to include areas of the valley along Lebanon’s eastern border with Syria. Hezbollah has long had an established presence in the valley, where the group was founded in 1982 with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.-Full article: https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-lebanon-hezbollah-e3ca9c83642056f962fdf76319e3b8de---RSS feed: @ournewsfeedtoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38839	2024-09-23T15:28:58-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank Israeli troops have raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, ordering the bureau to shut down. t.me/ourwarstoday JON GAMBRELL… 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 AJ: -#Israeli forces have raided Al Jazeera’s offices in Ramallah in the occupied #WestBank, #Palestine, and imposed a 45-day closure, in the latest push to curtail the news network’s coverage. @ourwarstoday Heavily armed and masked Israeli soldiers entered the building and handed the closure order to the network’s West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari early on Sunday. They did not provide a reason for the decision.-There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,- a soldier told al-Omari as Al Jazeera Arabic broadcast the conversation live on television.-I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment,- the soldier said in Arabic.Sunday’s raid comes just months after the Israeli government banned Al Jazeera from operating inside Israel in May.That initial closure order was also for 45 days, but it has been renewed and Al Jazeera journalists are still unable to report from inside the country.Speaking over the phone from Ramallah on Sunday, Al Jazeera’s correspondent Nida Ibrahim said the West Bank raid and closure order -comes as no surprise- after the earlier ban on reporting from inside Israel.-We’ve heard Israeli officials threatening to close down the bureau. We’ve heard the government discussing this, asking the military ruler in the occupied West Bank to close down and shut down the channel. But we [had] not been expecting it to happen today,- Ibrahim said.After the raid, al-Omari – the bureau chief – raised concerns about what Israeli soldiers may do to the office.-Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,- he said.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38713	2024-09-21T19:56:56-07:00

The crew was not injured.-This event represents an unprecedented escalation of Russia's illegal and unjustified war against #Ukraine,- the ministry's statement read.-Deliberately attacking a cargo ship is a serious violation of international humanitarian legal norms governing the conduct of war at sea.-Bucharest also condemned Russia's violations of the U.N. Charter through the -systematic and irresponsible bombing of Ukrainian infrastructure and grain-carrying ships,- adding these attacks -threaten global food security.-The incident comes as another sign of Russia's war against Ukraine spilling over to NATO territory. Romanian authorities have repeatedly uncovered drone wreckage on its soil following Russia's mass attack against Ukrainian Danube ports, lying in the vicinity of the Romanian border.While #Bucharest said it sees no intent behind Russian drones crashing on Romanian territory, it presented the Russian attack against the vessel as deliberate.The attack on the ship marked the first missile strike on a civilian vessel transporting grain through the #BlackSea since the start of the full-scale invasion. Some vessels have been previously damaged by mines or while moored in Ukrainian ports.President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is one of the key global contributors to food security and that the Ukrainian government will continue to do -everything possible- to protect Ukrainian ports and supply food to the global market.-We are waiting for the world's reaction. Wheat and food security should never be a target for missiles,- the president added.Ukraine has exported over 64 million metric tons of goods to 46 countries since the temporary Black Sea corridor began operating, according to the Infrastructure Ministry.-Ensuring the safety and sustainability of agricultural exports passing through the Black Sea remains critical for supporting global food security and keeping global prices under control,- U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.----In response the #Kremlin has feigned ignorance: -The Kremlin is not familiar with accusations from Kyiv that Russia allegedly attacked a grain ship in the Black Sea,- Russian state-owned TASS news outlet quoted Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov as saying.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38394	2024-09-13T07:20:11-07:00

Vadym Filashkin said.The previous day, Russians destroyed a natural gas distribution station near Pokrovsk, Filashkin said. Some 18,000 people remain in the city, including 522 children, he said. More than 20,000 people have left in the past six weeks as Russian forces creep closer to residential areas, Filashkin said.-Evacuation is the only … choice for civilians,- he added.Pokrovsk is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region, which lies on part of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defensive abilities and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated goal of capturing the entire Donetsk region, which it partially occupies.Russian troops backed by artillery and powerful glide bombs have turned Donetsk cities and towns such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka into bombed-out shells, though the push has cost Russia heavily in troops and armor.The United States and Britain pledged nearly $1.5 billion in additional aid to Ukraine on Wednesday during a visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats. Much of that will go to restoring the electricity supply.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, -we’re again seeing Putin dust off his winter playbook, targeting Ukrainian energy and electricity systems to weaponize the cold against the Ukrainian people.-Russia launched a total of 64 Shahed drones and five missiles over eastern, central, and northern regions of Ukraine, Ukraine’s air force said in its Thursday morning report.Notably on Tuesday, over 140 Ukrainian drones targeted multiple Russian regions overnight, including Moscow and surrounding areas, killing at least one person and injuring eight, officials said, in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russian soil of the past two and half years of #Russia's invasion war of #Ukraine.- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38389	2024-09-12T06:59:21-07:00

Stan Honda snapped this photo of her shrouded in dust shorty after the collapse of the second tower, and her likeness was widely circulated in papers and magazines around the world.Borders would die of stomach cancer in 2015 at the age of 42. Her cancer was directly tied to toxic chemical exposure in the WTC’s debris cloud.

🇺🇸 🇷🇺 Conservative Commenters Duped by #Russia, Says Departme...	🇺🇸 🇷🇺 Conservative Commenters Duped by #Russia, Says Department of Justice: @ourwarstoday -NEW YORK (AP) — They have millions of followers online. They have been major players in right-wing political discourse since Donald Trump was president. And they worked unknowingly for a company that was a front for a Russian influence operation, #UnitedStates DOJ prosecutors say.An indictment filed Wednesday alleges a media company linked to six conservative influencers — including well-known personalities Tim Pool, Dave Rubin and Benny Johnson — was secretly funded by Russian state media employees to churn out English-language videos that were -often consistent- with the Kremlin’s -interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition- to Russian interests, like its war in Ukraine.In addition to marking the third straight presidential election in which U.S. authorities have unveiled politically charged details about Russia’s attempted interference in U.S. politics, an indictment indicates how Moscow may be attempting to capitalize on the skyrocketing popularity of right-wing podcasters, livestreamers and other content creators who have found successful careers on social media in the years since Trump was in office.The U.S. Justice Department doesn’t allege any wrongdoing by the influencers, some of whom it says were given false information about the source of the company’s funding. Instead, it accuses two employees of RT, a Russian state media company, of funneling nearly $10 million to a Tennessee-based content creation company for Russia-friendly content.After the indictments were announced, both Pool and Johnson issued statements on social media, which Rubin retweeted, saying they were victims of the alleged crimes and had done nothing wrong.-We still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,- Pool said. -Putin is a scumbag.-In his post, Johnson wrote that he had been asked a year ago to provide content to a -media startup.- He said his lawyers negotiated a -standard, arms length deal, which was later terminated.-Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are at large, and it was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.Though the indictment does not name the Tennessee-based company, the details match up exactly with Tenet Media, an online media company that boasts of hosting -a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.- Tenet’s website lists six influencers who provide content, including Pool, Johnson, Rubin, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen and Matt Christiansen.Tenet Media’s six main influencers have more than 7 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 7 million followers on X.The indictment shows that some of the influencers were paid handsomely for their work. One unidentified influencer’s contract included a $400,000 monthly fee, a $100,000 signing bonus and an additional performance bonus.Tenet Media’s shows in recent months have featured high-profile conservative guests, including Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake. The nearly 2,000 videos posted by the company have gotten more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, prosecutors said.-Full article and details: https://apnews.com/article/russian-interference-presidential-election-influencers-trump-999435273dd39edf7468c6aa34fad5ddAP NewsRight-wing influencers were duped to work for covert Russian influence operation, US saysNew U.S. charges allege that a media company linked to six conservative influencers was a front for a Russian influence operation.

Via Reuters @ourwarstoday Photographs posted on social media showed several bodies lying on the ground covered in dust and debris, with the badly damaged side of a large building behind them. Reuters could not immediately verify the images.-The Russian scum will definitely be held accountable for this strike,- President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app.He ordered a full and prompt investigation, saying the strike with two ballistic missiles damaged a building of the Military Institute of Communications.It was not immediately clear who the victims were. Ukrainian military bloggers suggested some might be cadets or recently mobilised men undergoing training.The use of ballistic missiles - which hit targets hundreds of kilometres away within a few minutes of their launch - meant the victims had almost no time to find cover after the air raid siren sounded, the foreign ministry said.-This is a stunning tragedy for all of Ukraine. The enemy hit an educational institution and a hospital,- Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, wrote on X.Some Ukrainians left worried messages on the institute's Facebook page seeking information about their loved ones.-One of the institute's buildings was partially destroyed, and many people were trapped under the rubble,- the defence ministry said on Telegram.-Thanks to the coordinated work of rescuers and medics, 25 people were rescued, 11 of whom were taken from the rubble. The rescuers are currently continuing their work.-Russia did not immediately comment on the attack. –Reuters ---Russian milbloggers claim the casualties from the strike, purportedly Iskander, are much higher, Boris Razhin says in a widely shared messaged across Telegram: -Given that Ukrainian sources are now reporting 600 to 700 killed and wounded in Poltava, it is highly likely that today we have witnessed the deadliest strike of the war, which will surpass the strikes on the mercenary barracks at the Yavoriv training ground (2022), the barracks of the 79th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (2022), and the barracks of the training center in Desna (2023), when in each case there were more than 200 dead. Moreover, in the case of Poltava, it is obvious to everyone that it was the military that was hit by the high-precision strike.In addition to the negligence of the enemy leadership, which exposed a large number of personnel to attack (yes, idiots who organize formations in the zone of effective fire destruction of the enemy are not only ours - this example shows why it is not necessary to organize such formations in areas where ballistics can fly), it is worth noting the excellent work of our intelligence, which identified this target and ensured its effective destruction, as a result of which the enemy immediately lost several battalions. The missilemen worked with their usual precision.- https://t.me/boris_rozhin/136023	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38348	2024-09-03T10:11:30-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Happy Labor Day! --- Via workingclasshistory on Instagram: -On this day, 2 September 1921, federal troops arrived at Blair Mountain, in West Virginia to support mine bosses who were fighting a violent conflict against striking miners. Armed union miners… The first bombs dropped on U.S. soil by a military, gas and explosive death set upon those looking for better lives. @ourwarstoday To be noted several months earlier in May of 1921 during the Tulsa Massacre in Oklahoma privately owned aircraft dropped firebombs on black-owned homes and businesses, targeting families as well with homemade bombs and rifles. NPS; -The West Virginia mine wars culminated in a massive march of union miners through the coal towns of the southern counties. The participants ultimately sought to free miners in Mingo County who had been arrested and were being held in jail on charges of violating the martial law that the governor had imposed on the county. To get to Mingo, they first had to cross through Logan County.In late August 1921, the union miners encamped in the town of Blair, just below Blair Mountain in Logan County. Blair Mountain forms a long ridgeline that the miners had to cross in order to reach Mingo County. Their first order of business was to deal with Don Chafin, the notorious sheriff of Logan County whose main job was to protect the coal mine operators’ interests. By the time the armed marchers arrived in Blair, Chafin had assembled his own army of civilian recruits that were protecting positions along the Blair Mountain ridgeline. It was on Blair Mountain where the two forces came face-to-face.On the night of August 30, John Wilburn, a minister and part-time miner, led a group of 70 miners—including two of his sons—up the mountain. During a dawn patrol, Wilburn and four other men encountered three of Chafin’s deputy sheriffs including John Gore, an infamous mine guard in Logan County. In the gun battle that ensued, the miners shot and wounded Gore who then shot and killed miner Eli Kemp. Wilburn responded by shooting Gore in the head, ensuring that he was dead.This marked the beginning of the Battle of Blair Mountain. For the next three days, the two sides battled with gatling guns, rifles, and other firearms along the ridge of Blair Mountain. During the second day of fighting, Chafin ordered his men to fly airplanes over the encamped marchers and drop two nausea-inducing gas bombs, and two bombs filled with gunpowder, nuts and bolts. As historian James Green describes it in The Devil is Here in These Hills: West Virginia’s Coal Miners and Their Battle for Freedom, -Something extraordinary happened on Spruce Fork Ridge that day: American citizens were being subjected to aerial bombardment on their own soil.-After several days of heavy fighting along the mountain ridge, the miners were ready to move into Logan County when the federal government stepped in, dispatching troops, planes, and munitions to the area. This intervention effectively ended the miners’ march before they could enter into full battle with Chafin’s army. The miners willingly surrendered to the federal troops because they were not rebelling against the federal government, but rather against the local and state governments that catered to mining interests to the extent of denying citizens their constitutional rights. In fact, miners viewed the intervention of the military as a victory, seeing it as a signal that the rule of law would return to the region, even though they did not succeed in freeing the jailed miners in Mingo or ridding Logan County of its corrupt sheriff. The fighting of the West Virginia mine wars officially ended on September 4, 1921. Due to the size, length, and violence involved, the legacy of this short battle has loomed large in American labor history, and continues to be a symbol of workers’ struggles in the past—many of which continue to resonate today.-https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-blair-mountain.htm	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38346	2024-09-02T16:26:39-07:00

Forwarded From Our Wars, Today Our Wars, Today: Photo -After four days of fighting had left 100 coal miners dead, by presidential order, the governor of West Virginia—friend of the coal bosses—deployed the National Guard. After 3 U.S. soldiers died through one more day of combat, the coal miners laid down their arms and surrendered.The first death came at dawn on August 31, when Reverend John Wilburn, a part-time coal miner and Baptist minister, led a patrol of seventy volunteers up the mountain. Wilburn and his men shot three Logan Defenders, and one returned fire, fatally wounding an African-American miner named Eli Kemp. Wilburn stepped forward and shot the deputy in the head.It would be another decade before the workers right they'd fought for gained traction but the memory of Blair Mountain was never forgotten by the labor movement. In 2018, when West Virginia's teachers went on statewide strike they were wearing red bandanas around their necks.- @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38345	2024-09-02T16:24:44-07:00

Forwarded From Our Wars, Today Our Wars, Today: Photo -Old west cowboy style shootouts, general strikes, and rising violence between miners, policeman, and mine guards culminated in 10,000 miners arming themselves and marching on the coal bosses. Many of the miners were WW1 veterans who wore the uniforms they’d fought in France into the West Virginia mountains. One Italian miner and WW1 veteran wore his Italian Army Captain’s uniform into the battle. 1/4 of the miners were Black and even stopped at segregated diners during the march to eat as a sign of protest. Many of the men had red bandanas wrapped around their necks and called themselves the -Redneck Army-.Waiting for them on Blair Mountain was Sheriff Don Chafin—paid $30,000 a year by the coal bosses—and armed company men with rifles, .30 caliber machine guns, and Tommy guns. Sheriff Chafin hired local planes to drop homemade bombs on the marching coal miners as the fighting started.- @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38340	2024-09-02T16:24:44-07:00

The largest labor uprising in US history and largest armed rebellion since the Civil War. For five days, 10,000 West Virginia coal miners rose up against the mine owners and corporate bosses.At a time in American history where workers had no power and starting unions got you killed, coal miners lived in company owned towns, treated as basically slaves. Miners were paid in paper only redeemable at the company store, lived in company owned homes, and their families were bullied and threatened with violence by company hired -mine guards-. After WW1, miner unions were getting stronger and winning victories like 8 hour work days and higher standard wages for coal miners. A handful of counties in West Virginia owned by the mine bosses refused to give in and continued their inhumane treatment of their workers.- @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38335	2024-09-02T16:24:43-07:00

Happy Labor Day!---Via workingclasshistory on Instagram:-On this day, 2 September 1921, federal troops arrived at Blair Mountain, in West Virginia to support mine bosses who were fighting a violent conflict against striking miners.Armed union miners were attempting to march on non-union Logan County to free miners who had been imprisoned under martial law. Meanwhile, mine bosses used sheriff deputies, armed vigilantes, and the US Army air service dropped bombs to prevent the miners from crossing the mountain and reaching Logan.Although the miners had fought deputies for several days, many of the miners were themselves military veterans who fought in World War I, and so were unwilling to engage in combat with federal troops.As a result, workers either headed home, and tried to hide their weapons, or surrendered them to authorities.In the aftermath of the battle, 985 miners were indicted for crimes including murder, conspiracy to murder, and treason.Many of the miners were acquitted by sympathetic juries, but some were convicted and jailed for periods of up to 4 years. Bill Blizzard, one of the leaders of the miners during the battle, was put on trial for treason, but was acquitted, partly because he used an unexploded bomb dropped on workers by a military plane in his defence.The loss of the battle by the workers was a major setback for the United Mine Workers union, whose membership in the region subsequently fell drastically.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38334	2024-09-02T16:22:32-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Photo 🇲🇲 🔥The fire rises in #Myanmar... as resistance forces continue to advance across the country and close to the capital, against the unlawful Burmese military junta that overthrew the democratic government in 2021 in a shocking coup d’état that saw mass youth protests violently suppressed and widespread demonstrations. This resistance uproar eventually triggered a widespread revival of older and longing running anti-junta militias and EAOs (ethnic armed organizations), as well as the birth of new militant groups and alliances, as people took up arms against the illegal government, and the slew of war crimes and abuse committed by the State Administration Council (#SAC) and the #Tatmadaw military, leading to total civil war. @ourwarstoday Via Thomas Van Linge on Twitter:-MAP UPDATE: the situation in Myanmar / #Burma as of 01/09/2024. In the past month the resistance made several gains across the country, fully seizing the city of Lashio as well as towns in Kachin, Sagaing, Rakhine and Shan states.A more generalized version of the situation in Myanmar, dividing the different faction up into #NUG and its allies, the #3BHA, and neutral or ceasefire factions. (1st slide)At the moment the resistance controls approximately 385.000 km2, that's around 57% of the entire country.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38297	2024-09-01T15:51:29-07:00

↩️🎬 A #Moscow oil refinery also was struck by #Ukrainian drones ...	Our Wars, Today: Photo A #Moscow oil refinery also was struck by #Ukrainian drones today. @ourwarstoday Russian milblogger drone channel -Game of Drones- writes: -About the mass raid on Russian regions and MoscowThe morning of September 1 began with alarming news, which concerned Muscovites as well. Ukrainian UAVs attacked objects not only in the Moscow region, but also for the first time hit an object within the Moscow Ring Road - the oil refinery in Kapotnya.In total, the Defense Ministry reported the downing of 158 UAVs in 16 Russian regions. Two more power plants were hit: Kashirskaya and Konakovskaya, the Zhukovsky airfield, and several villages in the Moscow region.It is difficult to judge whether electronic warfare systems were used to shoot down the drones. Judging by the published videos, they definitely tried to shoot them down with small arms fire. Most likely, these were automatic weapons and machine guns.Everything that happened once again raises questions that we have written about many times. About the need to create a system for detecting enemy UAVs. About certification of electronic warfare systems. Until these problems are resolved at the very top, Ukrainian drones will fly to the Moscow region and even to the capital itself.- t.me/droneswar/9275	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38281	2024-09-01T09:37:40-07:00
