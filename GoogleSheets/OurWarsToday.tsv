Chechen Assault Cybertruck:Leader of the #Russian-aligned #Chechen Republic Ramzan #Kadyrov recently showed off his modified Cybertruck that has a mounted heavy machine gun, a Kord 12.7mm. He promises to bring this improvised fighting vehicle/NSTV/technical to the frontlines in #Ukraine where it will be -in demand- according to him. Posted today August 17th. @ourwarstodayKadyrov: -We received a Tesla cybertruck from the respected Elon Musk.I was happy to test the new equipment and personally saw that it is not by chance that it is called the -Cyberbeast-. A real invulnerable and fast animal. A maneuverable vehicle, it develops excellent speed and overcomes obstacles. A very comfortable car. Based on such excellent characteristics, the cybertruck will soon be sent to the SVO zone, where it will be in demand in appropriate conditions. I am sure that this -beast- will bring a lot of benefit to our soldiers.I express my sincere gratitude to Elon Musk! He is, of course, the strongest genius of our time and a specialist. A great man! Well, the cybertruck turned out to be a powerful project. Undoubtedly one of the best cars in the world! I literally fell in love with this car.Elon, thank you! Come to Grozny, I will receive you as the most dear guest! I do not think that our Russian MFA will be against such a trip. And, of course, we are waiting for your new developments that will contribute to the completion of the SVO.-Source: t.me/RKadyrov_95/4999 Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38027	2024-08-17T11:05:31-07:00
