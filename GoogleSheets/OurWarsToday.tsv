Via instagram.com/atlas.news3 – @ourwarstoday Karaki is one of the last surviving leaders of Hezbollah’s Military High Command and is believed to have recently replaced military operational commander Ibrahim Aqil following his death last Friday.Karaki’s status remains unknown at this time, however, his death would mark a near complete elimination by the #IDF of senior military leadership under Hassan #Nasrallah.----The Israeli cabinet of ministers has also just now reportedly voted to declare a -special situation on the homefront- across the entirety of Israel, this was confirmed by Israeli news channel N12.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says the Israeli army is -crushing- Hezbollah infrastructure that had been built up for decades in today's strikes in Lebanon, and that the leader of the terror group, Hassan Nasrallah, now remains alone.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38817	2024-09-23T09:33:00-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank Israeli troops have raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, ordering the bureau to shut down. t.me/ourwarstoday JON GAMBRELL… 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 AJ: -#Israeli forces have raided Al Jazeera’s offices in Ramallah in the occupied #WestBank, #Palestine, and imposed a 45-day closure, in the latest push to curtail the news network’s coverage. @ourwarstoday Heavily armed and masked Israeli soldiers entered the building and handed the closure order to the network’s West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari early on Sunday. They did not provide a reason for the decision.-There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,- a soldier told al-Omari as Al Jazeera Arabic broadcast the conversation live on television.-I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment,- the soldier said in Arabic.Sunday’s raid comes just months after the Israeli government banned Al Jazeera from operating inside Israel in May.That initial closure order was also for 45 days, but it has been renewed and Al Jazeera journalists are still unable to report from inside the country.Speaking over the phone from Ramallah on Sunday, Al Jazeera’s correspondent Nida Ibrahim said the West Bank raid and closure order -comes as no surprise- after the earlier ban on reporting from inside Israel.-We’ve heard Israeli officials threatening to close down the bureau. We’ve heard the government discussing this, asking the military ruler in the occupied West Bank to close down and shut down the channel. But we [had] not been expecting it to happen today,- Ibrahim said.After the raid, al-Omari – the bureau chief – raised concerns about what Israeli soldiers may do to the office.-Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,- he said.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38713	2024-09-21T19:56:56-07:00

The crew was not injured.-This event represents an unprecedented escalation of Russia's illegal and unjustified war against #Ukraine,- the ministry's statement read.-Deliberately attacking a cargo ship is a serious violation of international humanitarian legal norms governing the conduct of war at sea.-Bucharest also condemned Russia's violations of the U.N. Charter through the -systematic and irresponsible bombing of Ukrainian infrastructure and grain-carrying ships,- adding these attacks -threaten global food security.-The incident comes as another sign of Russia's war against Ukraine spilling over to NATO territory. Romanian authorities have repeatedly uncovered drone wreckage on its soil following Russia's mass attack against Ukrainian Danube ports, lying in the vicinity of the Romanian border.While #Bucharest said it sees no intent behind Russian drones crashing on Romanian territory, it presented the Russian attack against the vessel as deliberate.The attack on the ship marked the first missile strike on a civilian vessel transporting grain through the #BlackSea since the start of the full-scale invasion. Some vessels have been previously damaged by mines or while moored in Ukrainian ports.President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is one of the key global contributors to food security and that the Ukrainian government will continue to do -everything possible- to protect Ukrainian ports and supply food to the global market.-We are waiting for the world's reaction. Wheat and food security should never be a target for missiles,- the president added.Ukraine has exported over 64 million metric tons of goods to 46 countries since the temporary Black Sea corridor began operating, according to the Infrastructure Ministry.-Ensuring the safety and sustainability of agricultural exports passing through the Black Sea remains critical for supporting global food security and keeping global prices under control,- U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.----In response the #Kremlin has feigned ignorance: -The Kremlin is not familiar with accusations from Kyiv that Russia allegedly attacked a grain ship in the Black Sea,- Russian state-owned TASS news outlet quoted Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov as saying.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38394	2024-09-13T07:20:11-07:00

Vadym Filashkin said.The previous day, Russians destroyed a natural gas distribution station near Pokrovsk, Filashkin said. Some 18,000 people remain in the city, including 522 children, he said. More than 20,000 people have left in the past six weeks as Russian forces creep closer to residential areas, Filashkin said.-Evacuation is the only … choice for civilians,- he added.Pokrovsk is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region, which lies on part of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defensive abilities and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated goal of capturing the entire Donetsk region, which it partially occupies.Russian troops backed by artillery and powerful glide bombs have turned Donetsk cities and towns such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka into bombed-out shells, though the push has cost Russia heavily in troops and armor.The United States and Britain pledged nearly $1.5 billion in additional aid to Ukraine on Wednesday during a visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats. Much of that will go to restoring the electricity supply.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, -we’re again seeing Putin dust off his winter playbook, targeting Ukrainian energy and electricity systems to weaponize the cold against the Ukrainian people.-Russia launched a total of 64 Shahed drones and five missiles over eastern, central, and northern regions of Ukraine, Ukraine’s air force said in its Thursday morning report.Notably on Tuesday, over 140 Ukrainian drones targeted multiple Russian regions overnight, including Moscow and surrounding areas, killing at least one person and injuring eight, officials said, in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russian soil of the past two and half years of #Russia's invasion war of #Ukraine.- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38389	2024-09-12T06:59:21-07:00

🇺🇸 🇷🇺 Conservative Commenters Duped by #Russia, Says Departme...	🇺🇸 🇷🇺 Conservative Commenters Duped by #Russia, Says Department of Justice: @ourwarstoday -NEW YORK (AP) — They have millions of followers online. They have been major players in right-wing political discourse since Donald Trump was president. And they worked unknowingly for a company that was a front for a Russian influence operation, #UnitedStates DOJ prosecutors say.An indictment filed Wednesday alleges a media company linked to six conservative influencers — including well-known personalities Tim Pool, Dave Rubin and Benny Johnson — was secretly funded by Russian state media employees to churn out English-language videos that were -often consistent- with the Kremlin’s -interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition- to Russian interests, like its war in Ukraine.In addition to marking the third straight presidential election in which U.S. authorities have unveiled politically charged details about Russia’s attempted interference in U.S. politics, an indictment indicates how Moscow may be attempting to capitalize on the skyrocketing popularity of right-wing podcasters, livestreamers and other content creators who have found successful careers on social media in the years since Trump was in office.The U.S. Justice Department doesn’t allege any wrongdoing by the influencers, some of whom it says were given false information about the source of the company’s funding. Instead, it accuses two employees of RT, a Russian state media company, of funneling nearly $10 million to a Tennessee-based content creation company for Russia-friendly content.After the indictments were announced, both Pool and Johnson issued statements on social media, which Rubin retweeted, saying they were victims of the alleged crimes and had done nothing wrong.-We still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,- Pool said. -Putin is a scumbag.-In his post, Johnson wrote that he had been asked a year ago to provide content to a -media startup.- He said his lawyers negotiated a -standard, arms length deal, which was later terminated.-Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are at large, and it was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.Though the indictment does not name the Tennessee-based company, the details match up exactly with Tenet Media, an online media company that boasts of hosting -a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.- Tenet’s website lists six influencers who provide content, including Pool, Johnson, Rubin, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen and Matt Christiansen.Tenet Media’s six main influencers have more than 7 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 7 million followers on X.The indictment shows that some of the influencers were paid handsomely for their work. One unidentified influencer’s contract included a $400,000 monthly fee, a $100,000 signing bonus and an additional performance bonus.Tenet Media’s shows in recent months have featured high-profile conservative guests, including Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake. The nearly 2,000 videos posted by the company have gotten more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, prosecutors said.-Full article and details: https://apnews.com/article/russian-interference-presidential-election-influencers-trump-999435273dd39edf7468c6aa34fad5ddAP NewsRight-wing influencers were duped to work for covert Russian influence operation, US saysNew U.S. charges allege that a media company linked to six conservative influencers was a front for a Russian influence operation.

Via Reuters @ourwarstoday Photographs posted on social media showed several bodies lying on the ground covered in dust and debris, with the badly damaged side of a large building behind them. Reuters could not immediately verify the images.-The Russian scum will definitely be held accountable for this strike,- President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app.He ordered a full and prompt investigation, saying the strike with two ballistic missiles damaged a building of the Military Institute of Communications.It was not immediately clear who the victims were. Ukrainian military bloggers suggested some might be cadets or recently mobilised men undergoing training.The use of ballistic missiles - which hit targets hundreds of kilometres away within a few minutes of their launch - meant the victims had almost no time to find cover after the air raid siren sounded, the foreign ministry said.-This is a stunning tragedy for all of Ukraine. The enemy hit an educational institution and a hospital,- Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, wrote on X.Some Ukrainians left worried messages on the institute's Facebook page seeking information about their loved ones.-One of the institute's buildings was partially destroyed, and many people were trapped under the rubble,- the defence ministry said on Telegram.-Thanks to the coordinated work of rescuers and medics, 25 people were rescued, 11 of whom were taken from the rubble. The rescuers are currently continuing their work.-Russia did not immediately comment on the attack. –Reuters ---Russian milbloggers claim the casualties from the strike, purportedly Iskander, are much higher, Boris Razhin says in a widely shared messaged across Telegram: -Given that Ukrainian sources are now reporting 600 to 700 killed and wounded in Poltava, it is highly likely that today we have witnessed the deadliest strike of the war, which will surpass the strikes on the mercenary barracks at the Yavoriv training ground (2022), the barracks of the 79th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (2022), and the barracks of the training center in Desna (2023), when in each case there were more than 200 dead. Moreover, in the case of Poltava, it is obvious to everyone that it was the military that was hit by the high-precision strike.In addition to the negligence of the enemy leadership, which exposed a large number of personnel to attack (yes, idiots who organize formations in the zone of effective fire destruction of the enemy are not only ours - this example shows why it is not necessary to organize such formations in areas where ballistics can fly), it is worth noting the excellent work of our intelligence, which identified this target and ensured its effective destruction, as a result of which the enemy immediately lost several battalions. The missilemen worked with their usual precision.- https://t.me/boris_rozhin/136023	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38348	2024-09-03T10:11:30-07:00

Our Wars, Today: Happy Labor Day! --- Via workingclasshistory on Instagram: -On this day, 2 September 1921, federal troops arrived at Blair Mountain, in West Virginia to support mine bosses who were fighting a violent conflict against striking miners. Armed union miners… The first bombs dropped on U.S. soil by a military, gas and explosive death set upon those looking for better lives. @ourwarstoday To be noted several months earlier in May of 1921 during the Tulsa Massacre in Oklahoma privately owned aircraft dropped firebombs on black-owned homes and businesses, targeting families as well with homemade bombs and rifles. NPS; -The West Virginia mine wars culminated in a massive march of union miners through the coal towns of the southern counties. The participants ultimately sought to free miners in Mingo County who had been arrested and were being held in jail on charges of violating the martial law that the governor had imposed on the county. To get to Mingo, they first had to cross through Logan County.In late August 1921, the union miners encamped in the town of Blair, just below Blair Mountain in Logan County. Blair Mountain forms a long ridgeline that the miners had to cross in order to reach Mingo County. Their first order of business was to deal with Don Chafin, the notorious sheriff of Logan County whose main job was to protect the coal mine operators’ interests. By the time the armed marchers arrived in Blair, Chafin had assembled his own army of civilian recruits that were protecting positions along the Blair Mountain ridgeline. It was on Blair Mountain where the two forces came face-to-face.On the night of August 30, John Wilburn, a minister and part-time miner, led a group of 70 miners—including two of his sons—up the mountain. During a dawn patrol, Wilburn and four other men encountered three of Chafin’s deputy sheriffs including John Gore, an infamous mine guard in Logan County. In the gun battle that ensued, the miners shot and wounded Gore who then shot and killed miner Eli Kemp. Wilburn responded by shooting Gore in the head, ensuring that he was dead.This marked the beginning of the Battle of Blair Mountain. For the next three days, the two sides battled with gatling guns, rifles, and other firearms along the ridge of Blair Mountain. During the second day of fighting, Chafin ordered his men to fly airplanes over the encamped marchers and drop two nausea-inducing gas bombs, and two bombs filled with gunpowder, nuts and bolts. As historian James Green describes it in The Devil is Here in These Hills: West Virginia’s Coal Miners and Their Battle for Freedom, -Something extraordinary happened on Spruce Fork Ridge that day: American citizens were being subjected to aerial bombardment on their own soil.-After several days of heavy fighting along the mountain ridge, the miners were ready to move into Logan County when the federal government stepped in, dispatching troops, planes, and munitions to the area. This intervention effectively ended the miners’ march before they could enter into full battle with Chafin’s army. The miners willingly surrendered to the federal troops because they were not rebelling against the federal government, but rather against the local and state governments that catered to mining interests to the extent of denying citizens their constitutional rights. In fact, miners viewed the intervention of the military as a victory, seeing it as a signal that the rule of law would return to the region, even though they did not succeed in freeing the jailed miners in Mingo or ridding Logan County of its corrupt sheriff. The fighting of the West Virginia mine wars officially ended on September 4, 1921. Due to the size, length, and violence involved, the legacy of this short battle has loomed large in American labor history, and continues to be a symbol of workers’ struggles in the past—many of which continue to resonate today.-https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-blair-mountain.htm	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38346	2024-09-02T16:26:39-07:00

Forwarded From Our Wars, Today Our Wars, Today: Photo -After four days of fighting had left 100 coal miners dead, by presidential order, the governor of West Virginia—friend of the coal bosses—deployed the National Guard. After 3 U.S. soldiers died through one more day of combat, the coal miners laid down their arms and surrendered.The first death came at dawn on August 31, when Reverend John Wilburn, a part-time coal miner and Baptist minister, led a patrol of seventy volunteers up the mountain. Wilburn and his men shot three Logan Defenders, and one returned fire, fatally wounding an African-American miner named Eli Kemp. Wilburn stepped forward and shot the deputy in the head.It would be another decade before the workers right they'd fought for gained traction but the memory of Blair Mountain was never forgotten by the labor movement. In 2018, when West Virginia's teachers went on statewide strike they were wearing red bandanas around their necks.- @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38345	2024-09-02T16:24:44-07:00

Forwarded From Our Wars, Today Our Wars, Today: Photo -Old west cowboy style shootouts, general strikes, and rising violence between miners, policeman, and mine guards culminated in 10,000 miners arming themselves and marching on the coal bosses. Many of the miners were WW1 veterans who wore the uniforms they’d fought in France into the West Virginia mountains. One Italian miner and WW1 veteran wore his Italian Army Captain’s uniform into the battle. 1/4 of the miners were Black and even stopped at segregated diners during the march to eat as a sign of protest. Many of the men had red bandanas wrapped around their necks and called themselves the -Redneck Army-.Waiting for them on Blair Mountain was Sheriff Don Chafin—paid $30,000 a year by the coal bosses—and armed company men with rifles, .30 caliber machine guns, and Tommy guns. Sheriff Chafin hired local planes to drop homemade bombs on the marching coal miners as the fighting started.- @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38340	2024-09-02T16:24:44-07:00

The largest labor uprising in US history and largest armed rebellion since the Civil War. For five days, 10,000 West Virginia coal miners rose up against the mine owners and corporate bosses.At a time in American history where workers had no power and starting unions got you killed, coal miners lived in company owned towns, treated as basically slaves. Miners were paid in paper only redeemable at the company store, lived in company owned homes, and their families were bullied and threatened with violence by company hired -mine guards-. After WW1, miner unions were getting stronger and winning victories like 8 hour work days and higher standard wages for coal miners. A handful of counties in West Virginia owned by the mine bosses refused to give in and continued their inhumane treatment of their workers.- @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38335	2024-09-02T16:24:43-07:00

Happy Labor Day!---Via workingclasshistory on Instagram:-On this day, 2 September 1921, federal troops arrived at Blair Mountain, in West Virginia to support mine bosses who were fighting a violent conflict against striking miners.Armed union miners were attempting to march on non-union Logan County to free miners who had been imprisoned under martial law. Meanwhile, mine bosses used sheriff deputies, armed vigilantes, and the US Army air service dropped bombs to prevent the miners from crossing the mountain and reaching Logan.Although the miners had fought deputies for several days, many of the miners were themselves military veterans who fought in World War I, and so were unwilling to engage in combat with federal troops.As a result, workers either headed home, and tried to hide their weapons, or surrendered them to authorities.In the aftermath of the battle, 985 miners were indicted for crimes including murder, conspiracy to murder, and treason.Many of the miners were acquitted by sympathetic juries, but some were convicted and jailed for periods of up to 4 years. Bill Blizzard, one of the leaders of the miners during the battle, was put on trial for treason, but was acquitted, partly because he used an unexploded bomb dropped on workers by a military plane in his defence.The loss of the battle by the workers was a major setback for the United Mine Workers union, whose membership in the region subsequently fell drastically.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38334	2024-09-02T16:22:32-07:00

This resistance uproar eventually triggered a widespread revival of older and longing running anti-junta militias and EAOs (ethnic armed organizations), as well as the birth of new militant groups and alliances, as people took up arms against the illegal government, and the slew of war crimes and abuse committed by the State Administration Council (#SAC) and the #Tatmadaw military, leading to total civil war. @ourwarstoday Via Thomas Van Linge on Twitter:-MAP UPDATE: the situation in Myanmar / #Burma as of 01/09/2024.

Our Wars, Today: Photo A #Moscow oil refinery also was struck by #Ukrainian drones today. @ourwarstoday Russian milblogger drone channel -Game of Drones- writes: -About the mass raid on Russian regions and MoscowThe morning of September 1 began with alarming news, which concerned Muscovites as well. Ukrainian UAVs attacked objects not only in the Moscow region, but also for the first time hit an object within the Moscow Ring Road - the oil refinery in Kapotnya.In total, the Defense Ministry reported the downing of 158 UAVs in 16 Russian regions. Two more power plants were hit: Kashirskaya and Konakovskaya, the Zhukovsky airfield, and several villages in the Moscow region.It is difficult to judge whether electronic warfare systems were used to shoot down the drones. Judging by the published videos, they definitely tried to shoot them down with small arms fire. Most likely, these were automatic weapons and machine guns.Everything that happened once again raises questions that we have written about many times. About the need to create a system for detecting enemy UAVs. About certification of electronic warfare systems. Until these problems are resolved at the very top, Ukrainian drones will fly to the Moscow region and even to the capital itself.- t.me/droneswar/9275	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38281	2024-09-01T09:37:40-07:00

But political analysts are discussing it now. And even [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky said, he sometimes makes Freudian slips, that they will need this for future exchanges. That's why they are taking prisoners and want to seize square kilometers. It's so simple-minded and naive. We do not discuss our territory with anyone. We do not negotiate about our territory,- the minister said, as he commented on Ukraine's attack on the Kursk Region.He quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin as saying a year and a half ago that Russia -is not against talks, but those who are against them should realize that the longer they procrastinate, the harder it will be to reach an agreement.--In Istanbul, less than a month after the start of our special military operation, compared to what we see now, it was very easy to reach an agreement. They did not want that,- the minister said.-About everything else, the president said on June 14, speaking at the Russian Foreign Ministry, that we are ready to resolve the situation on the basis of the reality. The reality on the ground, the reality of the Russian Constitution, which clearly states that we now have four new constituents of the federation in addition to Crimea. Of course, with all this, there can also be no talk of Ukraine joining NATO,- Lavrov said.The minister also stated that Russia is currently not seeking any talks.-The Russian president has repeatedly said that those who make statements insinuating that Russia rejects negotiations, while Ukraine is ready for them - he has already said this many times - you at least tell this Zelensky, when he is in his right mind, if such situations happen on any day of the week, tell him to cancel his decree prohibiting negotiations,- Lavrov said.-https://tass.com/defense/1836591TASSRussia won’t exchange territory after attack on Kursk Region — LavrovIt is very hard to tell what goal and intent they were pursuing	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38266	2024-08-31T16:53:23-07:00

Regarding the video of the Russian soldier attempting to shoot himself that I posted on Instagram with the comments and likes off: -Just saw this and thought I'd explain my post, at least from the perspective of posting it. I generally keep most graphic and depressing war content on my graphic Telegram page but occasionally I will post it on Instagram. The point is not to be sensational but to show what is happening elsewhere, and if it's interrupted otherwise as war-profiteering or trivalizing that's my fault and I will try to do better.I don't mean for my posts to be war p*rn, and that's partially the reason why I disable comments on particularly morbid or emotional intense videos. People often escape to the comments to distract themselves from what they are seeing, or make gross jokes, or attack and insult others. I don't post these things for people to be disrespectful to the dead. I'm sure my online desensitization to these things plays into it, and if that's a shortsighted issue of mine I can't truly recognize, I'm apologetic.I've been using my warning disclaimer about content since 2022 and it's purpose is to simply have enough keywords in it to be picked up by Meta/Instagram's algorithm so that the post doesn't get zucced to oblivion. Not much more to it than that. I'm truly sorry to anyone who has felt like I've been trying to trivialize or make light/minimize the deaths or suffering of anyone or avoid discussions on morality of posting such content. That is not my intention whatsoever, and I will make more efforts to try to avoid that going forward.

↩️ Syrskiy led the defense of Kyiv that repelled Russia’s assault...	Our Wars, Today: Syrskyi Thoughts? Syrskiy led the defense of Kyiv that repelled Russia’s assault in early 2022, and a successful counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region that autumn. But some blamed him for heavy losses in the defense of the eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia captured in May 2023 after months of brutal fighting. @ourwarstoday The Kursk operation has won the general plaudits for its planning, secrecy and speed. Analysts and Ukrainian officers said Syrskiy had evidently drawn conclusions from Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive during the summer of 2023, when Ukraine consulted with the U.S. and other Western partners, deployed newly formed brigades and telegraphed its plans with videos and public comments.Only a small number of senior officers took part in the meetings, led by Syrskiy, to thrash out detailed plans for the incursion. Syrskiy tapped battle-hardened units, such as the 80th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades, to lead the incursion and didn’t inform the U.S. of plans.While last year’s counteroffensive assaulted Russia’s strongest fortifications in the south, this time Syrskiy picked a target that Moscow had assumed was untouchable and left weakly defended primarily by conscripts.-The strong point of Syrskiy is that he is a general who can act unusually, suddenly, unexpectedly for the enemy,- said Serhiy Cherevatiy, Syrskiy’s former communications adviser. -He knows we don’t have parity and can’t go head-to-head, so he uses cunning and any advantage we have.-Before Syrskiy’s July meeting with senior officers from units selected for the operation, troops from the 61st Brigade had spent months training in the east for what officers assumed would be another defensive engagement. Even after the general’s disclosure that they would be going into Russia, Kholodkevych, the brigade’s chief of staff, thought it might simply be a bluff, meant to deceive the Russians.The transfer of the 61st Brigade from the east was accompanied by a disinformation campaign indicating they were headed for Vovchansk, a northern city under assault since May, when Russia launched its own cross-border incursion.Instead, the brigade was in the second wave of Ukrainian troops into Kursk on Aug. 7. As assault troops on fast-moving armored vehicles drove deeper into Russia avoiding head-on assaults in towns and villages, the 61st mopped up pockets of soldiers cut off by the quick advance.The rapid operation bears similarities to Syrskiy’s Kharkiv offensive, which took advantage of Russian weak points to break through their lines, cut off troops and take back swaths of territory.Now, Ukraine is taking advantage of Russian unpreparedness to strike deeper into the rear, creating what Zelensky has called a buffer zone to impede Russian military operations against Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces are still taking more prisoners to add to a pool that Ukraine hopes to trade for its own people detained in Russia.Ukraine is using new tactics and equipment to gain an upper hand where Russian defenses are weaker, including using small explosive drones to strike down helicopters and Russian surveillance drones.The commander of a drone unit, call sign Aristarkh, said that was allowing Ukrainian artillery to move more freely and hit more targets as the threat of discovery is lower. Aristarkh’s teams operate strike drones with a range of 30 miles that can drop aerial bombs on high-value targets such as artillery guns.Russia has a total of 30,000 troops in the area to counter the offensive, Syrskiy said Tuesday, some of them transferred from Ukraine.Still, Syrskiy said Russia wasn’t redeploying troops from the Pokrovsk front to Kursk, as Ukraine had hoped it would, and is instead not strengthening its forces there.That has provoked complaints from soldiers in the east that their defensive efforts have been starved in favor of the Kursk offensive.Hodges, the retired U.S. Army Europe commander, said that is a risk that Syrskiy and his advisers will have foreseen and decided it was worth taking.Via: https://archive.is/gs9VV	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38248	2024-08-31T08:40:39-07:00
↩️ Ukraine General’s Plan Surprised the Russians—and His Own Troo...	Our Wars, Today: Syrskyi Thoughts? Ukraine General’s Plan Surprised the Russians—and His Own Troops:#Ukraine’s top military commander gathered senior officers for a secret meeting in late July where he disclosed an audacious plan to revive the country’s flagging war effort. @ourwarstoday Ukraine’s army, Gen. Oleksandr #Syrskyi told them, would turn the tables on Moscow by launching the first large-scale invasion of #Russia since World War II.One attendee, the chief of staff of the 61st Mechanized Brigade, said his initial reaction was shock. -Where are we going?- Lt. Col. Artem Kholodkevych recalled thinking.The brazen operation also stunned Russia when it launched on Aug. 6, overrunning weak border defenses and quickly seizing around 100 towns and villages in Russia’s #Kursk region. The invasion embarrassed Russian President Vladimir #Putin, raised Ukrainians’ morale after a year of grinding defensive war, and showed the U.S. and other backers that Ukraine still has plenty of fight in it.-We exploded the myth that Russia is an invincible country,- Kholodkevych said in an interview. -We did something that no one has done for 80 years.-The operation has brought a brighter spotlight on its architect, Syrskiy. The 59-year-old career military officer faced a challenging proposition when he took over in February. He was replacing a popular predecessor, Gen. Valeriy #Zaluzhniy, and since then has sought largely to manage a war of attrition against a much larger foe.The incursion has, for now, upended the narrative of the war, putting Ukraine back on the offensive. But the success of the operation will ultimately be determined by whether it leads to lasting gains, or greater losses, on the battlefield—or yields political dividends that bring more military support from the U.S. and its allies or strengthen Ukraine’s position in any future peace negotiations.Now in its fourth week, the incursion is continuing to make gains even as Russia has sent reinforcements. At least 2,000 #Russian troops are hemmed in against a river, where repeated attempts to relieve them using pontoon bridges have failed, according to #Ukrainian soldiers.Some military strategists and soldiers have questioned the Kursk operation, saying Syrskiy is committing precious reserves of manpower and equipment to a new front while Russia is taking advantage of Ukraine’s threadbare defensive lines on the eastern front to press forward. Russia has withdrawn several thousand troops from Ukraine in response to the incursion, but has intensified assaults on its main target, Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub for Ukrainian operations in the east.Others have praised the move, saying that Ukraine needed to play a joker to change the momentum of a war.Ukraine couldn’t afford simply to keep trying to buy time by throwing more men into defensive lines, said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe. -Nobody has enough resources to do everything,- he said. -You are constantly having to make decisions about priorities, where to accept risk.-The operation is also a bold gambit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr #Zelenskiy, who was trapped between a slow but relentless advance by Russia, which wants to take control of Ukraine, and the West’s unwillingness to provide sufficient weaponry to reverse Russian gains.-He saw that only one actor can change the status quo,- said Mick Ryan, a military strategist and retired major general in the Australian Army. -It’s risky but audacious.-Zelensky said Tuesday he is planning to travel to the U.S. in September to present a peace plan that has been spurred, in part, by the positive dynamic of the invasion.Syrskiy, a fitness buff with a passion for military history, had an ambiguous reputation among Ukrainian soldiers. His stern, clipped style contrasts with his predecessor, who would pose for selfies and flash V signs for victory.Via https://archive.is/gs9VVarchive.isExclusive | Ukraine General’s Plan Surprised the Russians—and His Own…archived 31 Aug 2024 06:36:06 UTC	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38247	2024-08-31T08:40:39-07:00

The raid began on August 28th, and is still ongoing. Israeli officials have said it is likely to continue, with the end date of the operation unknown. Via theatlasnews.co @ourwarstoday The Israeli operation has spanned several different cities. #Jenin and #Tulkarem appear to be the cities with the largest IDF activity, however Israeli raids have also occurred in #Nablus, Tubas, and Al-Fara’a.The IDF stated that they carried out the raids after detecting an -immediate threat- to civilians, but also as a larger crackdown amidst heightened militant activity in recent months.Across several of the besieged cities, #Israel has deployed armored bulldozers to carry out significant amounts of infrastructure destruction. While not present in every raid, Israel rather frequently deploys armored construction equipment to accompany their troops. The armored bulldozers dig up streets, crush cars, and, at times, demolish houses.Unique to the ongoing raid is that Israeli troops have surrounded the Jenin government hospital and blocked access to the building with mounds of dirt. Palestinian health officials further claimed that Israel prevented an ambulance from reaching the hospital. Israeli military sources have stated that this measure has been taken in order to prevent militant forces from seeking refuge in the hospital.Palestinian sources have claimed that Israeli bulldozers have also destroyed electricity transmitters for the Jenin refugee camp, causing a blackout in the camp.Israeli forces have thus far been primarily engaged by Saraya Al-Quds (the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s (#PIJ) militant wing), the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade (a #Palestinian militant group that was a part of Fatah until 2007 that has become one of the key Palestinian militant factions in recent years), and elements of the Al-Qassam Brigades, #Hamas’ militant wing. Other smaller groups have also engaged Israeli forces.Amidst the ongoing Israeli raids, Israel’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Israel Katz, released a statement claiming that the Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank are Iranian proxies that are funded and supplied directly by Iran through the Jordanian border, comparing it to the -proxy model- that was set up by Iran -in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq.-To counter this, Katz called for a security fence to be built on the Israeli-Jordanian border and for -the US and Western countries- to -strengthen the Kingdom of Jordan against Iranian subversion and enable it to defend its borders,- though he did not specify what exactly this meant.In a separate statement, Katz called for the -temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents- in order to allow for Israel to properly tackle ongoing security threats. Further, he stated that -this is a war for everything and we must win it.-The Foreign Minister’s statements, in particular that calling for the evacuation of Palestinian civilians, have drawn condemnation from international diplomats, including from the EU’s High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security and Vice President of the EU Commission, Josep Borrell.Read the full article here: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/29/israel-launches-massive-west-bank-raid/theatlasnews.coIsrael Launches Massive West Bank Raid | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38245	2024-08-31T08:06:18-07:00

If a spill occurs, it has the potential to be among the largest from a ship in recorded history and could cause an environmental catastrophe in an area that is particularly dangerous to access.-What was decided yesterday is an initial game plan, of the operation starting in 48 hours,- one of the sources said. A second source said the operation was likely to be complex, given Houthis have planted explosives on board.#Greece said in a letter circulated through the U.N. shipping agency on Friday that what it called a -potential spill- of 2.2 nautical miles (4.2 km) in length had been detected in the area matching the location of the Sounion in the Red Sea. However, an official with the European Union's ASPIDES naval monitoring mission told Reuters that the potential spill was from the vessel’s engine and not from the oil cargo onboard.-The potential spill is from the tanker's engine after the first hit,- the ASPIDES official said. Greece urged -all nations and all actors involved to assist in preventing the environmental hazard and resolving the situation the soonest possible- in its letter dated Aug. 29 and published on Friday by the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization.#Yemen's Houthi militants carried out multiple assaults, including planting bombs on the already disabled 900-foot (274-metre) Sounion, which is operated by Athens-based Delta Tankers.On Wednesday, the Iran-aligned militants said they would allow salvage teams to tow the ship - which has been on fire since Aug. 23 - to safety. The ship's crew has been evacuated.The sources said the priority of the operation - to decide whether to tow the vessel to a port or arrange a transfer of its cargo - depended on an inspection of the vessel. -It is not an easy task, transferring the oil cargo to another ship, when there are explosives on it,- said one of the sources. -In any case, ASPIDES ships will protect and escort the vessel to a safe port.-Greece has also been in touch with Saudi Arabia, a key player in the region, to ask for assistance.-Delta Tankers is doing everything it can to move the vessel (and cargo). For security reasons, we are not in a position to comment further,- a spokesperson for the tanker operator said.–Reuters----High-resolution satellite imagery of Maxar, taken today, shows the Greek-flagged tanker SOUNION in the Red Sea, recently attacked by Houthi rebels.

A majority party-exiled and controversial Ukrainian MP, Mariana Bezuhla, on the other hand, claimed online following the news breaking that a Ukrainian-operated Patriot air defense system had friendly fired and shot down the jet.&nbsp;Prior to his dismissal, Oleshchuk had said that he would investigate the crash and that -no one has hidden anything [or is] hiding anything [now].- theatlasnews.co &nbsp;Photo: Alamy, Zelenskiy and Oleshchuk.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38239	2024-08-30T16:41:40-07:00

One woman and four men died of their injuries on the spot before the ambulance arrived. I express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims, although I understand that no words can console in such grief...37 civilians were injured, including 6 children. Seven adults and three children are in serious condition. All victims were taken to medical institutions in Belgorod. All necessary assistance is being provided.Roofs were breached and windows were broken in two apartment buildings in the city, and the glazing was damaged in another apartment building.

Russia Bombs Kharkiv Residents and Playground, 6 Killed, 55 Wounded: @ourwarstoday Reuters: A #Russian guided bomb attack on #Ukraine's northeastern city of #Kharkiv hit a residential building and a playground, killing six people and injuring at least 55 more, local authorities said today around 4pm local time on the 30th.Ihor Terekhov, the city's mayor, said on Telegram that one child was killed in the playground, a 14 year old girl.Three people were killed in the 12-storey apartment block that caught fire as a result of the strike, he said.About 20 of the injured were in severe condition, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said.One end of the block was engulfed in black smoke, with many of the upper floors in flames. Several cars parked outside were gutted by fire.Emergency services and rescue volunteers rushed to carry survivors out of the building. The body of one of the victims lay under a carpet on the ground outside, surrounded by police.Residents of all ages, some of them covered in blood, sat stunned on benches and walls outside as medics attended to their injuries.The authorities did not give the circumstances in which the two other people died in the strikes, which hit four areas of the city.---Daily and weekly waves of Russian drones and missiles are not uncommon for Kharkiv, as well as mass casualty events of civilians as a result of such attacks. Since early May of 2024 Russia has focused on an offensive targeting Kharkiv and Sumy regions, forcing the evacuation of over 10,000, and causing hundreds of civilian casualties. War crimes committed by Russian soldiers have also been alleged by Ukrainian survivors during this offensive.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38214	2024-08-30T11:05:36-07:00

On the twenty-sixth of August, Oleksiy destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV while repelling a massive Russian combined air and missile attack. Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life.Oleksiy Mes was a strong and loyal soldier, a high-class pilot, a leader on earth and in the sky, a good friend, a loving son, father, husband, and patriot of his country. On the twenty-ninth of August, his fellow pilots, commanders and subordinates, friends and colleagues, hundreds of ordinary Ukrainians came to say goodbye to him.A pair of MiG-29 fighters paid tribute to the fallen pilot from the sky. The flight over the procession was performed by Alexey's comrades-in-arms. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant colonel Oleksiy Mesy was posthumously awarded the military rank of colonel.-https://t.me/kpszsu/18470	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38191	2024-08-29T09:35:06-07:00

Lieutenant colonel Oleksii -Moonfish- Mes, 31, was one of the first and only six Ukrainian pilots to be fully trained to fly the American-made F-16s. However, there was no confirmation that a U.S.-supplied F-16 was destroyed. @ourwarstoday That confirmation has arrived. Unnamed #UnitedStates officials have confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was destroyed in a crash on August 26th, not a combat incident as previously speculated by Russian military bloggers who claimed that Moonfish was killed in a missile strike on a Ukrainian air base.This confirmation comes after multiple reports that Ukrainian pilots were struggling with the steep learning curve during Western pilot training and an even steeper learning curve in transitioning from jet trainers to the advanced fourth generation fighter. The exact circumstances of the crash have not been reported.The #Russian Ministry of Defense has not publicly commented on the loss, but social media is already aflame with triumphant comments from circles critical of U.S. deliveries to Ukraine.

Telegram has long been accused by state and non-state groups of allowing a wide range of illegal or fraudulent activities to continue without much crackdown. @ourwarstoday After his was charged, he was reportedly released from custody on €5 million bail, according to POLITICO. He must check in with French police at a station twice a week and cannot leave the country.Telegram is among the world's most used messaging platforms with 950 million active users in July 2024 according to Durov.Warrants were originally issued in March by France for Durov and his brother Nikolai, according to POLITICO. Durov was detained on Saturday night in Paris at the Le Bourget airport.Durov’s lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said after the indictment: -The only statement I’d wish to make is that Telegram is in conformity with every aspect of European norms on digital matters. It is absurd to think that the head of a social network is being charged,-. Telegram released a statement reiterating the same points, also saying Durov had nothing to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;A French and Emirate citizen since 2021, Durov moved to the UAE in 2017 after leaving Russia in 2014 indefinitely following a number of confrontations with the Russian government.&nbsp;Durov in 2014 notably had a publicized departure from his position as CEO of the Facebook equivalent VK platform, which he helped found. This came after his selling of shares to VK in late 2013, a fakeout April's Fool of his resignation in 2014, then the refusal to hand over data on Ukrainian demonstrators in the Euromaiden protests to Russian authorities also in April, as well as refusing to block Alex Nalvany's page. He was dismissed from the company later that month after calling the requests unlawful. Durov claimed the company had been taken over by those aligned with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Via theatlasnews.co Barsalogho is located an approximate 25 miles north of Kaya–a strategically significant town which acts as the last military bulwark against the militant group–as the capital, #Ouagadougo, lies just 78 miles ahead. @ourwarstoday Military authorities in the area had allegedly forcibly tasked the village’s civilians with digging a defensive trench around the community due to intelligence on an impending attack on the locality which local sources claim has been -virtually under terrorist blockade for two years.-Sources inside the community stated, -it is no longer possible to go in any direction from Barsalogho more than 3km (1.8 miles) without being killed. However, in this case, the population was forced to go 3km (1.8 miles) outside the city to dig the ditch.-Taking place over seven hours, it is believed that between tens to hundreds of civilians bled to death after the initial massacre took place, with military reinforcements heading to the village on Sunday at approximately 10 a.m. and arriving at 2 p.m., nearly 24 hours after the onset of the massacre.Survivors were transported to Kaya’s regional hospital to receive treatment and were visited by a government team consisting of the Minister of State, Minister of Security, the Minister of Humanitarian Action, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, and a government spokesperson.On its media channels, JNIM announced, -full control over the headquarters of the Burkinabe militias in Barsalogho this morning, praise and gratitude be to God.-Notably, is the use of the term ‘Burkinabe militias’ to refer to the deceased civilians.Earlier this month, JNIM conducted an attack on a convoy of the Burkinabe armed forces (FDS) while traveling between Boungou and Ougarou in the country’s east. The attack left at least 140 military personnel dead.In its statement on the attack, JNIM denounced the mistreatment of the civilian populous by the Burkinabe government, stating, -This blessed jihadist act comes in response to the heinous crimes committed by the ruling clique against innocent, defenseless people in retaliation for the blood of our Muslim peoples in Burkina, Mali, and Niger and in an effort to stop the campaign of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and forced displacement that our families and brothers are suffering in this region. God is Great, and Glory belongs to God.-It is clear that the militant group classifies any individual connected to Ibrahim Traore’s military junta as a combatant, despite the fact that local sources pointed to the fact that -the leaders of the [military] detachment on site forced the people to participate in the work, against their will, through threats. Since the start of the work, the people were reprimanded and beaten by the FDS elements to force them to come and take part in the work.-Taking power through a military coup in 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traore and his newly formed military government vowed to respond decisively to the terrorist threat in the nation but has since struggled to make gains at a rate inferior to his predecessors.Requesting the populous on August 8th to report on any suspicious individuals, movements, or objects, in an attempt to establish an informal civilian surveillance force, the use of civilians to dig defensive trenches highlights the extent of the FDS’ manpower and resource shortages and its deadly consequences.

🖼 🇵🇰 🇨🇳 Does #Pakistan Underestimate #Balochistan’s Rebels?:...	🇵🇰 🇨🇳 Does #Pakistan Underestimate #Balochistan’s Rebels?: theatlasnews.co Fragments of the Balochistan landscape––a Chinese-controlled Gwadar port, an under-examined human rights crisis, and continual IED attacks––all connect to each other. The human rights crisis, exacerbated by poverty, encourages locals to join militant movements, often the only chance at income or upward mobility. These militant movements prompt aggressive counter-insurgency action, which intensifies the human rights crisis. @ourwarstoday The region is resource-rich; one undeveloped copper-gold reserve called Reko Diq holds 12.3 million metric tons of copper and 20.9 million ounces of gold. But these resources are dominated by foreign mining companies, particularly #Chinese ones, causing locals to complain not only of misappropriation of resources but also pollution.Over the past few days, scores were killed in Balochistan as a series of attacks rocked the region. Attacks targeting key infrastructure and Pakistani security forces were quickly claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army (#BLA), an infamous Baloch separatist group. Last Thursday, the Pakistani Army raided a BLA camp in the mountainous areas of Gishk, which turned into a 2-day affair claiming both Pakistani and Baloch lives. More recently, dozens more were killed in BLA operations on a major highway in Bela, a road near Musakhel, a railway in Bolan, and a police station in Kalat. In the wake of the violence, the BLA announced the end of the first phase of Operation Herouf. Not only did the operation allegedly kill 130 Pakistan military personnel, the BLA also controlled checkpoints on highways for 12 hours and a Pakistani military camp for 20 hours.In response, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi decried the attacks (some of which allegedly targeted Pubjabi citizens), promised retribution, and called on the provincial governments of Balochistan to repress terrorism. Today, President Asif Ali Zardari ordered the Interior Minister to completely eliminate terrorists, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an aggressive response. In clearance operations, the Pakistani Army reports to have killed 21 Baloch militants and says 14 of its own troops died in the attacks.But the BLA tells a different story. An official statement by the BLA claims that the coordinated attacks of Operation Herof were a success and well over a hundred Pakistani military personnel and military collaborators were killed, versus the 14 reported by Pakistani authorities.Baloch separatist groups have contributed to a violent insurgency, often called a low-intensity one, in the region for years. The only question is what to believe. In the midst of recent firewalls installed on Pakistani internet, information slowly trickles out of the media blackhole in Balochistan. Building a picture of what’s happening in the region is difficult.

Largest Russian Strikes on Ukraine: theatlasnews.co In the early hours this morning, August 26th, #Russian forces launched a massive wave of missile and drone strikes across 15 #Ukrainian oblasts, targeting critical energy infrastructures and prompting a nationwide air raid alert.&nbsp;#Ukraine celebrated independence from the Soviet Union on Saturday, and some form of attacks from #Russia around the date were anticipated. Reportedly, the wave of attacks was the largest ever by Russia against Ukraine during their ongoing war of invasion, with over 236 incoming aerial attacks. @ourwarstoday Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko confirmed the attack’s extensive impacts. In response, Ukrenergo, a major Ukrainian energy provider, initiated emergency power outages to manage the crisis. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal elaborated on the widespread impact of the attack, reporting extensive damage across the affected regions and conveying his condolences to the victims’ families.Explosions were reported in the capital city of Kyiv. Although Kyiv’s air defenses reportedly successfully intercepted a dozen missiles and fifteen drones, the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, headed by Ruslan Kravchenko, reported significant hits on infrastructure facilities, leading to power outages and water supply problems, particularly on the city’s right bank. To support residents impacted by these disruptions, authorities have established community stations offering essential services like phone charging and internet access.Allegedly, the Hydroelectric Power Station in Vyshhorod, near Kyiv, was also targeted in the recent Russian strikes. While there are reports of damage to the dam’s roadway and machine hall, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation Andriy Kovalenko assured&nbsp;on Telegram&nbsp;that&nbsp;the damage is not considered critical due to the impossibility to destroy the dam with missiles. He also stated that the Russian media are using this topic to stir up panic.Explosions were also reported in multiple other cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Kremenchuk, Dnipro, Khmelnytskyi, Kropyvnytskyi, and Kryvyi Rih, as well as in Lviv, Rivne, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts.Ukraine's emergency services reported 7 people were killed and 47 injured as a result of the Russian attack, including 3 children aged 10, 7, and a less than a year old baby.Energy provider DTEK has now announced rolling electrical blackouts in Kyiv, Odesa, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions in an effort to stabilize the power grid. In addition to the strikes, Russian forces have reportedly made advancements in the #Toretsk area, #Donetsk Oblast.&nbsp;In response, Vadim Filashkin, the Kyiv-appointed head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, reported a mandatory evacuation of the population in Toretsk.Read more in the full article at: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/26/massive-russian-strikes-in-ukraine-what-are-the-consequences/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38130	2024-08-26T14:42:59-07:00
