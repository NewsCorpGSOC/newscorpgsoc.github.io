Via Reuters. @ourwarstoday The type 2 virus (cVDPV2), while not inherently more dangerous than types 1 and 3, has been responsible, opens new tab for most outbreaks in recent years, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.U.N. agencies have called for Israel and Gaza's dominant Palestinian militant group Hummus to agree to a seven-day humanitarian pause in their 10-month-old war to allow vaccination campaigns to proceed in the territory.-Polio does not distinguish between Palestinian and Israeli children,- the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday.-Delaying a humanitarian pause will increase the risk of spread among children,- Philippe Lazzarini added. The baby, who has lost movement in his lower left leg, is currently in stable condition, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.The WHO has announced that two rounds of a polio vaccination campaign are set to begin in late August and September 2024 across the densely populated Gaza Strip, #Palestine. With its health services widely damaged or destroyed by fighting, and raw sewage spreading amid a breakdown in sanitation infrastructure, Gaza's population is particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of diseaseFull article: https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/baby-paralysed-gazas-first-case-type-2-polio-25-years-who-says-2024-08-23/---Photo: A Palestinian girl is examined by a doctor amid fears over the spread of polio after the first case was reported by the Ministry of Health, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, August 18, 2024.

Other uniformed members are holding the man down with the crack of the whips echoing in the background. @ourwarstoday It is unclear if the video was filmed by a Russian mercenary themselves or the video obtained from a different source and then watermarked by the mercenary channel.The video speaks to concerns first raised by UN Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk in May. Turk noted a 71 percent increase in violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law compared to the previous six months. Moreover, 65 percent of the victims in these abuses were victims of unlawful killings.Additionally, the incident may have been brought about by a request on August 8th from #BurkinaFaso’s Security Ministry to the populous to report on any suspicious individual, movement or activity.Read the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/23/burkinabe-armed-forces-filmed-torturing-an-alleged-infiltrated-fighter/theatlasnews.coBurkinabe Armed Forces Filmed Torturing an alleged ‘Infiltrated Fighter’ | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38118	2024-08-24T09:32:47-07:00

According to the Center, nearly 40 percent of the continent’s disinformation campaigns target West Africa, and nearly half of all the campaigns in the region are connected to Russia.Read the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/23/the-game-of-the-ear-disinformation-networks-in-west-africa/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38117	2024-08-24T08:57:17-07:00

They accuse American journalists and those of other nationalities of provocative behavior. Additionally, Russia has claimed there is an American PMC operating in #Kursk. @ourwarstoday Photo shows Americans in the Ukrainian International Legion holding the U.S. flag in Kursk, Russia. There have been several reported cases of volunteer soldiers from the U.S. fighting in an International Legion capacity in the offensive. ---WaPo:-The U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday rejected Russian accusations of U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s Kursk incursion, after the Foreign Ministry summoned Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Holmes to protest the -provocative actions- of American journalists who reported from the Russian region of Kursk under Ukrainian controlThe ministry condemned the actions of American journalists who reported from Kursk after Ukrainian forces took control of the region and complained that an American private military company was operating there as well.In response, the embassy said that independent news organizations -make their own operational and personnel decisions,- in a statement Wednesday. -The U.S. government plays no role.--In fact, we actively discourage all U.S. citizens from traveling to Russia, including for reporting purposes, as we have stated in our Travel Advisory for Russia, which is currently at Level 4: Do Not Travel.-The statement added that -we were not engaged in any aspect of the planning or preparation of this operation. We refer you to the Ukrainians to speak about their own military operations.-The ministry on Tuesday told Holmes that the journalists had entered the region illegally -for propaganda coverage of the crimes of the [Ukrainian] regime.- Its statement Tuesday said the Russian law enforcement agencies would investigate Americans -involved in these crimes- and bring them to justice. The ministry did not name any journalists or media outlets.The European Federation of Journalists on Tuesday strongly condemned earlier Russian threats to prosecute Italian journalists who covered the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk.-The EFJ considers that these intimidations amount to censorship and are aimed at preventing public opinion from being informed about ongoing operations,- the federation said in a statement.The Washington Post and several other U.S. news organizations have reported from inside Kursk in recent days. The Post said in a story published Aug. 18 that its team traveled to Ukrainian-held territory in Russia to document the extent of Ukrainian control and witness firsthand the conditions remaining Russian civilians face.-We are proud of our reporting on the Ukraine-Russia war and remain committed to covering all aspects of this important, evolving conflict,- a Post spokesperson said.Russia’s Foreign Ministry also complained that an American private military company was fighting on Ukraine’s side in Kursk and participating -in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation.- The ministry statement did not name the company but warned that any foreign military specialists or mercenaries illegally crossing into Russia were legitimate military targets.According to the ministry, Holmes was warned that these actions, -which run counter to the claims of the Biden administration about its alleged noninvolvement in the attack of Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia, clearly prove the involvement of the United States as a direct participant in the conflict.--Full article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/21/us-russia-journalists-kursk/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38081	2024-08-23T00:34:23-07:00

David Allvin told airmen in a newly released memo that officials are focusing on updating family and mental health resources for airmen as they continue to highlight the urgent preparation needed for a potential future conflict in the #Pacific. @ourwarstodayThe memo, provided first to Military.com and shared publicly Tuesday, was titled -Refocusing Family Readiness.- Amid the Air Force's latest shift to reorganize the force for great power competition -- the service's term for increased spending and strategy against adversaries such as #Russia and, most notably, #China -- it offered an inward look at how it plans to support airmen and families during the sweeping changes.-We cannot afford to be in that situation again,- Allvin wrote. -The insights I gained then have been validated in the years since, and serve as motivation for what we in the Air Force community need to strive to achieve when it comes to family readiness.--While our efforts to prepare the force for future challenges are essential, they will be incomplete without a parallel focus on family readiness,- Allvin wrote. -In order to meet the moment in this time of consequence, we need to ensure that families and communities connected to the Air Force are as well prepared as our service members for the possible challenges that lay ahead.-A number of programs have been rolled out and revamped in recent months, and Allvin hinted that others are currently underway including combining the Air Force’s True North programs and Operational Support Team programs to best support airmen and their families.Allvin pointed to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when he was serving as a squadron commander at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, as an example for -how collectively unprepared- service members and their families were for that change.Sweeping changes to the force came earlier this year. In February, Allvin and other Department of the Air Force leaders rolled out numerous changes ranging from bringing back warrant officers, reorganizing training organizations and creating new offices. The changes all underscore the need to prepare for a looming conflict: potential control and invasion of #Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party.The memo is one of the first indications of some family- and mental health-related changes the force is making in that reorganization effort.-We cannot afford to be in that situation again,- Allvin wrote. -The insights I gained then have been validated in the years since, and serve as motivation for what we in the Air Force community need to strive to achieve when it comes to family readiness.-In a related change, airmen and Guardians with dependents who go to a professional military education or training location can now collect per diem at a Basic Allowance for Housing rate while also still receiving a housing allowance at their prior duty station for their families.Full article: https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/08/20/air-force-chiefs-memo-highlights-need-family-readiness-service-preps-possible-pacific-conflict.htmlMilitary.comAir Force Families Must Be Prepared for Catastrophic Events Amid Shift to Potential Pacific Conflict, Service Chief SaysAmid the Air Force's latest shift to reorganize the force for great power competition, a newly released memo offers an inward look at how it plans to support airmen and families during the sweeping changes.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38075	2024-08-22T14:10:31-07:00

The enemy is dragging artillery into our territoryThis, of course, was to be expected. In different sectors of the front, the enemy began to dig in. And to tighten heavy artillery because of the ribbon. Before that, he made do with mortars. But here on the frames of objective control is the ACS, which is reset by our ixologists.Along with the attempt to isolate the Glushkovsky district, all this looks like preparation for the transition to defensive actions. There is a feeling that the enemy did not expect that he would be able to advance so far. But at the same time, there is a concentration of forces in other areas.Now the Armed Forces of Ukraine is focusing on the removal of crossings, which our heroic pontoons, without exaggeration, lead with the tenacity of the doomed. Among journalists, filming the guidance of pontoons has always been something secondary. But today, this job is in the full sense of the word deadly. They are covered both on marches and in the area of crossing guidance. Contrary to Kh*khl's expectations, our garrison in the Glushkovsky district did not run to the northern shore of the Sejm and continues to hold positions, do not let the enemy advance to the west. This means that you can wait for the enemy to open a new direction.

The air defense forces intercepted 45 enemy UAVs, while most of them were shot down over the territories of the Bryansk and Moscow regions. - 23 drones of Ukrainian formations were intercepted in the sky over the Bryansk region. The first targets were recorded in the airspace of the region around one o'clock in the morning, the work of the air defense of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued until seven in the morning, since the UAVs were involved in -waves-. Nevertheless, casualties and destruction in the region were avoided. - 11 more drones were shot down in the airspace of the Moscow region, in the Podolsk area south of Moscow. Similarly with the Bryansk region, the UAVs moved wave after wave and strayed as they approached the area of operation of the local air defense system. No damage or casualties have been detected in the region either.- In the Kaluga region, near the border with the Bryansk region, 3 drones were intercepted, in the Kursk region, air defense forces shot down two UAVs, as well as two missiles. Six more drones were intercepted in the Belgorod region. - In the area of Novoshakhtinsk in the Rostov region, air defense units, according to some information, shot down an ATACMS missile of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The munition fell on a vacant lot and caused a fire of dry grass, nearby buildings suffered damage to windows due to the blast wave. There were no casualties. To date, this is the first recorded case of the use of ATACMS by the enemy against objects in internationally recognized territories of Russia. It was probably just a test launch and in the near future the enemy will launch combined attacks using this type of missiles.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38073	2024-08-21T07:10:42-07:00

This strike, however, would only mark the second-ever visually confirmed HIMARS destruction since they began service in Ukraine over two years ago. @ourwarstoday When looking at the first HIMARS loss, which occurred back in March, there is much to compare. Footage released by Russian military sources, which was also taken by an overhead drone, tracks a HIMARS before it is eventually struck by an Iskander missile. In both instances, Russian drones were able to operate freely over Ukrainian-controlled territory and direct an Iskander missile strike on the launchers.To date, we have seen only four visually confirmed losses out of the 39 HIMARS supplied by the US. Two have been destroyed, as seen in the footage above. The other two were seen being unloaded at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania with battle damage, likely to be repaired.Read more analysis and details in the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/16/iskander-strike-claims-second-ever-himars-destruction/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38067	2024-08-19T08:35:33-07:00

Previously, he had said the operation aimed to protect communities in the bordering #Sumy region from constant shelling.Zelenskyy said -it is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much #Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions. This includes creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory -– our operation in the Kursk region,- he said in his nightly address.This weekend, Ukraine has destroyed a key bridge in the region and struck a second one nearby, disrupting supply lines as it pressed a stunning cross-border incursion that began Aug. 6, officials said. According to Russia’s Mash news site, the attacks left only one intact bridge in the area. Kyiv previously has said little about the goals of its push into Russia with tanks and other armored vehicles, the largest attack on the country since World War II, which took the Kremlin by surprise and saw scores of villages and hundreds of prisoners fall into Ukrainian hands.The Ukrainians drove deep into the region in several directions, facing little resistance and sowing chaos and panic as tens of thousands of civilians fled. Ukraine’s Commander in Chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed last week that his forces had advanced across 1,000 square kilometers (390 square miles) of the region, although it was not possible to independently verify what Ukrainian forces effectively control.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38066	2024-08-18T13:25:30-07:00

After artillery preparation, two enemy groups moved forward, but were spotted by UAV operators in time.The enemy was lucky to avoid the blows of our artillery and approach the position, but as soon as the first occupier came into the field of view of our infantry - he immediately became -200-. His -colleagues- decided not to tempt fate and immediately began to withdraw, trying to regroup, but drones and infantry nullified their plans.It is interesting that, unlike ordinary units, these characters were well equipped and prepared. The enemy expected to do everything quickly, but thanks to the coordinated actions of the infantry, artillery and UAV operators, the plan of the occupiers literally fell apart from the very beginning.Five occupiers were killed, several were wounded.- t.me/ombr_28/1227 Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38065	2024-08-18T10:15:40-07:00

A #Russian soldier headbutts a #Ukrainian explosive FPV drone after it hovers and then plunges towards him, and apparently he just walks away. @ourwarstoday I've noticed a number of videos more recently appearing of FPV drones hovering/watching a soldier before striking. Interesting trend. Commentary by Russian milblogger Sasha Kots who published the footage:-Phenomenal shots! There are still heroes in Rus'!The enemy's FPV drone mockingly slowly flies up to our fighter and hovers at human height before attacking.Our fighter takes a stance as if it were a boxing ring.The drone attacks and the soldier lunges forward and headbutts the drone.Explosion. The smoke clears, and our hero calmly goes into the forest. How can you not believe that God is on our side!- Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38064	2024-08-18T09:57:42-07:00

The BMP seems to be abandoned due to lack of activity. @ourwarstoday Video is too big	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38063	2024-08-18T09:48:52-07:00

Russian milbloggers say New York has fallen again, I thought they had taken it over a week ago, but apparently there has been 10-20% contested by Ukrainian forces since then. #Donetsk @ourwarstoday	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38062	2024-08-18T08:58:10-07:00
