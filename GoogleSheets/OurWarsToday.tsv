Lieutenant… Ukrainian F-16 Pilot Killed, Air Force Confirms: @ourwarstoday Update by Ukraine's Air Force:-Oleksiy Mes, an Air Force pilot of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, died defending our country.He heroically fought his last battle in heaven. On the twenty-sixth of August, Oleksiy destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV while repelling a massive Russian combined air and missile attack. Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life.Oleksiy Mes was a strong and loyal soldier, a high-class pilot, a leader on earth and in the sky, a good friend, a loving son, father, husband, and patriot of his country. On the twenty-ninth of August, his fellow pilots, commanders and subordinates, friends and colleagues, hundreds of ordinary Ukrainians came to say goodbye to him.A pair of MiG-29 fighters paid tribute to the fallen pilot from the sky. The flight over the procession was performed by Alexey's comrades-in-arms. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant colonel Oleksiy Mesy was posthumously awarded the military rank of colonel.-https://t.me/kpszsu/18470	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38191	2024-08-29T09:35:06-07:00

Lieutenant colonel Oleksii -Moonfish- Mes, 31, was one of the first and only six Ukrainian pilots to be fully trained to fly the American-made F-16s. However, there was no confirmation that a U.S.-supplied F-16 was destroyed. @ourwarstoday That confirmation has arrived. Unnamed #UnitedStates officials have confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was destroyed in a crash on August 26th, not a combat incident as previously speculated by Russian military bloggers who claimed that Moonfish was killed in a missile strike on a Ukrainian air base.This confirmation comes after multiple reports that Ukrainian pilots were struggling with the steep learning curve during Western pilot training and an even steeper learning curve in transitioning from jet trainers to the advanced fourth generation fighter. The exact circumstances of the crash have not been reported.The #Russian Ministry of Defense has not publicly commented on the loss, but social media is already aflame with triumphant comments from circles critical of U.S. deliveries to Ukraine.

The ads are not covert and prominently feature the U.S. Central Command logo, linking to a tweet with images of fighter jets. This comes after recent flares of exchanges of attacks over the Israel-Lebanon border. Tinder quickly responded to the military’s campaign, stating that the ads violated their policies related to violence and safety, leading to their prompt removal.

Telegram CEO Indicted on Criminal Charges in France: theatlasnews.co Pavel Durov, the Russian-born CEO and founder of the Telegram messaging and social media app (and co-founder of widely used Russian social media platform VK), has been indicted today by French authorities for six charges of criminal activity related to the app. The charges included complicity in his Dubai-based platform's enabling of illegal transactions, organized crime, distribution of illegal images of minors presenting, child sexual abuse images, and drug trafficking. Telegram has long been accused by state and non-state groups of allowing a wide range of illegal or fraudulent activities to continue without much crackdown. @ourwarstoday After his was charged, he was reportedly released from custody on €5 million bail, according to POLITICO. He must check in with French police at a station twice a week and cannot leave the country.Telegram is among the world's most used messaging platforms with 950 million active users in July 2024 according to Durov.Warrants were originally issued in March by France for Durov and his brother Nikolai, according to POLITICO. Durov was detained on Saturday night in Paris at the Le Bourget airport.Durov’s lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said after the indictment: -The only statement I’d wish to make is that Telegram is in conformity with every aspect of European norms on digital matters. It is absurd to think that the head of a social network is being charged,-. Telegram released a statement reiterating the same points, also saying Durov had nothing to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;A French and Emirate citizen since 2021, Durov moved to the UAE in 2017 after leaving Russia in 2014 indefinitely following a number of confrontations with the Russian government.&nbsp;Durov in 2014 notably had a publicized departure from his position as CEO of the Facebook equivalent VK platform, which he helped found. This came after his selling of shares to VK in late 2013, a fakeout April's Fool of his resignation in 2014, then the refusal to hand over data on Ukrainian demonstrators in the Euromaiden protests to Russian authorities also in April, as well as refusing to block Alex Nalvany's page. He was dismissed from the company later that month after calling the requests unlawful. Durov claimed the company had been taken over by those aligned with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Forwarded From ⚠️ Our Wars, GRAPHIC ⚠️🇧🇫 An attack by the al-#Qaeda linked militant group Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen (#JNIM) on Barsalogho village, in #BurkinaFaso’s Sanmatenga Province on Saturday has left at least 200 dead and at least 100 more injured, according to official sources, while local sources point to at least 400 fatalities from the mass killing of civilians. Via theatlasnews.co Barsalogho is located an approximate 25 miles north of Kaya–a strategically significant town which acts as the last military bulwark against the militant group–as the capital, #Ouagadougo, lies just 78 miles ahead. @ourwarstoday Military authorities in the area had allegedly forcibly tasked the village’s civilians with digging a defensive trench around the community due to intelligence on an impending attack on the locality which local sources claim has been -virtually under terrorist blockade for two years.-Sources inside the community stated, -it is no longer possible to go in any direction from Barsalogho more than 3km (1.8 miles) without being killed. However, in this case, the population was forced to go 3km (1.8 miles) outside the city to dig the ditch.-Taking place over seven hours, it is believed that between tens to hundreds of civilians bled to death after the initial massacre took place, with military reinforcements heading to the village on Sunday at approximately 10 a.m. and arriving at 2 p.m., nearly 24 hours after the onset of the massacre.Survivors were transported to Kaya’s regional hospital to receive treatment and were visited by a government team consisting of the Minister of State, Minister of Security, the Minister of Humanitarian Action, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, and a government spokesperson.On its media channels, JNIM announced, -full control over the headquarters of the Burkinabe militias in Barsalogho this morning, praise and gratitude be to God.-Notably, is the use of the term ‘Burkinabe militias’ to refer to the deceased civilians.Earlier this month, JNIM conducted an attack on a convoy of the Burkinabe armed forces (FDS) while traveling between Boungou and Ougarou in the country’s east. The attack left at least 140 military personnel dead.In its statement on the attack, JNIM denounced the mistreatment of the civilian populous by the Burkinabe government, stating, -This blessed jihadist act comes in response to the heinous crimes committed by the ruling clique against innocent, defenseless people in retaliation for the blood of our Muslim peoples in Burkina, Mali, and Niger and in an effort to stop the campaign of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and forced displacement that our families and brothers are suffering in this region. God is Great, and Glory belongs to God.-It is clear that the militant group classifies any individual connected to Ibrahim Traore’s military junta as a combatant, despite the fact that local sources pointed to the fact that -the leaders of the [military] detachment on site forced the people to participate in the work, against their will, through threats. Since the start of the work, the people were reprimanded and beaten by the FDS elements to force them to come and take part in the work.-Taking power through a military coup in 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traore and his newly formed military government vowed to respond decisively to the terrorist threat in the nation but has since struggled to make gains at a rate inferior to his predecessors.Requesting the populous on August 8th to report on any suspicious individuals, movements, or objects, in an attempt to establish an informal civilian surveillance force, the use of civilians to dig defensive trenches highlights the extent of the FDS’ manpower and resource shortages and its deadly consequences.

🖼 🇵🇰 🇨🇳 Does #Pakistan Underestimate #Balochistan’s Rebels?:...	🇵🇰 🇨🇳 Does #Pakistan Underestimate #Balochistan’s Rebels?: theatlasnews.co Fragments of the Balochistan landscape––a Chinese-controlled Gwadar port, an under-examined human rights crisis, and continual IED attacks––all connect to each other. The human rights crisis, exacerbated by poverty, encourages locals to join militant movements, often the only chance at income or upward mobility. These militant movements prompt aggressive counter-insurgency action, which intensifies the human rights crisis. @ourwarstoday The region is resource-rich; one undeveloped copper-gold reserve called Reko Diq holds 12.3 million metric tons of copper and 20.9 million ounces of gold. But these resources are dominated by foreign mining companies, particularly #Chinese ones, causing locals to complain not only of misappropriation of resources but also pollution.Over the past few days, scores were killed in Balochistan as a series of attacks rocked the region. Attacks targeting key infrastructure and Pakistani security forces were quickly claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army (#BLA), an infamous Baloch separatist group. Last Thursday, the Pakistani Army raided a BLA camp in the mountainous areas of Gishk, which turned into a 2-day affair claiming both Pakistani and Baloch lives. More recently, dozens more were killed in BLA operations on a major highway in Bela, a road near Musakhel, a railway in Bolan, and a police station in Kalat. In the wake of the violence, the BLA announced the end of the first phase of Operation Herouf. Not only did the operation allegedly kill 130 Pakistan military personnel, the BLA also controlled checkpoints on highways for 12 hours and a Pakistani military camp for 20 hours.In response, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi decried the attacks (some of which allegedly targeted Pubjabi citizens), promised retribution, and called on the provincial governments of Balochistan to repress terrorism. Today, President Asif Ali Zardari ordered the Interior Minister to completely eliminate terrorists, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an aggressive response. In clearance operations, the Pakistani Army reports to have killed 21 Baloch militants and says 14 of its own troops died in the attacks.But the BLA tells a different story. An official statement by the BLA claims that the coordinated attacks of Operation Herof were a success and well over a hundred Pakistani military personnel and military collaborators were killed, versus the 14 reported by Pakistani authorities.Baloch separatist groups have contributed to a violent insurgency, often called a low-intensity one, in the region for years. The only question is what to believe. In the midst of recent firewalls installed on Pakistani internet, information slowly trickles out of the media blackhole in Balochistan. Building a picture of what’s happening in the region is difficult.

Largest Russian Strikes on Ukraine: theatlasnews.co In the early hours this morning, August 26th, #Russian forces launched a massive wave of missile and drone strikes across 15 #Ukrainian oblasts, targeting critical energy infrastructures and prompting a nationwide air raid alert.&nbsp;#Ukraine celebrated independence from the Soviet Union on Saturday, and some form of attacks from #Russia around the date were anticipated. Reportedly, the wave of attacks was the largest ever by Russia against Ukraine during their ongoing war of invasion, with over 236 incoming aerial attacks. @ourwarstoday Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko confirmed the attack’s extensive impacts. In response, Ukrenergo, a major Ukrainian energy provider, initiated emergency power outages to manage the crisis. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal elaborated on the widespread impact of the attack, reporting extensive damage across the affected regions and conveying his condolences to the victims’ families.Explosions were reported in the capital city of Kyiv. Although Kyiv’s air defenses reportedly successfully intercepted a dozen missiles and fifteen drones, the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, headed by Ruslan Kravchenko, reported significant hits on infrastructure facilities, leading to power outages and water supply problems, particularly on the city’s right bank. To support residents impacted by these disruptions, authorities have established community stations offering essential services like phone charging and internet access.Allegedly, the Hydroelectric Power Station in Vyshhorod, near Kyiv, was also targeted in the recent Russian strikes. While there are reports of damage to the dam’s roadway and machine hall, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation Andriy Kovalenko assured&nbsp;on Telegram&nbsp;that&nbsp;the damage is not considered critical due to the impossibility to destroy the dam with missiles. He also stated that the Russian media are using this topic to stir up panic.Explosions were also reported in multiple other cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Kremenchuk, Dnipro, Khmelnytskyi, Kropyvnytskyi, and Kryvyi Rih, as well as in Lviv, Rivne, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts.Ukraine's emergency services reported 7 people were killed and 47 injured as a result of the Russian attack, including 3 children aged 10, 7, and a less than a year old baby.Energy provider DTEK has now announced rolling electrical blackouts in Kyiv, Odesa, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions in an effort to stabilize the power grid. In addition to the strikes, Russian forces have reportedly made advancements in the #Toretsk area, #Donetsk Oblast.&nbsp;In response, Vadim Filashkin, the Kyiv-appointed head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, reported a mandatory evacuation of the population in Toretsk.Read more in the full article at: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/26/massive-russian-strikes-in-ukraine-what-are-the-consequences/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38130	2024-08-26T14:42:59-07:00

Via Reuters. @ourwarstoday The type 2 virus (cVDPV2), while not inherently more dangerous than types 1 and 3, has been responsible, opens new tab for most outbreaks in recent years, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.U.N. agencies have called for Israel and Gaza's dominant Palestinian militant group Hummus to agree to a seven-day humanitarian pause in their 10-month-old war to allow vaccination campaigns to proceed in the territory.-Polio does not distinguish between Palestinian and Israeli children,- the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday.-Delaying a humanitarian pause will increase the risk of spread among children,- Philippe Lazzarini added. The baby, who has lost movement in his lower left leg, is currently in stable condition, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.The WHO has announced that two rounds of a polio vaccination campaign are set to begin in late August and September 2024 across the densely populated Gaza Strip, #Palestine.

Other uniformed members are holding the man down with the crack of the whips echoing in the background. @ourwarstoday It is unclear if the video was filmed by a Russian mercenary themselves or the video obtained from a different source and then watermarked by the mercenary channel.The video speaks to concerns first raised by UN Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk in May. Turk noted a 71 percent increase in violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law compared to the previous six months. Moreover, 65 percent of the victims in these abuses were victims of unlawful killings.Additionally, the incident may have been brought about by a request on August 8th from #BurkinaFaso’s Security Ministry to the populous to report on any suspicious individual, movement or activity.Read the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/23/burkinabe-armed-forces-filmed-torturing-an-alleged-infiltrated-fighter/theatlasnews.coBurkinabe Armed Forces Filmed Torturing an alleged ‘Infiltrated Fighter’ | Atlas News	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38118	2024-08-24T09:32:47-07:00

According to the Center, nearly 40 percent of the continent’s disinformation campaigns target West Africa, and nearly half of all the campaigns in the region are connected to Russia.Read the full article: https://theatlasnews.co/latest/2024/08/23/the-game-of-the-ear-disinformation-networks-in-west-africa/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38117	2024-08-24T08:57:17-07:00

They accuse American journalists and those of other nationalities of provocative behavior. Additionally, Russia has claimed there is an American PMC operating in #Kursk. @ourwarstoday Photo shows Americans in the Ukrainian International Legion holding the U.S. flag in Kursk, Russia. There have been several reported cases of volunteer soldiers from the U.S. fighting in an International Legion capacity in the offensive. ---WaPo:-The U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday rejected Russian accusations of U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s Kursk incursion, after the Foreign Ministry summoned Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Holmes to protest the -provocative actions- of American journalists who reported from the Russian region of Kursk under Ukrainian controlThe ministry condemned the actions of American journalists who reported from Kursk after Ukrainian forces took control of the region and complained that an American private military company was operating there as well.In response, the embassy said that independent news organizations -make their own operational and personnel decisions,- in a statement Wednesday. -The U.S. government plays no role.--In fact, we actively discourage all U.S. citizens from traveling to Russia, including for reporting purposes, as we have stated in our Travel Advisory for Russia, which is currently at Level 4: Do Not Travel.-The statement added that -we were not engaged in any aspect of the planning or preparation of this operation. We refer you to the Ukrainians to speak about their own military operations.-The ministry on Tuesday told Holmes that the journalists had entered the region illegally -for propaganda coverage of the crimes of the [Ukrainian] regime.- Its statement Tuesday said the Russian law enforcement agencies would investigate Americans -involved in these crimes- and bring them to justice. The ministry did not name any journalists or media outlets.The European Federation of Journalists on Tuesday strongly condemned earlier Russian threats to prosecute Italian journalists who covered the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk.-The EFJ considers that these intimidations amount to censorship and are aimed at preventing public opinion from being informed about ongoing operations,- the federation said in a statement.The Washington Post and several other U.S. news organizations have reported from inside Kursk in recent days. The Post said in a story published Aug. 18 that its team traveled to Ukrainian-held territory in Russia to document the extent of Ukrainian control and witness firsthand the conditions remaining Russian civilians face.-We are proud of our reporting on the Ukraine-Russia war and remain committed to covering all aspects of this important, evolving conflict,- a Post spokesperson said.Russia’s Foreign Ministry also complained that an American private military company was fighting on Ukraine’s side in Kursk and participating -in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation.- The ministry statement did not name the company but warned that any foreign military specialists or mercenaries illegally crossing into Russia were legitimate military targets.According to the ministry, Holmes was warned that these actions, -which run counter to the claims of the Biden administration about its alleged noninvolvement in the attack of Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia, clearly prove the involvement of the United States as a direct participant in the conflict.--Full article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/21/us-russia-journalists-kursk/	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38081	2024-08-23T00:34:23-07:00

David Allvin told airmen in a newly released memo that officials are focusing on updating family and mental health resources for airmen as they continue to highlight the urgent preparation needed for a potential future conflict in the #Pacific. @ourwarstodayThe memo, provided first to Military.com and shared publicly Tuesday, was titled -Refocusing Family Readiness.- Amid the Air Force's latest shift to reorganize the force for great power competition -- the service's term for increased spending and strategy against adversaries such as #Russia and, most notably, #China -- it offered an inward look at how it plans to support airmen and families during the sweeping changes.-We cannot afford to be in that situation again,- Allvin wrote. -The insights I gained then have been validated in the years since, and serve as motivation for what we in the Air Force community need to strive to achieve when it comes to family readiness.--While our efforts to prepare the force for future challenges are essential, they will be incomplete without a parallel focus on family readiness,- Allvin wrote. -In order to meet the moment in this time of consequence, we need to ensure that families and communities connected to the Air Force are as well prepared as our service members for the possible challenges that lay ahead.-A number of programs have been rolled out and revamped in recent months, and Allvin hinted that others are currently underway including combining the Air Force’s True North programs and Operational Support Team programs to best support airmen and their families.Allvin pointed to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when he was serving as a squadron commander at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, as an example for -how collectively unprepared- service members and their families were for that change.Sweeping changes to the force came earlier this year. In February, Allvin and other Department of the Air Force leaders rolled out numerous changes ranging from bringing back warrant officers, reorganizing training organizations and creating new offices. The changes all underscore the need to prepare for a looming conflict: potential control and invasion of #Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party.The memo is one of the first indications of some family- and mental health-related changes the force is making in that reorganization effort.-We cannot afford to be in that situation again,- Allvin wrote. -The insights I gained then have been validated in the years since, and serve as motivation for what we in the Air Force community need to strive to achieve when it comes to family readiness.-In a related change, airmen and Guardians with dependents who go to a professional military education or training location can now collect per diem at a Basic Allowance for Housing rate while also still receiving a housing allowance at their prior duty station for their families.Full article: https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/08/20/air-force-chiefs-memo-highlights-need-family-readiness-service-preps-possible-pacific-conflict.htmlMilitary.comAir Force Families Must Be Prepared for Catastrophic Events Amid Shift to Potential Pacific Conflict, Service Chief SaysAmid the Air Force's latest shift to reorganize the force for great power competition, a newly released memo offers an inward look at how it plans to support airmen and families during the sweeping changes.	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38075	2024-08-22T14:10:31-07:00

The enemy is dragging artillery into our territoryThis, of course, was to be expected. In different sectors of the front, the enemy began to dig in. And to tighten heavy artillery because of the ribbon. Before that, he made do with mortars. But here on the frames of objective control is the ACS, which is reset by our ixologists.Along with the attempt to isolate the Glushkovsky district, all this looks like preparation for the transition to defensive actions. There is a feeling that the enemy did not expect that he would be able to advance so far. But at the same time, there is a concentration of forces in other areas.Now the Armed Forces of Ukraine is focusing on the removal of crossings, which our heroic pontoons, without exaggeration, lead with the tenacity of the doomed. Among journalists, filming the guidance of pontoons has always been something secondary. But today, this job is in the full sense of the word deadly. They are covered both on marches and in the area of crossing guidance. Contrary to Kh*khl's expectations, our garrison in the Glushkovsky district did not run to the northern shore of the Sejm and continues to hold positions, do not let the enemy advance to the west. This means that you can wait for the enemy to open a new direction. As I wrote earlier, this may be the southwestern corner of the Kursk region - Tetkino with an eye on Karyzh.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38074	2024-08-21T07:11:38-07:00

The air defense forces intercepted 45 enemy UAVs, while most of them were shot down over the territories of the Bryansk and Moscow regions. - 23 drones of Ukrainian formations were intercepted in the sky over the Bryansk region. The first targets were recorded in the airspace of the region around one o'clock in the morning, the work of the air defense of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued until seven in the morning, since the UAVs were involved in -waves-. Nevertheless, casualties and destruction in the region were avoided. - 11 more drones were shot down in the airspace of the Moscow region, in the Podolsk area south of Moscow. Similarly with the Bryansk region, the UAVs moved wave after wave and strayed as they approached the area of operation of the local air defense system. No damage or casualties have been detected in the region either.- In the Kaluga region, near the border with the Bryansk region, 3 drones were intercepted, in the Kursk region, air defense forces shot down two UAVs, as well as two missiles. Six more drones were intercepted in the Belgorod region. - In the area of Novoshakhtinsk in the Rostov region, air defense units, according to some information, shot down an ATACMS missile of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The munition fell on a vacant lot and caused a fire of dry grass, nearby buildings suffered damage to windows due to the blast wave. There were no casualties. To date, this is the first recorded case of the use of ATACMS by the enemy against objects in internationally recognized territories of Russia. It was probably just a test launch and in the near future the enemy will launch combined attacks using this type of missiles.-	https://t.me/ourwarstoday/38073	2024-08-21T07:10:42-07:00
