Unmarried women in Turkmenistan have been ordered to wear headscarves that show their statusAshgabat has introduced new requirements for the appearance of women, aimed at distinguishing their marital status.&nbsp;Since the beginning of March, unmarried women have been required to wear yellow headscarves at work, while married women have been ordered to wear yellow dresses.&nbsp;Organization leaders cite to instructions -from above-, without specifying their origin, and warn of possible dismissal for failure to comply with these rules, reportsRadio Azatlyk. Previously, female civil servants were already prohibited from using cosmetics, wearing tight dresses or dyeing their hair in light shades, along with other requirements.Why yellow was chosen for the -dress code- is unclear; this color does not have any special symbolic meaning in Islam or in the traditional art of the Turkmen people, however, according to one version, the choice of color connectedwith the preferences of the wife and sisters of the former president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. Such unofficial regulations, which have no legal basis, but are strictly observed, are not uncommon in Turkmenistan.&nbsp;Previously, women were prohibited from using cosmetics, wearing tight clothes and dyeing their hair in light colors.&nbsp;In addition, the country has restrictions on the color of cars - preference is given to white or light shades, as well as on the installation of outdoor air conditioning units on facades buildings.&nbsp;Young men are required to be clean-shaven, which effectively prohibits the wearing of a beard.	https://t.me/astrapress/76875	2025-03-18T06:15:28-07:00

Stand-up comedian Artemy Ostanin was detained while trying to leave the Russian FederationPreviously, the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against him under Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-inciting hatred or enmity and humiliation of human dignity-). The reason was his joke, in which the security forces saw an insult to the participants of the fighting. Ostanin faces a fine or imprisonment for a term of 3 to 6 years.According to investigators, during a public speech in Moscow Ostanin -made negative and offensive comments about a participant in a special military operation.- The joke that became the reason for the criminal case was voiced in February on the -Stand-Up in 60 Seconds- project. In the issue, the comedian said that a man without legs ran over his foot on the subway, whom he called -a skater without legs- and suggested that he -took off a mine.- Z-publics -Call of the People- and -Paragraph- stated that we were talking about a veteran of the war in Ukraine, and demanded that a case be opened against Ostanin.The stand-up comedian himself denies the connection of his joke with the war in Ukraine. He explained that he was talking about a beggar in the subway who had been skating for many years. Nevertheless, the activists who wrote a denunciation against him, including serial informer Vitaly Borodin, insist that the use of the phrase -trapped by a mine- inevitably evokes certain associations. In particular, one of the authors of the complaint, an activist of the -Call of the People- movement Sergei Zaitsev, in a comment to the publication -Podyom- said: -Viewers of the issue still have associations with conflicts in Ukraine, Afghanistan and Chechnya.-	https://t.me/astrapress/76857	2025-03-18T03:27:02-07:00

They are complaining about him from the frontIn the Belgorod region, the general director of the construction company Vek LLC, Alexander Spiridonov, has been refusing to pay a team of 18 workers 18 million rubles for almost two years. The last time, Spiridonov explained his refusal by saying that former builders had gone to war in Ukraine, which means -why do you need money if you die there?- ASTRA was told about this by Arzuman Manukyan, who, as he claims, was defrauded of 8,700,000 rubles by a foreman, a resident of Belgorod and a participant in the war in Ukraine from military unit 74507.-When we told him about our desire to participate in the -SVO- and asked to make payments for completed government orders, he replied: -Why do you need money, you’ll die anyway.- These words pierce the heart. We fulfilled all government orders, worked honestly, and now we are left without a livelihood,- Manukyan said. Spiridonov's company -Vek- has an authorized capital of only 10,000 rubles and 7 employees: a janitor, a security guard, a security guard, a chief engineer, a foreman, a deputy general director - Spiridonov's wife Yulia, and Spiridonov himself (the list of employees is at the disposal of ASTRA). Despite this, judging by open sources, Spiridonov’s company receives dozens of government orders, including from the Ministry of Construction of the Belgorod Region, totaling approximately 1.2 billion rubles. For example: the construction of a house for orphans and a hostel in Valuiki, residential buildings in Alekseevka, a school in Krasny Khutor, the House of Culture in Prokhorovka, landscaping in Nelidovka and Bessonovka and others, ASTRA was convinced.Manukyan claims that he worked for Spiridonov from March 2022 to September 2023 at a rate of 200,000 rubles a month, processed, albeit without a contract. He recruited his familiar workers to fulfill the orders, but in the end, instead of the promised salaries, the builders received no more than 30,000 rubles a month. Spiridonov delayed full payments to workers, claiming that the regional administration owed him 450 million rubles for completed projects, so there was nothing to pay the builders with. Because of this, Manukyan, who called his acquaintances to work, had to sell his property for 1 million rubles - this is how he paid the workers himself. -We are appealing from 40 people, but not everyone can be present here, because some are in hospitals. [Spiridonov] gave us small advances for the work done, and promised the rest after the objects were delivered. The objects were handed over, but we didn’t receive the money,- deceived residents of the Belgorod region addressed Leonid Kapliy, a member of the Public Council at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, in a video from the front. Other workers appealed to the governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov. Manukyan turned to the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin. It is alleged that he reacted and a criminal case was opened under Article 145.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Non-payment of wages), but Spiridonov is a witness in the case, the criminal case itself was opened against an unspecified person. Manukyan says that Spiridonov has a -protection- in local branches of law enforcement agencies that are trying to delay the case, including investigator Kira Zhenikova. -From October 2022 to February 2023, the management of Vek LLC, knowing reliably about the presence of A.G. Manukyan, an employee of the said Company. wage arrears, in violation of Art. 37 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Articles 2, 21, 22, 136 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, due to other personal interests, wages were not partially paid to the specified employee for more than three months, while the available funds were directed to the economic needs of the enterprise,- said the decision of the deputy head of the investigative committee for Belgorod, Gulin. -It’s all deception and extortion,- Spiridonov responded to an ASTRA correspondent’s request to comment on the situation and hung up.

In Finland, DSRG -Rusich- fighter Jan Petrovsky was sentenced to life imprisonment for war crimes in UkraineThe Helsinki District Court sentenced Russian Jan Petrovsky (Vojislav Torden) to life imprisonment, finding him guilty of committing war crimes in Ukraine, reportedHelsingin Sanomat. His defense intends to appeal the verdict.Petrovsky was charged with five war crimes committed in 2014, when he fought on the side of the pro-Russian militants, being the deputy commander of the sabotage and assault reconnaissance group -Rusich-:💫 Ambush on the Ukrainian military - Petrovsky’s unit lured Ukrainian soldiers using Ukrainian flag, after which they opened fire. More than 20 people died.💫 Execution of the wounded - after the battle, a group under the command of Petrovsky finished off the surviving Ukrainian soldiers, which is contrary to the rules of war.💫 Abuse of prisoners - one of the wounded Ukrainian soldiers was mutilated: the -Rusich- emblem was cut out on his face.💫 Desecration of the bodies of the dead - Petrovsky posed with the bodies of killed Ukrainian soldiers, photographed them and distributed the pictures on social networks.💫 Calls for cruelty - before committing the crimes, he made statements from which it followed that his unit did not take prisoners and did not show mercy.Petrovsky himself rejected all accusations, claiming that he did not hold command positions and did not participate in battles, but only made propaganda videos.Petrovsky, known by the nickname Slavyan, was born in 1987 and spent his childhood in St. Petersburg. In 2004, his mother married a Norwegian citizen and moved to Oslo. 16-year-old Petrovsky moved there with her. Later, he began to come to Russia, where he met the leader of the neo-Nazi DSRG -Rusich- and former paratrooper Alexei Milchakov.In 2014, they went to fight in Donbass on the side of Russia. In September of the same year, near the village of Shchastya in the Lugansk region, Rusich militants ambushed and defeated a column of the Aidar battalion. Milchakov, who took part in this, openly told how he took pictures with the bodies of dead Ukrainian soldiers, and the Rusich fighters cut off some of the ears.In 2016, Petrovsky was deported from Norway to Russia, here he changed his first and last name to Vojislav Torden. In 2023, his wife received permission to study in Finland, and he was allowed into the country after her, given a residence permit. Petrovsky entered Finland, but was later detained at Helsinki airport before flying to Nice.In December 2023, the Supreme Court of Finland&nbsp;refused&nbsp;Ukraine to extradite Petrovsky due to conditions in Ukrainian prisons, which the European Court of Human Rights found to violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of torture).	https://t.me/astrapress/76528	2025-03-14T01:38:06-07:00

According to him, Moscow is putting forward conditions that could make reaching an agreement impossible.-Putin often does this - he doesn’t say -no- directly, but creates conditions under which normal decisions become impossible,- he noted.

But there are nuances. What will we do with the wedge site in the Kursk region? If we stop hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who remained there will leave without a fight? Should we let them out of there? After they committed a lot of crimes against civilians? How will it be? It’s not clear,- Putin said. Zelensky said that Ukraine supported the American proposal for unconditional silence at the front and is ready for negotiations.-We do not set conditions that complicate anything.

🖼 - Dismantling of the Kyiv regime - Russia can propose at negot...	-Dismantling the Kyiv regime- can be proposed by Russia at the negotiations, - The Washington Post-An influential Moscow think tank, closely associated with the Russian FSB,- has prepared a document with maximalist demands aimed at achieving Moscow’s strategic goals in the Ukrainian conflict, writes The Washington Post. According to the publication, the document was prepared in February, a week before the negotiations between Russia and the USA, held on February 18 in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.According to information received by journalists from European intelligence sources, the document proposals from the administration of US President Donald Trump to end the war in Ukraine within 100 days, as well as plans to send peacekeepers to the region, are rejected. Instead, it is argued that -a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis cannot occur until 2026.-The authors of the document insist on official recognition of Russian sovereignty over the occupied territories of Ukraine. In addition, it is proposed to create a buffer zone in the north-east of Ukraine, adjacent to the Bryansk and Belgorod regions of Russia, as well as a demilitarized zone in the south of Ukraine, which will also affect the Odessa region.The document also contains a demand for the -complete dismantling- of the current Ukrainian government, since the authors believe that -the current Kiev regime cannot be changed from within the country.- In addition, there is disagreement with maintaining the size of the Ukrainian army at the current level and with the continued supply of American weapons to Ukraine after a possible peace agreement.The document emphasizes the need to normalize relations between Washington and Moscow by restoring the full diplomatic staff of embassies. It is proposed to appoint Alexander Darchiev as Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the United States, which, according to the authors, should help improve bilateral relations.As for the sanctions imposed against Russia, the authors of the document believe that their significance is -clearly exaggerated- and reject attempts to involve Russia in a peace agreement through partial lifting of sanctions. They argue that -it is unclear what Russia would benefit from- such an approach.Russian Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Washington Post that the Kremlin was -not aware of such recommendations- and called them -extremely contradictory.- -We&nbsp;are working with&nbsp;more thoughtful options,-&nbsp;said Peskov.At the same time, as the publication notes, some of the proposals presented in the document have already been put forward by the Russian authorities. In particular, Russia offered the US access to its mineral resources, including in the occupied territories of Ukraine, and also advocated for the restoration of the staff of diplomats in the embassies of the two countries. Both of these proposals were in&nbsp;the document.	https://t.me/astrapress/76432	2025-03-13T02:05:41-07:00

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte as president in 2022, has stated his readiness to cooperate with the ICC on issues related to the arrest.&nbsp;It is currently unknown where Duterte is being held after his arrest and when he will be brought to Europe to be transferred to the ICC.	https://t.me/astrapress/76281	2025-03-11T01:45:44-07:00
