In Finland, DSRG -Rusich- fighter Jan Petrovsky was sentenced to life imprisonment for war crimes in UkraineThe Helsinki District Court sentenced Russian Jan Petrovsky (Vojislav Torden) to life imprisonment, finding him guilty of committing war crimes in Ukraine, reportedHelsingin Sanomat. His defense intends to appeal the verdict.Petrovsky was charged with five war crimes committed in 2014, when he fought on the side of the pro-Russian militants, being the deputy commander of the sabotage and assault reconnaissance group -Rusich-:üí´ Ambush on the Ukrainian military - Petrovsky‚Äôs unit lured Ukrainian soldiers using Ukrainian flag, after which they opened fire. More than 20 people died.üí´ Execution of the wounded - after the battle, a group under the command of Petrovsky finished off the surviving Ukrainian soldiers, which is contrary to the rules of war.üí´ Abuse of prisoners - one of the wounded Ukrainian soldiers was mutilated: the -Rusich- emblem was cut out on his face.üí´ Desecration of the bodies of the dead - Petrovsky posed with the bodies of killed Ukrainian soldiers, photographed them and distributed the pictures on social networks.üí´ Calls for cruelty - before committing the crimes, he made statements from which it followed that his unit did not take prisoners and did not show mercy.Petrovsky himself rejected all accusations, claiming that he did not hold command positions and did not participate in battles, but only made propaganda videos.Petrovsky, known by the nickname Slavyan, was born in 1987 and spent his childhood in St. Petersburg. In 2004, his mother married a Norwegian citizen and moved to Oslo. 16-year-old Petrovsky moved there with her. Later, he began to come to Russia, where he met the leader of the neo-Nazi DSRG -Rusich- and former paratrooper Alexei Milchakov.In 2014, they went to fight in Donbass on the side of Russia. In September of the same year, near the village of Shchastya in the Lugansk region, Rusich militants ambushed and defeated a column of the Aidar battalion. Milchakov, who took part in this, openly told how he took pictures with the bodies of dead Ukrainian soldiers, and the Rusich fighters cut off some of the ears.In 2016, Petrovsky was deported from Norway to Russia, here he changed his first and last name to Vojislav Torden. In 2023, his wife received permission to study in Finland, and he was allowed into the country after her, given a residence permit. Petrovsky entered Finland, but was later detained at Helsinki airport before flying to Nice.In December 2023, the Supreme Court of Finland&nbsp;refused&nbsp;Ukraine to extradite Petrovsky due to conditions in Ukrainian prisons, which the European Court of Human Rights found to violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of torture).	https://t.me/astrapress/76528	2025-03-14T01:38:06-07:00

But there are nuances. What will we do with the wedge site in the Kursk region? If we stop hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who remained there will leave without a fight?

üñº - Dismantling of the Kyiv regime - Russia can propose at negot...	-Dismantling the Kyiv regime- can be proposed by Russia at the negotiations, - The Washington Post-An influential Moscow think tank, closely associated with the Russian FSB,- has prepared a document with maximalist demands aimed at achieving Moscow‚Äôs strategic goals in the Ukrainian conflict, writes The Washington Post. According to the publication, the document was prepared in February, a week before the negotiations between Russia and the USA, held on February 18 in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.According to information received by journalists from European intelligence sources, the document proposals from the administration of US President Donald Trump to end the war in Ukraine within 100 days, as well as plans to send peacekeepers to the region, are rejected. Instead, it is argued that -a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis cannot occur until 2026.-The authors of the document insist on official recognition of Russian sovereignty over the occupied territories of Ukraine. In addition, it is proposed to create a buffer zone in the north-east of Ukraine, adjacent to the Bryansk and Belgorod regions of Russia, as well as a demilitarized zone in the south of Ukraine, which will also affect the Odessa region.The document also contains a demand for the -complete dismantling- of the current Ukrainian government, since the authors believe that -the current Kiev regime cannot be changed from within the country.- In addition, there is disagreement with maintaining the size of the Ukrainian army at the current level and with the continued supply of American weapons to Ukraine after a possible peace agreement.The document emphasizes the need to normalize relations between Washington and Moscow by restoring the full diplomatic staff of embassies. It is proposed to appoint Alexander Darchiev as Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the United States, which, according to the authors, should help improve bilateral relations.As for the sanctions imposed against Russia, the authors of the document believe that their significance is -clearly exaggerated- and reject attempts to involve Russia in a peace agreement through partial lifting of sanctions. They argue that -it is unclear what Russia would benefit from- such an approach.Russian Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Washington Post that the Kremlin was -not aware of such recommendations- and called them -extremely contradictory.- -We&nbsp;are working with&nbsp;more thoughtful options,-&nbsp;said Peskov.At the same time, as the publication notes, some of the proposals presented in the document have already been put forward by the Russian authorities. In particular, Russia offered the US access to its mineral resources, including in the occupied territories of Ukraine, and also advocated for the restoration of the staff of diplomats in the embassies of the two countries. Both of these proposals were in&nbsp;the document.	https://t.me/astrapress/76432	2025-03-13T02:05:41-07:00

The arrest is related to charges of crimes against humanity committed during his anti-drug campaign, reports the Associated Press. According to human rights activists, more than 12 thousand people were killed in anti-drug operations during Duterte's presidency from 2016 to 2022.&nbsp;In 2019, Duterte removed the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the Rome Statute, under which the ICC operates, so Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Panelo, called the arrest illegal. However, the court stated that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed up to that point - from November 1, 2011 to March 16, 2019 inclusive.&nbsp;The detainee's daughter, Sara Duterte, is the vice president of the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte as president in 2022, has stated his readiness to cooperate with the ICC on issues related to the arrest.&nbsp;It is currently unknown where Duterte is being held after his arrest and when he will be brought to Europe to be transferred to the ICC.	https://t.me/astrapress/76281	2025-03-11T01:45:44-07:00

Before being sent to Ukraine, F-16 fighters were equipped with electronic warfare systems, including AN/ALQ-131 suspended containers and PIDS+ and ECIPS+ systems. The cessation of supplies of spare parts and software for these systems significantly reduces the combat capabilities of Ukrainian aircraft, says Forbes analysts.In response to this situation, Ukraine is looking for alternative solutions.

These aircraft can partially compensate for the loss of combat capabilities of the F-16.&nbsp;Earlier, in August 2024, the White House refused to send American specialists to maintain the F-16 in Ukraine for security reasons, fearing a possible escalation of the conflict.	https://t.me/astrapress/76125	2025-03-09T09:54:00-07:00

Despite this, on March 7, Georgescu filed his candidacy for the upcoming elections, collecting more than 324,000 signatures in his support.&nbsp;The Constitutional Court decision on March 8 clears the way for Georgescu to participate in the elections on May 4, if his candidacy is approved by the Central Electoral Bureau. However, his participation remains in doubt due to the ongoing criminal investigation and preventive measures imposed against him, including a ban on leaving the country and publishing xenophobic content on the Internet.&nbsp;The political crisis in Romania intensified after the resignation of President Klaus Iohannis on February 10, 2025. Iohannis resigned to avoid impeachment proceedings initiated by the opposition after the election results were annulled. Senate President Ilie Bolojan was appointed acting president.	https://t.me/astrapress/76116	2025-03-09T05:48:00-07:00
