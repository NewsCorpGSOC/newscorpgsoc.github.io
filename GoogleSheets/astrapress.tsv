Sledkom became interested in the caseAfter information spread in local public pages that a 16-year-old girl was forcibly married by her parents to a 24-year-old man, the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered to open a criminal case on the fact of forced marriage and restriction of freedom of a minor. This was reported by the department's press service.&nbsp;The incident occurred in February 2024. The girl refused to marry by consent, after which her parents, belonging to the Yazidi community, allegedly beat her and forcibly took her to the groom's house, where she was deprived of freedom, the opportunity to study and communicate with relatives and friends.&nbsp;The marriage was concluded only according to tradition, but not in the registry office.Girl's friends toldE1 that she was under constant control in her husband's house, she was forbidden to continue her studies, her phone was monitored and she was forbidden to leave the house. Five years ago, the groom's family already a tragedy occurred: the man's younger sister committed suicide at the age of 16 when they tried to marry her off to a 50-year-old man.&nbsp;The girl's relatives claim that she was happy in her marriage, calling the accusations -slander.- The head of the public organization -Yazidis of the Urals,- Georgy Asoev, said that the couple lives in peace and harmony, and called the complaints -nonsense.- He emphasized that in the 21st century, forced marriage is impossible, and called not to interfere in family affairs.&nbsp;Nurzida Bensgier, director of the Interethnic Information Center in Yekaterinburg, also commented on the situation. She noted that in diasporas outside their country, the desire to preserve national identity, faith and traditions is especially pronounced, especially in matters of marriage and funerals.&nbsp;According to a study by the human rights organization Ad Rem published in 2024, 4,453 marriages involving underage girls were registered in the country in 2021 alone. However, official statistics do not reflect the real scale of the problem, since many such unions are not officially registered.Yazidis are an ethno-confessional group of Kurds living mainly in northwestern Iraq, northern and northeastern Syria. In Russia, according to the 2010 census, there are more than 40 thousand of them.	https://t.me/astrapress/75421	2025-02-27T01:51:34-08:00

Previously, the Moscow Garrison Military Court acquitted Mrishchuk and other defendants in the case on charges of creating a criminal community, but the Second Western District Military Court overturned the acquittal and sent the case for review.According to the investigation, the PMC -ENOT- was created by Roman Telenkevich, known under the call sign -Vodyanoy-.

Other victims cannot receive compensation almost a yearA serviceman from Orsk, Alexander L., recorded a video message in which he stated that after losing his home due to the flood in April 2024 and receiving a certificate for a new one, he was deprived of both his old home and the opportunity to purchase a new home. After the flood, the commission declared Alexander's housing unfit for habitation and subject to demolition, after which he was given a certificate for the purchase of new housing. Having concluded a purchase and sale agreement, he transferred the old house into the ownership of the city and went to war. It later turned out that the certificate was canceled and the purchase and sale transaction was declared invalid. As a result, Alexander was left homeless.In his video message to Vladimir Putin and the Chairman of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, Alexander stated: -At a time when I am defending the Fatherland, Russia, the officials of Orsk made me homeless.-The situation was complicated by the fact that the house in which Alexander lived consisted of two halves with different owners. The neighbors decided to carry out a major overhaul of their part, while Alexander sought to demolish his half. This disagreement led to a legal conflict, as a result of which the certificate for new housing was canceled.The head of Orsk, Artem Vorobyov, responded to the video message on his Telegram channel, noting that such cases after a flood are not uncommon and are usually resolved in court. He assured that, together with the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the regional Ministry of Construction, all possible measures are being taken to restore Alexander‚Äôs rights. -It cannot be otherwise,- Vorobiev emphasized. Chairman of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin instructed the regional department of the Investigative Committee to conduct an investigation into this fact and provide a report on the activities carried out.Soon Vorobiev recorded another video message, saying that he had found a solution to safely resolve the situation, but did not provide details.At the same time, the problems of other residents of Orsk, left without housing, remain unresolved.April 8 2024, more than a hundred residents of Orsk came out to a rally to the local administration building, protesting against insufficient compensation and the inaction of the authorities. The protesters demanded a review of the terms of payments and acceleration of the process of providing assistance. In response to this, the governor of the Orenburg region, Denis Pasler, promised to double regional payments.At the end of May 2024, residents of Orsk also claimed that they did not receive compensation. They complained about the same in August. Their problems were not solved either in one day or in several months.

The study covers sentences under five articles of the Criminal Code related to murder handed down between 2022 and 2025. However, given that some cases are still pending and detailed data is not available for a number of convictions, the actual number of victims may be higher.&nbsp;According to the study, Russian courts handed down 225 verdicts in cases of murders committed by former combatants in Ukraine. The geography of crimes covers 62 regions of the country. The largest number of victims was recorded in the Krasnodar Territory and the Kostroma Region - 14 people in each region. In the Rostov region, 12 people died at the hands of those returning from the war, in the Trans-Baikal Territory - 10, in the Krasnoyarsk Territory - 9. In the Volgograd and Perm regions, 8 victims were registered each.&nbsp;The victims of these crimes are not only relatives or acquaintances of former military personnel, but also random people: children, pensioners, passers-by. In some cases, the defendants are charged with additional charges related to rape and robbery. Courts often consider participation in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine as a mitigating circumstance, and awards and certificates received at the front as a positive characteristic of the defendant‚Äôs personality.	https://t.me/astrapress/75228	2025-02-24T09:36:17-08:00

Since the start of the war in Russia, the number of political persecutions has almost doubled - report Avtozak LiveFrom 2022 to 2024, the number of political persecutions in Russia almost doubled - from 1265 to 2373 cases. At the same time, the average time for consideration of politically motivated cases has also decreased significantly, the Avtozak Live team found out.According to their data, from February 24, 2022 to February 9, 2025, more than 5,400 politically motivated criminal cases were initiated under 146 articles of the criminal code against 5,254 people, at least 2,940 of whom are now in custody. In more than 1,900 cases, cases against the persecuted were initiated under two or more articles.&nbsp;The most charges - 16 - were brought against Andrei Pronsky, who is accused of preparing an attempt on the life of Vladimir Solovyov. The remaining nine defendants in this case are charged with 15 articles each.One of the most common articles for political persecution in Russia is Article 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Terrorist Act-). According to it, people are regularly imprisoned for arson of military registration and enlistment offices and other damage to military infrastructure. Also, this article often prosecutes victims of telephone scammers who convince people to participate in arson.The number of criminal cases against minors increased significantly with the start of the war. In 2024, 177 cases were opened, mainly on charges of preparing terrorist acts, sabotage and rehabilitation of Nazism. The youngest accused was a 14-year-old girl who fried sausages on the Eternal Flame in Ruza.Avtozak Live notes that with the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine repressions became more brutal and widespread.	https://t.me/astrapress/75226	2025-02-24T09:02:18-08:00

A measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico amid the growing popularity of the anti-vaccination movement - almost 100 cases90 cases of infection have been confirmed in Texas, nine in New Mexico. The highest number of cases is in Gaines County, where the vaccination rate is below the state average.The outbreak began in the South Plains region of Texas in late January, the state Department of Health Services said. According to the latest data, among the 90 cases, 77 are children. 16 people are hospitalized.In New Mexico, infections were reported in Lee County, which borders the epicenter of the outbreak in Texas, the local Department of Health said. Nine people fell ill there, including four children.Local services are urgently setting up additional vaccination and testing points to contain the spread of infection. Free vaccinations are available in Seminole (Gaines County, Texas) and Lee County (New Mexico). Additional testing sites have also opened in these areas.Measles is considered one of the most contagious infections, and outbreaks occur when herd immunity levels fall below 95%. In Gaines County, the rate is significantly lower: last year, only 82% of children received the two required doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.Vaccine refusal rates are on the rise in the region. In Texas, the law allows for -conscientious objection- to vaccinate a child, and in Gaines County, 13% of students exercised this right.The situation is complicated by the appointment of Robert Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health. Kennedy is known to be skeptical of vaccines and cited controversial studies about their possible side effects. He has already stated that he intends to review the childhood vaccination system.In the United States, measles was officially considered eliminated, but due to a decrease in the level of vaccination, cases of the disease are being recorded more and more often. In 2024, the country reported 285 cases of measles in more than 30 states.	https://t.me/astrapress/75108	2025-02-22T20:50:01-08:00

In the Kirov region, a cleaner was convicted for commenting about a deceased participant in the war in UkraineThe Kirov regional court sentenced the cleaner Raisa Novoselova, convicting her for insulting the memory of defenders of the Fatherland (Part 4 of Article 354.1 of the Criminal Code), writes the SOVA research center. The woman received a six-month suspended sentence and a ban on publishing materials on the Internet for a year. The verdict was handed down on January 15, 2025.The reason for the criminal prosecution was a comment published by Novoselova under a post about a serviceman who died in the war in Ukraine. -The comment contained linguistic and psychological signs of humiliation of the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces who died during a special military operation,- says the published decision of the court.Novoselova admitted her guilt and asked to consider the case in a special manner without examining the evidence. The case was opened in October 2024, after the regional department of the Investigative Committee reported the publication of a comment that, in their opinion, expressed disrespect and insult to the fallen defenders of the Fatherland. The SOVA Research Center considered the actions of law enforcement agencies unnecessary, noting that the relatives of the deceased could have filed a civil lawsuit to protect their honor and dignity, rather than resort to criminal prosecution.	https://t.me/astrapress/75071	2025-02-22T01:05:09-08:00

My work is related to theoretical mathematics, which has no military application,- she said in an interview with Sveriges Radio.The girl previously worked at Skoltech, which is under US and EU sanctions and, according to the US, allegedly collaborated with the Russian military.Rudneva admits that she is defending her dissertation at the Higher School of Economics, which cooperates with Skoltech, but claims that this is necessary to complete it work.At Skoltech itself, according to the educational institution‚Äôs website, Rudneva was listed as a research intern at the Krichever Center for Advanced Study from 2018 to 2022 and worked on a dissertation on the topic -Asymmetric vertex models and stochastic integrable processes.-The Swedish Migration Service refused to discuss individual cases. The country's security service said in an interview with Sveriges Radio that -their decisions are based on a comprehensive assessment of various factors- and that their task is -to ensure the protection of valuable technologies and research.-Rudneva appealed the deportation decision.-This research does not pose a threat.

Journalists calculated that 3,205 Russian military personnel were seriously injured, 37,567 people were moderately injured, and 63,821 people were lightly injured. -In field hospitals, everything is recorded clearly. And in hospital cases, sometimes they underestimate the severity in order to quickly return the wounded to the front, [and to save on] insurance payments,- commented Zhilyaev. Also, -Radio Liberty- clarifies that the total number of those wounded in the war cannot be determined from these data, since it does not record cases when military personnel were returned to the front after treatment for minor injuries.For some military personnel who drank or took drugs, the diagnosis is -acute oral poisoning with an unknown substance,- -poisoning with unknown narcotic substances,- -acute poisoning with an alcohol-containing liquid.- -One day a lieutenant was brought to our hospital. He said he drank four shots of cognac. He developed pulmonary edema. The diagnosis is -poisoning with an unknown substance.- As I understand it, the resistance of the population [in Ukraine] is also manifested through such cases,- Zhilyaev said.Mediazona and BBC Russian Service found out that the number of dead Russian soldiers since February 24, 2022 reached 95,026.

Among them was Colonel Sergei Atroshchenko, commander of military unit 75387, 960th assault aviation regiment, who in Ukraine is called the man who gave orders to bomb the drama theater, maternity hospital, children's hospital and other objects in Mariupol. He was awarded the rank of Colonel General. In 2023, the Ukrainian project Informnapal wrote that hackers hacked Atroshchenko's email and obtained lists of his subordinates and other information. -The number one killer of Mariupol residents has been identified.

In December 2022, a man volunteered to fight in Ukraine. She told ASTRA that Mashlyakevich had no problems at work until he was late for -some assignment- in October 2024. After that, they tried to force him to purchase a UAV (presumably a Mavik quadcopter) worth 200 thousand rubles for the needs of a motorized rifle unit with his own money. The serviceman refused, citing the fact that he was not part of this unit; Denis served with the tank crews. They continued to put pressure on him.It is known that Denis went to the bank together with another military unit, Azamat, who demanded money from him. There, 200 thousand rubles were withdrawn from his account, which is confirmed by a bank statement.Then the serviceman was illegally detained somewhere in the -DPR-, shot in both hands with a pneumatic weapon and his phone was taken away. One bullet got stuck in his right hand, which led to problems with his fingers - pain and limited mobility.During this period, several large debits were made from his accounts: three payments of 305,970 rubles and another in the amount of 81,592 rubles. The recipient of the payment is a certain -Azamat B.-After these events, one of Denis‚Äôs colleagues warned him that they wanted to -nullify- him‚Äîto remove him as an unnecessary witness. Fearing for his life, Mashlyakevich left military unit 91714 in November to officially contact the prosecutor's office. According to the girl, he was not hiding and was at the place of registration, awaiting official proceedings.The prosecutor's office promised that the investigation would begin on February 1, but on January 27, Denis was detained by unknown people in civilian clothes and in civilian cars: they tied him up with force right near the house, although he did not resist. After the arrest, a hematoma formed on Mashlyakevich‚Äôs face. Denis‚Äôs girlfriend claims that those who arrived pointed weapons at them, after which they took Denis to the unit.-They wanted to send him to the contact line the very next day, but on 28 we went to the prosecutor‚Äôs office, they called the unit, and Denis‚Äôs phone was returned. He was in touch. We even came to the unit and were allowed to see each other. Then messages began to arrive that Denis was being -taken away-, that he was -going there-, they wrote that he was on the front line somewhere wearing arm guards. Since then there has been no contact with Denis,- says the girlfriend of the missing serviceman.The relatives demand a fair trial and punishment for the perpetrators, but all requests are answered with replies.

Zarema Musayeva will remain in custody until March 26Today, February 20, the Sheikh-Mansurovsky District Court of Grozny extended the preventive measure for Zarema Musayeva, leaving her in custody until March 26. It was expected that by this time her term of imprisonment in the first criminal case should have expired - March 23, 2025.However, a new criminal case was opened against Musaeva. She is accused of disorganizing the activities of a colony (Part 3, Article 321 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), for which she could face up to five years in prison.Musaeva‚Äôs lawyer, Alexander Savin, said that her client continues to have health problems, including due to diabetes.

The exercise commander was fined two hundred thousand rubles for an explosion at the training ground that injured two cadets The Vladimir Garrison Military Court fined Captain Denis Vonotkov, commander of the military training tank regiment, two hundred thousand rubles Part 30616-7, in a case of violation of the rules for handling weapons, resulting in serious harm to health (Part 1 of Article 349 of the Criminal Code). Mediazona reports this with reference to the press service of the court. During exercises at the Sergeytsevo training ground, Vonotkov tied together imitation IM-100 cartridges in pairs, intensifying the explosion. He did not fence off the dangerous area and incorrectly calculated the distance, which is why the explosion occurred under the rear of the infantry fighting vehicle, where the cadets were located. As a result, Zemskov received a mine explosion injury with severe injuries, and Ivashchenko received fractures and hematomas. -This explosion stunned him [Ivashchenko], and he experienced a state of shock, the doors of the BMP-1 opened from the blast wave, he fell on his back from the landing compartment to the ground, after which he began to shout -really the 300th,- pointing his finger inside the landing compartment of the BMP-1, since he realized that [Zemskov] had suffered bodily harm,- the verdict says. Vonotkov admitted guilt, but refused to comment.In 2020, a junior sergeant died at the same training ground, receiving a through wound to the chest.

A resident of Cherepovets was denied an abortion in all medical institutions in the city A 38-year-old resident of Cherepovets, Natalya (name changed), was denied an abortion in antenatal clinics in the city, as well as in private clinics in Cherepovets and Vologda. According to the woman, medical institutions in the region actually stopped providing this service without official explanation. -I live in the Cherepovets region, I have three children, my youngest daughter is three years old. I planned to go to work, but found out I was pregnant. I contacted a doctor at my place of residence, but I was told that he was not responsible for performing abortions. In a private clinic they did an ultrasound, set the period at eight weeks and explained that medical termination of pregnancy at this stage is no longer possible,- Natalya told the Rech newspaper. After this, the woman tried to sign up for an operation at the city maternity hospital, but was refused. -Yesterday was the last day we performed abortions. From today we have no right,- they told her over the phone.She received a similar answer in other antenatal clinics in the city. During a personal visit to one of the consultations, Natalia was explained that at the regional level a decision had been made to recommend that all women under 50 years of age continue pregnancy. However, she was not provided with any official documents, and she was not given a written refusal to have an abortion. Later, the woman turned to the official community of the maternity hospital on the social network VKontakte with a request to explain the reasons for the refusal. In response, she was informed that -termination of pregnancy is carried out only for medical reasons in a 24-hour hospital- and that this issue is regulated at the level of the government of the Vologda region. The couple considered the possibility of leaving the child, but came to the conclusion that they would not be able to provide for him morally and financially. -My husband already works three jobs. I spent ten years on maternity leave, and now I wanted to return to my professional activities,- explained Natalya. As a result, the woman had to go to a private clinic in the Yaroslavl region, where they agreed to carry out the operation without restrictions. The cost of the procedure was about nine thousand rubles.	https://t.me/astrapress/74962	2025-02-20T08:14:45-08:00

A monument to Stalin will not be erected in Kaliningrad because of his repressions and terror The head of the Kaliningrad administration, Elena Dyatlova, rejected the proposal of the local branch of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation to erect a monument to Joseph Stalin, citing historical documents condemning the cult of personality and political repression. In a response published on the party‚Äôs website, Dyatlova noted that the installation of monuments should not lead to conflicts in society, and recalled the 1956 resolution of the CPSU Central Committee -On overcoming the cult of personality and its consequences,- as well as the law -On the rehabilitation of victims of political repression.- She emphasized that the period from the 1930s to the early 1950s is recognized as the time of Stalinist repressions, and many years of terror and persecution of citizens of the USSR were condemned as incompatible with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaw and justice.The Communist Party of the Russian Federation called Dyatlova‚Äôs position -a clear anti-Soviet position aimed at denigrating Soviet history and the great feat of the people.- The head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction in the Legislative Assembly of the Kaliningrad Region, Maxim Bulanov, said that, in his opinion, the mayor is trying to whitewash his incompetence and inaction, which led to the deplorable state of the city. He emphasized that the party will not allow history to be rewritten and evaded responsibility.In recent years, monuments to Stalin have been erected regularly in Russia. These include busts and full-length monuments. In November-December 2024 alone, three monuments to Stalin were erected - in the Primorsky Territory, in North Ossetia and in the Vologda region. There are more than a hundred of them in total.Elena Dyatlova has held the post of mayor of Kaliningrad since November 2020 and at the same time heads the city branch of the United Russia party.	https://t.me/astrapress/74937	2025-02-20T03:19:15-08:00

They gave the most precious thing - their lives, so that we could live in a free state. It was during these days of 2014 that Russia chose war and began the first steps to occupy Crimea. While people were being killed in Kyiv, and people were defending their freedom, Putin decided to strike another blow - a very vile one. Since then, the world has been living in a new reality, where Russia is trying to deceive everyone. And it is very important not to give in, to be together.

Because of this, people cannot buy housing. In addition, residents say that 150 thousand rubles, which were paid one-time to people who lost property, turned out to be -disproportionate to the damage.- Therefore, they are asking for a monthly payment of 65 thousand rubles, as was done for the residents of Kursk.-Our village has actually been erased from the map, but we remain citizens of Russia and ask not for alms, but for justice.
