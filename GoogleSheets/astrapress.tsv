ASTRA: The owner of the tanker -Volgoneft 239- was fined 300 thousand rubles for violating technical regulationsThe Arbitration Court of the Krasnodar Territory made a decision in the case of violation of technical regulations by the owner of the tanker -Volgoneft 239-, which wreckedin the Kerch Strait. The company Volgatransneft CJSC was fined 300 thousand rubles. The court found the company guilty of violating the rules for operating mixed-type vessels, since the tanker continued to sail after the expiration of the season and outside the established navigation area, which is contrary to the requirements of Russian legislation.CJSC Volgatransneft plans to appeal the decision.-Guilty is proven when the shipowner has the opportunity to fulfill the requirements of the law, but did not comply with them. We referred in court to the fact that we did not have the opportunity to comply with these legal requirements. We believe that it is not entirely correct to place all the blame on the shipowner for this situation, because, firstly, on December 5, the ship was released on the instructions of the captain of the port of Kavkaz. The passage as part of a caravan was allowed, and after crossing the Kerch Strait, the ship, without unloading, could no longer return back to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov under any circumstances,- RIA Novosti quotes company representative Olga Pautova.An environmental disaster in the Black Sea occurred on December 15, 2024 in the Kerch Strait, when two tankers, Volgoneft 212- and -Volgoneft 239-, transporting fuel oil, crashed. As a result of the incident, significant pollution of the sea occurred: about 2.4 thousand tons of fuel oil got into the waters of the strait from four damaged tanks about 2.4 thousand tons of fuel oil. This led to the release of oil products on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory and the Crimean Peninsula, which provoked the introduction of emergency regimes both at regional level, and at federal.	https://t.me/astrapress/74453	2025-02-14T04:43:29-08:00

An official from Komi, accused of corruption, asks to go to war with UkraineFormer first deputy head of the administration of the city of Pechora in the Komi Republic, Andrei Kanishchev, who is under investigation on charges of corruption, signed a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense and expressed his intention to go to the zone of a special military operation in Ukraine. A corresponding petition to suspend the criminal case was received by the Pechora City Court, but at the moment it has not yet been considered, local media writes. &nbsp;Kanishchev is accused of receiving a bribe on an especially large scale and exceeding official authority. According to investigators, he, together with the former mayor of Pechora Valery Serov, received a bribe in the amount of four million rubles from a commercial company for assistance in concluding a government contract to carry out work to improve the city.&nbsp;At the time of the initiation of this criminal case, Kanishchev was already in custody on another charge. In February 2024, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for intentionally causing grievous bodily harm, negligently resulting in the death of the victim. In August 2022, Kanishchev hit sound engineer Viktor Fateev during a fire show on the main stage of Pechora, which led to his death.&nbsp;The case of Kanishchev is notsingle. Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 108 Russian officials and deputies have declared their desire to go to the front. Of these, 70 did this voluntarily, and 18, who were under criminal prosecution, chose to avoid it by signing contracts with the Ministry of Defense. The remaining 20 people subsequently abandoned their intentions.In March 2023, the mayor of Vorkuta, Yaroslav Shaposhnikov, announced that he would go to war in Ukraine. But he did this only after 118 days, citing the fact that the then acting head of Komi, Vladimir Uyba, asked him to stay.In May 2023, the acting Minister of Health of Komi, Igor Diaghilev, voluntarily went to the front, where he worked as a traumatologist in a military hospital. A year and a half later, in October 2024, after his return, he was appointed deputy prime minister of the government of the republic.The former first deputy head of the administration of Syktyvkar, Alexander Mozhegov, also found himself in the combat zone. The reasons for his participation in the war were not officially reported.Another official from Komi, ex-head of the Kortkeros district Alexander Arteev, came to the front from a penal colony. In 2023, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting bribes. In July 2024, his death became known.	https://t.me/astrapress/74450	2025-02-14T03:33:07-08:00

A resident of a Chechen village who killed his daughter-in-law went to war with Ukraine instead of punishmentA 46-year-old resident of the Chechen village of Bachi-Yurt, Ruslan Umayev, accused of murdering his 22-year-old daughter-in-law Kristina Kokova, was released from the pre-trial detention center and aimed at war against Ukraine. This was reported by the mother of the murdered girl, Anastasia Kokova.According to her information, on February 11, after the next meeting of the Shalinsky City Court of Chechnya, Umayev was sent to a military unit. It is expected that in two weeks he will be sent to an assault unit at the front.&nbsp;-The killer wants to go, as he said at the trial, to defend our homeland. &lt;...&gt; And this is not an isolated case, such scum are still released to this day in the -SVO-, for whom it is 50/50 whether they will be lucky or not to return from there alive. And they will also be heroes. These animals who kill other people's children rather than protect them are not heroes. And they are not worthy of awards,- Anastasia believes.Earlier, Anastasia Kokova appealed to the Russian Prosecutor General's Office with a request to prevent Umaev from concluding a contract with the Ministry of Defense, fearing that he would escape punishment for the crime he committed. Kokova‚Äôs lawyer also expressed concern that the accused could go to war without a record of conviction for murder.&nbsp;Now Kokova has again sent complaints to the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office and Vladimir Putin.A resident of the Moscow region town of Lobnya, Kristina Kokova, married Akhmed Umaev, the son of Ruslan Umaev, in 2020. After moving to Chechnya, she gave birth to a daughter, but soon began to complain of physical violence from her husband and pressure from her mother-in-law. After the divorce, the relatives of her ex-husband prevented her from communicating with her daughter, and her father-in-law Ruslan Umayev controlled and persecuted her, threatening to prohibit meetings with the child.&nbsp;In September 2024, Christina stopped communicating. After the search began, Ruslan Umayev admitted that he strangled her in her sleep with a rope and then tried to burn the body. He indicated the -immoral behavior- of his daughter-in-law as the motive. The mother of the deceased believes that Umaev killed her daughter to hide traces of sexual violence - traces of sperm were found on the bed where the murder was committed, but an examination was never ordered.	https://t.me/astrapress/74439	2025-02-14T01:16:16-08:00

The military prosecutor's office proved massive falsification of contracts for conscripts near ChebarkulThe military prosecutor's office conducted an inspection in five military units of the Chebarkul division and proved massive falsification of contracts for conscripts, reports the human rights organization -Conscript School-. The command of the unit deceived soldiers in order to fulfill the plan for recruiting contract soldiers.The claims began in the fall of 2024, when conscripts began to complain about forged contracts. Relatives of the soldiers reported that the command used various pretexts to force them to sign contracts. They promised that the recruits would remain to serve in the rear if they signed the papers, but later they were sent to war.The military prosecutor's office of the Chebarkul garrison confirmed that the command of military units 86274, 87441, 93992, 89547 and 31612 deceived soldiers, forged signatures and forced them to sign contracts under false pretenses. For example, in unit 87441 conscripts were forced to sign a contract without preparation, and in other cases contracts were signed without the knowledge of the soldiers.Conscript School lawyer Timofey Vaskin commented on the situation: -The prosecutor‚Äôs office did not say a word about the violation of conscripts‚Äô rights. But they said that there is public outcry and discontent; parents are writing complaints to the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the president.

The document provides for the release from punishment of persons convicted for the first time for intentional crimes of minor and moderate gravity, as well as certain categories of citizens, including combatants, home front workers, minors, pregnant women and disabled people of groups I and II.&nbsp;However, the draft contains exceptions for a number of articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, to which the amnesty does not apply. Among them are articles 280.3 (repeated discrediting of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation), 207.3 (public dissemination of knowingly false information about the use of the RF Armed Forces) and 205.2 (public calls for terrorist activities or public justification of terrorism). Thus, persons convicted under these articles are not subject to the proposed amnesty, even if they belong to preferential categories such as pregnant women, single parents or pensioners.Previously, some deputies from the United Russia party expressed the opinion that holding an amnesty this year is inappropriate, since the convicts can -atone for their guilt- by signing a contract and going to war with Ukraine.Last A large-scale amnesty in Russia, dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Victory, was carried out in 2015 and affected about 60 thousand people sentenced to imprisonment and up to 200 thousand suspended sentences.&nbsp;The final decision on the amnesty and its conditions will be made after consideration and discussion of the project in the State Duma.	https://t.me/astrapress/74371	2025-02-13T00:20:21-08:00

The document says that Russia is arming itself and increasing its capabilities for a potential armed confrontation with Western countries - however, this does not mean that the decision to start such a war has been made. The authors of the report believe that Russia's readiness to take more risky actions regarding NATO may increase if Russia considers the alliance weakened and disunited, or is confident that the United States will not help Europe. If the war in Ukraine ends, the Russian Federation may free up military resources and, in about six months, enter into a local conflict with one of the NATO countries. In 2 years, Russia may pose a threat to one or more states in the Baltic Sea. About five years after the end of the war with Ukraine, Russia may be ready for a full-scale war in Europe, an intelligence report says.	https://t.me/astrapress/74320	2025-02-12T01:16:34-08:00

Despite the dissuadings of Olga Arnold's mother, the man wanted to atone for his guilt with blood and help his daughter, who is now one year and 8 months old. About this case wrote tg channel -Mobilization of the DPR Live-, the information was confirmed by ASTRA. Ilya ended up in military unit 41698, 5th brigade of the 3rd motorized rifle battalion, company -B-. On a combat mission in September, he was wounded in both legs: a through wound to the left leg, shrapnel, and fractures; right leg - patella, tendon, damaged main nerve, fragments, fracture. The man was sent to the 14th hospital in Donetsk, and then taken to a medical facility in Dokuchaevsk. There, Ilya was put in a basement, beaten and forced to transfer money to commanders. -On October 13, medic Maxim takes him to Dokuchaevsk. There they threatened to knock out his teeth with a hammer, they kept him in handcuffs, it was terrible. Unoperated, he was taken to the hospital because a complication had developed, but they only sutured his soft tissues - nothing more,- the soldier‚Äôs mother, Olga Arnold, told ASTRA.From the hospital, the man was again taken to the basement of the medical unit, where his condition worsened again and he was sent to the 15th hospital in Donetsk for rehabilitation. After this, Ilya is transferred to Kurakhovo, put in a pit, and then sent on a combat mission to the village. Gluboky (30 km from Donetsk). Arnold's mother says that the commander he came across saw Ilya's condition and canceled his participation in the assault. Medics arrived at the scene and took the wounded man to the village of Peski, where Ilya ended up in a basement in which there were 15 other wounded people. Arnold's mother claims that in this place the medic Maxim from the medical unit collects the wounded, including those who walk on crutches, and again sends them to the assaults. From this basement on February 8, the man managed to record video messages for his mother. -All the wounded here walk on crutches, here everyone is sent to the front line. Yesterday they brought the boys, they can‚Äôt walk - they‚Äôre on crutches, and they were simply sent to the front. This Maxim is a complete asshole. I shake every day so that they don‚Äôt send me there, I can‚Äôt run, I can‚Äôt walk well. If I were healthy, I would of course go, I‚Äôm not afraid of anything, I‚Äôve been there twice, but at least I could get treatment,- says Ilya in his video from the basement. Ilya‚Äôs mother filed complaints with the Investigative Committee, the prosecutor‚Äôs office, the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation and other departments, but this did not produce any results. She herself went to the headquarters in Makeevka to write a complaint against the commander of the military unit, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Demkovsky. Unit inspector Anna (her full name is not disclosed) helped Olga, for which she was sent to the assault and was wounded. -They took me out in a serious condition with the replenishment of my lungs and I was declared in SOCH (unauthorized abandonment of the unit) as a criminal, although everyone saw the condition. And my commander is the same as Ilya‚Äôs, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Demkovsky. You send threats to him and not to me, I already helped you in any way I could, for which I paid,- wrote Anna to Ilya‚Äôs mother.After this, Olga received death threats and she had to urgently leave Makeyevka. Now she is threatened with the murder of her son if she does not stop talking about the situation, but the mother demands that her son be taken to Russia for surgery and sent to the N.N. Priorov hospital. At the same time, the woman is caring for Ilya‚Äôs daughter - the girl‚Äôs mother Daria Kolpak abandoned the child.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/74211	2025-02-10T13:32:22-08:00

‚Ü©Ô∏è Ukrainian counterattacks slowed down the Russian offensive, - ...	ASTRA: During the day, the Ukrainian Armed Forces advanced 5 kilometers southeast of Sudzha during a new offensive in the Kursk region. This is reported by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and Russian Z-channels. Ukrainian counterattacks slowed Russian offensive, - Le FigaroBy according tothe French newspaper Le Figaro, in January the pace of the offensive of Russian troops in Ukraine slowed down. If in December Russian forces captured 416 km¬≤, and in November - 714 km¬≤, then in January this figure was only 331 km¬≤. Despite ongoing fighting in the Donbass, where Russia has captured the towns of Kurakhovo and, most recently, Toretsk, Ukrainian defenses are holding their ground.Ukrainian forces are launching counterattacks along the entire front, including the Kursk region, where a successful Ukrainian offensive last August led to the capture of more than 1,000 km¬≤ in ten days. Russia has since gradually reclaimed the territory, reducing the Ukrainian overhang in the area to 430 km¬≤.In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has resumed counter-offensives, advancing several kilometers south of the town of Suzhda, easing the threat to Ukrainian positions in the area. Although the Ukrainian offensives are not yet as large-scale, the capture of several small villages, such as Kolmakov and Cherkasskaya Konopelka, strengthens Ukraine's position and could play an important role in possible negotiations with Russia and the United States, as Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky hopes, the publication notes.	https://t.me/astrapress/74193	2025-02-10T01:29:57-08:00

The Marines of the 155th Brigade also mentioned Akhmedov in their complaint to the governor of Primorsky Krai, in which they expressed dissatisfaction with the command and huge losses near Pavlovka in Donetsk region.In December 2023, Putin signed a decree awarding Akhmedov the rank of lieutenant general.	https://t.me/astrapress/74022	2025-02-07T08:48:24-08:00

How to prepare for the next one and protect yourself?Last year‚Äôs autumn conscription was the most dangerous in recent times: military commissars illegally drafted people with diagnoses into the army, raided them and sent them to serve -one day,- intimidated and used violence. It is expected that in the spring it will become even more difficult - electronic summonses, databases with data on conscripts will be used, and mobilization reservations will -burn out- (formally it is still in progress). But this is not a reason to give up. Experience shows that even in the most difficult situations you can protect your rights and remain free. The better prepared you are to communicate with the military registration and enlistment office, the higher the chances of safety.Appeal to Conscience, a human rights project that free of charge helps conscripts defend their rights through legal means, will help with this.
