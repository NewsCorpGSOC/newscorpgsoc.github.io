Consolidating the demilitarization zone- - Ukraine responded to Russian peace conditions Advisor to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak commented on the peace plan of the Russian Foreign Ministry and put forward... The very first draft of the peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine has been published. According to it, Ukraine was supposed to recognize Crimea as Russia, but later the position of the Russian Federation changedResearch project -System- (RFE/RL)&nbsp;published&nbsp;the earliest known project peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine. On March 7, for the third round of negotiations, the same peace treaty in its original form was drawn up. The document was provided to the publication by a Ukrainian source, and a Russian source confirmed its authenticity. Under the terms of the original agreement:- Ukraine must -recognize the independence- of the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk republics, and also recognize Crimea and Sevastopol as an -integral part of Russia.-- Ukraine must take bear the costs of restoring the infrastructure of Donbass, destroyed since 2014;- Ukraine must reduce the size of the army to 50,000 people, which is 5 times less than by February 24, 2022; - Ukraine is prohibited from entering into any military alliances and concluding any military agreements with other states;- Ukraine is prohibited from -developing, producing, acquiring and deploying on its territory missile weapons of any type with a firing range of more than 250 km-;- All sanctions against Russia since 2014, including Western and Ukrainian ones, must be lifted;- Russian should become one of the state languages ‚Äã‚Äãin Ukraine;- Must be canceled and no longer -any bans on symbols associated in states with the victory over Nazism- are introduced.&nbsp;That is, Soviet symbols must be allowed;- Ukraine must stop procedures for accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;In response, the Russian side promised a -ceasefire regime- and certain -measures-, and not a withdrawal of troops.&nbsp;At the same time, Russian representatives wanted to oblige the Ukrainian troops to withdraw to permanent deployment points, and all foreign specialists from the West had to leave the country, and Russian troops, together with the forces of the National Guard, were supposed to remain in positions and monitor Ukraine‚Äôs fulfillment of -all obligations under the treaty.- At the same time, in March 2024, The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;published&nbsp;draft peace agreements between Russia and Ukraine , which was discussed after negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place at the end of March in Istanbul. The document is dated April 15, 2022 and in it Russia‚Äôs position softened.According to it, it was determined that Ukraine would have a security mechanism similar to Article 5 of NATO, for which, as expected, the guarantor countries: Great Britain, China , the Russian Federation, the USA, France, Russia, Belarus, Turkey would undertake to defend Ukraine with military forces in the event of an attack.However, this point could not be agreed upon, since the wording proposed by Ukraine meant that the signatories of the agreement would be able to Ukraine as collectively and individually. Russia insisted on only collective intervention. That is, Russia itself, as a signatory to the treaty, could, in theory, veto the decision to protect Ukraine from its own attack.The clause on territorial integrity was also changed. How writes -Currently-, Ukraine, according to the April agreement, remains within its recognized borders, including Crimea, Sevastopol and some unspecified territories that are not covered by security guarantees. The communiqu√© adopted in Istanbul at the end of March indicated that the status of Crimea and Sevastopol would be resolved diplomatically.However, the document published on April 15, 2022 stated that annexed Crimea would remain under Russian control without a formal renunciation of sovereignty above it from the Ukrainian side. The future of parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions that were under Russian control until February 24, 2022, was to be determined during negotiations between the presidents of the two countries. The document did not mention the status of other territories occupied by Russia According to the WSJ, negotiations continued until June 2022 and stopped at the initiative of Ukraine. Moscow previously claimed that the negotiations ended in April.	https://t.me/astrapress/67762	2024-11-04T12:01:27-08:00

A woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison for donating seven thousand rubles to blogger Arkady BabchenkoA court in Rostov sentenced Elena Popova to 12 years in prison and a fine of 500 thousand rubles. under the article on treason.

Popova made it on February 27, 2022, reports -First department-. Popova‚Äôs cousin Tatyana believes that she was identified in the -Rozysk-Magistral- while purchasing sea tickets, since passport information is needed to purchase tickets. After searches in her own and her parents‚Äô apartments, Popova was sentenced to 10 days of administrative arrest under the article on -hooliganism.- She was accused of hooligan behavior three times and spent a total of 35 days in jail. After the third arrest, Popova was charged with treason. Tatyana calls the accusation of treason nonsense: -She made a huge number of transfers to various charitable foundations - to help women, children, animals. Hundreds of thousands in donations. In this case, the state simply took advantage of her naivety, because probably in the first days [of the war] many people transferred money to various bloggers and organizations. As a result, for seven thousand rubles - 12 years and a fine of 500 thousand.
