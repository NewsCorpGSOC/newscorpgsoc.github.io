On August 26, he decided to escape from the unit and return home. He did not tell her the reasons why he did this. He stayed at home for only a few days - soon he was stopped on the street to have his documents checked and taken to the police station. There it turned out that he was wanted.-My husband called me and said that he had been detained, so I accordingly came there. We sat in the police for two hours, the military commandant‚Äôs office arrived. He said: -Guys, I‚Äôm not going anywhere. Either I stay here or I just die.- A scuffle broke out, and eventually he was handcuffed, forced into a car, and taken to the military commandant‚Äôs office. I called the duty officer there, they don‚Äôt provide information - it‚Äôs the weekend.&nbsp;And three days later the prosecutor‚Äôs office told me that he was sent to Zaitsevo,- says Valentina.Valentina says that Alexey left at home all his personal belongings - from a military ID to a telephone, on which his comrades periodically write. Answering them, she found out that some of her husband‚Äôs colleagues also passed through Zaitsevo.-One tells me, I know what kind of place this is, I was there for two weeks. He was put there because he insulted the commander. Why, if my husband broke the law, is he not in a pre-trial detention center, but in a hole? And why are his rights not respected? They should at least have informed me as a relative that my husband was detained under such and such an article, and not torture people and mock me. They are not even allowed to go to the toilet, people walk under themselves.&nbsp;Up to 100 people sit there at a time. You wouldn‚Äôt wish this on your enemy,- Valentina told ASTRA.According to Valentina, her husband went to war not out of patriotic convictions or for the sake of money, but because -he was interested in - - he did not serve in military service for medical reasons. - When he made his choice, it was a shock for me. I couldn‚Äôt come to my senses for three days. If I had known about this in advance, I would never have let him in in my life. I don't need any blood money. And they don‚Äôt even have this money, because they provided for themselves. They bought socks, tents, food, cigarettes, some tools, pens, paid for their communications, the Internet. We bought tents so that we wouldn‚Äôt sleep on the cold ground. I think this is not normal. Why did they go to fight then? They, like patriots, went for Russia. What did you get in the end? Such an appeal? What money? What is shown on TV is all nonsense,- says Valentina.Valentina has sent appeals to the presidential administration, as well as to several deputies, but is worried that the answer to them will not arrive on time , and now -every minute counts.--I just need to get my husband out of there. Let him be punished according to the law, they will give him a prison term, but he did not deserve what is happening in Zaitsevo. I don't think anyone deserves this. I owe my husband my whole life, I cannot leave him. I've known him for over 20 years. I‚Äôm ready to do anything for him, but he needs to be pulled back out of this hole. And I don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs alive or not. My head is just a mess. But I won‚Äôt forgive myself if I don‚Äôt help him,- says Valentina.&nbsp;Throughout the entire full-scale war, ASTRA talks about illegal prisons for -refuseniks-, where military personnel i>threatsandvarious torturedforced into deadly assaults. We have already found 18such placesin the occupied territories and 1 in the territory of Russia. And also ASTRA is the only one from the media that was able to obtain and publish video from the basement of Zaitsevoand from other similar places.If you or your relative find yourself in such a situation, write to the editor: @redastrabot	https://t.me/astrapress/65695	2024-10-03T05:00:29-07:00

Moreover, the management of BRE fed them several times a month with promises of speedy payment of salaries. Thus, each editor found himself bound by obligations to the authors who wrote the articles. And now we are in an extremely cramped situation, when we find ourselves -in debt- to long-term authors, with whom we have established not only professional, but also human relationships,one of the publication‚Äôs employees told ASTRA. According to another BRE employee, other organizations cooperating with the publishing house are not receiving money now: for example, Internet providers and water utilities.From May to September 2024, BRE employees wrote about 1,000 appeals and requests to the Prosecutor General's Office, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the Government Office, the Presidential Administration, the Ministry of Digital Development, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. -We received assurances from each department that funding is being sought and is about to arrive,- says a BDT employee. ‚Äî Some people quit, but about 300 people remain on staff. For many of them, work at BRE is their only job. Of course, during this time everyone has accumulated a lot of debt on loans and mortgages. Not everyone has a part-time job.-According to her, until about mid-June, all employees continued to work as usual, but then they wrote notices that they were suspending their official duties until salaries were paid.-We wanted to organize a rally, but due to anti-Covid measures it was not approved for us, so on October 2 we held single pickets in Kitai-Gorod.

A video appeared on the Internet in which a man in civilian clothes fires a burst of pistol into the sky and dances Lezginka surrounded by other men in military uniform. As the publication -Ashes- writes... A Chechen from Akhmat threw a grenade at the car of a military man from Dagestan in the Belgorod region 35-year-old Kurban Akaev is the commander of a repair company from the 752nd regiment, which is based in the city of Valuiki. Kurban is Dargin by origin. When asked by an ASTRA correspondent whether his nationality is the cause of the conflict, Kurban replies-I didn‚Äôt have any conflict with him.- On the night of September 29, Kurban's vacation began. He met him at the Roly-Poly cafe in Valuyki, chatting in a company of about a dozen friends near his Toyota Camry. Police officers and a company of about 20 Chechens stood nearby. According to Kurban, before the flash he heard someone pulling the pin from a grenade. -It[the grenade] rolled a little and suddenly exploded. An officer stood next to me - he bent over. I see he‚Äôs bleeding from his head because of the fragments.- The wounded officer, says Kurban, was afraid to go to the hospital so that his unit would not accuse him of being AWOL. According to Kurban, the military man who attacked him serves in the Akhmat regiment -When he threw a grenade, panic set in, people began to run inside and he shouted ‚ÄòAkhmat strength‚Äô. He raised his hand and I recognized him immediately,- says Kurban. As a result of the explosion, his car was scratched many times by shrapnel, and in one place his door was broken.When asked whether the grenade was a live one, Kurban answers in the affirmative. The owner of the Roly-Poly cafe, in a conversation with ASTRA, suggested that the grenade could have been a -dummy-, since there was no serious damage as a result of the explosion and there was no need to call an ambulance. Kurban says that the Chechen who attacked him was together with two other people. Chechens from a company of 20 people approached him after the explosion to discuss car repairs. -They came running, shouting that he would do [repair] your car &lt;..&gt; Then they got into a fight. An innocent man stood with a phone and talked - and they attacked him, they thought that he was filming them,- says the military man. According to Kurban, the Chechens have long been -lawless- in Valuyki.&nbsp;In July, in this city, soldiers from Chechnya danced lezginka and shot in the air - after which the head of the district said that -measures have been taken to prevent such cases.- This is not the first time that Cafe Roly-Poly has been in the news: in March, residents of Valuyka they called for it to be closedbecause of two strippers who washed each other during the performance.	https://t.me/astrapress/65518	2024-09-30T13:01:58-07:00

It is noteworthy that in January 2022, on Oleg Kashin‚Äôs stream, Readovka editor-in-chief Alexey Kostylev said that he does not receive money from the Kremlin or other government agencies.Previously, Meduza and The Bell released a joint investigation about&nbsp;the work of this publication. Before the war, Readovka had a reputation as an opposition media outlet, but after the invasion of Ukraine began, they began to actively support the Kremlin. -In March 2022, our editorial office literally turned into a sect. Kostylev began to gather employees and give lectures about the fact that the world after the start of the war will no longer be the same, you need to accept the new course of events, not ask questions and trust the information he conveys. Kostylev always wanted to be in the&nbsp;center, and&nbsp;in&nbsp;in&nbsp;the center of what&nbsp;is not&nbsp;important,- said a former employee of the publication. In 2022 Kostylev tried to become the contractor for the Ministry of Defense for the supply of down jackets. It was planned to buy khaki down jackets in China and sell them to the Russian army. Depending on the fabric, the Ministry of Defense then purchased down jackets at a price of 15 to 200 thousand rubles per piece. The idea failed when China blocked the export of army-colored down jackets to Russia so as not to violate American sanctions.At the end of December 2023, he launched the clothing brand -24 New Russian Brand-, where trousers were sold for 20,000 rubles, and quilted jackets for 60,000. He explained the high prices by the exclusivity and tailoring of things in Russia. Soon after the news was published, Kostylev wrote to ASTRA that -everywhere he emphasizes that he is not the founder of the brand.-	https://t.me/astrapress/65517	2024-09-30T12:20:06-07:00

This military formation was formed in 2022 and consists mainly of mobilized people. His command is accused of torturing their own military personnel - as well as their mass murder.The murder of 7 military personnel took place in the early morning of July 4, 2023 in the village of Bakhmutskoye, the so-called -DPR-. At that time, battles were still going on for this village - which the military from the 6th division took advantage of. They took their colleagues to the basement and threw 5 F-1 grenades there. The survivors of the explosion were finished off with a silent PB pistol. 19 Russian military personnel are listed as victims in the case. All of them were held at different times in the basements of apartment buildings in the city of Popasnaya -LPR-. According to the command, they were placed there for refusing to follow orders. There they were subjected to torture: they were beaten -with their feet, fists, and also with various objects and special equipment in the face and body.- The military was also denied access to food, water and hygiene products. Out of 19 victims, military prosecutors -saved- 8 people by dismissing the military personnel. Another military man escaped execution in Bakhmutskoye due to injury. For the first time, a criminal case against the command of the 6th division became known this summer from investigations of the Ukrainian portal -Suspilne-. The publication confirmed information about the criminal case in conversations with relatives of the murdered and murderers. To them, Ukrainian journalists introduced themselves as employees of -public television,- without specifying either the TV channel or the country of broadcasting. Among others, -Suspilna- was able to reach the wife of the commander of the 6th division, Marat Ospanov (call sign -Gyurza- - in the photo), whom investigators consider the main organizer of the massacre. This summer, his wife told reporters that Ospanov was being examined at a psychiatric clinic in Lugansk. According to Suspilne, 19 soldiers from the 6th division were sent to torture cellars in the city of Popasnaya due to publications on social networks of complaints about the conditions of service. ASTRA was among the first to publish these appeals from the military of the 6th division - for example, the complaint of those mobilized from the 1307th regiment that they were being used as -cannon fodder-. 5 of the 7 soldiers killed in Bakhmutsky served in this regiment.In total, there are 7 defendants in the criminal case. As ASTRA found out, the case was initiated under articles of abuse of power (parts 3 and 4 of article 286), unlawful deprivation of liberty (part 3 of article 127) and murder of two or more persons (part 2 of article 105).	https://t.me/astrapress/65507	2024-09-30T09:50:08-07:00

In addition to Joyce, the journalist is accused of collaborating with a number of Western organizations, for example, with the Carnegie Foundation (in Russia the foundation is declared a -foreign agent-). -Given the level of access and social circles, Chernenko could not only share information, but also highlight new people for British intelligence, as well as organize contacts with them,- writes Rybar.

According to him, the posts of the telegram channel -are designed in the classic genre of denunciation.- He stated that communicating with various speakers is the job of a journalist. -Writing -Elena Chernenko communicates with people from the British embassy- is the same as reproaching the employees of the Kommersant incident department for communicating with police officers, prosecutors, lawyers and crime bosses,- he added.February 24, 2022 Chernenko published an open anti-war letter.

Victims of the Babi Yar tragedy were honored in Ukraine On the 83rd anniversary of the tragedy On Babi Yar, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky paid tribute to the victims of mass Nazi executions during the occupation of Kyiv in 1941‚Äì1943. -Babyn Yar is a terrible symbol of the fact that the most terrible crimes are committed when the world chooses not to notice, to remain silent, to be indifferent, to be not decisive enough to give a worthy rebuff to evil. When the eyes of the world are closed, humanity loses. Babi Yar is clear evidence of the atrocities that regimes led by leaders who rely on intimidation and violence are capable of. They are no different at any time. But the world's reaction must be different. This is what the world needed to learn. We must stand guard over humanity, life and justice.

Activists of the Borisoglebsk Anti-Corruption Committee Vladimir Vernyaev and Oleg Meshcheryakov became suspects. Both activists deny any involvement in the creation of the leaflets. According to Vladimir, he saw the leaflets that he allegedly distributed only during the interrogation. -I wrote a statement to the police that material was being distributed on my behalf, which served to initiate a criminal case. The police responded that they refused to initiate a case due to the absence of a crime,- Vernyaev told ASTRA. On September 27, 2024, Vernyaev was summoned to the Investigative Committee and given a written undertaking not to leave the place, Vladimir reported. He, like his colleague Oleg Meshcheryakov, are now in the status of suspects.The -Borisoglebsk Anti-Corruption Committee- has repeatedly complained about the work of deputy Shiryaev.

This is the first known case of the death of a woman who entered into a contract with the Ministry of Defense in a colonyElena Pimonenkova died on August 27 in the Belgorod region. The woman was from Pikalev, and during the war she was a -medic in the capture squad of an assault platoon.- Sister of the deceased Olga told 47news that Pimonenkova signed a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense in May, while in a women's colony in Ulyanovka, Tosnensky district. In the colony, about 60 women expressed a desire to fight, but only ten were selected, among them Elena, although she had a year left to serve. -Before signing the contract, she told me why she decided so, like, why would I hang around here. Maybe I began to realize something in life, after all, I‚Äôm 37 years old,- said sister Olga. Pimonenkova had several convictions: she was first convicted at the age of 23 for attacking a man with a knife, then for car thefts, robberies, damaging other people's property and threats to kill. According to Pimonenkova's sister, the family was informed that Elena was hit by a car in the Belgorod region. However, the version raises doubts among the family: -A man called my mother the day before and did not introduce himself. He said, I‚Äôll take care of her, wean her from bad habits.-	https://t.me/astrapress/65288	2024-09-27T12:45:10-07:00

According to the announcement, the -art estate- will provide people with disabilities with the opportunity to -develop and socialize in more open conditions.- It is also reported that they plan to invite seriously injured military personnel to -Pole- so that they can recover and undergo rehabilitation.Residents of Yalgelevo came out to protest against the construction. They were outraged that the village still has no developed infrastructure, no amenities, and the local school - located next door to the future -art estate- - is overcrowded. -There is nothing in the village itself! Roads, light, playgrounds, a pharmacy, and a local police officer! The heads of the settlements and the heads of the Ropshin settlement are thieves and liars! There are all the documents where they promise with deadlines, in the end - zero!-, a resident of the area wrote in a local public page. In a conversation with ASTRA, he clarified that he has nothing against people with disabilities, but -nothing is being done here at all for other people.- -Nobody is against these people, against the way this is all happening,- he said. Pro-Kremlin media did not notice the protests and this angered local residents even more. -The media, and there were enough of them, obediently, as if on a string, followed the officials. Not a single camera, not a single microphone was directed towards the crowd of people,- says publications of the Ropsha Online channel.Children's Ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova became widely known public during the war in Ukraine due to the removal of children from the occupied territories. Lvova-Belova herself adopted a boy from Mariupol. Last year, due to the removal of children, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Lvova-Belova (in the same case, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin). In early September, it became reliably known that Lvova-Belova had left her priest husband and married the Orthodox oligarch and one of the main sponsors of the -Russian Spring- Konstantin Malafeev.

He gave them the information they needed... The accused of the attempt on the life of Zakhar Prilepin is demanded to be sentenced to life imprisonmentAbout this writes -Mediazona- with reference to a correspondent from the hall of the 2nd Western District Military Court.The investigation claims that the accused Alexander Permyakov in 2022 received Ukraine instructions about exploding the car of the writer Zakhar Prilepin and part of the money - two thousand rubles, after which he entered Russia through Latvia and committed an assassination attempt.It is alleged that correspondence with the elder was found on Permyakov‚Äôs phone operative SBU Zhuravkin, with whom Permyakov discussed -the preparation of a terrorist attack, surveillance of Prilepin and his houses, the placement of mines.- From a page on VKontakte under the name Ivanka Polikarpova, Zhuravkin communicated with Prilepin‚Äôs son Ignat and thus found out where the writer would be on the day of the terrorist attack. In addition to a life sentence, the prosecutor's office asks that Permyakov spend the first 10 years of his sentence in prison, and also pay a fine of one and a half million rubles. The prosecutor called the social danger of the crime colossal and noted -strong antisocial attitudes and socially dangerous interests- of the accused. At the same time, Permyakov‚Äôs sister Irina told the investigator during interrogation that while still a schoolchild, her brother was sentenced to 7 years because -he and his friends beat someone.- Four years later, he was released on parole, and in 2015 went -to the DPR militia.- In the spring of 2022, Permyakov moved to the Khmelnitsky region of Ukraine -as a migrant.-Prilepin himself refused to participate in the debate and asked that Permyakov be punished -in accordance with the law.- Permyakov did not speak out in the debate. In May 2023, a bomb was blown up in the Nizhny Novgorod region car by Zakhar Prilepin. As a result, the writer was seriously injured, and his guard Alexander Shubin died on the spot. The Investigative Committee opened a case of terrorism. On the same day, not far from the scene of the assassination attempt, there was detainedAlexander Permyakov. They found on him passports of Russia and Ukraine and a fake passport of Kazakhstan, nearby - a combat pistol with a silencer, a band-aid, five SIM cards, two bank cards, cash rubles and hryvnias, a flashlight, a compass, a flint, and a sheet with ten telephone numbers and names.

The country's authorities referred to Putin's words that the mobilization had ended Pavel Suetin left Severomorsk in the Murmansk region on September 22, 2022 - the day after the mobilization was announced. He came to Norway and requested asylum in the city of Vads√∏. However, in mid-September 2024, the Norwegian Migration Agency informed the man that he was not eligible for asylum and must leave the Schengen area within three weeks. This is the first known decision of this kind in Norway, writes The Barents Observer. According to the migration department, mobilization is not currently being carried out in Russia. Norwegian officials refer to the words of Vladimir Putin and Sergei Shoigu, who announced the completion of mobilization in October 2022. Suetin himself claims that the military commissariat continues to look for him even two years after the start of mobilization. According to the man, people from the military registration and enlistment office came to the apartment where he was registered and asked where he was. Suetin does not yet know what to do if the Norwegian authorities still force him to leave the country. -I'm sure, I know that I will be taken to war. I am of military age, I am not married, I have no children, I served in the army (although my military service consisted of removing snow and making the bed beautifully). Nowadays, it is not even necessary to serve a summons; it is enough to send it to the State Services - and the person is immediately deprived of the opportunity to leave the country. If I return to Russia, I will end up either in the army or in prison. Both options are tantamount to death.-Previously, Scandinavian countries have repeatedly refused political asylum to Russians. Thus, Russian Stanislav Brysin was refused asylum in Sweden, even despite his experience in holding protests and an open criminal case for -calls for terrorism.- At the beginning of the month, ASTRA wrote that in search of refuge, Brysin boarded a boat and sailed towards Ireland.

His body was not given to his parents for almost a month. The official cause of death listed on the certificate was -cerebral edema, intracerebral hemorrhage in the brain stem.- The relatives of the deceased were never told where and how he received this injury. According to the military, conscript Lazhiev developed -homesickness syndrome- due to a strong reluctance to serve.
