FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the occupied village of Korsun, Donetsk region According to ASTRA, an unexploded FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the village of Korsun in the Yenakievo City Council. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 129th air bomb that fell as a result of an emergency landing on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before ASTRA reported that in order to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began equipping Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 129 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´®Subscribe to ASTRA.

The Russian military has continued its counteroffensive in the Kursk region for the fifth day. Previously, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost approximately a quarter of all territories of the Kursk border region captured by UkraineSince the beginning of October, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have lost control over more than 120 square kilometers of the territory of the Kursk region. This is information from the OSINT project DeepState, which is close to the Ukrainian army, the data of which is often assessed by journalists and analysts as genuine.However, assessments of the successes of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region vary. Thus, the commander of the Akhmat special forces, Apti Alaudinov, said that the Russian Armed Forces had already liberated -about half- of the territories of the Kursk region occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since breaking through the border in the Kursk region, Alaudinov has regularly made loud statements that need to be verified turn out to be half-truths or outright false.

By his own admission, Trutnev sketched out the song -on his knees.- It's called -Not Comrade Commander.- As far as the ASTRA editors know, this is the first rap incriminating the command, recorded in the conditions of the so-called -SVO.-Previously, Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky told ASTRAthat they escaped with positions after the company commander with the call sign -Prokop-, in a drunken state, gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields. ASTRA confirmed the identities of Trutnev and Ostrovsky. It is unknown where the military is now. Vyacheslav‚Äôs common-law wife Alena told ASTRA that she and the young man‚Äôs mother admit that the videos could have been recorded in Ukrainian captivity. However, there is no evidence of this.

Apparently, the appointment of Kovalev as vice-governor is part of the trend to promote war participants in Ukraine to government positions. Kovalev is a native of Sevastopol, who before the annexation of Crimea served in the special forces unit of the Ukrainian police -Berkut-. After the annexation, Berkut came under the command of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (and then the Russian National Guard), and Kovalev eventually received the post of commander of the Sevastopol Berkut-S. The soldiers of this riot police unit participated in the war in Ukraine from the very beginning, mark -Important stories.- In August 2024, Kovalev took the post of vice-governor in another region - in the Vologda region. There he was responsible for public safety and law enforcement issues. According to local media, the former riot policeman resigned from this post in September. What caused the dismissal (and whether it was completely voluntary) is unknown. In Ukraine, a criminal case has been opened against Kovalev under articles of encroachment on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, treason, and misappropriation of firearms.	https://t.me/astrapress/66336	2024-10-14T08:40:52-07:00

Vyacheslav says that he was sentenced to 8 years under Articles 228 and 166 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, and at the time of signing the contract he -had 1.5 years left before parole.- He served his sentence in IK-10 in the city of Rubtsovsk, Altai Territory. Dmitry was also imprisoned under 228 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation in Penal Colony 19 of the Irkutsk Region.-We were serving our sentences in colonies, and there they began to tighten the screws and drive people to war. They gave the illusion of choice: for example, you are eligible for parole in a year and a half or two years, supposedly why do you need parole when you can win a year at the SVO, get money and come back clean. And if not, then you won‚Äôt see any parole, maybe they‚Äôll even throw you in for desertion, and in general, the punishment cell is your home until the end of your term,- they said. The prisoners were also promised that during the war they would be treated as full-fledged military personnel, but -the attitude has not changed one bit. -When we arrived here, we were guarded everywhere. Detachments, treated like cattle. Stupid missions from which it is impossible to return, and if we had sat down, we would not have taken such a step, we would not have recorded anything at all. The orders were like this... Stupid meat, they killed people,- the military said. In addition, the men complained that for 4 months they had never received payments on the card, and they had received nothing except allowances. -Maybe someone will come to their senses and not come here, because there is nothing to do here, they are deceiving their own people here,- they concluded.Earlier Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky ASTRA reported that they fled from their positions after the company commander with the call sign -Prokop-, in a drunken state, gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields.ASTRA confirmed personalities of Trutnev and Ostrovsky.

ASTRA: The Russian Aerospace Forces again dropped an aerial bomb on the Belgorod region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod region, on October 10 in the Shebekinsky urban district, in FAB-500 was found several kilometers from the village of Neklyudovo. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 128th air bomb that fell on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem with the updated FABs was immediately revealed - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, during an emergency gathering, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

Taiwan called China's military exercises a provocation. In recent years, China intensified its military presence around Taiwan - China does not recognize the independence of the 23 million island. It is noteworthy that the island blockade exercise began shortly after October 10, the founding day of the first Chinese Republic, which is celebrated as a national holiday in Taiwan. The first republic in China replaced the last imperial dynasty, and this regime ended with civil war and the rise to power of the communists. Taiwan was founded by opponents of the communists who fled to the island - and in many ways this democratic country considers itself the successor of the first Chinese Republic. Taiwan's sovereignty is recognized by only a dozen states. The United States is not among them, which provides Taiwan with military support and acts as a guarantor of the island's independence.	https://t.me/astrapress/66314	2024-10-13T22:45:53-07:00

Over the past two years, the company has rented 5.5 thousand hectares of land in the country and invested in two textile factories (in Dushanbe and Khujand), which sewed military uniforms for Russian soldiers fighting with Ukraine. Journalists learned that in 2023, BTK Group purchased men's clothing, including military uniforms, and imported it to Russia for -SVO purposes.- The cost of the purchased goods was about $13 million. In the first four months of 2024, the company purchased clothing worth $4 million.BTK Group was founded in 2005 by Taimuraz Bolloev, one of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs close associates - he was twice his confidant in the presidential elections. In June 2024, the European Union imposed personal sanctions against Bolloev. The company came to Tajikistan in 2022.

They publicly expressed their anti-war point of view, which caused them problems at work. -I am a pacifist and generally do not accept any military conflicts, much less attacks on the fraternal people, because every Russian has close and distant relatives in Ukraine. After the war, we were in a very stressful state, and we decided to leave, because we can‚Äôt change anything in Russia,- Olga told ASTRA.According to her, Sweden was the only country where where they could most quickly obtain visas and enter legally. In June 2022, they crossed the border and applied for asylum. A few months later, immediately after mobilization began, they received a refusal. Olga and her husband filed an appeal, which was considered for another six months.-In fact, migration clerks do not have a document by which they should evaluate Russians who opposed the war. In fact, they rely on outdated documents, according to which there is no war,- Olga claims.Olga says that she and her husband still found a way to suspend the decision on their deportation, but after 11 months they anyway, an order was issued to leave the country.-On August 1, I was absolutely illegally put in a pre-trial detention center. I am an asylum seeker, all my documents are legal, but since then they have not released me. I lived in migration housing, came and renewed my asylum seeker card. I was where I was supposed to be. If they suspected that I would run away, they should have forced me to report to come. But they missed this point and simply arrested me, separating me from my five children,- Olga told ASTRA.A review of the decision to place her in a pre-trial detention center in early October did not yield anything. i>-I am in the leaked FSB database -Oppositionists- because I have a small journalistic job. I wrote articles about anti-war organizations that are banned in Russia. I took part in rallies and demonstrations, wrote a book, and ran a telegram channel in which I told how to get asylum. Provocateurs are writing to my husband from the FSB,- Olga shares.She says what she saw asylum seekers from Belarus were deportedagainst whom criminal proceedings were initiated. According to Olga, the son from this family was arrested immediately at the border, and his mother stopped communicating. -I am now simply afraid for my life, because the latest paper says that nothing threatens us, there is no war in Yekaterinburg, everything is fine, the FSB will not touch us. And my interview was published on YouTube, there were 1100 comments. 80 percent of them - come, we will crucify you,- says Olga.Olga has now created petition asking the Swedish authorities to prevent her deportation. Scandinavian countries have repeatedly denied political asylum to Russians. So, Russian Pavel Suetin left Severomorsk for Norway and requested asylum in the city of Vads√∏, but in September 2024, the Norwegian migration department informed him that he was not entitled to asylum and must leave the Schengen zone within three weeks. Another Russian, Stanislav Brysin, was refused asylum in Sweden, despite the experience of holding protests and an open criminal case for -calls for terrorism.- ASTRA wrote that in search of refuge, Brysin boarded a boat and sailed towards Ireland. Before this Sweden has deported a family from Belarus, against whom a criminal case has been opened in their homeland. Not The situation with asylums in the USA is better. So, in material about American migration prisons ASTRA told the story of an opposition journalist from Russia with administrative punishment for -discrediting the army-, which US authorities deported to their homeland and handed over to the FSB.üå± Subscribe to ASTRA.

Russia is deceiving young girls from Africa, Asia and Latin America to assemble Shaheds - Associated PressAbout 200 foreign women are assembling Iranian drones in the Alabuga special economic zone in Tatarstan. Girls aged 18‚Äì22 are attracted to Russia using the Alabuga Start online program: on the program‚Äôs website they are promised studies in Europe, a free plane and work in the service and catering sectors, but this turns out to be a hoax. As a result, girls face constant monitoring, broken wage promises, and dangerous work with caustic chemicals that damage their skin. -I regret and curse the day when I started doing this,- the publication quotes one of the women. Together with foreign women, 15-16-year-old Russian students of vocational schools work there, who also complain about working conditions. Analysts found that since July 29, about 95% of drones have not hit any visible targets in Ukraine. Instead, they fall into the rivers and fields of Ukraine, fly into Latvia and land on the territory of Russia or Belarus. Until July, about 14% of Shaheds hit targets in Ukraine. The publication writes that one of the reasons for the decline in the quality of drones may be unskilled labor. The special economic zone -Alabuga- was created in 2006 to attract business and investment to Tatarstan. After February 2022, it quickly grew and its parts switched to military production.	https://t.me/astrapress/66155	2024-10-10T11:37:03-07:00

Ukraine is considering lifting the ban on arms exports - Financial TimesAfter Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv banned the export of military goods to meet the needs of its own army.

The State Duma has introduced amendments according to which foreign citizenship will become an aggravating circumstance when committing a crimeDraft amendments to Part 1 of Article 63 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Circumstances- aggravating punishment-) was introduced to the State Duma by deputy Evgeniy Marchenko (non-factional parliamentarian). He proposes to consider the commission of a crime -by a person with foreign citizenship or a stateless person- as an aggravating circumstance, writes -Kommersant-. Marchenko believes that this initiative -will become an effective preventive mechanism- and will contribute to -more responsible behavior- of foreigners in the Russian Federation. He refers to TFR statistics indicating a 55% increase in the number of extremist crimes committed by migrants in the first half of 2024. Experts interviewed by Kommersant say these amendments contradict the constitutional principle of equality before the law and may contribute to the outflow of migrants. The State Duma is currently considering several bills that would tighten migration policy: illegal stay in the country as an aggravating circumstance when sentencing, and equating the organization of illegal migration to particularly serious crimes. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called tightening control over migration a priority for the State Duma this session.&nbsp; Until 2021, Marchenko was a deputy from United Russia, but was later expelled from the party because the parliamentarian, contrary to the consolidated decision of the party bodies, voted against the adoption of the federal budget in the first reading, thereby violating the norms of the charter -United Russia- and regulations on the faction.	https://t.me/astrapress/65972	2024-10-07T22:18:07-07:00
