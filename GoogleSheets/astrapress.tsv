During this time, the cost of work has quadrupledComplete construction of one of the largest infectious diseases hospitals in Siberia in the village of Sadovy, Novosibirsk region, were supposed to open in 2022, but it only started accepting patients now, said Regional Minister of Health Rostislav Zablotsky. Agreement on the construction of an infectious diseases hospital between former Minister of Health of the Novosibirsk Region Konstantin Khalzov and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the K1 holding Dmitry Kolosov signed on September 29, 2021 at the VIII Infrastructure Congress -Russian PPP Week-. Construction work began in 2022, when the cost of the facility was estimated at 4.6 billion rubles. Initially, the commissioning of the facility was planned for the end of 2022. In the summer of 2022, at an off-site meeting at a construction site, First Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Alexander Zhukov noted that, -despite the sanctions and the difficult economic situation, solutions have been found to complete construction on time.- But in the end, the launch date was moved to the third quarter of 2023, and the price of the facility increased fourfold - to 16 billion.In August 2023, the Ministry of Health of the Novosibirsk Region succeeded admission of guilt of the private partner -Development Projects 2-, part of the K1 holding, in delaying the construction of the facility. The company will pay a penalty of 990 thousand rubles, the arbitration court decision stated. At the same time, the initial amount of the claim was 48.041 million.According to the case materials, the private partner was responsible, among other things, for the development of project documentation for the task agreed upon by the Novosibirsk Ministry of Health, as well as for the positive conclusion of the state examination on it. No more than 50 days were allotted for this from the moment the land lease agreements were signed. According to the calculations of the Ministry of Health presented in court, the delay was 198 days. At the same time, while demanding a penalty, the ministry did not take into account the time it took to adjust the assignment for the project, which had been agreed upon for a long time and then finalized by the officials themselves.At the same time, the press service of the regional government at the same time stated that the work had reached the finish line.In November 2023, Governor Alexander Travnikov saidthat the hospital will open after the New Year - due to unfinished storm drains, and in the beginning of December 2023, the opening of the hospital assigned to December 31 - due to the restructuring of the gas network. Nevertheless, it took another six months, and for the last six months the contractor has been trying to obtain all permits to put the building into operation, although should have received them back in June. In total, the Ministry of Health reported, to the budget of the Novosibirsk region received five million rubles in penalties for non-compliance deadlines.üí• ASTRA is important for the continuation of its work even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers:PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/73301	2025-01-27T03:57:13-08:00

The head of the 6th commandant's office of Donetsk tortured the illegally mobilized father of 4 children, Alexander Barlet, said victim. After complaints about torture, they tried to kill the hero of ASTRA publicationsFather of 4 children Alexander Barlet, illegally mobilized (after voluntary service), past torture cellar and survivor attempt on December 30 in Donetsk, told ASTRA who participated in the torture and attempted murder. After receiving severe injuries, having lost a kidney and regaining consciousness, Barlet told ASTRA that he was beaten in the sixth commandant‚Äôs office of military unit 53435 (former military unit 08826) in Donetsk by the head of the department, Lieutenant Colonel Andrey Redko (call sign -David-). -Personally, he beat Redko in his office, tried to tear up my Russian Federation passport, shouted that I was unworthy to be a citizen of the Russian Federation, and cut my hand with a knife,- Barlet told ASTRA. Human rights activist Maxim Davydov told ASTRA that Redko served in the same military unit as Barlet (42600, former 08826), where Igor Puzik (call sign -Evil-) also worked, who in 2024 year sent soldiers of the DPR long-range reconnaissance regiment on an assault, where they died. Davydov claims that on the day of the attempted murder of Barlet, two people from the 110th brigade (formerly the 100th brigade) of the military unit of Barlet and 4 people from the rapid reaction group of the 6th commandant‚Äôs office of Redko came for him, who opened fire on the man. Davydov says they tried to kill Barlet because he was the victim of a fraudulent scheme - As ASTRA previously wrote, in December it turned out that the man was still assigned to his old military unit 42600, although he no longer served there and was released on leave due to injury. It turned out that at the same time in the military unit he was included in the list of those who left the unit without permission (SOCH), but still allegedly received a salary and payments for injury. However, in the personal account of the Russian Ministry of Defense, unknown details of a bank account were noted, which belongs neither to Barlet nor his family - none of them received the money. When this information was revealed, the military unit tried to cover their tracks by capturing or killing the main witness. -The commanders of the military unit falsified documents that he [Barlet] was still serving, and issued some kind of bank card through which he allegedly received payments, and I think for his injury. And when he began to figure out why he was in the SOC and hired a lawyer, it turned out that Barlet was still listed in the unit as receiving money and fighting. And here all the military investigators are in one gang, along with war criminals from military units, and they simply decided to resolve the matter quietly - to remove the main witness. So they arrived and started shooting. They had the task of taking him at any cost, either alive or dead. I think that even if they had taken him alive, he would not have lasted long at the front,- Davydov tells ASTRA. After Barlet's escape, military unit employees were able to find him and his father at the man's property thanks to bribery of neighbors - Davydov claims that the military paid 10,000 rubles so that Barlet's neighbors would inform him when he would appear at home. This is what happened on the day of the assassination attempt, the human rights activist believes.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Andrei Redko, being a Kramatorsk police operative, was kidnapped by pro-Russian forces, but was later released, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry reported. At the same time, Redko is listed in list of -traitors to Ukraine,- like almost all employees of the 6th commandant‚Äôs office of Donetsk. Redko did not answer ASTRA's call.

Israel begins a new military operation in the West BankJanuary 21 Prime Minister Israel Benjamin Netanyahu announcedthe start of a military operation in Jenin, a city in The West Bank, which is part of the Palestinian Authority. The operation, dubbed Operation Iron Wall, involves the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Shin Bet and the police.Netanyahu noted that the Jenin operation is part of a broader strategy to strengthen security in Judea and Samaria. According to him, this operation is -another step towards achieving this goal.- He added that Israel is acting decisively against the -Iranian axis,- which is sending weapons to various regions, including Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Judea and Samaria.By information from the pro-Palestinian publication Al Jazeera, the operation has already killed six Palestinians and injured 35 people.This is not Israel's first military operation Jenin: The IDF last conducted military operations in this city in August 2024.

Following the 1996 Oslo Accords, Israel transferred control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority. However, in recent years, the influence of the Palestinian authorities in the region has weakened, and, according to some sources, they have lost control of the Jenin area.Palestinians called Jenin is the -capital of martyrs,- while the Israelis call it a -hornet‚Äôs nest.-Recall that earlier on January 19 officially a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group in the Gaza Strip came into force.It also became known today that the IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi resigned, taking personal responsibility for the failure of the Israeli army during the Hamas attack on October 7.
