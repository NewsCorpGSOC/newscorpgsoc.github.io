Three aerial bombs dropped Russian planes in the Belgorod region in one dayAs ASTRA sources in the region‚Äôs emergency services told us, last week, on Friday, November 29, Russian airborne forces dropped immediately three FABs for the Belgorod region. One of them -went down unexpectedly- near a residential building in the village of Veselaya Lopan, Belgorod region, more than 30 km from the border with Ukraine. No injuries or damage were avoided. Another aerial bomb fell into a field 7 km from the village of Bessonovka. The third FAB of the day was found in the village of Dragunskoye. This time the ammunition fell in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe substation, 3 kilometers from residential buildings. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 162 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19 a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69779	2024-12-05T08:20:29-08:00

The influence of war veterans in Ukraine turned out to be -few-By data of the -Algorithm of Light- project, in 2022‚Äì2023 in the country 2,284 women became victims of domestic violence, of which 2,123 of them were killed by their partners, the rest by relatives. In total, 3,436 women were killed over two years. At the same time, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, which is cited by the -Algorithm of Light-, in 2023, compared to 2022, 2% fewer murders were registered (Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 6% fewer rapes (Article 131 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 4% fewer cases of causing serious harm to health (Article 111 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). During January-July 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs registered 15,600 violent crimes, which is 6% less than the same period last year. According to the state statistics portal, in 2023 the number of deaths from violent crimes decreased from 9,366 people in 2022 to 8,792 in 2023.In 65 criminal cases checked by the Light Algorithm, war participants appeared in Ukraine. In 11 of these convictions the victim was a woman, only 8 of these involved domestic violence - 7 by a partner and 1 by a relative. It is impossible to draw conclusions about how often women died at the hands of SVO participants in 2022-2023; their number turned out to be small for analysis, notes Algorithm of Light.However, it is believed that the courts may not provide information about the previous criminal record of ex-prisoners or their participation in the -SVO-. In the recent research journalists found cases where, after the publication of sentences for participants in the war in Ukraine, materials the courts edited them, removing data on state awards or completely erasing the published text of the verdict.	https://t.me/astrapress/69657	2024-12-03T06:30:52-08:00

The head of the Human Rights Council Valery Fadeev spoke in favor of the transfer of the Solovetsky Stone from the LubyankaAccording to Fadeev, the monument to the victims of political repression has today become a place for political actions. -The authorities responded, showed an anti-Stalinist character and created a monument at the request of these people. But people are actually holding not a memorial action, but an action against the employees of the building on Lubyanka - the FSB, the KGB, the NKVD. They say: -We are here, we remember everything, and you are the same,- - he said in an interview with RBC. In his opinion, the memorial stone should -eventually be moved.- The Solovetsky Stone is the oldest memorial to victims of political repression in the country. It is a granite stone brought from the territory of the former Solovetsky camp and was installed in front of the KGB building in October 1990. Every year, on the day of remembrance of the victims of political repression, memorial events are held near it.The official also negatively assessed Last Address projectwhich hangs memorial plaques on houses victims of repression, and spoke in favor of removing the signs that had already been installed: -There is a memorial to Sakharov, there is a Day of Remembrance for Political Victims, Political Repression, there are corresponding paragraphs in the history textbook. But it‚Äôs so obsessive to poke people in the face every day, and here you are killing each other, this country has no future. As they say, some are guards, and others are sitters. This is not true. And this project is exactly on the side of untruth, or at best half-truth. That's why I don't like him.-	https://t.me/astrapress/69645	2024-12-03T01:51:41-08:00

As ASTRA found out, 3 FABs fell from Russian aircraft in the Belgorod region over the past few days. So, on November 23, an aerial bomb was found in a field near the village of Surkovo... Due to the fall of a 250-kilogram aerial bomb in a village in the Belgorod region, 100 people were evacuated 2 more FABs fell on the same day in the region, no one was injured. As ASTRA found out, due to the -abnormal descent- of a FAB-250 from a Russian plane in the village of Kazatskoye, Yakovlevsky urban district, on November 26, residents of several streets were evacuated, in total - about 100 people. Sources in the region's emergency services told ASTRA that an aerial bomb fell near a residential building on Novaya Street. The bomb did not explode, so no one was injured. Now the FAB has already been confiscated, the residents have returned to their homes. Another aerial bomb was found on the same day a few kilometers from the village of Nikolskoye, Belgorod district. Another FAB was dropped on November 26 in the Bystry farm. In both cases there were no casualties or damage.Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 159 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and in Russian-controlled territories Ukraine for 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69552	2024-11-30T23:19:21-08:00

During the last word, the court interrupted Gorinov, announced a break and left. Alexey continued speaking to the audience in the hall.-My fault is that I, as a citizen of my country, allowed this war and could not stop it. And please note this in the verdict.

I continue to live with the hope that this will happen someday. In the meantime, I ask the residents of Ukraine and my fellow citizens who suffered from the war to forgive me,- saidhe.	https://t.me/astrapress/69438	2024-11-29T02:13:47-08:00

Journalists found a Russian filtration camp for captured Ukrainians in Belarus - investigation by the Belarusian Investigative CenterAt the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military created a filtration camp on the territory of Belarus. Journalists found out that it was located on the basis of one of the buildings that belonged to a Belarusian state-owned enterprise -Pripyat Alliance- in Narovlya (Gomel region). Some human rights activists call this camp one of the most cruel against prisoners. Not only Ukrainian military personnel were taken there, but also civilians, including minors. For example, a resident of the Kyiv region Larisa Yagodinskaya said that in March 2022, her two sons were taken there, one of whom had not yet reached the age of eighteen at that time: -They said that the sons were saboteurs, and they took them and took them to Chernobyl. There it turned out that they were beating them, and as [the younger son] Slava later told them, [that the eldest son] most likely even broke his ribs, they beat him hard with a bat.- UAF serviceman Bogdan Lysenko, who was captured by the Russian military at the end of March 2022, also spoke about the torture of civilians: -Narovlya - it was such a propaganda picture that we [Russian military] are, like, humane... But none of them shows how civilians were interrogated there. And they beat civilians there, God forbid... That is, screams were constantly heard there.- According to human rights activists, now some of the Ukrainians who passed through the filtration camp in Narovlya are still in captivity, in particular, on the territory of penal colonies in Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69426	2024-11-28T23:32:32-08:00

The Central Election Commission spent four months looking for errors in his election reporting. The politician explained the fine by saying that the CEC blocked his election account - and tens of thousands of sheets had to be printed at SberbankA court in Moscow fined Boris Nadezhdin, a participant in the 2024 presidential elections blocked by the CEC, for errors in the pre-election financial report. Three fines of 50 thousand rubles each for:‚Äî illegal use of donations received in violation;‚Äî violation of the rules for transferring funds contributed to the election fund;‚Äî failure to provide a complete attachment financial report. Nadezhdin announced the court's decision this evening. Previously he wrote on his channel that his violations were explained by the fact that on February 8 the Central Election Commission blocked his election account. Because of this, financial statements had to be submitted to the Ministry of Justice on 50 thousand sheets of paper, -the unfortunate Sberbank was responsible for printing them - which it did for several days around the clock- [stack of papers in the photo]. The politician also complained about the large number of signature collectors - according to him, it was technically difficult for them to print out all the payments for donations. -It is completely incomprehensible why in the 21st century one would submit a financial report and applications on paper, despite the fact that the Central Election Commission sees all transactions on the election account online,- he wrote. The politician explained that the court reduced the amount of the fine from 75 thousand because it took into account mitigating circumstances -the size of the pension, the presence of children, etc.- Nadezhdin added that two of the four donations for which the Central Bank issued him this fine were 30 and 70 (thirty and seventy) rubles. -We will appeal,- he wrote.	https://t.me/astrapress/69330	2024-11-27T11:33:03-08:00
