The head of the 6th commandant's office of Donetsk tortured the illegally mobilized father of 4 children, Alexander Barlet, said victim. After complaints about torture, they tried to kill the hero of ASTRA publicationsFather of 4 children Alexander Barlet, illegally mobilized (after voluntary service), past torture cellar and survivor attempt on December 30 in Donetsk, told ASTRA who participated in the torture and attempted murder. After receiving severe injuries, having lost a kidney and regaining consciousness, Barlet told ASTRA that he was beaten in the sixth commandant’s office of military unit 53435 (former military unit 08826) in Donetsk by the head of the department, Lieutenant Colonel Andrey Redko (call sign -David-). -Personally, he beat Redko in his office, tried to tear up my Russian Federation passport, shouted that I was unworthy to be a citizen of the Russian Federation, and cut my hand with a knife,- Barlet told ASTRA. Human rights activist Maxim Davydov told ASTRA that Redko served in the same military unit as Barlet (42600, former 08826), where Igor Puzik (call sign -Evil-) also worked, who in 2024 year sent soldiers of the DPR long-range reconnaissance regiment on an assault, where they died. Davydov claims that on the day of the attempted murder of Barlet, two people from the 110th brigade (formerly the 100th brigade) of the military unit of Barlet and 4 people from the rapid reaction group of the 6th commandant’s office of Redko came for him, who opened fire on the man. Davydov says they tried to kill Barlet because he was the victim of a fraudulent scheme - As ASTRA previously wrote, in December it turned out that the man was still assigned to his old military unit 42600, although he no longer served there and was released on leave due to injury. It turned out that at the same time in the military unit he was included in the list of those who left the unit without permission (SOCH), but still allegedly received a salary and payments for injury. However, in the personal account of the Russian Ministry of Defense, unknown details of a bank account were noted, which belongs neither to Barlet nor his family - none of them received the money. When this information was revealed, the military unit tried to cover their tracks by capturing or killing the main witness. -The commanders of the military unit falsified documents that he [Barlet] was still serving, and issued some kind of bank card through which he allegedly received payments, and I think for his injury. And when he began to figure out why he was in the SOC and hired a lawyer, it turned out that Barlet was still listed in the unit as receiving money and fighting. And here all the military investigators are in one gang, along with war criminals from military units, and they simply decided to resolve the matter quietly - to remove the main witness. So they arrived and started shooting. They had the task of taking him at any cost, either alive or dead. I think that even if they had taken him alive, he would not have lasted long at the front,- Davydov tells ASTRA. After Barlet's escape, military unit employees were able to find him and his father at the man's property thanks to bribery of neighbors - Davydov claims that the military paid 10,000 rubles so that Barlet's neighbors would inform him when he would appear at home. This is what happened on the day of the assassination attempt, the human rights activist believes.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Andrei Redko, being a Kramatorsk police operative, was kidnapped by pro-Russian forces, but was later released, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry reported. At the same time, Redko is listed in list of -traitors to Ukraine,- like almost all employees of the 6th commandant’s office of Donetsk. Redko did not answer ASTRA's call. Now Barlet’s family is receiving threats, Donetsk channel -Mobilization of the DPR- is raising funds for a male lawyer.Supporting ASTRA, you are contributing to freedom of speech: Patreon Boosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/73142	2025-01-24T04:58:22-08:00

A Russian plane dropped an aerial bomb on an occupied village in the Zaporozhye region, ASTRA found outOn January 9, a Russian FAB fell near the village of Vishnevka in the Mikhailovsky district of Zaporozhye region areas. The air bomb did not explode; a crater formed at the site. There were no casualties. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year, about 6 FABs and one rocket for 2025.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using UMPC last spring. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July 2023, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian. November 19 last year a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district.

It is alleged that all those infected underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. The information was confirmed by the head of the regional Ministry of Health, Alexander Gashkov (on video).After the outbreak, experts from Moscow were brought in to conduct an epidemiological investigation. They found that the infection spread due to violations of sanitary standards - lack of antiseptics, improper handling of equipment and the use of multi-dose bottles of saline solution. In addition, the virus can be transmitted to patients due to the fact that staff did not clean their hands and used disposable instruments several times.There may be more people infected, since about 1,000 people had MRIs with contrast in the office. Now the work of the CT room has been suspended for a month. The Investigative Committee in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky opened a criminal case on the fact of criminal negligence of unidentified employees of the Kamchatka Regional Oncology Dispensary, which negligently resulted in the infliction of grievous harm to human health (Part 2 of Article 293 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
