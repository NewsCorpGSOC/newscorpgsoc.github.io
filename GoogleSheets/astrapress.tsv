Kursk residents will not receive compensation because all the money is spent on the war with Ukraine, Khinshtein said at a meeting with refugees United Russia member Alexander Khinshtein, appointed by Putin as the acting head of the Kursk region, reported on his visit to the temporary accommodation center for refugees. According to him, the state will not be able to fully compensate for the property lost by the Kursk residents - the state -will not bear all the expenses-, since there are not enough budget funds for this, and it is expensive to wage a war with Ukraine.-In our country The SVO is still ongoing, and the SVO is highly technical, the land must be freed! But here, excuse me, every shell costs money!-said Khinshtein.At the same time, on his page on VKontakte, Khinshtein don't forget mention that the director of school No. 1, Sergei Aleksandrovich Kondoyanidi, who was present at the meeting, a deputy of the Representative Assembly of the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, took people out from under shelling. In the comments he was immediately reminded that this information was not true.

Never in my life have I prescribed someone else’s for myself merit. I can assume that someone does not like my ACTIONS and POSITION on our current situation with you and many other issues relating to all residents of the Sudzhansky district. I have never made excuses, and I think those who are guilty are making excuses, but what is written is, to put it mildly, disgusting.

Exceptions are outstanding figures of sports and art, as well as individual humanitarian cases.Consideration of applications for citizenship from Russians over 15 years of age is suspended for those applications that have already been submitted.The bill was criticized representatives of the Russian diaspora and human rights organizations, pointing out that the conditions put forward are virtually unenforceable, since it is impossible to renounce Russian citizenship without having citizenship of another country. Also, critics of the bill called it discriminatory and pointed out that a significant number of people live in the Czech Republic who left Russia due to disagreement with the war and the power of Vladimir Putin. Now the Russians, who signed the petition about the inadmissibility of the adoption of the bill, are preparing to file a lawsuit with the intention, if necessary, to reach the ECHR.To obtain citizenship, it was necessary to live in the country for more than 10 years and fulfill a number of conditions. Now the document will be sent for consideration to the Senate. After the document is approved there, it will be sent to the President of the Czech Republic for signature. The amendment is expected to come into force in early February 2025. It was included in the Lex Ukrajina law, which provides for the extension of the temporary protection regime for Ukrainian refugees until 2026.ASTRA spoke with a girl who applied for citizenship back in April 2023 - her application has not yet been considered It is unlikely that they will even consider it now. Svetlana Bogdanova moved to Prague from Murmansk and works as a veterinarian.-It’s sad, of course, because you seem to live in the country, pay taxes, the country lives on these taxes, and then it just considers you a second person varieties and says: -No, you are not worthy to be a citizen of the Czech Republic.- It turns out that in a European country the same thing is happening as in Russia, that is, you can basically do whatever you want, and nothing will happen to you for it,- says Svetlana.She noted that she did not know what to do now. Among the options she is considering is moving to another country.	https://t.me/astrapress/70524	2024-12-18T06:45:20-08:00

In the division to the local… Parents of conscripts from Chelyabinsk demand that Putin figure out why their children sign the contract,having barely entered the military unitRelatives of conscripts serving in the Chebarkul garrison No. 93992, write mass appeals to the direct line with Putin, which will take place on December 19. They are concerned that in military units, conscripts en masse sign contracts in the very first days of service.Parents of conscripts are convinced: their children sign contracts under psychological pressure, and reports on the revocation of the document remain unheeded. In addition to the direct line, families turn to military prosecutors at various levels, human rights ombudsmen, courts and other authorities. So far, to no avail: nothing is known about examples of contract termination in Chebarkul.The initiators of the appeal say that conscripts are being encouraged to sign a contract on the way to the unit. Most recruits do not give in to persuasion, but they continue to be intensively convinced once in the military unit. In particular, threats to send them to the Belgorod or Kursk regions, from where the soldiers -will return with a load of 200.- If the serviceman continues to persist, he is offered to sign a -document- in order to remain in the Chebarkul units (in the military police, in the medical battalion, as drivers).The parents do not have the original or copies of the signed documents, but they believe that the fact of imprisonment military contract is confirmed by large amounts from 400 thousand to 2&nbsp;million rubles received in the bank accounts of their children. From the name of these payments it is clear that we are talking about one-time payments for imprisonment agreement with the Ministry of Defense. Amounts vary as the conclusion passes through different regions. Officially transfer of money explained by a technical failure.The 90th Guards Tank is based in Chebarkul division. In 2022, its fighters took part in the attack on Kyiv, where parts of the division were ambushed, suffered heavy losses and took refuge in Bogdanovka, Brovary district. Previously, Astra journalists talked about the massacres and rapes committed by the division’s soldiers in Bogdanovka that period.🫨 Subscribe to ASTRA.

They claim that, at least in their city, only they and local Cossacks removed oil products from the beach - the Emergency Situations Ministry employees did not help them.-They bought everything themselves, brought it in cars. Someone bought, for example, just a huge number of 120-liter basins. There are many people willing, but there is no equipment, not even clothes. Because we also went and realized that we had simply gotten away with everything. People are all standing in the dark. Shoes, clothes, it won’t wash off anything,- said volunteer Ilya.According to him, there is a stench on the beach. As a result, some of the volunteers feel sick - today they did not yet know about the smell and did not stock up on masks. Ilya is preparing for the fact that tomorrow there will be even more work, as there is a strong wind that will bring new fuel oil ashore.-We collected the fuel oil in bags. No one has taken them out yet. The Ministry of Emergency Situations will most likely give some instructions on this matter, but so far there are none. That is, our task for now is simply to localize, collect, drag and cover everything with sand, because the waves are strong, the water can get it all out and take it away overnight,- explains Ilya.The volunteer says, that not only residents of Anapa, but also visitors from other regions who spent the winter here came to the beach to help.-There are still no people. Therefore, of course, we need to help. We also have our own work. Now it's dark, we stopped working. At night everyone will come to their senses a little and tomorrow we will start again, because the water will only erode further and further. The scale here is catastrophic. The state, local businesses, and people need to somehow unite,- says Ilya.&nbsp;Fuel oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which are proven carcinogens. Breathing fuel oil vapors causes irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing, shortness of breath and can lead to the development of bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Fuel oil particles entering the lungs can cause fibrosis and other chronic diseases. Direct contact with fuel oil causes dermatitis, eczema and other skin diseases. Some components of fuel oil have neurotoxic properties that affect the nervous system. This can manifest itself in headaches, dizziness, weakness and other neurological symptoms.In the morning, Governor of the Krasnodar Territory Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed, that after the tanker crash -Volgoneft 239- and Volgoneft 212 washed up oil products on the coast. oil products washed ashore.

Among them are Tina Kandelaki and employees of the presidential administration and the GRUSystem journalists&nbsp;(Radio Liberty project) prepareda partial list of Russians, against whom the European Union is preparing sanctions due to involvement in Russian hybrid operations in Europe and Africa. It will include 16 people and three companies.For example, the head of GC Structura LLC, Nikolai Tupikin, according to EU officials, headed the Doppelganger (-Double-) operation. This is a disinformation campaign launched after the start of the war in Ukraine and is aimed at audiences in the EU and the USA. It was used to publish fake news on websites imitating major international media and other authoritative sources.An employee of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sofya Zakharova, also participated in this campaign, who, among other things, may be associated with projects to discredit the Russian opposition , which for the first time became one of the reasons for the introduction of EU sanctions.The sanctions list, which has not yet been officially published, also included a former TV presenter, deputy general director Gazprom Media Tinatin (Tina) Kandelaki. It is alleged that it is engaged in propaganda justifying Russian aggression in Ukraine, and in the occupied territories its structures replaced Ukrainian TV channels with Russian ones.FSB officer Artem Kureev should be subject to EU sanctions - he launched propaganda projects Rusafro and African Initiative (- African Initiative-), spread disinformation accusing the West of -experiments to create bioweapons-, which talked about -genetically modified mosquitoes-, as well as the fact that Western companies, under the guise of vaccination, allegedly used the African population as a -free clinical base-.Another people on the list: GRU officers Yuri Sizov and Vladimir Lipchenko, who were allegedly involved in the creation of intelligence networks, arson and attacks on critical infrastructure in the EU countries and Ukraine. The sanctions should include GRU military unit 29155, headed by GRU Major General Andrei Averyanov. The unit's employees were associated with a number of European GRU operations. For example, in an investigation by the Czech weekly Respekt and Bellingcat it was said that the Russian military intelligence operation to organize sabotage at weapons depots in the Czech Republic in the fall of 2014 took place under the personal control of Averyanov. Averyanov himself leads operations in Africa to undermine democracy, the draft sanctions say. Russian forces may have mined gold in Mali to finance these operations, the document's authors claim.EU foreign ministers are due to approve the new sanctions list on December 16.	https://t.me/astrapress/70206	2024-12-13T11:07:29-08:00

A criminal case was opened against an Iranian singer because of an online concert where she sang without a hijabIranian singer Parastu Ahmadi performed in one of the traditional Iranian caravanserais (a resting place for caravans in the Persian Empire), broadcast on her YouTube channel. Parastu was not wearing a hijab and was wearing an evening dress, which is contrary to Iranian laws. After 1979, women in the country also do not have the right to sing in public, so her concert is also a violation of the laws.Before the performance, Ahmadi said: -I want to sing for the people I love. This is a right that I cannot ignore: to sing for the land that I love dearly.-The concert was watched by many viewers, despite the YouTube ban in Iran. After widespread publicity, security agents came to Ahmadi's house with a search, and she was summoned to the Tehran security prosecutor's office for questioning, writes Euronews. A criminal case was opened against the singer and her team for violating morality and the law and lack of permission to conduct an online broadcast of the concert.🌱 Subscribe to ASTRA.
