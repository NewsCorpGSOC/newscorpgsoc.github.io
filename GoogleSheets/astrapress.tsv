ASTRA: In Makeevka, the Russian Aerospace Forces dropped a FAB-500 near a residential building. 3 more aerial bombs were found in the Belgorod region. As ASTRA found out, 3 FABs fell from Russian aircraft in the Belgorod region over the past few days. So, on November 23, an aerial bomb was found in a field near the village of Surkovo... Due to the fall of a 250-kilogram aerial bomb in a village in the Belgorod region, 100 people were evacuated 2 more FABs fell on the same day in the region, no one was injured. As ASTRA found out, due to the -abnormal descent- of a FAB-250 from a Russian plane in the village of Kazatskoye, Yakovlevsky urban district, on November 26, residents of several streets were evacuated, in total - about 100 people. Sources in the region's emergency services told ASTRA that an aerial bomb fell near a residential building on Novaya Street. The bomb did not explode, so no one was injured. Now the FAB has already been confiscated, the residents have returned to their homes. Another aerial bomb was found on the same day a few kilometers from the village of Nikolskoye, Belgorod district. Another FAB was dropped on November 26 in the Bystry farm. In both cases there were no casualties or damage.Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 159 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and in Russian-controlled territories Ukraine for 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69552	2024-11-30T23:19:21-08:00

Journalists found a Russian filtration camp for captured Ukrainians in Belarus - investigation by the Belarusian Investigative CenterAt the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military created a filtration camp on the territory of Belarus. Journalists found out that it was located on the basis of one of the buildings that belonged to a Belarusian state-owned enterprise -Pripyat Alliance- in Narovlya (Gomel region). Some human rights activists call this camp one of the most cruel against prisoners. Not only Ukrainian military personnel were taken there, but also civilians, including minors. For example, a resident of the Kyiv region Larisa Yagodinskaya said that in March 2022, her two sons were taken there, one of whom had not yet reached the age of eighteen at that time: -They said that the sons were saboteurs, and they took them and took them to Chernobyl. There it turned out that they were beating them, and as [the younger son] Slava later told them, [that the eldest son] most likely even broke his ribs, they beat him hard with a bat.- UAF serviceman Bogdan Lysenko, who was captured by the Russian military at the end of March 2022, also spoke about the torture of civilians: -Narovlya - it was such a propaganda picture that we [Russian military] are, like, humane... But none of them shows how civilians were interrogated there. And they beat civilians there, God forbid... That is, screams were constantly heard there.- According to human rights activists, now some of the Ukrainians who passed through the filtration camp in Narovlya are still in captivity, in particular, on the territory of penal colonies in Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69426	2024-11-28T23:32:32-08:00

SchoolboyArsenia Turbinaconvicted to&nbsp;five years under&nbsp;terrorist charges, again sent to a punishment cellHe was placed in a punishment cell for seven days - the maximum term for minors.

Arseny insisted that he did not join the legion, but distributed leaflets out of personal convictions. Later, the Court of Appeal reduced his term of imprisonment by&nbsp;24 days.In October, Turbin in a letter from the pre-trial detention center reported ,that he was being beaten: -This evening after 18:00 he punched me in the head on the bed twice. The situation is very difficult and critical. Azizbek beat me and said that I would get kicked at night (only with obscenities). The night will be very difficult. But I will hold on.- Later the cellmate was resettled. The schoolboy’s mother also said that Arseny lost 17 kilograms in the pre-trial detention center.	https://t.me/astrapress/69363	2024-11-28T01:29:05-08:00

The Central Election Commission spent four months looking for errors in his election reporting. The politician explained the fine by saying that the CEC blocked his election account - and tens of thousands of sheets had to be printed at SberbankA court in Moscow fined Boris Nadezhdin, a participant in the 2024 presidential elections blocked by the CEC, for errors in the pre-election financial report. Three fines of 50 thousand rubles each for:— illegal use of donations received in violation;— violation of the rules for transferring funds contributed to the election fund;— failure to provide a complete attachment financial report. Nadezhdin announced the court's decision this evening. Previously he wrote on his channel that his violations were explained by the fact that on February 8 the Central Election Commission blocked his election account. Because of this, financial statements had to be submitted to the Ministry of Justice on 50 thousand sheets of paper, -the unfortunate Sberbank was responsible for printing them - which it did for several days around the clock- [stack of papers in the photo]. The politician also complained about the large number of signature collectors - according to him, it was technically difficult for them to print out all the payments for donations. -It is completely incomprehensible why in the 21st century one would submit a financial report and applications on paper, despite the fact that the Central Election Commission sees all transactions on the election account online,- he wrote. The politician explained that the court reduced the amount of the fine from 75 thousand because it took into account mitigating circumstances -the size of the pension, the presence of children, etc.- Nadezhdin added that two of the four donations for which the Central Bank issued him this fine were 30 and 70 (thirty and seventy) rubles. -We will appeal,- he wrote.	https://t.me/astrapress/69330	2024-11-27T11:33:03-08:00

The first amendment concerned the bot for -breaking through-, which is used by security forcesToday, the State Duma unanimously adopted in the 2nd and 3rd final readings a package of bills that tightens administrative liability and introduces criminal liability for the leakage of personal data . -The punishment will directly depend on the volume of the leak: for legal entities it will range from 5 to 15 million rubles. In the event of a repeated leak, the company will have to pay a turnover fine: from 1 to 3% of its last year’s turnover. The toughest sanctions are provided for leaks of biometric personal data. In case of repeated violation, the fine will be up to 25 million to 0.5 billion rubles,- Deputy Khinshtein explained the procedure for fines. The law also introduces a prison sentence for the illegal use, collection, storage or transfer of personal data obtained illegally. Up to 4 years without aggravating circumstances and up to 10 years if the crime was committed by a group of people or resulted in grave consequences. Today, the administration of -Eyes of God-, the most popular bot for -breaking through- the personal data of Russians, responded to the amendments. According to the amendments, administering such a bot may be punishable by imprisonment.

He added that the law adopted today by the State Duma is called by independent media the -law against investigative journalists-, since for many years they have been using data leaks and bots like the -Eyes of God- to investigate corruption and the activities of the Russian special services.	https://t.me/astrapress/69269	2024-11-26T09:45:14-08:00

Another FAB was found in the Shakhtarsky district. In both cases, no one was injured. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 156 cases of FAB aerial bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024.

There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine.

They want to sentence a Khabarovsk student to 11 years in prison for ordering a foreign medicineHe suffers from a sleep disorder and purchased a medicine that is considered a drug in RussiaForeign Doctors diagnosed student Andrei Moroztsev with idiopathic hypersomnia. He has been living with the disease since school. As a young man himself toldjournalists about its performance — -this is 50-70% of the level of an ordinary person, if you follow all the recommendations and daily routine.--This is not what ordinary people feel in the evenings. It’s as if your head is being grabbed by a hoop, and lead is poured into the center - and you fall asleep, because it’s impossible to fight this painful feeling,- Andrei said.Last spring, he received an email ordered an Indian medicine for hypersomnia and became involved in a criminal case for the purchase and smuggling of drugs (Articles 228 and 229.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). In November, as found out -7x7-, the prosecutor asked to sentence Andrei to 11 years in a maximum security colony. The medicine that Andrey ordered from India contains an analogue of modafinil - this is a pharmaceutical stimulant, which in the USA, Europe and even a number of CIS countries is prescribed to patients with narcolepsy, hypersomnia and other sleep disorders. In Russia, this substance has been available since 2012 banned as a drug.Morozov is by no means the first patient with a similar diagnosis to face criminal prosecution for ordering Indian drugs. So, only at the beginning of 2024, a physicist from St. Petersburg Andrei Volotka for ordering modafinil by mail received4 years of strict regime. After the start of criminal prosecution, Andrei Morozov founded the -Ratio- community of Russians with sleep disorders. In May of this year, patients turnedto Putin with a request to allow the import of modafinil into Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69225	2024-11-25T12:38:21-08:00

He began to demand to continue, I refused without a condom, but he began to beat me and yell that he would -fuck without a condom- and without lubrication (I didn’t want sex and I was dry), that he never uses them and does not intend to.

Putin more than doubled payments to the Russian Guard for signing the contractNow for signing a contract for participation in the war with Ukraine, Roskvardia fighters will be paid a one-time payment of 400 thousand rubles - against the 195 thousand rubles they have been paid for the contract since November 2022. All contract soldiers now receive the same payment of 400 thousand rubles. In November, the Russian authorities changed the system of monetary remuneration for the military. So, two weeks ago after Putin’s decree, the government sharply reduced payments to the militaryfor injuries - up to 30 times. Then Putin (by his own decree) raised payments for injuries resulting in disability by a million rubles. After that State Duma obliged volunteers to pay for military equipment lost in battle. All this is happening against the backdrop of an unprecedented increase in the size of one-time payments for signing a contract in 2024. With the help of these payments, regions compete for the number of contract soldiers sent to war. The current record is held by the Belgorod region, where you can get 3 million rubles for signing a permanent contract with the Ministry of Defense.	https://t.me/astrapress/69201	2024-11-25T07:23:17-08:00

Many were lured into the war by deceptionSince at least July 2024, Russia has been recruiting Yemenis to take part in the invasion of Ukraine, writes the British newspaper Financial Times with a link to an interview with mercenaries.&nbsp; Yemen is a poor Muslim country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula that has been torn by civil war for 10 years. Payments for Russian contracts are huge amounts of money by the standards of this country, but even despite this, some Yemenis are recruited into the war by deception. Two of the newspaper's interlocutors, Yemenis Abdullah and Nabil recruited by Russia, said that they were lured into the war by deception. Abdullah thought he was flying to Russia to work in the drone industry. Nabil believed that he would be offered a job in the fields of -security- and -engineering.- Abdullah told reporters that when his group from Yemen refused to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense, the military present at the scene fired a shot in the air so that the foreigners would still sign the contracts. According to the man, he was brought to the war by -scammers who traffic people.-Yemen is not the only country in the Global South whose residents are being deceived by Russia into sending them to fight in Ukraine. Thus, in the spring of this year, India reported, that there was a real -human trafficking network- in the countrythat sent Indians to Russia.
