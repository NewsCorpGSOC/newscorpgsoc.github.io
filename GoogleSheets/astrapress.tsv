At least 10 conscripts from the Chebarkul military units of the 90th Guards Tank Division received transfers for allegedly signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense. In the division to the local‚Ä¶ Parents of conscripts from Chelyabinsk demand that Putin figure out why their children sign the contract,having barely entered the military unitRelatives of conscripts serving in the Chebarkul garrison No. 93992, write mass appeals to the direct line with Putin, which will take place on December 19. They are concerned that in military units, conscripts en masse sign contracts in the very first days of service.Parents of conscripts are convinced: their children sign contracts under psychological pressure, and reports on the revocation of the document remain unheeded. In addition to the direct line, families turn to military prosecutors at various levels, human rights ombudsmen, courts and other authorities. So far, to no avail: nothing is known about examples of contract termination in Chebarkul.The initiators of the appeal say that conscripts are being encouraged to sign a contract on the way to the unit. Most recruits do not give in to persuasion, but they continue to be intensively convinced once in the military unit. In particular, threats to send them to the Belgorod or Kursk regions, from where the soldiers -will return with a load of 200.- If the serviceman continues to persist, he is offered to sign a -document- in order to remain in the Chebarkul units (in the military police, in the medical battalion, as drivers).The parents do not have the original or copies of the signed documents, but they believe that the fact of imprisonment military contract is confirmed by large amounts from 400 thousand to 2&nbsp;million rubles received in the bank accounts of their children. From the name of these payments it is clear that we are talking about one-time payments for imprisonment agreement with the Ministry of Defense. Amounts vary as the conclusion passes through different regions. Officially transfer of money explained by a technical failure.The 90th Guards Tank is based in Chebarkul division. In 2022, its fighters took part in the attack on Kyiv, where parts of the division were ambushed, suffered heavy losses and took refuge in Bogdanovka, Brovary district. Previously, Astra journalists talked about the massacres and rapes committed by the division‚Äôs soldiers in Bogdanovka that period.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

They claim that, at least in their city, only they and local Cossacks removed oil products from the beach - the Emergency Situations Ministry employees did not help them.-They bought everything themselves, brought it in cars. Someone bought, for example, just a huge number of 120-liter basins. There are many people willing, but there is no equipment, not even clothes. Because we also went and realized that we had simply gotten away with everything. People are all standing in the dark. Shoes, clothes, it won‚Äôt wash off anything,- said volunteer Ilya.According to him, there is a stench on the beach. As a result, some of the volunteers feel sick - today they did not yet know about the smell and did not stock up on masks. Ilya is preparing for the fact that tomorrow there will be even more work, as there is a strong wind that will bring new fuel oil ashore.-We collected the fuel oil in bags. No one has taken them out yet. The Ministry of Emergency Situations will most likely give some instructions on this matter, but so far there are none. That is, our task for now is simply to localize, collect, drag and cover everything with sand, because the waves are strong, the water can get it all out and take it away overnight,- explains Ilya.The volunteer says, that not only residents of Anapa, but also visitors from other regions who spent the winter here came to the beach to help.-There are still no people. Therefore, of course, we need to help. We also have our own work. Now it's dark, we stopped working. At night everyone will come to their senses a little and tomorrow we will start again, because the water will only erode further and further. The scale here is catastrophic. The state, local businesses, and people need to somehow unite,- says Ilya.&nbsp;Fuel oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which are proven carcinogens. Breathing fuel oil vapors causes irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing, shortness of breath and can lead to the development of bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Fuel oil particles entering the lungs can cause fibrosis and other chronic diseases. Direct contact with fuel oil causes dermatitis, eczema and other skin diseases. Some components of fuel oil have neurotoxic properties that affect the nervous system. This can manifest itself in headaches, dizziness, weakness and other neurological symptoms.In the morning, Governor of the Krasnodar Territory Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed, that after the tanker crash -Volgoneft 239- and Volgoneft 212 washed up oil products on the coast. oil products washed ashore.

Among them are Tina Kandelaki and employees of the presidential administration and the GRUSystem journalists&nbsp;(Radio Liberty project) prepareda partial list of Russians, against whom the European Union is preparing sanctions due to involvement in Russian hybrid operations in Europe and Africa. It will include 16 people and three companies.For example, the head of GC Structura LLC, Nikolai Tupikin, according to EU officials, headed the Doppelganger (-Double-) operation. This is a disinformation campaign launched after the start of the war in Ukraine and is aimed at audiences in the EU and the USA. It was used to publish fake news on websites imitating major international media and other authoritative sources.An employee of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sofya Zakharova, also participated in this campaign, who, among other things, may be associated with projects to discredit the Russian opposition , which for the first time became one of the reasons for the introduction of EU sanctions.The sanctions list, which has not yet been officially published, also included a former TV presenter, deputy general director Gazprom Media Tinatin (Tina) Kandelaki. It is alleged that it is engaged in propaganda justifying Russian aggression in Ukraine, and in the occupied territories its structures replaced Ukrainian TV channels with Russian ones.FSB officer Artem Kureev should be subject to EU sanctions - he launched propaganda projects Rusafro and African Initiative (- African Initiative-), spread disinformation accusing the West of -experiments to create bioweapons-, which talked about -genetically modified mosquitoes-, as well as the fact that Western companies, under the guise of vaccination, allegedly used the African population as a -free clinical base-.Another people on the list: GRU officers Yuri Sizov and Vladimir Lipchenko, who were allegedly involved in the creation of intelligence networks, arson and attacks on critical infrastructure in the EU countries and Ukraine. The sanctions should include GRU military unit 29155, headed by GRU Major General Andrei Averyanov. The unit's employees were associated with a number of European GRU operations. For example, in an investigation by the Czech weekly Respekt and Bellingcat it was said that the Russian military intelligence operation to organize sabotage at weapons depots in the Czech Republic in the fall of 2014 took place under the personal control of Averyanov. Averyanov himself leads operations in Africa to undermine democracy, the draft sanctions say. Russian forces may have mined gold in Mali to finance these operations, the document's authors claim.EU foreign ministers are due to approve the new sanctions list on December 16.	https://t.me/astrapress/70206	2024-12-13T11:07:29-08:00

This is a right that I cannot ignore: to sing for the land that I love dearly.-The concert was watched by many viewers, despite the YouTube ban in Iran.

In 2024, 54 journalists were killed in the world - Reporters Without BordersBy according tothe organization, a third of the 54 dead journalists were killed in the Gaza Strip. They also write that at least 13 journalists have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion began.550 journalists are currently imprisoned around the world, up 7% from last year. Almost half of all imprisoned journalists in the world are in prisons in just four countries: China, including Hong Kong (124), Myanmar (61), Israel (41) and Belarus (40).-Journalists don‚Äôt die, they are killed ; they are not in prison, the regimes lock them up; they don't disappear, they are kidnapped. These crimes, often orchestrated by governments and armed groups with complete impunity, violate international law and too often go unpunished. We need to keep things moving, remind ourselves as citizens that journalists die for us, keep us informed. We must continue to count, name, convict, investigate and enforce justice. Fatalism must never win. Defending those who inform us is defending the truth,- said RSF Director General Thibau Bruttin.	https://t.me/astrapress/70131	2024-12-12T01:00:29-08:00

A teacher from the Moscow region was accused of -propaganda of quadrobing- because of an assignment based on Turgenev‚Äôs story -Mumu- ‚Äã‚Äã At the Aviatika Lyceum in the city of Lobnya, a literature teacher asked fifth-graders to write an essay on behalf of Mumu dogs. The task sounded like this: -Imagine yourself in Mumu‚Äôs place. Tell us how your day goes, what and how you usually do. How do you feel about your owner, what do you like, what don‚Äôt like, what are you afraid of, what do you dream about,- reports the pro-Kremlin publication Shot. However, this creative exercise caused dissatisfaction among some parents. They considered the task -creative quadrobing- and appealed to the director of the lyceum with complaints. In addition, after the situation was written about in the press, people began to be indignant that the teacher‚Äôs name is Aruvkhan Vazirovna: -Is it in your lyceum that migrant teachers force children to bark like dogs from Turgenev‚Äôs text Mu-mu? Shame!-, addressed attention -Non-Moscow speaking.- At the same time, Aruvkhan is a citizen of Russia - she comes from Karachay-Cherkessia. The Ministry of Education of the Moscow Region took the woman's side. Department explained that such a task helps children develop emotional intelligence and analyze the feelings of literary characters. State Duma deputy Vitaly Milonov also joined the discussion: he called the parents‚Äô claims unfounded and proposed organizing an open lesson for them to explain the content of Turgenev‚Äôs work. According to him, his parents probably never understood what the story -Mumu- ‚Äã‚Äãwas really about.	https://t.me/astrapress/70121	2024-12-11T23:14:53-08:00

In London, Russian agents wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev and editor-in-chief of The Insider Roman Dobrokhotov, -BBC and TelegraphA group of five Bulgarian citizens arrested in 2023 are suspected of spying for Moscow for at least three years, the BBC and Telegraph report, citing case materials. They are accused of participating in intelligence collection operations in the UK, Germany, Austria, Spain and Montenegro.At the trial in a London court, it became known that a group of agents planned to kidnap the editor-in-chief of The Insider, Roman Dobrokhotov. The operation, called Operation Fishing Boat, involved a plan to smuggle the journalist out of the UK by boat. In addition to kidnapping, the defendants also considered more radical measures, such as staging Dobrokhotov‚Äôs death, for example, as a result of an accident. However, these ideas were abandoned, considering them ineffective. In addition, the men wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev, the publications write. The investigation claims that one of the coordinators of the operation was the Austrian businessman Jan Marsalek, associated with Russian intelligence. The cell was led by Orlin Rusev. In addition to Rusev, the group also included Bizer Dzhambazov, Katrin Ivanova, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir Ivanchev. Rusev and Dzhambazov have already pleaded guilty to espionage. The remaining defendants continue to deny the charges. Previously, journalists from The Insider and Bellingcat published high-profile investigations, including about the assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The investigation claims that Russian intelligence saw Dobrokhotov as a threat and assigned the cell to monitor him, as well as his colleague Hristo Grozev.In the picture, from left to right: Vanya Gaberova, court employee, Katrin Ivanova, court employee and Tihomir Ivanchev at the Old Bailey	https://t.me/astrapress/70035	2024-12-10T23:37:17-08:00
