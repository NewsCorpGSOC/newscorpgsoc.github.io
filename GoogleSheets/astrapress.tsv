They are complaining about him from the frontIn the Belgorod region, the general director of the construction company Vek LLC, Alexander Spiridonov, has been refusing to pay a team of 18 workers 18 million rubles for almost two years. The last time, Spiridonov explained his refusal by saying that former builders had gone to war in Ukraine, which means -why do you need money if you die there?- ASTRA was told about this by Arzuman Manukyan, who, as he claims, was defrauded of 8,700,000 rubles by a foreman, a resident of Belgorod and a participant in the war in Ukraine from military unit 74507.-When we told him about our desire to participate in the -SVO- and asked to make payments for completed government orders, he replied: -Why do you need money, you‚Äôll die anyway.- These words pierce the heart. We fulfilled all government orders, worked honestly, and now we are left without a livelihood,- Manukyan said. Spiridonov's company -Vek- has an authorized capital of only 10,000 rubles and 7 employees: a janitor, a security guard, a security guard, a chief engineer, a foreman, a deputy general director - Spiridonov's wife Yulia, and Spiridonov himself (the list of employees is at the disposal of ASTRA). Despite this, judging by open sources, Spiridonov‚Äôs company receives dozens of government orders, including from the Ministry of Construction of the Belgorod Region, totaling approximately 1.2 billion rubles. For example: the construction of a house for orphans and a hostel in Valuiki, residential buildings in Alekseevka, a school in Krasny Khutor, the House of Culture in Prokhorovka, landscaping in Nelidovka and Bessonovka and others, ASTRA was convinced.Manukyan claims that he worked for Spiridonov from March 2022 to September 2023 at a rate of 200,000 rubles a month, processed, albeit without a contract. He recruited his familiar workers to fulfill the orders, but in the end, instead of the promised salaries, the builders received no more than 30,000 rubles a month. Spiridonov delayed full payments to workers, claiming that the regional administration owed him 450 million rubles for completed projects, so there was nothing to pay the builders with. Because of this, Manukyan, who called his acquaintances to work, had to sell his property for 1 million rubles - this is how he paid the workers himself. -We are appealing from 40 people, but not everyone can be present here, because some are in hospitals. [Spiridonov] gave us small advances for the work done, and promised the rest after the objects were delivered. The objects were handed over, but we didn‚Äôt receive the money,- deceived residents of the Belgorod region addressed Leonid Kapliy, a member of the Public Council at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, in a video from the front. Other workers appealed to the governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov. Manukyan turned to the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin. It is alleged that he reacted and a criminal case was opened under Article 145.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Non-payment of wages), but Spiridonov is a witness in the case, the criminal case itself was opened against an unspecified person. Manukyan says that Spiridonov has a -protection- in local branches of law enforcement agencies that are trying to delay the case, including investigator Kira Zhenikova. -From October 2022 to February 2023, the management of Vek LLC, knowing reliably about the presence of A.G. Manukyan, an employee of the said Company. wage arrears, in violation of Art. 37 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Articles 2, 21, 22, 136 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, due to other personal interests, wages were not partially paid to the specified employee for more than three months, while the available funds were directed to the economic needs of the enterprise,- said the decision of the deputy head of the investigative committee for Belgorod, Gulin. -It‚Äôs all deception and extortion,- Spiridonov responded to an ASTRA correspondent‚Äôs request to comment on the situation and hung up.

The Vatican published the first photo of Pope Francis after a month of hospitalizationIn the picture, the 88-year-old pontiff is depicted from the back in the chapel, equipped in the room next to the ward of the Roman clinic Gemelli, where he remains under the supervision of doctors. The Vatican said in an official statement that Francis celebrated Mass on Sunday with other priests.The pope was hospitalized with a severe respiratory infection that developed into bilateral pneumonia, threatening his life. In recent days, some improvement in his condition has been reported. There are no oxygen tubes in the photo, although the Vatican previously reported that the pontiff was undergoing oxygen therapy. Since his hospitalization on February 14, Francis has never appeared in public. His only appeal was a recorded audio message to believers. Vatican officials have not yet made predictions about when he will be able to return to full-time duties.Francis's hospitalization served as a reason for the replication of the prophecy of St. Malachy, the authenticity of which has not been confirmed. It says that the current Pope will be the last in the history of mankind. After his departure, Rome will be destroyed, the end of the world will come and the Last Judgment will begin.	https://t.me/astrapress/76764	2025-03-17T01:41:14-07:00

The United States is withdrawing from the international task force investigating Russia's crimes in Ukraine, - The New York TimesOfficial notice of the decision is expected to be sent out on Monday to staff and members of Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, The New York Times reports, citing people familiar with the matter. The international team behind the US withdrawal is playing a key role in gathering evidence, supporting Ukrainian investigators and developing a legal strategy to prosecute those responsible for crimes committed by the Russian military and the country's leadership.According to sources familiar with the situation, the reason for the US withdrawal could be legal and political disagreements over the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is also involved in the investigation. Washington does not officially recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has previously caused tension in relations with European partners.Officials in the European Union and Ukraine have not yet commented on how this decision will affect the effectiveness of investigations.	https://t.me/astrapress/76753	2025-03-17T00:41:00-07:00

In Saratov, a photographer received 5 days of arrest for a photograph of NavalnyOn February 16, photographer Nurlan Sultanov (in the photo in a white jacket) attached an image of politician Alexei Navalny to the monument to Nikolai Vavilov in Saratov. The police saw this, asked the photographer to peel off the photograph and asked for his passport information, after which they released him. However, then the security forces tried to contact Sultanov, but he did not answer. Then the police persuaded an unknown girl to become a customer for a photo shoot with Sultanov. When the young man arrived at the place on March 14 - at a photo studio on Bolshaya Kazachyaya - instead of a female fashion model, he was met by two policemen. Then, during his arrest, he was beaten, says lawyer and deputy chairman of the Saratov branch of the Yabloko party, Kirill Rumyantsev. -According to my client, the police struck him in the solar plexus and the back of the head, spoke rudely to get him to admit guilt and give the necessary testimony (about participation in the activities of an extremist organization and support for its ideology). After the confession, the police officers promised Sultanov -to get off with just a fine,- -saidRumyantsev. Sultanov refused to admit guilt. In the two days that he spent in the cell before the trial, he was fed only once, Rumyantsev says. As a result, on March 16, the judge found Sultanov guilty under Part 1 of Art. 20.3. Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation (demonstration of extremist symbols) and imposed a sentence of administrative arrest for 5 days. Taking into account the two days already served, he will spend another 3 days in the detention center.‚òÆÔ∏è Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/76738	2025-03-16T13:23:25-07:00

FSB reported on preventing terrorist attacks with postal parcelsThe Russian FSB claims that it stopped an attempt by the Ukrainian special services to organize a series of terrorist attacks using parcels with disguised explosive devices. This was reported by the state agency TASS with reference to the Public Relations Center (CSR) of the FSB.The intelligence service said that they found five parcels at the Chelyabinsk airport, inside of which there were improvised explosive devices disguised as perfume sets. If the package was opened, the devices should have worked. Among the addresses of the parcel recipients were Engels, Moscow, Lyubertsy and Voronezh.As a result of the department's operation in Pervouralsk (Sverdlovsk region), a Russian was detained, allegedly recruited by the Ukrainian special services. He, according to the security forces, admitted that his curators promised $6 thousand for completing the task, but never paid.Recall that yesterday in the Ukrainian Ivano-Frankivsk, employees of the Ukrainian special services, in turn, reported that two teenagers recruited by the FSB tried to blow up a railway facility, but blew themselves up.

üñº - Dismantling of the Kyiv regime - Russia can propose at negot...	-Dismantling the Kyiv regime- can be proposed by Russia at the negotiations, - The Washington Post-An influential Moscow think tank, closely associated with the Russian FSB,- has prepared a document with maximalist demands aimed at achieving Moscow‚Äôs strategic goals in the Ukrainian conflict, writes The Washington Post. According to the publication, the document was prepared in February, a week before the negotiations between Russia and the USA, held on February 18 in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.According to information received by journalists from European intelligence sources, the document proposals from the administration of US President Donald Trump to end the war in Ukraine within 100 days, as well as plans to send peacekeepers to the region, are rejected. Instead, it is argued that -a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis cannot occur until 2026.-The authors of the document insist on official recognition of Russian sovereignty over the occupied territories of Ukraine. In addition, it is proposed to create a buffer zone in the north-east of Ukraine, adjacent to the Bryansk and Belgorod regions of Russia, as well as a demilitarized zone in the south of Ukraine, which will also affect the Odessa region.The document also contains a demand for the -complete dismantling- of the current Ukrainian government, since the authors believe that -the current Kiev regime cannot be changed from within the country.- In addition, there is disagreement with maintaining the size of the Ukrainian army at the current level and with the continued supply of American weapons to Ukraine after a possible peace agreement.The document emphasizes the need to normalize relations between Washington and Moscow by restoring the full diplomatic staff of embassies. It is proposed to appoint Alexander Darchiev as Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the United States, which, according to the authors, should help improve bilateral relations.As for the sanctions imposed against Russia, the authors of the document believe that their significance is -clearly exaggerated- and reject attempts to involve Russia in a peace agreement through partial lifting of sanctions. They argue that -it is unclear what Russia would benefit from- such an approach.Russian Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Washington Post that the Kremlin was -not aware of such recommendations- and called them -extremely contradictory.- -We&nbsp;are working with&nbsp;more thoughtful options,-&nbsp;said Peskov.At the same time, as the publication notes, some of the proposals presented in the document have already been put forward by the Russian authorities. In particular, Russia offered the US access to its mineral resources, including in the occupied territories of Ukraine, and also advocated for the restoration of the staff of diplomats in the embassies of the two countries. Both of these proposals were in&nbsp;the document.	https://t.me/astrapress/76432	2025-03-13T02:05:41-07:00

Former President of the Philippines was detained on an ICC warrantFormer President of the Philippines, 79-year-old Rodrigo Duterte, was detained at Manila International Airport on a warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The arrest is related to charges of crimes against humanity committed during his anti-drug campaign, reports the Associated Press. According to human rights activists, more than 12 thousand people were killed in anti-drug operations during Duterte's presidency from 2016 to 2022.&nbsp;In 2019, Duterte removed the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the Rome Statute, under which the ICC operates, so Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Panelo, called the arrest illegal. However, the court stated that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed up to that point - from November 1, 2011 to March 16, 2019 inclusive.&nbsp;The detainee's daughter, Sara Duterte, is the vice president of the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte as president in 2022, has stated his readiness to cooperate with the ICC on issues related to the arrest.&nbsp;It is currently unknown where Duterte is being held after his arrest and when he will be brought to Europe to be transferred to the ICC.	https://t.me/astrapress/76281	2025-03-11T01:45:44-07:00
