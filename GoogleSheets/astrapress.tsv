ASTRA] two men in civilian clothes approached (one of them is in the photo) and demanded to see documents. When asked to introduce themselves, one of them produced a document indicating that he was a military police officer. Dmitry asked them why, firstly, they were dressed -in civilian clothes-, and secondly, why they demanded documents from a civilian, to which they, according to Dmitry‚Äôs wife, allegedly replied that -the laws have changed and they have everyone has the right to check documents.- After this, Dmitry‚Äôs wife began filming what happened on her phone, to which the men threatened her with an article about -discrediting- the military and demanded that she stop filming. Following this, a group of security officers drove up to the store, grabbed Dmitry and put him in the car. -I ran after him, tried to pull him out.

Also at the event, Putin was shown the proposed single currency of the BRICS member countries, although the head of the Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, did not value the banknote.

Why he decided that they did not comply is unclear. And in the form of, so to speak, punishment, he decided to throw them into a pit. This is a cellar that closes. And he abandoned all the wounded.

Ukrainian partisan Grigory Sinchenko, who once escaped from the basements of the -DPR-, is being tortured in a Russian pre-trial detention center, his mother reported Grigory Sinchenko, a disabled person of the third group, a native of Donetsk, is subjected to systematic torture in pre-trial detention center No. 2 in Taganrog and are denied medical care. About this toldhis mother Tatyana Gulevskaya. -During the next court hearing on August 12, 2024, to which the lawyer connected via video link, Grigory looked beaten and exhausted. The defense lawyer saw Sinchenko with bruises on his face: there were fresh hematomas under Grigory‚Äôs eyes, abrasions on his chin and lips, his whole face was swollen. The lawyer only had time to ask Grigory a question about his condition, after which the video link was immediately turned off,- Gulevskaya said. Two days later, the lawyer arrived at the pre-trial detention center, but he was not allowed to see Sinchenko and was given a note in which the prisoner said that he allegedly did not want to see him. At the next meeting on August 26, Sinchenko sat silently with his head down and admitted his guilt for the first time. Sinchenko's mother and lawyer believe that the man was tortured in order to extract a confession. The defense attorney never managed to get to Grigory after that meeting. A few months earlier, in May, Sinchenko declared a hunger strike and opened his veins. Sinchenko is accused of -espionage-, -sabotage- and other crimes committed in the -DPR- in 2016-2019. After his arrest in Donetsk in 2016, according to his mother, he was tortured with electric shocks, hung from the ceiling by his hands and strangled. Later in the exchange he returned to Ukraine. In 2019, he was detained again in his native Donetsk - after he blew up a mobile station and posted a video on YouTube with the caption: -This was done to draw attention to inhuman torture in the basements of the MGB. The people of Donbass must go out to protest against torture or the fascist republic will remain without communication.-In 2020, Sinchenko managed to escape from the detention center, but the man was recaptured.	https://t.me/astrapress/66942	2024-10-22T10:50:10-07:00

Moscow conscripts were forced to sign a form with access to state secrets Moscow college student told -Conscript School- that he and about 20 other young people were invited to the Unified Recruitment Point (EPP) in Moscow to -clarify military registration data,- where they received a questionnaire in which they were asked to sign under the clause on access to state secrets and responsibility for their dissemination. Admission to state secrets means a ban on leaving the country for up to 5 years after its termination. An attempt to leave the country while having access to state secrets is also a crime.-The requirements of the Moscow Military Commissariat to fill out the item on access to state secrets are illegal. Neither the law nor the Regulations on conscription for military service require this of conscripts. Access to state secrets is issued when a person must work with classified information. But this should only happen with the consent of the citizen. The exception is conscripts. They may be allowed access to state secrets without consent, since the military unit itself may be secret. The conscripts do not touch any state secrets,- human rights activists note. -Getting access to state secrets means that the military registration and enlistment office will have one more reason to make threats. They will say: -if you report something publicly about violations during the draft, we will put you in prison for disclosing state secrets,- says project lawyer Timofey Vaskin.	https://t.me/astrapress/66929	2024-10-22T06:25:20-07:00

The commanders are hiding from their relatives and inviting them to evacuate the wounded themselvesWives and mothers of military personnel assigned to Lugansk military unit 40463 turned to Putin and Bastrykin with a request to help them find their missing relatives and conduct an investigation regarding the part. They told ASTRA that military personnel are disappearing en masse before they even arrive there. Here are the stories of just a few missing men: ‚ÄîAnton Golubov. Transferred to the unit on April 29, last contacted on May 1. He has been listed as missing since May 11. ‚Äî Nikita Kim. On September 6 he went on a combat mission and went missing on September 7. ‚ÄîMobilized Dmitry Sagin. Instead of the hospital, they were sent for the assault on July 13th. Disappeared on July 14. ‚Äî World of Kokoev. On August 17 he arrived at the unit, on August 20 he last contacted his relatives. Officially listed as missing since September 3. ‚Äî Alexey Pushkarsky, father of many children. Left on a mission on September 10, disappeared without a trace on September 18. ‚Äî Danil Kiryukhin. Illegally transferred to this military unit on July 26. Since August 3 - missing. ‚Äî Dmitry Muravyov. Sent to military unit 40463 after 2 weeks of training - July 18. Since July 31, Dmitry‚Äôs status has been missing. The relatives of the missing are not given any information, and the majority of those who apply do not even have notices that their relatives are missing. At the same time, some women claim that their husbands and sons were sent to unit 40463 either illegally or as -punishment.- Thus, Mir Kokoev was transferred there as a -penalty officer- after he demanded leave, which he should have been given last year. Most women are told by nameless representatives of the unit, hiding under their Telegram nicknames, that their loved ones stopped communicating after the drone attack. A relative of Mir Kokoev, when asked how the man disappeared, was told that he might-stayed to drink tea in a nearby dugout,-and when asked to evacuate, they even answered that she could pull him out on her own fighter. -The wounded are also not evacuated - only if the soldier himself has reached the zero point... At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry still does not know that my brother is missing,-‚Äî says the sister of the missing Dmitry Muravyov. Evacuation is not carried out even in those settlements over which the Russian Defense Ministry reported control - for example, Berestovoe, where another serviceman,Maxim Startsev, disappeared. The ASTRA editorial office was also contacted by relatives of the missing: Konstantin Polichov, Ivan Romanchenko, Daut Arslanov, Konstantin Ponamarev, Ruslan Kochetkov, Vladislav Sukharevsky, Alexey Razuev, Andrey Chigarkin, Maxim Antonov, Vakil Yaunbaev , Vladimir Danilov, Alexander Khlebinskikh, Ivan Gromachenko.According to the wives, the commander of the 1st MSB is considered to be a military man with the call sign -Cap-. For assaults, after which military personnel disappear en masse - certain -Greedy- and -Zolotoy-. Relatives know the name of only the political officer of the unit - Vitaly Bugaev. Relatives of the soldiers of the same military unit who disappeared in 2022 are already wrote a petition addressed to Putin. In it they demandedto -conduct an investigation into the concealment of information by the command of the military unit about our loved ones and find out their fate.- The ASTRA editors do not know whether there was any reaction to the appeal of loved ones. ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.
