How Kommersant's sources explain that local authorities can give good reports on statistics, but the Presidential Administration wants to know how they themselves assess changes in the region citizens.In turn, the source of -Layout- in the Cabinet of Ministers saidthat the government is preparing a methodology for calculating the assessment of the work of governors based on the criterion of growth of the -total fertility rate.- For failure to meet KPIs, governors may face resignation and a -wolf ticket- for a future career, said the publication’s interlocutor in the government of one Siberian region. Most of the agitation to increase the birth rate can be expected in those regions where there is no money for material assistance to young families and mothers. -Well, think for yourself, what’s easier: to hold a poster competition -I’m a Mommy- - or to give each mommy several hundred thousand rubles?- — said the source.It is expected that the updated KPIs for governors will soon be formalized in official documents, including by presidential decree.	https://t.me/astrapress/69234	2024-11-26T00:11:37-08:00

They want to sentence a Khabarovsk student to 11 years in prison for ordering a foreign medicineHe suffers from a sleep disorder and purchased a medicine that is considered a drug in RussiaForeign Doctors diagnosed student Andrei Moroztsev with idiopathic hypersomnia. He has been living with the disease since school. As a young man himself toldjournalists about its performance — -this is 50-70% of the level of an ordinary person, if you follow all the recommendations and daily routine.--This is not what ordinary people feel in the evenings. It’s as if your head is being grabbed by a hoop, and lead is poured into the center - and you fall asleep, because it’s impossible to fight this painful feeling,- Andrei said.Last spring, he received an email ordered an Indian medicine for hypersomnia and became involved in a criminal case for the purchase and smuggling of drugs (Articles 228 and 229.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). In November, as found out -7x7-, the prosecutor asked to sentence Andrei to 11 years in a maximum security colony. The medicine that Andrey ordered from India contains an analogue of modafinil - this is a pharmaceutical stimulant, which in the USA, Europe and even a number of CIS countries is prescribed to patients with narcolepsy, hypersomnia and other sleep disorders. In Russia, this substance has been available since 2012 banned as a drug.Morozov is by no means the first patient with a similar diagnosis to face criminal prosecution for ordering Indian drugs. So, only at the beginning of 2024, a physicist from St. Petersburg Andrei Volotka for ordering modafinil by mail received4 years of strict regime. After the start of criminal prosecution, Andrei Morozov founded the -Ratio- community of Russians with sleep disorders. In May of this year, patients turnedto Putin with a request to allow the import of modafinil into Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69225	2024-11-25T12:38:21-08:00

Putin more than doubled payments to the Russian Guard for signing the contractNow for signing a contract for participation in the war with Ukraine, Roskvardia fighters will be paid a one-time payment of 400 thousand rubles - against the 195 thousand rubles they have been paid for the contract since November 2022. All contract soldiers now receive the same payment of 400 thousand rubles. In November, the Russian authorities changed the system of monetary remuneration for the military. So, two weeks ago after Putin’s decree, the government sharply reduced payments to the militaryfor injuries - up to 30 times. Then Putin (by his own decree) raised payments for injuries resulting in disability by a million rubles. After that State Duma obliged volunteers to pay for military equipment lost in battle. All this is happening against the backdrop of an unprecedented increase in the size of one-time payments for signing a contract in 2024. With the help of these payments, regions compete for the number of contract soldiers sent to war. The current record is held by the Belgorod region, where you can get 3 million rubles for signing a permanent contract with the Ministry of Defense.	https://t.me/astrapress/69201	2024-11-25T07:23:17-08:00

On an activist from Yoshkar-Ola an administrative case was opened for a video calling for preparations for bombingThe reason was a video of activist Alexei Naumov, where he shared his opinion on a document in which officials and civil servants are allegedly given instructions to evacuate due to bombings, without warning residents about this. The Lenta.ru publication wrote that this was a fake, but Naumov himself in the video did not talk about the authenticity of the document; he only urged his subscribers to contact the authorities on security issues and prepare things in case of an emergency. -In 2022, we have already begun to raise this issue. And what a surprise we were that 2 years later the situation had hardly changed. Do they want to shift the blame for inaction onto us?

Many were lured into the war by deceptionSince at least July 2024, Russia has been recruiting Yemenis to take part in the invasion of Ukraine, writes the British newspaper Financial Times with a link to an interview with mercenaries.&nbsp; Yemen is a poor Muslim country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula that has been torn by civil war for 10 years. Payments for Russian contracts are huge amounts of money by the standards of this country, but even despite this, some Yemenis are recruited into the war by deception. Two of the newspaper's interlocutors, Yemenis Abdullah and Nabil recruited by Russia, said that they were lured into the war by deception. Abdullah thought he was flying to Russia to work in the drone industry. Nabil believed that he would be offered a job in the fields of -security- and -engineering.- Abdullah told reporters that when his group from Yemen refused to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense, the military present at the scene fired a shot in the air so that the foreigners would still sign the contracts. According to the man, he was brought to the war by -scammers who traffic people.-Yemen is not the only country in the Global South whose residents are being deceived by Russia into sending them to fight in Ukraine. Thus, in the spring of this year, India reported, that there was a real -human trafficking network- in the countrythat sent Indians to Russia.

At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations,&nbsp; throw links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks.

Thus the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 151 case of falling FAB aerial bombsin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region.

There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.💫 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoostyCrypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69017	2024-11-22T01:35:59-08:00

The problem is illegal migrants,- he emphasized. Peskov’s statement looks unexpected against the backdrop of the policy towards migrants that the Russian authorities have been pursuing for at least the last year. So, in the summer and autumn of the State Duma adopted several packages of amendments aimed at combating illegal migration, including parliamentarians allowed police to deport foreigners without trial. At the same time, lists of prohibited professions for foreign workers. At the same time, migrants in Russia are required to register for military service - which the police remind them about during raids on markets and other places where migrants gather.	https://t.me/astrapress/69015	2024-11-22T00:50:08-08:00
