Before the verdict was announced, he noted that, despite his illness, he decided to attend the hearing because he was confident that he was right. He emphasized that his publication was aimed at drawing attention to the problem of missing soldiers and maintaining contact with their relatives.&nbsp;Earlier, in March 2024, Kustov had already faced pressure from the authorities.

Local authorities sent residents a tractor with a barrel for a -replacement.- However, according to residents, the water brought was cloudy, had a rusty tint and contained sediment - they could not use it for drinking, reports 74.ru.The head of the Sosnovsky district, Evgeny Vaganov, confirmed the existence of a problem with the quality of drinking water. However, according to him, the dirty water was replaced promptly, immediately after complaints.-They poured clean water, but when they transported it over bumps, it shook. As soon as we saw it, we immediately went to change it,- said Vaganov.According to residents, the accident could have occurred due to the constant movement of heavy trucks through the village, which led to subsidence of the asphalt and, possibly, damage to pipes. They repeatedly appealed to the administration with a request to install signs prohibiting the passage of multi-ton trucks, but, according to them, these requests were ignored.&nbsp;This is not the first time that residents of the Chelyabinsk region are faced with similar problems.

Russia may be preparing for a large-scale war with NATO—Danish intelligence The Danish Foreign and Military Intelligence Service published report, which assesses the Russian threat to the Kingdom of Denmark. The document says that Russia is arming itself and increasing its capabilities for a potential armed confrontation with Western countries - however, this does not mean that the decision to start such a war has been made. The authors of the report believe that Russia's readiness to take more risky actions regarding NATO may increase if Russia considers the alliance weakened and disunited, or is confident that the United States will not help Europe. If the war in Ukraine ends, the Russian Federation may free up military resources and, in about six months, enter into a local conflict with one of the NATO countries. In 2 years, Russia may pose a threat to one or more states in the Baltic Sea. About five years after the end of the war with Ukraine, Russia may be ready for a full-scale war in Europe, an intelligence report says.	https://t.me/astrapress/74320	2025-02-12T01:16:34-08:00

Despite the dissuadings of Olga Arnold's mother, the man wanted to atone for his guilt with blood and help his daughter, who is now one year and 8 months old. About this case wrote tg channel -Mobilization of the DPR Live-, the information was confirmed by ASTRA. Ilya ended up in military unit 41698, 5th brigade of the 3rd motorized rifle battalion, company -B-. On a combat mission in September, he was wounded in both legs: a through wound to the left leg, shrapnel, and fractures; right leg - patella, tendon, damaged main nerve, fragments, fracture. The man was sent to the 14th hospital in Donetsk, and then taken to a medical facility in Dokuchaevsk. There, Ilya was put in a basement, beaten and forced to transfer money to commanders. -On October 13, medic Maxim takes him to Dokuchaevsk. There they threatened to knock out his teeth with a hammer, they kept him in handcuffs, it was terrible. Unoperated, he was taken to the hospital because a complication had developed, but they only sutured his soft tissues - nothing more,- the soldier’s mother, Olga Arnold, told ASTRA.From the hospital, the man was again taken to the basement of the medical unit, where his condition worsened again and he was sent to the 15th hospital in Donetsk for rehabilitation. After this, Ilya is transferred to Kurakhovo, put in a pit, and then sent on a combat mission to the village. Gluboky (30 km from Donetsk). Arnold's mother says that the commander he came across saw Ilya's condition and canceled his participation in the assault. Medics arrived at the scene and took the wounded man to the village of Peski, where Ilya ended up in a basement in which there were 15 other wounded people. Arnold's mother claims that in this place the medic Maxim from the medical unit collects the wounded, including those who walk on crutches, and again sends them to the assaults. From this basement on February 8, the man managed to record video messages for his mother. -All the wounded here walk on crutches, here everyone is sent to the front line. Yesterday they brought the boys, they can’t walk - they’re on crutches, and they were simply sent to the front. This Maxim is a complete asshole. I shake every day so that they don’t send me there, I can’t run, I can’t walk well. If I were healthy, I would of course go, I’m not afraid of anything, I’ve been there twice, but at least I could get treatment,- says Ilya in his video from the basement. Ilya’s mother filed complaints with the Investigative Committee, the prosecutor’s office, the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation and other departments, but this did not produce any results. She herself went to the headquarters in Makeevka to write a complaint against the commander of the military unit, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Demkovsky. Unit inspector Anna (her full name is not disclosed) helped Olga, for which she was sent to the assault and was wounded. -They took me out in a serious condition with the replenishment of my lungs and I was declared in SOCH (unauthorized abandonment of the unit) as a criminal, although everyone saw the condition. And my commander is the same as Ilya’s, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Demkovsky. You send threats to him and not to me, I already helped you in any way I could, for which I paid,- wrote Anna to Ilya’s mother.After this, Olga received death threats and she had to urgently leave Makeyevka. Now she is threatened with the murder of her son if she does not stop talking about the situation, but the mother demands that her son be taken to Russia for surgery and sent to the N.N. Priorov hospital. At the same time, the woman is caring for Ilya’s daughter - the girl’s mother Daria Kolpak abandoned the child.🫨 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/74211	2025-02-10T13:32:22-08:00

ASTRA: During the day, the Ukrainian Armed Forces advanced 5 kilometers southeast of Sudzha during a new offensive in the Kursk region. This is reported by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and Russian Z-channels. Ukrainian counterattacks slowed Russian offensive, - Le FigaroBy according tothe French newspaper Le Figaro, in January the pace of the offensive of Russian troops in Ukraine slowed down. If in December Russian forces captured 416 km², and in November - 714 km², then in January this figure was only 331 km². Despite ongoing fighting in the Donbass, where Russia has captured the towns of Kurakhovo and, most recently, Toretsk, Ukrainian defenses are holding their ground.Ukrainian forces are launching counterattacks along the entire front, including the Kursk region, where a successful Ukrainian offensive last August led to the capture of more than 1,000 km² in ten days. Russia has since gradually reclaimed the territory, reducing the Ukrainian overhang in the area to 430 km².In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has resumed counter-offensives, advancing several kilometers south of the town of Suzhda, easing the threat to Ukrainian positions in the area. Although the Ukrainian offensives are not yet as large-scale, the capture of several small villages, such as Kolmakov and Cherkasskaya Konopelka, strengthens Ukraine's position and could play an important role in possible negotiations with Russia and the United States, as Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky hopes, the publication notes.	https://t.me/astrapress/74193	2025-02-10T01:29:57-08:00

How to prepare for the next one and protect yourself?Last year’s autumn conscription was the most dangerous in recent times: military commissars illegally drafted people with diagnoses into the army, raided them and sent them to serve -one day,- intimidated and used violence. It is expected that in the spring it will become even more difficult - electronic summonses, databases with data on conscripts will be used, and mobilization reservations will -burn out- (formally it is still in progress). But this is not a reason to give up. Experience shows that even in the most difficult situations you can protect your rights and remain free. The better prepared you are to communicate with the military registration and enlistment office, the higher the chances of safety.Appeal to Conscience, a human rights project that free of charge helps conscripts defend their rights through legal means, will help with this.

Ukrainian troops are conducting a second attack in the last month in order to expand the bridgehead and move the front away from Sudzha - Z-channelsThe Ukrainian army has launched a new offensive in the Kursk region. This is reported by pro-Russian channels supporting the war, such as -Archangel Spetsnaz-, -Operation Z-, -Sudzha Rodnaya- and -Military Informant-. According to Z-military officers, a Ukrainian column of armored vehicles is heading towards the Belovsky district, where fighting is taking place in the area of ​​the village of Ulanki, located south of the city of Sudzha. Judging by various media reports, from 350 to 500 Ukrainian troops and about 50 pieces of equipment are participating in the offensive. The fighting continues in the morning, starting at six o'clock, and the advancing forces are trying to take fire control over the 65-kilometer section of the road from Sumy to Sudzha, along which reinforcements are arriving. Telegram channel -Sudzha Rodnaya- reports heavy fighting in the region and does not rule out that this could be a diversionary maneuver before a larger counter-offensive. Despite the measures taken, the Ukrainian Armed Forces column apparently advanced approximately 4–6 kilometers in a straight line. The offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was also commented on by Apti Alaudinov, deputy head of the main military-political directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and commander of the Akhmat volunteer formation. -The enemy launched an offensive... The Akhmat special forces have never been stationed in this area,- he said.
