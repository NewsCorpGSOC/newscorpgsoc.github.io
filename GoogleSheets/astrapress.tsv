At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later, you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations, sending us links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register.All donations sent from November 12 will be used to collect salaries.

Journalists found a Russian filtration camp for captured Ukrainians in Belarus - investigation by the Belarusian Investigative CenterAt the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military created a filtration camp on the territory of Belarus. Journalists found out that it was located on the basis of one of the buildings that belonged to a Belarusian state-owned enterprise -Pripyat Alliance- in Narovlya (Gomel region). Some human rights activists call this camp one of the most cruel against prisoners. Not only Ukrainian military personnel were taken there, but also civilians, including minors. For example, a resident of the Kyiv region Larisa Yagodinskaya said that in March 2022, her two sons were taken there, one of whom had not yet reached the age of eighteen at that time: -They said that the sons were saboteurs, and they took them and took them to Chernobyl. There it turned out that they were beating them, and as [the younger son] Slava later told them, [that the eldest son] most likely even broke his ribs, they beat him hard with a bat.- UAF serviceman Bogdan Lysenko, who was captured by the Russian military at the end of March 2022, also spoke about the torture of civilians: -Narovlya - it was such a propaganda picture that we [Russian military] are, like, humane... But none of them shows how civilians were interrogated there. And they beat civilians there, God forbid... That is, screams were constantly heard there.- According to human rights activists, now some of the Ukrainians who passed through the filtration camp in Narovlya are still in captivity, in particular, on the territory of penal colonies in Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69426	2024-11-28T23:32:32-08:00

Because they don‚Äôt abandon their own people,- he added.Oleg Yagodin was found guilty in 2022 of -discrediting- the RF Armed Forces.

The politician also complained about the large number of signature collectors - according to him, it was technically difficult for them to print out all the payments for donations. -It is completely incomprehensible why in the 21st century one would submit a financial report and applications on paper, despite the fact that the Central Election Commission sees all transactions on the election account online,- he wrote. The politician explained that the court reduced the amount of the fine from 75 thousand because it took into account mitigating circumstances -the size of the pension, the presence of children, etc.- Nadezhdin added that two of the four donations for which the Central Bank issued him this fine were 30 and 70 (thirty and seventy) rubles. -We will appeal,- he wrote.	https://t.me/astrapress/69330	2024-11-27T11:33:03-08:00

In Makeevka, the Russian Aerospace Forces dropped a FAB-500 near a residential building3 more aerial bombs were found in the Belgorod region.How ASTRA found out that 3 FABs fell from Russian planes in the Belgorod region over the past few days. So, on November 23, an aerial bomb was found in a field near the village of Surkovo, Shebekinsky urban district. The next day, a FAB-500 was found in the Belgorod district, and on November 25, a FAB-250 fell several kilometers from the Gremyachiy village of the Shebekinsky urban district. There were no casualties or damage.In occupied Makeyevka, Donetsk region, on November 24, a FAB-500 fell right next to a residential building on Ordzhonikidze Street, ASTRA found out. Another FAB was found in the Shakhtarsky district. In both cases, no one was injured. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 156 cases of FAB aerial bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024.

There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.üí´ By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69241	2024-11-26T02:50:40-08:00

He has been living with the disease since school. As a young man himself toldjournalists about its performance ‚Äî -this is 50-70% of the level of an ordinary person, if you follow all the recommendations and daily routine.--This is not what ordinary people feel in the evenings. It‚Äôs as if your head is being grabbed by a hoop, and lead is poured into the center - and you fall asleep, because it‚Äôs impossible to fight this painful feeling,- Andrei said.Last spring, he received an email ordered an Indian medicine for hypersomnia and became involved in a criminal case for the purchase and smuggling of drugs (Articles 228 and 229.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). In November, as found out -7x7-, the prosecutor asked to sentence Andrei to 11 years in a maximum security colony. The medicine that Andrey ordered from India contains an analogue of modafinil - this is a pharmaceutical stimulant, which in the USA, Europe and even a number of CIS countries is prescribed to patients with narcolepsy, hypersomnia and other sleep disorders. In Russia, this substance has been available since 2012 banned as a drug.Morozov is by no means the first patient with a similar diagnosis to face criminal prosecution for ordering Indian drugs. So, only at the beginning of 2024, a physicist from St. Petersburg Andrei Volotka for ordering modafinil by mail received4 years of strict regime. After the start of criminal prosecution, Andrei Morozov founded the -Ratio- community of Russians with sleep disorders.

At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations,&nbsp; throw links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name. This will help minimize risks and feel calmer.All donations sent from November 12th will be used to collect salaries.

The Lenta.ru publication wrote that this was a fake, but Naumov himself in the video did not talk about the authenticity of the document; he only urged his subscribers to contact the authorities on security issues and prepare things in case of an emergency. -In 2022, we have already begun to raise this issue. And what a surprise we were that 2 years later the situation had hardly changed. Do they want to shift the blame for inaction onto us?

Many were lured into the war by deceptionSince at least July 2024, Russia has been recruiting Yemenis to take part in the invasion of Ukraine, writes the British newspaper Financial Times with a link to an interview with mercenaries.&nbsp; Yemen is a poor Muslim country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula that has been torn by civil war for 10 years. Payments for Russian contracts are huge amounts of money by the standards of this country, but even despite this, some Yemenis are recruited into the war by deception. Two of the newspaper's interlocutors, Yemenis Abdullah and Nabil recruited by Russia, said that they were lured into the war by deception. Abdullah thought he was flying to Russia to work in the drone industry. Nabil believed that he would be offered a job in the fields of -security- and -engineering.- Abdullah told reporters that when his group from Yemen refused to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense, the military present at the scene fired a shot in the air so that the foreigners would still sign the contracts. According to the man, he was brought to the war by -scammers who traffic people.-Yemen is not the only country in the Global South whose residents are being deceived by Russia into sending them to fight in Ukraine. Thus, in the spring of this year, India reported, that there was a real -human trafficking network- in the countrythat sent Indians to Russia.

Despite this, the command promised to send the military -behind the belt- - that is, to the combat zone, which November 13 led to a riot and the escape of some of the military. As a result, they were actually sent to Rostov and are planning to deliver to the war zone. -In short, the plane has already flown away, they are all already there. Now they will move to the front.
