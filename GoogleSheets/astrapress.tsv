The source of this information was the TG channel of an employee of the pro-Kremlin MIA -Russia Today-, member of the public chamber Armen Gasparyan, writes The Insider. In the publication, Gasparyan refers to a certain German publication Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland (-Current news in Germany-).The Internet Archive first discovered this media on December 14, 2024, before which there were no signs of its existence. -Apparently, this is another fake publication created by Russian propagandists to spread disinformation,- writes The Insider. Journalists also studied the -purchase and sale agreement- published by Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland. The document was signed by an official from another administrative district, and for some reason the name and position of the person who signed the document is hidden. In addition, the information that the residence will be closed to tourists also turned out to be false: the attraction was closed for the winter, opening is expected on May 9, 2025.Gazeta.ru later deleted the fake.	https://t.me/astrapress/74125	2025-02-09T06:26:29-08:00

When asked by a journalist how he sees the American occupation of Gaza, Trump replied: -I see the long-term position of the owner.

One of them fell near a private residential building on Sadovaya Street in the Trud village of Korochansky district. Since the bomb did not explode, no one was injured, the residents were evacuated on the day of the fall. Another FAB-250 crashed near the village of Malomikhailovka, Shebekinsky urban district.

On February 1, during a long visit with his parents, his body reacted strongly to regular food, which differed from the prison diet. According to activists, for three days after the meeting, Yegor could not get out of bed and was in such bad condition that he could barely stand on his feet. On February 3, the support group reported that Yegor was denied sick leave, despite his deteriorating health. He did not receive the necessary tests that should have been done in December, and problems with his spine reappeared. -Egor went to the doctor, but they refused to give him sick leave, they said that it was okay, that he wouldn’t die. They gave him some strange pills, and the antibiotic turned out to be not for him, but for another prisoner. For three days he ate practically nothing, drinking only tea. When I returned to the detachment, my condition did not improve. Since it was Saturday, and doctors don’t work on weekends, he was given activated charcoal and the drugs that I brought for the date. Yesterday, he said, it got even worse, he started vomiting, and his stomach hurt a lot. He went to see a doctor again, but there was no improvement, he was not given sick leave,- Tatyana, the political prisoner’s mother, told ASTRA. She added that she was worried, not understanding the exact reason for the deterioration of her son’s condition. -We brought medicine with us, but it is still unclear how to treat him. Maybe it was an intestinal infection or a virus, or maybe just indigestion from the fact that his body was not used to normal food after prison food. He never received the necessary tests, and I don’t know what to tell him for the next date,- she said, emphasizing that without tests it is impossible to determine the correct treatment. According to the latest reports from the support group, Yegor's condition is still improving. -Egor felt better. I started eating a little. The abdominal pain goes away, the vomiting has stopped,-— representatives of the group wrote in their Telegram channel.In November 2023, the court sentenced Balazeikin to six years in prison in the case of throwing a Molotov cocktail at the St. Petersburg military registration and enlistment office. Memorial recognized him as a political prisoner. During the trial, he admitted the fact of arson, but stated that he did not intend to intimidate people or cause damage. After reaching adulthood, Yegor was transferred to an adult colony, despite his health condition.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has prepared amendments that will simplify the conscription of soldiers with psychosis and syphilisThe Military Department has prepared changes to the -Regulations on military medical examination-, which, if adopted, will facilitate the conscription of soldiers suffering from certain diseases into the army. Judging by the documents, now, for example, conscripts with primary, secondary and latent syphilis are exempt from service under category -B- (limited fitness, not subject to conscription in peacetime). But if the amendments are adopted, guys with these diseases will receive category -B- (fit with minor restrictions). Also, conscripts with moderately severe, short-term endogenous psychoses and severe neurotic psychoses associated with stress and somatoform disorders and mood disorders will receive category -B- instead of -D- (not fit for military service). It is alleged that the amendments were developed -in order to improve the system of medical examination of military personnel, taking into account the experience of conducting a special military operation,- as well as the requirements for the health status of military personnel.	https://t.me/astrapress/73766	2025-02-03T10:58:43-08:00

Customers need to proactively formulate technical specifications, provide technical support for contracts and give unconditional priority in purchases to Russian machines. So far, unfortunately, there are many cases of purchasing imports when their analogues are available on the market. Anton Andreevich (Alikhanov, Minister of Industry and Trade - approx.), I believe that it is necessary to legally prohibit the purchase of foreign equipment in the presence of Russian equipment,- Manturov said, writes TASS.
