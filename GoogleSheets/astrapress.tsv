ASTRA: The suspect in the assassination attempt on Zakhar Prilepin confessed, claims channel 112, owned by the Kremlin Ren-TV. -The man said that he was recruited by one of the Ukrainian special services several years ago. He gave them the information they needed... The accused of the attempt on the life of Zakhar Prilepin is demanded to be sentenced to life imprisonmentAbout this writes -Mediazona- with reference to a correspondent from the hall of the 2nd Western District Military Court.The investigation claims that the accused Alexander Permyakov in 2022 received Ukraine instructions about exploding the car of the writer Zakhar Prilepin and part of the money - two thousand rubles, after which he entered Russia through Latvia and committed an assassination attempt.It is alleged that correspondence with the elder was found on Permyakov‚Äôs phone operative SBU Zhuravkin, with whom Permyakov discussed -the preparation of a terrorist attack, surveillance of Prilepin and his houses, the placement of mines.- From a page on VKontakte under the name Ivanka Polikarpova, Zhuravkin communicated with Prilepin‚Äôs son Ignat and thus found out where the writer would be on the day of the terrorist attack. In addition to a life sentence, the prosecutor's office asks that Permyakov spend the first 10 years of his sentence in prison, and also pay a fine of one and a half million rubles. The prosecutor called the social danger of the crime colossal and noted -strong antisocial attitudes and socially dangerous interests- of the accused. At the same time, Permyakov‚Äôs sister Irina told the investigator during interrogation that while still a schoolchild, her brother was sentenced to 7 years because -he and his friends beat someone.- Four years later, he was released on parole, and in 2015 went -to the DPR militia.- In the spring of 2022, Permyakov moved to the Khmelnitsky region of Ukraine -as a migrant.-Prilepin himself refused to participate in the debate and asked that Permyakov be punished -in accordance with the law.- Permyakov did not speak out in the debate. In May 2023, a bomb was blown up in the Nizhny Novgorod region car by Zakhar Prilepin. As a result, the writer was seriously injured, and his guard Alexander Shubin died on the spot. The Investigative Committee opened a case of terrorism. On the same day, not far from the scene of the assassination attempt, there was detainedAlexander Permyakov. They found on him passports of Russia and Ukraine and a fake passport of Kazakhstan, nearby - a combat pistol with a silencer, a band-aid, five SIM cards, two bank cards, cash rubles and hryvnias, a flashlight, a compass, a flint, and a sheet with ten telephone numbers and names. At the police station, Permyakov admitted to the attempt on Prilepin‚Äôs life, regretting that he did not die.	https://t.me/astrapress/65265	2024-09-27T04:11:29-07:00

Nowadays, it is not even necessary to serve a summons; it is enough to send it to the State Services - and the person is immediately deprived of the opportunity to leave the country. If I return to Russia, I will end up either in the army or in prison. Both options are tantamount to death.-Previously, Scandinavian countries have repeatedly refused political asylum to Russians. Thus, Russian Stanislav Brysin was refused asylum in Sweden, even despite his experience in holding protests and an open criminal case for -calls for terrorism.- At the beginning of the month, ASTRA wrote that in search of refuge, Brysin boarded a boat and sailed towards Ireland. Before this Sweden has deported a family from Belarus, against whom a criminal case has been opened in their homeland. The situation with shelters in the United States is no better. So, in material about American migration prisons ASTRA told the story of an opposition journalist from Russia with administrative punishment for -discrediting the army-, which US authorities deported to their homeland and handed over to the FSB.	https://t.me/astrapress/65199	2024-09-26T07:05:12-07:00

The Russian Aerospace Forces again dropped an aerial bomb on the Belgorod region According to ASTRA sources, on September 23 in the Grayvoronsky urban district, a few kilometers from the village of Dobroivanovka FAB-250 found. There were no casualties or damage, the ammunition has already been destroyed.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 127th air bomb dropped by the Russian Aerospace Forces on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to September of this year.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 127 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

Shortly before this, the Ukrainian Air Force warned about the launch of guided missiles in the Zaporozhye region. After the explosions, there was no light in the city for some time, the public writes. In the comments, Telegram users noted that the sound of the explosions was remarkably loud. No other details were officially announced. Russian aviation for the first time successfully used a modernized version of Soviet FAB aerial bombs in the city, Ukrainian monitoring channels claim. Russia began actively using updated FABs in 2024. The FAB is equipped with UMPC complexes - wings and satellite guidance, which make the bomb adjustable and increase its range. As ASTRA previously wrote, such aerial bombs fell in the Russian Federation and the occupied territoriesof Ukraine more than a hundred times. Usually, such bombs do not explode when falling on Russian territory, however, on May 4, a FAB-500 fell on a house in Begorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities chose to remain silent about the reason for the bomb's fall and its affiliation.	https://t.me/astrapress/64935	2024-09-22T13:56:14-07:00

The unit's political officer claims that the conscript is being interrogated because of -betrayal of the motherland.- She complained that her son was not allowed to call her Today in military unit 12721 in Klintsy, Bryansk region, conscripts - including those who returned from Ukrainian captivity - were allowed to see their relatives and pick up packages from them. Victoria Abramenko and her husband came to give things to their 21-year-old son Maxim - before his business trip to the Kursk region, he served in unit 12721. The parents spent the whole day at the fence of the military unit. -Here one [military from the unit] came out and said: ‚ÄòWho are you waiting for?‚Äô I said, Avramenko. ‚ÄòOh, one of these? Well, those who were in captivity‚Äô. Yes, I say, you don‚Äôt even consider them to be people? Of these?!-Lyudmila is indignant. Towards evening, political officer V.A. Kuznetsov came out to the woman. -He said: ‚ÄòYour son is being interrogated by the military police for treason. He told you that he [the conscripts who returned from captivity] are treated poorly here, and you called Astra.-&nbsp;At the end of August, Victoria told ASTRA that her son was four days from the moment of returning to their homeland as part of the prisoner exchange, they did not allow contact with the family. -He hasn‚Äôt been in touch since about a week. After the publication, they immediately brought him a phone and said ‚Äòhere, call me, because the prosecutor‚Äôs office already called us‚Äô. And, in my opinion, the FSB called my husband and told him to refute the publication, saying that his son had already contacted you,- says the woman.At that time, her son was in military unit in Moscow. There, Victoria says, the conscripts who returned from captivity were treated normally and were well fed. Some in Klintsy, according to her, conscripts compare -to prison- and complain about the bad (-like cattle-) attitude of their colleagues - precisely because the young people returned from captivity on an exchange.-I say to this political officer [Kuznetsov], explain to me how this is even possible? Do you mean they are interrogating you about treason? &lt;...&gt; It was your part that even hung up on me, it was your part that said that you had no information. That my son was missing from you, even when he was officially found in captivity,- complains Victoria.&nbsp;Maxima, she says, she was allowed to see -exactly for a minute- so that pick up the bags. He managed to tell her -I don‚Äôt know what will happen to me next.- What‚Äôs happening to her son now is unknown. According to the latest information, Maxim is still being interrogated at headquarters. Another possible reason for the pressure, Victoria believes, is her husband‚Äôs correspondence in the telegram chat -We are together. Alushta-, which is possibly associated with the -Committee of Soldiers' Mothers-. There, the man suggested that relatives of conscripts who returned from captivity, who complain about the lack of information, contact the ASTRA editorial office. After that, her husband received a call from the administrator of the chat - from which he was then deleted. Victoria suggests that the chat administrator could have reported this to the military unit.&nbsp;-I don‚Äôt know what they want. Maybe some stars earn themselves this &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; Why don‚Äôt you interrogate those who abandoned the boys [conscripts], simply abandoned them for slaughter and ticked away [after the Ukrainian Armed Forces‚Äô breakthrough in the Kursk region]?

As a result of the large-scale sabotage, at least 32 people were killed, including two children, and thousands more were injured. Previously American media, citing Israeli sources, wrote that to blow up Hezbollah pagers, Israeli intelligence created a fake company, which received an order from a Shiite organization and -mined- the pagers for several years. Israeli intelligence knew that Hezbollah was afraid of surveillance through smartphones, so the head of the organization demanded that all its members use pagers and walkie-talkies.Against the backdrop of another escalation in Israel, the country's authorities closed the office of the Qatari media holding early this morning Al Jazeera in Palestine.

They cannot deport him to Ukraine because of the war and refuse to send him to Georgia to live with his relatives. In Russia, a man has a small child Alexander Ross is a native of Ukraine who has been living in Russia for the last 7 years. There, according to his common-law wife Lyudmila Burlakova, he was engaged in activism and social entrepreneurship, including helping the Russian military with his own money. -Sasha positions himself as Russian. I moved to Russia from Ukraine because persecution for pro-Russian views had already begun there,- Lyudmila Burlakova told ASTRA. The marriage of Lyudmila and Alexander is not officially registered, but they have a child together - two-year-old Fedor, born in the spring of 2022. Alexander Ross is listed as the father on the boy‚Äôs birth certificate (this and other documents mentioned in the news are at the disposal of the editors). They moved to the Volgograd region from Yekaterinburg during Lyudmila‚Äôs maternity leave: -My parents live here. Warm, sunny and lots of fruits and vegetables. The best choice for a child,- she explains. Ross has been in custody since the end of June. He wanted to draw attention to the state of pedestrian streets in the city of Kamyshin, by organizing a wheelchair race. The race was not allowed to take place - Ross was arrested for 9 days for organizing a public event without filing a notification (clause 2 of Article 20.2 of the Administrative Code).As ASTRA Lyudmila reported, Alexander Ross has been in custody since then. On July 6, police discovered that Ross had violated immigration laws. A year earlier, he and his wife flew to Egypt, and upon their return, Ross did not appear at the Ministry of Internal Affairs to provide his fingerprints and register. The couple did not know that upon leaving Russia, the man‚Äôs temporary registration was canceled. On September 20, the period of stay in the temporary detention center for migrants in Volgograd was once again extended by 90 days. They cannot deport him to Ukraine because of the war. The man also has relatives in Georgia, but the court refused to expel him to this country. -The conditions of detention are terrible, he sits in a solitary cell, without cellular communication. Sasha‚Äôs gums are swollen, he should go to the hospital, they don‚Äôt provide medical services, just pull out a tooth. Why pull out a healthy tooth if your gums swell due to a cold?-said Lyudmila in a conversation with ASTRA. In July, Lyudmila was fined for providing her common-law husband - and the father of her child - Alexander Ross with temporary registration for 2,000 rubles. -Where is the common sense of what is happening?-, asks the woman. According to her, Alexander has very low hemoglobin, she adds, after almost three months in prison he has become very weak and is already thinking about the subsequent rehabilitation of his common-law husband.-In fact, he is being held for nothing . Well, just think that he didn‚Äôt roll his fingers and take a photo. According to this article [part 1 of article 18.11. Code of Administrative Offenses] there is another punishment - a fine. No, in order to replenish the treasury with this fine, we take and imprison a person. And not only is the damage caused to everyone, including the individual, but it is also at the expense of the state. How much does each day cost at the migration center?-says Lyudmila.	https://t.me/astrapress/64909	2024-09-22T05:40:52-07:00

Serial killer and organizer of an ultra-right group Artur Ryno kidnapped his daughter from kindergartenIn the 2000s, he killed 20 people of Caucasian and Asian appearance - and served only ten years for this, since he was a minor at the time of the trial The Ryno-Skachevsky gang operated in Moscow in 2006 - 2007 The neo-Nazis have 24 proven murders, although Artur Ryno himself claimed that he killed 37 people. Ryno committed the murders on the basis of racial hatred; his victims were people of Caucasian and Asian appearance. In 2017, Ryno was released. After this, the former student icon painter opened a right-wing tattoo parlor in the center of Moscow. He got tattoos, including runes and other symbols favored by nationalists, but his personality and past remained a secret for a long time. 27-year-old piercer Valentina Atman met Ryno in 2020 when she got a job at his tattoo parlor. She did not immediately find out about her future husband‚Äôs past, but eventually accepted him. The couple got married, but the young people broke up two years later. Valentina told reporters that their marriage collapsed because Ryno raised his hand against her. The daughter remained to live with her mother. -We were walking late at night, and he suddenly asked if I was afraid of him. I didn‚Äôt understand the question, the next time he asked how intestines fall out of a person. He depicted this sound to me. Mutual acquaintances in personal conversations said that Arthur‚Äôs gang comrades loved to pick out people‚Äôs eyes and let out their guts,- - told by Valentina Atman. Valentina recently came to pick up her four-year-old daughter from kindergarten, but, as the teacher was told, the girl had already been taken away by her father. Ryno's ex-wife was able to find her daughter only after 4 days - she was in Pavlovsky Posad with her mother-in-law, writes the Shot tg channel. Lyudmila took her daughter with the help of the police. According to Valentina, her ex-husband and mother-in-law asked their daughter a question: -Anya, tell me, do you want to live with your mother?-. Valentina states that -Arthur Ryno‚Äôs mother still considers him a hero.- Lyudmila told the media that she had to move because Arthur Ryno was watching her at the entrance. She and her daughter have not left the house for two weeks out of fear of running into Ryno. The ex-spouses have been suing over custody of their daughter for a year and a half, but the court has not yet made a decision as to who the girl will stay with.	https://t.me/astrapress/64877	2024-09-21T13:17:08-07:00

In Ukraine, since the beginning of the year, 266 military and volunteer vehicles have been burnedAs a representative of the Prosecutor General‚Äôs office, Nadezhda Maksimets, said, Russian special services are behind the arson. According to her, 169 people have been charged with arson, most of them under 35 years old. They set fire to military vehicles for -easy money.- According to Maksimets, on average they promise from 700 to 3 thousand dollars for arson. According to the prosecutor's office, this money is not paid later.An earlier edition of -Important Stories- discovered that unknown persons are looking for perpetrators of arson attacks on Ukrainian military vehicles, including through the Russian-language drug forum RuTor. For similar acts of sabotage in Europe, Russian special services are looking for perpetrators, including through telegram chats for drug sales.Russian state media associate the arson of Ukrainian military vehicles with -ongoing forced mobilization.- In advertisements for the search for arson perpetrators, which ASTRA reviewed, the motive of supposedly fighting mobilization also often appears. At the same time, during the year in Ukraine, cars were set on fire not only by military registration and enlistment offices, but also directly by the military, and, as Maksimets reported today, by volunteers.

Over the past few weeks, operators have noticed a -strong and uneven- slowdown in the work of YouTube, Google and its services, -which has provoked a multiple increase in the number of user complaints to providers.- It is the uneven decline in quality, according to Rosteleset, that -violates the rules of the -free market-.

Since the legislation does not provide for such a measure of influence on Internet resources as -slowing down- in the current regulations, the resource itself, like the youtube domain name. com, at the beginning of August is not included in the list of prohibited or restricted access, authorized bodies and courts did not make a decision to restrict access to the platform, GRCHTS and Roskomnadzor do not have the right, on their own initiative, to take actions to restrict access to information-,&nbsp;- Rosteleset insists.	https://t.me/astrapress/64720	2024-09-20T02:01:16-07:00
