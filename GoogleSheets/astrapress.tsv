The Russian soldier who killed the widow of a WWII veteran stabbed himself in the stomach because he no longer wanted to fightA former prisoner pardoned by Putin tried to commit suicide in military unit 91704 in the city of Klintsy, Bryansk areas. We are talking about 33-year-old Denis Akkalaev. ASTRA learned that on January 6, he got drunk and stabbed himself in the stomach because he no longer wanted to serve. Now he is in the hospital.Akkalaev left the colony to fight. In 2015, he was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the murder of an elderly neighbor. This happened on May 7, 2015 in his home village in the Oryol region. Akkalaev came to the 86-year-old widow of a WWII veteran and asked to borrow money. She refused. Then he beat her half to death with a stool, took 1,300 rubles and her phone, set fire to the bed she was lying on, and ran away. When the neighbors put out the fire, the woman was already dead. Before this, Akkalaev was convicted seven times.

That day I photographed blind activist Oksana Osadchaya, who went out on a solo picket. The court sentenced me to 20 days. On New Year‚Äôs Day in the special detention center, I was glad that kind people brought me and others parcels. We had enough food and cigarettes. By midnight, one of the prisoners brewed chifir [overbrewed black tea]. Exactly at midnight we read toasts, drank chifir and sat down to celebrate, chat about everything and devour the food reserves that we usually tried to save. They sang songs: some political, some ordinary, some as best they could - tipsy from the chifir,- he says.ASTRA publishes stories of political prisoners who have to celebrate holidays in captivity, as well as their loved ones.

Those who do not show up can be checked by the Ministry of Internal AffairsOn January 3, in the village of Vasilyevo in Tatarstan, retired police captain 49-year-old Ildar Sharipov, who died in the war, was buried.Sharipov previously worked in the Kazan Line Directorate Ministry of Internal Affairs in transport, and after retirement he decided to go to fight with Ukraine. He signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry, volunteered as part of the Alga battalion and died. His former colleague, retired police lieutenant colonel Alexey Arzyutov, came to the funeral. Seeing that at the farewell there was not a single representative of the department where both had previously served, he decided to write a denunciation to the management. As ASTRA found out, he complained that neither the employees nor the management came to say goodbye to the deceased Sharipov, and did not express condolences to the family.As a result, Arzyutov asked to -evaluate- the actions of the leadership of the Kazan Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in transport. üïØ By supporting ASTRA, you are making a contribution to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypt BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/71978	2025-01-08T10:24:45-08:00

The GRU financed the Taliban to carry out terrorist attacks against the United States in Afghanistan - The InsiderRussian intelligence maintained ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan and provided financial support for terrorist attacks against American troops in the 2010s. Journalists from The Insider and Spiegel came to this conclusion, having a joint investigation.According to journalists, from 2016 to 2020 the Taliban carried out a series of attacks on US military bases and carried out terrorist attacks near these facilities. The casualties included not only American troops, but also Afghan soldiers and civilians. As journalists point out, these attacks were supported by the GRU. For the murder of one American serviceman, the perpetrators received up to 200 thousand dollars. In total, Russia could have transferred about $30 million to the Taliban, according to former Afghan intelligence officials.The money arrived through couriers with Russian passports issued with the help of the GRU. The operation was organized by unit 29115 of the GRU, known for the case of the poisoning of the Skripals in the UK, the explosion at a warehouse in Vrbetice, Czech Republic, and other international sabotage. The intended purpose of these attacks was to put pressure on the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan.The investigation relies on testimony from former Afghan intelligence officials and information they found about GRU connections with the smugglers, the Azizi brothers, who sources say , participated in schemes for paying money to the Taliban. The investigation also names the alleged GRU curators of these operations.	https://t.me/astrapress/71970	2025-01-08T08:52:26-08:00

A Wagnerite was detained in Krasnoyarsk, suspected of murdering an acquaintance who tried to save teenagers from violence - -TVK-About the detention of a 26-year-old man reported by the Main Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee for the Krasnoyarsk Territory and Khakassia. According to the investigation, on the night of January 1, the 25-year-old victim drank alcohol in the company of four friends in an apartment on Chernyshevsky Street in Krasnoyarsk.-A conflict arose between the victim and one of his friends due to mutual insults.

Anton stood up for them, after which a fight began. Vitaly grabbed the knife and struck three times - in the heart, groin and hand.

Blessed are those who were persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,- these words of Christ are quoted by the Evangelist Matthew, describing the famous -Sermon on the Mount.- Despite such unequivocal attitudes towards issues of war and peace in Scripture, officials of the Russian Orthodox Church willingly find ways to support Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Thousands of Chita residents were left without heat in the winter due to an accident at a boiler house owned by the former United Russia mayor. The enterprise can also threaten the ecology of the cityResidents of houses connected to the boiler room of the Machine Plant reportthat the radiators in their apartments are cold and there is no hot water at all No. The administration explained the situation by reconnecting from the leaking fifth boiler to a working fourth one. And the Teploenergoservis company promised to restore the boiler room after lunch.-Coal is available. Work is underway. Control of heat supply parameters in the boiler room. Management companies monitor the state of in-house parameters,- ‚Äî wrote in her tg channel, the head of the Chita mayor's office, Inna Shcheglova.This is not the first accident on facilities of Teploenergoservis. Due to regular accidents at the Mashzavod boiler house in the fall, Chita is not received a certificate of readiness for winter. Boiler room owner - former United Russia mayor Chita Vladimir Zabelin - a year ago promised residents to carry out repairs, but in March last year he suggested to the administration buy the boiler house from him for 107 million rubles, since -it will be easier for the company to get rid of the boiler houses than to maintain them.- The administration responded that it was too expensive. At the same time, the first deputy prime minister of the Trans-Baikal Territory government, Andrei Kefer, back in 2023 notedthat the boiler house in the city center is dangerous for residents and produces more than 200 tons of harmful emissions.In Chita it is now -18¬∞C, by the evening the temperature is expected to drop to -20¬∞C.Astra previously told how in December, residents were left without heat Cheboksary and Taganrog.	https://t.me/astrapress/71847	2025-01-07T02:50:06-08:00

At Christmas, the patriarch proclaimed an -alternative path of civilizational development- in RussiaThe head of the Russian Orthodox Church began his Christmas sermon by addressing the -lords,- after which he moved on to contrasting Jesus Christ and the gods of Olympus. The patriarch also criticized the atheistic worldview. In his opinion, faith in God requires much more strength.Cyril devoted approximately half of his sermon to exposing the -sins- of the West. At the same time, he did not directly mention the war in Ukraine. From the speech, however, it follows that in this way Russia -challenged many great and powerful-:-As I say, we are hated because we offer a different path, an alternative path of civilizational development. There is scientific and technological progress and the complete collapse of everything that has to do with human morality. ... Our country, which has gone through enormous sorrows, has shaped a strong human character. By the grace of God, today there is a revival of faith in the Lord and Savior[...] Today we especially ask the Lord to bless our fatherland, our Orthodox President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the authorities, the army and all our people.- It was the inability of the West to accept the special role of Russia that the Patriarch explained the international confrontation.-When [...] churches Christian ones, at best, are repurposed as mosques, where they at least pray to God, and often entertainment establishments*, as I said, into restaurants and so on. Here we are today showing an alternative to civilizational development, when it is possible to combine science, technology, education, the highest culture with faith in our Lord and Savior. That's why they beat us. Well, physically it‚Äôs not very successful. -The creation of certain blocs aimed at weakening Russia is slander of various kinds,- said the head of the Russian Orthodox Church.During the Christmas service, Patriarch Kirill also met with Putin. He asked to engrave his initials on chains to the crosses of SVO soldiers, which were consecrated by Patriarch Kirill.*Apparently, Patriarch I meant the UOC temple in Vinnitsa. Last November, the Spas TV channel spread a fake story that it had allegedly been converted into a nightclub.
