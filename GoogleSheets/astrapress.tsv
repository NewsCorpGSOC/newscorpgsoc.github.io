How to prepare for the next one and protect yourself?Last year‚Äôs autumn conscription was the most dangerous in recent times: military commissars illegally drafted people with diagnoses into the army, raided them and sent them to serve -one day,- intimidated and used violence. It is expected that in the spring it will become even more difficult - electronic summonses, databases with data on conscripts will be used, and mobilization reservations will -burn out- (formally it is still in progress).

US President Donald Trump, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the United States plans to -occupy the Gaza Strip.- There, US forces will clear unexploded bombs and shells, demolish destroyed buildings and create economic development. Before this, Trump said that the entire Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip should be resettled to other places‚ÄîJordan, Egypt and other countries, adding that there could be 5 or 6 such places. -There is death everywhere, it is impossible to live there,- he added. When asked by a journalist how he sees the American occupation of Gaza, Trump replied: -I see the long-term position of the owner. I see that this will bring stability to this part of the Middle East or to the entire Middle East.-When asked who exactly, according to Trump, would have to live in Gaza after the -clearance,- he did not answer. The Israeli prime minister said at the meeting that Trump had become Israel's -greatest friend- of all those who were in the White House. Netanyahu also stressed that Israel's main objectives are the release of all hostages and the complete destruction of Hamas. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu-Zuhri has already responded that -President Trump‚Äôs ideas about relocating Palestinians from Gaza will lead to chaos in the Middle East.- According to him, -the people in Gaza will not allow these plans to come true.

Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year, about 16 FABs and one missile as well as one UMPB-250 for 2025.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.At the beginning of July 2023, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, no casualties were avoided. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian. November 19 last year a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region.ü´® Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue ASTRA‚Äôs work : Patreon Boosty CryptoBuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/73792	2025-02-04T04:26:18-08:00

On February 1, during a long visit with his parents, his body reacted strongly to regular food, which differed from the prison diet. According to activists, for three days after the meeting, Yegor could not get out of bed and was in such bad condition that he could barely stand on his feet. On February 3, the support group reported that Yegor was denied sick leave, despite his deteriorating health. He did not receive the necessary tests that should have been done in December, and problems with his spine reappeared. -Egor went to the doctor, but they refused to give him sick leave, they said that it was okay, that he wouldn‚Äôt die. They gave him some strange pills, and the antibiotic turned out to be not for him, but for another prisoner. For three days he ate practically nothing, drinking only tea. When I returned to the detachment, my condition did not improve. Since it was Saturday, and doctors don‚Äôt work on weekends, he was given activated charcoal and the drugs that I brought for the date. Yesterday, he said, it got even worse, he started vomiting, and his stomach hurt a lot. He went to see a doctor again, but there was no improvement, he was not given sick leave,- Tatyana, the political prisoner‚Äôs mother, told ASTRA. She added that she was worried, not understanding the exact reason for the deterioration of her son‚Äôs condition. -We brought medicine with us, but it is still unclear how to treat him. Maybe it was an intestinal infection or a virus, or maybe just indigestion from the fact that his body was not used to normal food after prison food. He never received the necessary tests, and I don‚Äôt know what to tell him for the next date,- she said, emphasizing that without tests it is impossible to determine the correct treatment. According to the latest reports from the support group, Yegor's condition is still improving. -Egor felt better. I started eating a little. The abdominal pain goes away, the vomiting has stopped,-‚Äî representatives of the group wrote in their Telegram channel.In November 2023, the court sentenced Balazeikin to six years in prison in the case of throwing a Molotov cocktail at the St. Petersburg military registration and enlistment office. Memorial recognized him as a political prisoner. During the trial, he admitted the fact of arson, but stated that he did not intend to intimidate people or cause damage. After reaching adulthood, Yegor was transferred to an adult colony, despite his health condition. In May 2024, he was included in the list of terrorists and extremists, and the Memorial Project recognized him as a political prisoner.

Vologda publication 35Media of oligarch Alexei Mordashov deleted news about residents of the region killed in the warThis was brought to attention by attention activist Evgeny Domozhirov, collecting a list of dead fellow countrymen. -Many of them were in our sources and were mentioned both a long time ago and more recently, such as Uchenov, whose screenshot was preserved on the site. It seems that the concealment of losses is moving to a new level and not only concealment has begun, but also the deletion of old information,- he wrote. Domozhirov writes that military Vladimir Sidorov, who died in August and was found in September, is still not on the official lists. There is also no mention of him online, which may mean that he was buried secretly, without public notification, the activist adds. There are most likely many more such cases, the activist claims.Billionaire Alexey Mordashov, through Severgroup, owns 35Media and the Severstal steel corporation. He is under sanctions from the EU, USA, Japan, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, UK, New Zealand and Ukraine for supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Previously, the Sakhalin authorities stopped publishing obituaries about residents of the region killed in the war.

They are trying to find me further and finish what they started,- says the man.Barlet notes that, most likely, one of the employees of the Kalinin hospital was in cahoots with the commandant‚Äôs office, since the military quickly found out about he went missing and put his parents under surveillance - his relatives managed to photograph the car that was parked next to the victim‚Äôs family‚Äôs house. Davydov claims that this is the commandant‚Äôs car.

The lawyer under the legend infiltrated the human rights community and obtained information about persecuted Russiansconfirm -Important Stories-33-year-old lawyer and human rights activist Maria Chashilova, who previously collaborated with OVD-Info, the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives (MCC) and other human rights projects, infiltrated on Wednesday human rights activists, using a fake diploma, edited entries in the work book and a fictitious biography, according to which she allegedly was a police officer and works as a lawyer, the publication writes. -For more than six years, Chashchilova worked in Russian human rights organizations, where she gained access to information that poses a threat to people persecuted by the Russian authorities: those who work anonymously in -undesirable- organizations, lawyers defending Russian political prisoners and Ukrainian prisoners of war, LGBT activists declared extremists in Russia,- writes -Important Stories- journalist Irina Dolinina.As journalists found out, Chashilova used a fake RANEPA diploma, which is not listed in the official register of Rosobrnadzor, and edited entries in the work book. Information about the girl‚Äôs lawyer status was also not found in the state register of lawyers of the Russian Federation. In addition, she previously indicated in her resume that she served with the rank of police lieutenant in the Ministry of Internal Affairs from 2012 to 2015. In an interview with Important Stories, she began to deny this fact. Chaschilova organized a human rights conference in Berlin in April 2023, after which two participants complained of symptoms of poisoning. At the same time, Chashchilova herself did not come to the conference, citing the fact that she was going on a business trip to Ukraine. In fact, she never left, stating that she -really wanted to enter [Ukraine], but didn‚Äôt- due to visa problems. She was also interested in the sources of publications of -Important Publications-, the structure of the editorial office and the publication‚Äôs employees in the Russian Federation, and also asked for the address of journalist Irina Dolinina in the Czech Republic in order to supposedly send a gift. The gift did not arrive, but threats to the editorial office began to be sent to the specified address. In addition, the publication notes that Chashchilova‚Äôs uncle is Interior Ministry Colonel Vladimir Pershin, a key witness in the case of Khabarovsk Governor Sergei Furgal, and Chashchilova‚Äôs cousin is a former FSB employee.Maria was fired from - OVD-Info- in December 2024. She herself called the reason for her dismissal -rumors- spread by -Important Stories- and rejected the accusations. -We didn‚Äôt fire her because of your investigation, but its preparation, which we knew about, became a reason to take a closer look at her. We discovered several situations of deception and failure to provide important information about oneself. And we realized that we cannot vouch for what Masha tells us or our partners about herself, and it‚Äôs impossible to work like that,- said OVD-Info director Alexander Polivanov to Important Stories. Now she works in the Conscientious Objector Movement (DSO). They stated that they -conducted a security check, which did not reveal any grounds for mistrust- in Chashilova. There is also no evidence that Chashilova worked for Russian security forces or provided them with any information.	https://t.me/astrapress/73589	2025-01-31T11:44:26-08:00
