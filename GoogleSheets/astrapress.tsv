A Russian plane dropped an aerial bomb near a residential building in a village in the Belgorod region. Injuries were avoided because it did not explodeOn January 29, the Russian Armed Forces again dropped two FAB-250s on the Belgorod region, ASTRA found out. One of them fell near a private residential building on Sadovaya Street in the Trud village of Korochansky district. Since the bomb did not explode, no one was injured, the residents were evacuated on the day of the fall. Another FAB-250 crashed near the village of Malomikhailovka, Shebekinsky urban district.

On February 1, during a long visit with his parents, his body reacted strongly to regular food, which differed from the prison diet. According to activists, for three days after the meeting, Yegor could not get out of bed and was in such bad condition that he could barely stand on his feet. On February 3, the support group reported that Yegor was denied sick leave, despite his deteriorating health. He did not receive the necessary tests that should have been done in December, and problems with his spine reappeared. -Egor went to the doctor, but they refused to give him sick leave, they said that it was okay, that he wouldn’t die. They gave him some strange pills, and the antibiotic turned out to be not for him, but for another prisoner. For three days he ate practically nothing, drinking only tea. When I returned to the detachment, my condition did not improve. Since it was Saturday, and doctors don’t work on weekends, he was given activated charcoal and the drugs that I brought for the date. Yesterday, he said, it got even worse, he started vomiting, and his stomach hurt a lot. He went to see a doctor again, but there was no improvement, he was not given sick leave,- Tatyana, the political prisoner’s mother, told ASTRA. She added that she was worried, not understanding the exact reason for the deterioration of her son’s condition. -We brought medicine with us, but it is still unclear how to treat him. Maybe it was an intestinal infection or a virus, or maybe just indigestion from the fact that his body was not used to normal food after prison food. He never received the necessary tests, and I don’t know what to tell him for the next date,- she said, emphasizing that without tests it is impossible to determine the correct treatment. According to the latest reports from the support group, Yegor's condition is still improving. -Egor felt better. I started eating a little. The abdominal pain goes away, the vomiting has stopped,-— representatives of the group wrote in their Telegram channel.In November 2023, the court sentenced Balazeikin to six years in prison in the case of throwing a Molotov cocktail at the St. Petersburg military registration and enlistment office. Memorial recognized him as a political prisoner. During the trial, he admitted the fact of arson, but stated that he did not intend to intimidate people or cause damage. After reaching adulthood, Yegor was transferred to an adult colony, despite his health condition.

However, the wounded man’s wife refused, and then the hospital management received an order to discharge the man on Monday, says Davydov.

They are trying to find me further and finish what they started,- says the man.Barlet notes that, most likely, one of the employees of the Kalinin hospital was in cahoots with the commandant’s office, since the military quickly found out about he went missing and put his parents under surveillance - his relatives managed to photograph the car that was parked next to the victim’s family’s house. Davydov claims that this is the commandant’s car.

Opposition blogger Mikhail Alferov from the Kemerovo region died in the war with UkraineAbout this reportedby his friend, journalist Natalya Zubkova. According to her, he stopped communicating on December 1, and died, presumably, on December 25. -Before he died, he wrote a strange message to his mother on November 26th. It was like saying goodbye. He said that for now he could not write or call her anymore.

At first he was at the headquarters of military unit No. 89547 in the -DPR-, and in the summer he returned to the Kemerovo region with instructions from the command to obtain computer equipment. After returning to his unit, his situation worsened, and at the end of November he began to fear for his life. In early December he disappeared, and on January 29 his closed coffin was brought home. The circumstances of his death remain unknown.Mikhail was a political activist and the author of the YouTube channel -Alferov life-. Videos often focused on freedom of assembly in the region, corruption of local and federal officials, and the work of security forces. He was repeatedly persecuted in administrative and criminal cases. Criminal cases were brought against him under articles of inciting hatred or enmity (Part 1 of Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), slander (Part 1 of Article 298.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) and the use of violence against a representative of the authorities (Part 1 of Article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ).Mikhail still has a disabled mother in Kemerovo.	https://t.me/astrapress/73624	2025-02-01T03:35:19-08:00

Information about the girl’s lawyer status was also not found in the state register of lawyers of the Russian Federation. In addition, she previously indicated in her resume that she served with the rank of police lieutenant in the Ministry of Internal Affairs from 2012 to 2015. In an interview with Important Stories, she began to deny this fact. Chaschilova organized a human rights conference in Berlin in April 2023, after which two participants complained of symptoms of poisoning. At the same time, Chashchilova herself did not come to the conference, citing the fact that she was going on a business trip to Ukraine. In fact, she never left, stating that she -really wanted to enter [Ukraine], but didn’t- due to visa problems. She was also interested in the sources of publications of -Important Publications-, the structure of the editorial office and the publication’s employees in the Russian Federation, and also asked for the address of journalist Irina Dolinina in the Czech Republic in order to supposedly send a gift. The gift did not arrive, but threats to the editorial office began to be sent to the specified address. In addition, the publication notes that Chashchilova’s uncle is Interior Ministry Colonel Vladimir Pershin, a key witness in the case of Khabarovsk Governor Sergei Furgal, and Chashchilova’s cousin is a former FSB employee.Maria was fired from - OVD-Info- in December 2024. She herself called the reason for her dismissal -rumors- spread by -Important Stories- and rejected the accusations. -We didn’t fire her because of your investigation, but its preparation, which we knew about, became a reason to take a closer look at her. We discovered several situations of deception and failure to provide important information about oneself. And we realized that we cannot vouch for what Masha tells us or our partners about herself, and it’s impossible to work like that,- said OVD-Info director Alexander Polivanov to Important Stories. Now she works in the Conscientious Objector Movement (DSO). They stated that they -conducted a security check, which did not reveal any grounds for mistrust- in Chashilova.

Russian billionaire Suleiman Kerimov owned a stake in SpaceX even after US sanctions - BloombergMember of the Federation Council from Dagestan, billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, through a trust, owned at least 1% of the shares of SpaceX Elon Musk, despite the sanctions imposed against him by the United States of America. About this reportsthe American edition of Bloomberg with reference to its sources.According to the agency, Kerimov acquired a stake in SpaceX back in 2017, and the asset was managed by Heritage Trust, registered in the US state of Delaware. In 2018, the United States imposed sanctions against the Dagestani billionaire, accusing him of close ties with the Russian authorities and personally with Vladimir Putin.

Forbes in 2024 estimated his capital at $9.3 billion.Sanctions against Kerimov were imposed not only by the United States, but also European Union. In 2022, after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, American authorities expanded restrictions against the billionaire. In addition to blocking his assets, Kerimov was also banned from entering the United States, and financial institutions were instructed not to conduct any transactions with him.Suleiman Kerimov is one of the most influential Russian entrepreneurs.

The claim is directed to 32 airport structures... The court arrested the assets of the Domodedovo group of companies at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office. The supervisory agency demands that control over the airport be returned to the state, since it was under -foreign influence.-The decision on this was made by the Moscow Region Arbitration Court. The court also ordered the owners of the holding, Dmitry Kamenshchik and Valery Kogan, to ensure the safety of all movable and immovable property of the companies in the Domodedovo perimeter and at the same time prohibited them from giving instructions on its alienation or leaving it outside Russian jurisdiction, as well as on stopping the activities of the companies.As they write. -Vedomosti-, the Prosecutor General's Office believes that the group of companies at Domodedovo Airport was under the control of -residents of foreign states- - Dmitry Kamenshchik (Turkey, UAE) and Valery Kogan (Israel).The lawsuit states that Kamenshchik and Kogan should have gained control over the Russian strategic asset only if there was a decision from a government commission (they allegedly did not apply for it). The possibility of nationalizing the airport was already discussed after the terrorist attack at Domodedovo in 2011. In 2015, a criminal case was opened against Kamenshchik under the article on the provision of services that did not meet safety requirements, resulting in the death of two or more people. The case was later dropped.	https://t.me/astrapress/73532	2025-01-30T09:39:37-08:00

The authorities want to nationalize Domodedovo Airport The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation filed a lawsuit with the Arbitration Court of the Moscow Region demanding that 100% of the shares of DME Holding LLC, which owns the airport, be transferred to the state. The lawsuit is directed to 32 airport structures, its owner Dmitry Kamenshchik and chairman of the supervisory board Valery Kogan. As Vedomosti writes, the Prosecutor General's Office believes that the group of companies at Domodedovo Airport was under the control of -residents of foreign states- - Dmitry Kamenshchik (Turkey, UAE) and Valery Kogan (Israel ). The lawsuit states that Kamenshchik and Kogan were supposed to gain control over the Russian strategic asset only if there was a decision from a government commission (they allegedly did not apply for it). The possibility of nationalizing the airport was already discussed after the terrorist attack at Domodedovo in 2011. In 2015, a criminal case was opened against Kamenshchik under the article on the provision of services that do not meet safety requirements, resulting in the death of two or more people. The case was later dropped.	https://t.me/astrapress/73462	2025-01-29T10:23:51-08:00
