Ekaterinburg historian Abaturov rejected the BBC investigation that he is a serial informer Anna Korobkova-I don‚Äôt I admit that I have ever written anything on behalf of Anna Korobkova,- wrote Ivan Abaturov on his page on VKontakte.In investigationBBC claims the IP addresses of the devices from which Abaturov and Anna Korobkova sent letters, match. In response to this, Abaturov says that in 2022 he did not have his own home Internet, so he used public WiFi networks.Abaturov also replied that the similarity in the texts of Korobkova‚Äôs denunciations and his materials, as stated by Daniil Skorinkin, could be achieved by artificial intelligence. Previously, Ivan Abaturov was already involved in a scandal related to denunciations. In August 2022, the director of the Nestor-History publishing house, Sergei Erlikh, said that the police came to the office following a complaint from Abaturov, who accused their book about the Holocaust in Romania of disseminating -false information- about the actions of the USSR in World War II.It is also known that Abaturov is a historian by training. In 2021 he appealed to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office with a proposal to cancel the decision to rehabilitate Mineki. However, the military prosecutor's office said that Mineki is certainly a victim of political repression. Two years ago, Alexandra Arkhipova learned that a denunciation had been filed against her from a certain -Anna Korobkova.- The denunciation was sent to the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration under the President (RANEPA), where Arkhipova worked for many years. Since then, -Anna Korobkova- has sent dozens of denunciations and given numerous interviews, posing as a serial informer.	https://t.me/astrapress/71397	2024-12-29T09:51:29-08:00

ASTRA: A previously convicted serviceman returned from the war and killed an acquaintance in front of children in the Kemerovo region. Since September, relatives have complained three times against the military man for beatings and setting fire to a house. As ASTRA found out, in the village of Shchebzavod in the Kemerovo region, 26... A murderer pardoned by Putin, who fought in the Wagner PMC, kidnapped and tried to rape a resident of the Oryol region Criminal case of kidnapping (126 of the Criminal Code RF) was initiated in December against a previously convicted former fighter of the Wagner PMC, pardoned by Putin after participating in the war, 48-year-old Alexei Khokhlova, ASTRA found out. The common-law husband of the injured woman wrote a statement regarding the former fighter. Initially, the victim claimed that Khokhlov raped her, but investigators ultimately found no evidence of this and opened a case only for kidnapping. As Olga (name changed) said, a former serviceman beat her in one of the villages of the Maloarkhangelsk region back in August of this year. He then forcibly brought her to his house, where he abused her and held her all night, threatening to kill her. As ASTRA found out, Alexey Khokhlov was previously convicted of theft and murder. In 2022, the killer was recruited to the war with Ukraine as part of the Wagner PMC, and then Khokhlov was pardoned by Putin and returned to the village, where he attacked a local resident.This is already the 7th crime in December, committed by previously convicted former or current Russian military personnel, which became known to ASTRA. So, we told how in December a previously convicted serviceman who returned from the war killed an acquaintance in the Pskov region by beating him to death with a hammer. To hide traces of the murder, he set the body and house on fire. In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, a drunken serviceman who returned from the war beat up a traffic police officer after he stopped him while driving drunk. In the Kemerovo region, a previously convicted serviceman returned from the war and killed an acquaintance in front of children, and a shooter from Kursk robbed a construction site shop in Arkhangelsk. Previously convicted military man from Ryazani harassed a woman and her daughter on a train while he was going on vacation. In Stary Oskol, a previously convicted war participant stole a smart speaker. In the photo: illustrative photoüå± Subscribe to ASTRA.

In occupied Lugansk, unknown persons kidnapped a volunteer - a citizen of SerbiaWe are talking about 39-year-old volunteer Dragomir Topaloviƒá. He came to Russia this year and often visited occupied Lugansk, was engaged in volunteer activities, and wrote a telegram channel -Secrets of the Lugansk Republic.- In mid-December, Topaloviƒá contacted his relatives from Serbia, but spoke to them from the basement and asked for help in his release, stating that he was being forcibly held and wanted to be sent to war. After this conversation he never contacted me again. It is known that Topalovic has been suffering from hepatitis for a long time. Later, the telegram channel -Secrets of the Lugansk Republic- deleted the news about his abduction. ASTRA tried to contact the channel administrators to find out the reasons for the deletion, but received no response. On the news drewthe attention of the Z-channel -Shakespeare-: -What, guys, are just another -puzzis-, huh? Such as in the case of my friend Russell Bentley (call sign -Texas-), who was simply taken and killed. This is much worse than crests, guys. Because scum are scolded publicly, in front of all the people. And that means, sooner or later, all this will end up in the rear. Once again: this is exactly how the Mexican cartels turned out. By the way, what about the Ernest and Goodwin case? I don‚Äôt hear an answer.-Previously ASTRA reported about how servicemen of the DPR long-range reconnaissance regiment Dmitry Lysakovsky with the call sign -Goodwin- and Sergei Gritsai with the call sign -Ernest- was thrown into a deadly assault after conflicts with commander Igor Puzik (-Evil-), where they died. In their dying video, the military advised -never serve anyone- in the Russian army and spoke about the -crimes of the leadership,- as well as how commanders -lie every day.-Also ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military personnel by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military units 41698 and 42600). According to the editor‚Äôs interlocutors, the commanders of the 5th brigade set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was in the Petrovskaya mine that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured an American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine. Ibid tortured men who refused to fight, andthen forced them to carry out deadly assaults. In mid-December, Vladimir Putin noted -mass heroism and courage- in the 5th brigade of the -DPR- and awarded the brigade an -honorary name.- By his decree, the 5th separate motorized rifle brigade named after Zakharchenko is now called -Guards-.

In October, Turbin in a letter from the pre-trial detention center reported that he was being beaten: -This evening after 18:00 he punched me in the head on the bed twice. The situation is very difficult and critical. Azizbek beat me and said that I would get kicked at night (only with obscenities). The night will be very difficult.

They began to pay him less and every other time, and for trying to find out the reason or at least transfer to another place, Berlyakov, according to him, was sent to the assault detachment along with the fighters of the -Storm Z- unit. From there, the serviceman deserted a few months later to get to the military registration and enlistment office in Saratov and find out what was happening. It turned out that the Saratov resident was listed with the 6th Cossack Regiment as mobilized from the -LPR- and was wanted for desertion. -Who mobilized me here? -By order of the Beekeeper.- I say: -Who is the Beekeeper?- They say: -The head of the -LPR-. What difference does it make to me who the head of the -LPR- is, I am registered and live in the Saratov region, I am registered with the military registration and enlistment office, I have permanent registration, where my child is located. I am a single father. They couldn‚Äôt mobilize me there. I came here voluntarily,- Berlyakov is indignant.At the same time, Russian military commissars, police and operatives The FSB constantly emphasized in a conversation with Berlyakov their inability to influence the situation: the command of the 6th Cossack regiment simply ignored all their requests. The serviceman tried to take the requests to the command of the 6th regiment himself. Because of this, he, according to him, ended up in jail several times. pit, they threatened to kill him several times, he was sent to the front line several times, and once without weapons and uniform The last time. Berlyakov appeared at the location of the Cossack regiment, he was already being led to be shot, but the execution did not happen: he was stopped by FSB officers, whom Berlyakov had encountered earlier: -I‚Äôm sitting and thinking, damn, I wonder if the bullet hurts in the head or not. As a result, the voice is familiar, but I can‚Äôt figure out who it is. [...] He tells me his call sign. I understand that this is that [familiar] FSB officer. [...] I‚Äôm safe.--Through the personal account of a serviceman, which everyone has, according to the badge number that I have, I found out that the salary I am credited only to some unknown bank. [...] There are many such children who are supposedly in captivity of crests, but in fact the sixth Cossack army keeps them in basements and receives money for them,- says the Saratovite. Now Vladislav Berlyakov is preparing to go to the capital, because -he is tired of writing to Moscow.- He has neither a salary nor the opportunity to get a job: according to documents, he is still a wanted deserter.-I tell [the FSB officers who saved him. - Approx. ed.]: -Can I get a job?- They say: -You can‚Äôt get a job. You are a military man. You are purely a military man. Not a single security service will let you through. Even right away, they can even quietly call the police, the commandant‚Äôs office or something else from you...- I say: - I won‚Äôt go stealing. I don‚Äôt have any salary! I‚Äôve been in captivity for so long! I can‚Äôt get a job. I have a child on my hands. they took it away from me because I don‚Äôt provide a certificate from anywhere. I can‚Äôt take a certificate that I am in service,- Berlyakov sums up his conversation with the FSB officers, who, according to him, saved him from execution at 6:00. m Cossack regiment.Berlyakov‚Äôs video message appeared in the Z-channel -Soldatskaya Pravda-.

There were no casualties or damage. So... Two more aerial bombs dropped on Russian planes near residential buildings in the Belgorod region, more than 150 residents were evacuated According to ASTRA, an -abnormal collapse- FAB-500 on December 26 occurred near a residential building on Pobeda Street in the village of Kustovoe, Yakovlevsky urban district, Belogrrl region. More than 150 village residents were evacuated, no injuries were reported. The bomb must be removed and destroyed today. Another aerial bomb fell near a residential building in the village of Pushkarnoye. Residents were also not injured. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year. November 19 a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/71241	2024-12-27T01:07:06-08:00

Under the name of the serial informer -Anna Korobkova,- a scandalous journalist may be hidingTogether with linguist Daniil Skorinkin, social anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova conducted a comparative analysis of the article about -Korobkova- on Wikipedia and the letters she sent to journalists and Arkhipova herself. For this purpose, the stylometric method was used, which analyzes the frequency of use of function words in the text, thanks to which authorship can be determined. The results showed that the style of the Wikipedia article and Korobkova‚Äôs letter are very similar. The history of edits to the article indicates that the text was added by the user -Arkady2023- on the night of October 4-5, which is probably the pseudonym of Ivan Abaturov.Previously, Ivan Abaturov was already involved in a scandal related to denunciations. In August 2022, the director of the Nestor-History publishing house, Sergei Erlikh, said that the police came to the office following a complaint from Abaturov, who accused their book about the Holocaust in Romania of disseminating -false information- about the actions of the USSR in World War II.It is also known that Abaturov is a historian by training. In 2021 he appealed to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office with a proposal to cancel the decision to rehabilitate Mineki. However, the military prosecutor's office said that Mineki is certainly a victim of political repression. Two years later, Alexandra Arkhipova learned that a denunciation had been filed against her from a certain -Anna Korobkova.- The denunciation was sent to the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration under the President (RANEPA), where Arkhipova worked for many years. Since then, -Anna Korobkova- has sent dozens of denunciations and given numerous interviews, posing as a serial informer.	https://t.me/astrapress/71164	2024-12-26T01:50:01-08:00
