In the Russian Federation, the first sentence was passed on an air defense officer who, instead of a drone, shot down a helicopter with three military personnel - KommersantIgor Pashkov, who served as a senior assistant at the operational duty command post of one of the units Air defense forces stationed in Russian-occupied Crimea became the first defendant in a criminal case under Part 3 of Article 293 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Negligence-), manifested during repelling the alleged attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, reports the newspaper.As established by the garrison military court of Sevastopol, October 18, 2023 in 6:30 in the morning, when Pashkov was on combat duty, he received a report about the detection of a low-flying, low-speed air target.The head of the combat crew gave his call sign, but the officer made a mistake in the number and reported to management that the unidentified target was located in a different location . As a result, a decision was made to destroy it. The check showed that -there are no aircraft of our own- in the indicated area, and two minutes after the first message, a helicopter was shot down by a missile from the TOR-M2DT anti-aircraft missile system. Later it turned out that the downed Mi-8MTV-5-1, which fell into the Black Sea, was Russian, and three members of its crew, captains, died.Military investigative bodies of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a criminal case for violation of combat rules duty, which led to grave consequences. Pashkov admitted his guilt in May 2024, admitting the mistake that led to the downing of a Russian Aerospace Forces helicopter. The investigation charged him with negligence for careless attitude to service, which led to false information about the aircraft.The Garrison Court found Pashkov guilty, but he took advantage of Article 51 of the Constitution and refused to testify. The court ordered him to pay 5 million rubles to the Ministry of Defense and compensate moral damages to the widows of the pilots in the amount of 1 million rubles each. In the appeal, the parties appealed the verdict, claiming insufficient severity of punishment and unlawful mitigation of circumstances.The Southern District Military Court, having reviewed the verdict, reduced Pashkov’s sentence to two years and ten months in a penal colony, taking into account his admission of guilt and repentance and other mitigating circumstances, such as having a dependent disabled son and positive characteristics.	https://t.me/astrapress/72507	2025-01-15T11:35:08-08:00
