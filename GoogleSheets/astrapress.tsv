Emergency power outages lasting up to 10 hours for 2-3 days occur regularly. They consider the culprit to be SZ Kvant LLC, which manages local power grids. This company -in some dubious way- became the owner of the networks, began connecting new consumers without complying with technical conditions and took huge amounts of money for it. As a result: networks are overloaded and not maintained, and modernization is not carried out. -The administration turns a blind eye to the problem. As a result, residents suffer from regular outages, and no one is in a hurry to help us,- local resident Ekaterina told ASTRA.They hope for a quick solution to the problem so that the winter months do not become a test for them. -Don‚Äôt let our families will freeze this winter.

ASTRA: In Makeevka, the Russian Aerospace Forces dropped a FAB-500 near a residential building. 3 more aerial bombs were found in the Belgorod region. As ASTRA found out, 3 FABs fell from Russian aircraft in the Belgorod region over the past few days. So, on November 23, an aerial bomb was found in a field near the village of Surkovo... Due to the fall of a 250-kilogram aerial bomb in a village in the Belgorod region, 100 people were evacuated 2 more FABs fell on the same day in the region, no one was injured. As ASTRA found out, due to the -abnormal descent- of a FAB-250 from a Russian plane in the village of Kazatskoye, Yakovlevsky urban district, on November 26, residents of several streets were evacuated, in total - about 100 people. Sources in the region's emergency services told ASTRA that an aerial bomb fell near a residential building on Novaya Street. The bomb did not explode, so no one was injured. Now the FAB has already been confiscated, the residents have returned to their homes. Another aerial bomb was found on the same day a few kilometers from the village of Nikolskoye, Belgorod district. Another FAB was dropped on November 26 in the Bystry farm. In both cases there were no casualties or damage.Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 159 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and in Russian-controlled territories Ukraine for 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69552	2024-11-30T23:19:21-08:00

Journalists found a Russian filtration camp for captured Ukrainians in Belarus - investigation by the Belarusian Investigative CenterAt the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military created a filtration camp on the territory of Belarus. Journalists found out that it was located on the basis of one of the buildings that belonged to a Belarusian state-owned enterprise -Pripyat Alliance- in Narovlya (Gomel region). Some human rights activists call this camp one of the most cruel against prisoners. Not only Ukrainian military personnel were taken there, but also civilians, including minors. For example, a resident of the Kyiv region Larisa Yagodinskaya said that in March 2022, her two sons were taken there, one of whom had not yet reached the age of eighteen at that time: -They said that the sons were saboteurs, and they took them and took them to Chernobyl. There it turned out that they were beating them, and as [the younger son] Slava later told them, [that the eldest son] most likely even broke his ribs, they beat him hard with a bat.- UAF serviceman Bogdan Lysenko, who was captured by the Russian military at the end of March 2022, also spoke about the torture of civilians: -Narovlya - it was such a propaganda picture that we [Russian military] are, like, humane... But none of them shows how civilians were interrogated there. And they beat civilians there, God forbid... That is, screams were constantly heard there.- According to human rights activists, now some of the Ukrainians who passed through the filtration camp in Narovlya are still in captivity, in particular, on the territory of penal colonies in Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69426	2024-11-28T23:32:32-08:00

Actor Oleg Yagodin was demanded to withdraw from all performances on tour of the Kolyada Theater in Moscow due to anti-war statements in 2022According to the creator of the Kolyada Theater - Nikolay Kolyada, he received a call from the capital‚Äôs center -On Strastnoy-, employees stated that a representative of the -competent authorities- demanded that they cancel the theater‚Äôs tour in Moscow, or replace Oleg Yagodin in all performances. -The trial of Oleg Yagodin took place three years ago. At the trial, Oleg apologized for saying the wrong thing, the wrong thing, the wrong thing, and paid a fine of 40 thousand. And then a thousand more times Oleg cursed himself for what had happened,- written Kolyada. -Oleg Yagodin is an outstanding Russian artist, like no other in Russia, and indeed everywhere else. I could replace him just to go to Moscow - Oleg has only 9 performances. But I won't do that. I‚Äôd rather cancel these tours, and we‚Äôll sit at home and play our performances, because they don‚Äôt abandon their own, you know? &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; How else can he obey? Tell me, please. What else can I do? Who to give an interview to, where to stand and douse yourself with gasoline, where to send humanitarian aid? Or are there any other options? In that case, I‚Äôll go with him, and I‚Äôll also douse myself with gasoline. Because they don‚Äôt abandon their own people,- he added.Oleg Yagodin was found guilty in 2022 of -discrediting- the RF Armed Forces. At a concert during the -Night of Music- he shouted -No to war-, which was broadcast live on one of the TV channels. At the beginning of 2024, Oleg Yagodin was included in the secret lists of -banned musicians.- In the summer, the group had to cancel concerts in the south of Russia, and later concerts were canceled in Moscow and Yekaterinburg.	https://t.me/astrapress/69421	2024-11-28T21:32:14-08:00

The Central Election Commission spent four months looking for errors in his election reporting. The politician explained the fine by saying that the CEC blocked his election account - and tens of thousands of sheets had to be printed at SberbankA court in Moscow fined Boris Nadezhdin, a participant in the 2024 presidential elections blocked by the CEC, for errors in the pre-election financial report. Three fines of 50 thousand rubles each for:‚Äî illegal use of donations received in violation;‚Äî violation of the rules for transferring funds contributed to the election fund;‚Äî failure to provide a complete attachment financial report. Nadezhdin announced the court's decision this evening. Previously he wrote on his channel that his violations were explained by the fact that on February 8 the Central Election Commission blocked his election account. Because of this, financial statements had to be submitted to the Ministry of Justice on 50 thousand sheets of paper, -the unfortunate Sberbank was responsible for printing them - which it did for several days around the clock- [stack of papers in the photo]. The politician also complained about the large number of signature collectors - according to him, it was technically difficult for them to print out all the payments for donations. -It is completely incomprehensible why in the 21st century one would submit a financial report and applications on paper, despite the fact that the Central Election Commission sees all transactions on the election account online,- he wrote. The politician explained that the court reduced the amount of the fine from 75 thousand because it took into account mitigating circumstances -the size of the pension, the presence of children, etc.- Nadezhdin added that two of the four donations for which the Central Bank issued him this fine were 30 and 70 (thirty and seventy) rubles. -We will appeal,- he wrote.	https://t.me/astrapress/69330	2024-11-27T11:33:03-08:00

At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations,&nbsp; throw links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name. This will help minimize risks and feel calmer.All donations sent from November 12th will be used to collect salaries.

In Makeevka, the Russian Aerospace Forces dropped a FAB-500 near a residential building3 more aerial bombs were found in the Belgorod region.How ASTRA found out that 3 FABs fell from Russian planes in the Belgorod region over the past few days. So, on November 23, an aerial bomb was found in a field near the village of Surkovo, Shebekinsky urban district. The next day, a FAB-500 was found in the Belgorod district, and on November 25, a FAB-250 fell several kilometers from the Gremyachiy village of the Shebekinsky urban district. There were no casualties or damage.In occupied Makeyevka, Donetsk region, on November 24, a FAB-500 fell right next to a residential building on Ordzhonikidze Street, ASTRA found out. Another FAB was found in the Shakhtarsky district. In both cases, no one was injured. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 156 cases of FAB aerial bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region.

There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged.

In Russia, this substance has been available since 2012 banned as a drug.Morozov is by no means the first patient with a similar diagnosis to face criminal prosecution for ordering Indian drugs. So, only at the beginning of 2024, a physicist from St. Petersburg Andrei Volotka for ordering modafinil by mail received4 years of strict regime. After the start of criminal prosecution, Andrei Morozov founded the -Ratio- community of Russians with sleep disorders. In May of this year, patients turnedto Putin with a request to allow the import of modafinil into Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69225	2024-11-25T12:38:21-08:00

Putin more than doubled payments to the Russian Guard for signing the contractNow for signing a contract for participation in the war with Ukraine, Roskvardia fighters will be paid a one-time payment of 400 thousand rubles - against the 195 thousand rubles they have been paid for the contract since November 2022. All contract soldiers now receive the same payment of 400 thousand rubles. In November, the Russian authorities changed the system of monetary remuneration for the military. So, two weeks ago after Putin‚Äôs decree, the government sharply reduced payments to the militaryfor injuries - up to 30 times. Then Putin (by his own decree) raised payments for injuries resulting in disability by a million rubles. After that State Duma obliged volunteers to pay for military equipment lost in battle. All this is happening against the backdrop of an unprecedented increase in the size of one-time payments for signing a contract in 2024. With the help of these payments, regions compete for the number of contract soldiers sent to war. The current record is held by the Belgorod region, where you can get 3 million rubles for signing a permanent contract with the Ministry of Defense.	https://t.me/astrapress/69201	2024-11-25T07:23:17-08:00
