Meanwhile, the Russian Federation is already accused of interfering in the electoral processHow confirms ABC News with link to FBI documents, the agency arrested a certain Isaac Sissel in Michigan, who allegedly published threats on the Internet that he would carry out a mass shooting of conservative Christians if Donald Trump won the election. A man was arrested in Canton 2 days after threats of a mass shooting were published. The criminal case states that his messages about the terrorist attack were reported to the FBI by the administration of the Reddit portal. The reason was various accounts with threatening usernames, including -ShootUpTrulyRally-, -WillShootTrumpSoon-, -PlannigToShootTrump- and -PlanningToKillTrump-. Sissel told agents during questioning that Trump -was a threat...that he should have been killed and that everything would be better if Trump were dead,- his affidavit states.&nbsp; The man is also said to be a migrant who had recently lived on the University of Michigan campus and was the subject of multiple arrest warrants on charges of stalking, harassment and offensive communications. ABC also reported that anonymous bomb threats had been reported at several polling stations, including in the swing state of Georgia. The FBI said that most of these threats come from -Russian mailing addresses.--At this time, none of the threats have been determined to be credible,- reported to the FBI. Right now, the US is holding presidential elections, in which the main confrontation is between former President Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Vice President Kamala Harris from the Democratic wing. Polls show that neither candidate has a clear advantage, so the election will be decided in so-called swing states that do not have a traditional allegiance to one of the two major parties.	https://t.me/astrapress/67827	2024-11-05T11:54:27-08:00

The first polling stations will open in Vermont at 12 Moscow time. American intelligence at least since the beginning of the year tells about how Russia (and also Iran and China) floods the American Internet with fakes for the elections. Researchers believethat -trolls- associated with Russia have been busy for the last two months discrediting Democratic candidate Kamala Harris - and various attempts to sow discord in US society. Last week, a video began to go viral online (more than half a million views on the social network -X- alone) in which allegedly immigrants from Haiti say that on the eve of the elections they go to polling stations in different parts of the state of Georgia and leave votes for Harris. CNN contacted social network user -X- (former tweeter) under the nickname AlphaFox78, who was one of the sources of this fake. He told CNN that the video was paid for by Australian Semyon Boykov - better known online by his nickname Aussie Cossack (-Australian Cossack-).In Australia, Boykov has problems with the law - in December 2022 year he attacked a 72-year-old pensioner who supports Ukraine [in the latest video]. The pensioner was hospitalized with a head injury. Boykov, in order to avoid going to prison, has been living on the territory of the Russian consulate in Australia since 2023. In the same year, Putin gave Boykov Russian citizenship. In a conversation with CNN, user -X- AlphaFox78 said that his collaboration with Boykov -started with memes and seemed innocent-. At the request of the -Australian Cossack,- he posted videos for $100 per post. CNN also writes that, according to their data, Boykov officially works for Russian state media - and is registered in Australia as an agent of Russian influence.	https://t.me/astrapress/67773	2024-11-04T21:21:24-08:00

The very first draft of the peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine has been published. According to it, Ukraine was supposed to recognize Crimea as Russia, but later the position of the Russian Federation changedResearch project -System- (RFE/RL)&nbsp;published&nbsp;the earliest known project peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine. On March 7, for the third round of negotiations, the same peace treaty in its original form was drawn up. The document was provided to the publication by a Ukrainian source, and a Russian source confirmed its authenticity. Under the terms of the original agreement:- Ukraine must -recognize the independence- of the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk republics, and also recognize Crimea and Sevastopol as an -integral part of Russia.-- Ukraine must take bear the costs of restoring the infrastructure of Donbass, destroyed since 2014;- Ukraine must reduce the size of the army to 50,000 people, which is 5 times less than by February 24, 2022; - Ukraine is prohibited from entering into any military alliances and concluding any military agreements with other states;- Ukraine is prohibited from -developing, producing, acquiring and deploying on its territory missile weapons of any type with a firing range of more than 250 km-;- All sanctions against Russia since 2014, including Western and Ukrainian ones, must be lifted;- Russian should become one of the state languages ​​in Ukraine;- Must be canceled and no longer -any bans on symbols associated in states with the victory over Nazism- are introduced.&nbsp;That is, Soviet symbols must be allowed;- Ukraine must stop procedures for accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;In response, the Russian side promised a -ceasefire regime- and certain -measures-, and not a withdrawal of troops.&nbsp;At the same time, Russian representatives wanted to oblige the Ukrainian troops to withdraw to permanent deployment points, and all foreign specialists from the West had to leave the country, and Russian troops, together with the forces of the National Guard, were supposed to remain in positions and monitor Ukraine’s fulfillment of -all obligations under the treaty.- At the same time, in March 2024, The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;published&nbsp;draft peace agreements between Russia and Ukraine , which was discussed after negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place at the end of March in Istanbul. The document is dated April 15, 2022 and in it Russia’s position softened.According to it, it was determined that Ukraine would have a security mechanism similar to Article 5 of NATO, for which, as expected, the guarantor countries: Great Britain, China , the Russian Federation, the USA, France, Russia, Belarus, Turkey would undertake to defend Ukraine with military forces in the event of an attack.However, this point could not be agreed upon, since the wording proposed by Ukraine meant that the signatories of the agreement would be able to Ukraine as collectively and individually. Russia insisted on only collective intervention. That is, Russia itself, as a signatory to the treaty, could, in theory, veto the decision to protect Ukraine from its own attack.The clause on territorial integrity was also changed. How writes -Currently-, Ukraine, according to the April agreement, remains within its recognized borders, including Crimea, Sevastopol and some unspecified territories that are not covered by security guarantees. The communiqué adopted in Istanbul at the end of March indicated that the status of Crimea and Sevastopol would be resolved diplomatically.However, the document published on April 15, 2022 stated that annexed Crimea would remain under Russian control without a formal renunciation of sovereignty above it from the Ukrainian side. The future of parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions that were under Russian control until February 24, 2022, was to be determined during negotiations between the presidents of the two countries. The document did not mention the status of other territories occupied by Russia According to the WSJ, negotiations continued until June 2022 and stopped at the initiative of Ukraine. Moscow previously claimed that the negotiations ended in April.	https://t.me/astrapress/67762	2024-11-04T12:01:27-08:00

In Komi hospital, instead of an elevator, medical staff have to use a stretcher March 10 in the village Ust-Tsilma, shortly before the presidential elections, a medical building was inaugurated. However, the elevators in the four-story hospital building still do not work, because of this, doctors are forced to lift intensive care and low-mobility patients on stretchers.-Workers and patients of the medical building of the Ust-Tsilemskaya hospital experience every day the beauty of optimizing healthcare . Or is it the negligence of those in charge who decided that an elevator in a hospital is a luxury, and not a means of transporting patients on gurneys. But no matter what you call the situation, it’s outrageous!- – wrote local deputy Tatyana Saladina. Prosecutor's Office revealedthat the hospital has not entered into an agreement with the organization to maintain the elevator since its opening , and the lift is not registered in the Rostechnadzor register. -Elevators cannot be launched without concluding a service agreement with a specialized organization. This is a safety issue for users and a guarantee that possible problems in the operation of elevators will be addressed by someone. The difficulty is that there is no such organization in the Ust-Tsilemsky region. The ministry, together with the district hospital, is searching for an organization that will maintain the elevator. Measures have been taken to allocate additional funds for these purposes,- added at the Komi Ministry of Health.	https://t.me/astrapress/67701	2024-11-03T08:55:17-08:00
