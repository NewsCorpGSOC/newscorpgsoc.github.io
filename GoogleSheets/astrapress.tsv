The State Duma has introduced amendments according to which foreign citizenship will become an aggravating circumstance when committing a crimeDraft amendments to Part 1 of Article 63 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Circumstances- aggravating punishment-) was introduced to the State Duma by deputy Evgeniy Marchenko (non-factional parliamentarian). He proposes to consider the commission of a crime -by a person with foreign citizenship or a stateless person- as an aggravating circumstance, writes -Kommersant-. Marchenko believes that this initiative -will become an effective preventive mechanism- and will contribute to -more responsible behavior- of foreigners in the Russian Federation. He refers to TFR statistics indicating a 55% increase in the number of extremist crimes committed by migrants in the first half of 2024. Experts interviewed by Kommersant say these amendments contradict the constitutional principle of equality before the law and may contribute to the outflow of migrants. The State Duma is currently considering several bills that would tighten migration policy: illegal stay in the country as an aggravating circumstance when sentencing, and equating the organization of illegal migration to particularly serious crimes. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called tightening control over migration a priority for the State Duma this session.&nbsp; Until 2021, Marchenko was a deputy from United Russia, but was later expelled from the party because the parliamentarian, contrary to the consolidated decision of the party bodies, voted against the adoption of the federal budget in the first reading, thereby violating the norms of the charter -United Russia- and regulations on the faction.	https://t.me/astrapress/65972	2024-10-07T22:18:07-07:00

As a result, the Yemeni movement purchased $10 million worth of machine guns. Victor Bout returned to Russia two years ago - then Bout, convicted in the United States in the case of selling weapons to the Colombian group FARC, was exchanged for two-time Olympic basketball champion Brittney Greiner. Viktor Bout is currently working deputy Legislative Assembly of the Ulyanovsk Region from the Liberal Democratic Party. -If we look at the title of the article [The Wall Street Journal], and it is pointedly called 'Putin's arms dealer,' and, naturally, we understand that this stuff was specially timed on the birthday of our President Vladimir Putin,- Bout said in a commentary to RBC. CNN previously wrote that Russia planned to transfer missiles and military equipment to the Houthis - but changed her mind under pressure from Saudi Arabia. However, then journalists did not report about Bout’s participation in the negotiations. It is beneficial for Moscow to arm the Houthis because of their confrontation with the United States in Yemen and the Red Sea.

🎬🖼 A cargo ship with 20 thousand tons of saltpeter from Russia ...	A cargo ship with 20 thousand tons of saltpeter from Russia has not been able to get up for repairs in Europe for more than a month. Local authorities fear a repeat of the tragedy in Beirut The Malta-flagged cargo ship MV Ruby carrying Russian fertilizers has not been allowed into European ports for repairs since the beginning of September. European authorities are afraid of the possible detonation of 20 thousand tons of ammonium nitrate (ammonium nitrate), which Ruby was supposed to deliver to Africa from the Murmansk region. The New York Times writes about this.Ruby left the port in the city of Kandalaksha in August. Soon after the start of the journey, the ship ran aground, resulting in damage to the hull, propeller and rudder. From September 1 to September 4, the ship was in the Norwegian port of Tromso - there it was inspected, but not repaired. Since then, the ship has not been allowed to dock.Ammonium nitrate is a popular fertilizer that comes with risks. Nitrate is explosive, especially in large quantities. Heating or, for example, a significant change in air humidity can lead to an explosion. In August 2020, due to welding work in the port of Lebanese Beirut, 2,750 tons of saltpeter detonated - as a result of a powerful explosion (on video), more than 200 people were killed, and about 300,000 more were left homeless. There is about 8 times more saltpeter on board Ruby - although it is known that the ship was not damaged by the cargo. The opportunity to moor the ship with explosive cargo MV Ruby has already been denied by the authorities of Lithuania and Great Britain, off whose coast the ship has been docking for the last week. Now the UAE company that operates the vessel, Serenity Shipping, has requested permission to dock to unload fertilizer onto another vessel and carry out repairs on the Ruby. Even Malta refused to allow Ruby with explosive cargo, writes The New York Times. This is despite the fact that the ship is flying the Maltese flag. Officials said the Ruby would only be able to dock if it got rid of the saltpeter.

In this way they were ground in 2-3 days.- I spent two days recovering from this story, and all the stories with drunken assaults seemed like flowers to me.

A few days later, in one of the Z-channels called -Misha from Canada- (10 thousand subscribers), a publication appeared in which the women who complained about Ksenofontov were called -enemies-, and the -bloggers- who published this information were called -trash, which needs to be planted.- Among other things, Bolvinova complained that they still refuse to issue her a certificate of her husband’s death, and military unit 29760, which owed her husband half a million rubles, paid the debt only after the uproar. The true commander of this unit, according to close military personnel, is Ksenophontov, -and all these acting commanders perform his duties while he is behind the belt and commands the 25th brigade.- The appeal was also recorded by the wife of the mobilized Kirill Velichko. He last got in touch on January 18, 2024 and reported that he was being taken to the assault. According to his colleagues, he died on January 19 near Sinkovka as a result of a drone strike.

A nurse was given 8 years in prison for posts about the war with Ukraine59-year-old Olga Menshikh was accused of spreading -fake news- because of posts about murders in Bucha and a missile attack on Vinnitsa. -Zakharova talks cruel nonsense at her fucking briefing. How does the earth carry it? God, what is she talking about... At this time, Vinnitsa. Russia shelled the city center for the first time, missiles hit an office building, 12 dead, dozens wounded,- said one of the posts.At the trial in Moscow, Menshikh did not admit her guilt. In her final statement, she said that she often saw wounded people in her hospital. -When a young stump passes by you, do you know what feelings a woman has? Compassion, not the hatred that is charged to me. Maybe at some point I experienced professional deformation. &lt;...&gt; I really felt sorry for them,- she said.Since 2011, Olga Menshikh worked as a nurse anesthetist at the Pirogov Center in Moscow. Previously, she was tried several times under administrative charges, including for going to a protest.Photo: -Mediazona-	https://t.me/astrapress/65696	2024-10-03T05:45:09-07:00

On August 26, he decided to escape from the unit and return home. He did not tell her the reasons why he did this. He stayed at home for only a few days - soon he was stopped on the street to have his documents checked and taken to the police station. There it turned out that he was wanted.-My husband called me and said that he had been detained, so I accordingly came there. We sat in the police for two hours, the military commandant’s office arrived. He said: -Guys, I’m not going anywhere. Either I stay here or I just die.- A scuffle broke out, and eventually he was handcuffed, forced into a car, and taken to the military commandant’s office. I called the duty officer there, they don’t provide information - it’s the weekend.&nbsp;And three days later the prosecutor’s office told me that he was sent to Zaitsevo,- says Valentina.Valentina says that Alexey left at home all his personal belongings - from a military ID to a telephone, on which his comrades periodically write. Answering them, she found out that some of her husband’s colleagues also passed through Zaitsevo.-One tells me, I know what kind of place this is, I was there for two weeks. He was put there because he insulted the commander. Why, if my husband broke the law, is he not in a pre-trial detention center, but in a hole? And why are his rights not respected? They should at least have informed me as a relative that my husband was detained under such and such an article, and not torture people and mock me. They are not even allowed to go to the toilet, people walk under themselves.&nbsp;Up to 100 people sit there at a time. You wouldn’t wish this on your enemy,- Valentina told ASTRA.According to Valentina, her husband went to war not out of patriotic convictions or for the sake of money, but because -he was interested in - - he did not serve in military service for medical reasons. - When he made his choice, it was a shock for me. I couldn’t come to my senses for three days. If I had known about this in advance, I would never have let him in in my life. I don't need any blood money. And they don’t even have this money, because they provided for themselves. They bought socks, tents, food, cigarettes, some tools, pens, paid for their communications, the Internet. We bought tents so that we wouldn’t sleep on the cold ground. I think this is not normal. Why did they go to fight then? They, like patriots, went for Russia. What did you get in the end? Such an appeal? What money? What is shown on TV is all nonsense,- says Valentina.Valentina has sent appeals to the presidential administration, as well as to several deputies, but is worried that the answer to them will not arrive on time , and now -every minute counts.--I just need to get my husband out of there. Let him be punished according to the law, they will give him a prison term, but he did not deserve what is happening in Zaitsevo. I don't think anyone deserves this. I owe my husband my whole life, I cannot leave him. I've known him for over 20 years. I’m ready to do anything for him, but he needs to be pulled back out of this hole. And I don’t even know if he’s alive or not. My head is just a mess. But I won’t forgive myself if I don’t help him,- says Valentina.&nbsp;Throughout the entire full-scale war, ASTRA talks about illegal prisons for -refuseniks-, where military personnel i>threatsandvarious torturedforced into deadly assaults. We have already found 18such placesin the occupied territories and 1 in the territory of Russia.

Employees of the Great Russian Encyclopedia have not received their salaries for the tenth monthThe non-profit organization involved in compiling the Great Russian Encyclopedia received subsidies from the state annually. As BRE employees told ASTRA, at the end of 2023, about 450 of them, as usual, signed fixed-term contracts for 2024. In addition, 6,500 freelance authors who were supposed to receive fees continued their work with the publication.-Both BDT employees and authors, including academicians and corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, doctors and candidates of sciences, leading experts in their field were confident that the delay in fees was temporary and funding was about to arrive. Moreover, the management of BRE fed them several times a month with promises of speedy payment of salaries. Thus, each editor found himself bound by obligations to the authors who wrote the articles. And now we are in an extremely cramped situation, when we find ourselves -in debt- to long-term authors, with whom we have established not only professional, but also human relationships,one of the publication’s employees told ASTRA. According to another BRE employee, other organizations cooperating with the publishing house are not receiving money now: for example, Internet providers and water utilities.From May to September 2024, BRE employees wrote about 1,000 appeals and requests to the Prosecutor General's Office, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the Government Office, the Presidential Administration, the Ministry of Digital Development, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. -We received assurances from each department that funding is being sought and is about to arrive,- says a BDT employee. — Some people quit, but about 300 people remain on staff. For many of them, work at BRE is their only job. Of course, during this time everyone has accumulated a lot of debt on loans and mortgages. Not everyone has a part-time job.-According to her, until about mid-June, all employees continued to work as usual, but then they wrote notices that they were suspending their official duties until salaries were paid.-We wanted to organize a rally, but due to anti-Covid measures it was not approved for us, so on October 2 we held single pickets in Kitai-Gorod.
