Putin went to Mongolia to ask shamans for permission to use nuclear weapons - Der SpiegelRussian writer and journalist, ex-editor-in-chief of Dozhd, Mikhail Zygar sharedwith the German publication Der Spiegel rumors that Putin traveled to Mongolia in early September to -meet with shamans- and ask them for -blessings to use nuclear weapons-: -There are now rumors in Moscow that Putin needs the blessing of shamans in order to use nuclear weapons. Without their approval, he could not take such a serious step, for fear of angering the spirits. And he allegedly returned from Mongolia happy. However, this version sounds like a big fantasy. None of my sources can confirm it. However, the meeting with Mongolian shamans seemed to have taken place.- Zygar also focuses on the fact that Mongolia and Tuva - two of Putin's recent trips - are considered the homeland of the most powerful shamans in the world. -Vladimir Putin has long been known for his special attitude towards mysticism. And he appears to combine his interest in orthodox mysticism with pagan traditions,- the publication said. Sergei Shoigu was the first to bring Putin into contact with shamans. As evidence of this version, the author of the article recalls the frequent joint trips of Shoigu and Putin in the early 00s, including to Tuva. Zygar also claims that before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin consulted a lot with mystics. They assured him of military victory.	https://t.me/astrapress/64375	2024-09-15T11:12:46-07:00

During the correspondence, the Dossier Center was unable to obtain evidence that would meet the minimum expectations of reliability. The data could not be verified, and combined with the manner of presentation, this created the impression of provocation. &lt;…&gt; We suggested that the person who wrote to us, who, in his opinion, had such evidence, report the crime to the police. At the same time, we suggested that Leonid Nevzlin, if he has evidence, should also contact law enforcement agencies, which, as far as we know, he did on August 5, 2024. The Dossier Center already informed law enforcement agencies on July 2, 2024, about the situation (receiving dubious information about a crime, possibly being a provocation or blackmail),&nbsp;— told Khodorkovsky. September 12 FBK accused businessman Leonid Nevzlin of ordering the assassination attempt on Leonid Volkov in Vilnius. Maria Pevchikh stated that Khodorkovsky knew from June that Nevzlin organized the attack. -Either this is true and then Leonid Nevzlin has gone crazy.

Dissident artists prevented public utilities from restoring order - this is how the -Bulldozer Exhibition- of 1974 is described in the history textbook from Medinsky Today, September 15, marks the 50th anniversary of the -Bulldozer Exhibition- - when unofficial Soviet avant-garde artists exhibited their works in a vacant lot in the Bitsevsky Forest Park. The exhibition was dispersed by bulldozers, sprinklers, security forces and people in civilian clothes. The attackers destroyed paintings and beat artists and visitors. Subsequently, the incident was written about in foreign publications. And here is how this event is described in a new history textbook authored by Medinsky. According to the authors of the manual, who coined the phrase -contemporary art,- for protest artists, -the main measure of -success- was coverage in Western media. -They exhibited their works without approval from the city authorities at the intersection of two Moscow streets.

Navalny's FBK released investigation, according to which Leonid Nevzlin, a close associate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and former top manager of YUKOS, is the organizer of a series of attacks on Russian oppositionists abroad. Andrei Matus, who until recently worked for the structures of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, told FBK about this. It is alleged that Leonid Nevzlin instructed Matus to clean up the electronic traces of the attack on Volkov. He was entrusted with taking away the phones of the perpetrators of the attack, but instead of getting rid of them, he leaked data from the FBK devices (and, apparently, the propaganda TV channel Russia Today, where a week earlier the same correspondence that FBK talks about was published).Matus provided Navalny’s team with videos filmed in the first person by participants in the attacks on Zhdanov in Geneva and Mironov’s wife in Argentina, as well as correspondence in which a person recorded as Nevzlin discusses the attack on Volkov with the perpetrator. That the correspondence was real for FBK was confirmed by investigative journalists - Mikhail Maglov from the Proekt publication and Hristo Grozev, who investigated Navalny’s poisoning. According to FBK, Nevzlin is allegedly behind the attack on Navalny's associates Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, as well as attack on economist Maxim Mironov and his wife in Buenos Aires. FBK interlocutor Andrei Matus also stated that it was allegedly planned to beat Leonid Volkov -to the point of disability- or kidnap him, take him to Russia by sea and hand him over to the FSB. Perhaps the most convincing evidence that Matus showed to FBK is an audio recording in which a man with a voice similar to Nevzlin says, among other things, that he is dissatisfied with the fact that Maxim Mironov’s wife was not beaten enough. >-We call on everyone who cooperates in any capacity with the structures of Mikhail Khodorkovsky to stop doing so until the circumstances and the degree of his personal involvement and awareness of the crimes of [Leonid Nevzlin] are clarified.- , - said the FBK.	https://t.me/astrapress/64177	2024-09-12T06:45:37-07:00

This was allegedly seen by children playing on the playground. One of the boys told his mother about what happened, and she contacted the police. According to another versions one of the students came to visit another to take a shower, because his hot water was turned off. As MK writes, an investigative experiment, which was carried out only almost a year after the arrest at the request of students, showed: from the playground it is impossible to see what is happening in the window of the 2nd floor of a house that is not even located opposite the playing area, but to the side. But after that the guys were not released. Timur and Daniil did not admit guilt. Some parents of the victims spoke out in their defense.	https://t.me/astrapress/64151	2024-09-12T00:31:05-07:00

In their closing words they said: Harris: -Today you have seen two plans for leading the country - one leads forward, and the other goes back. &lt;…&gt; I want to invest in the economy of the future, support young families and seniors, and I will be a president who protects our fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the rights of women to do with their bodies what they consider important.-Trump : -she started by saying that she was going to do this and that. But she has been working for 3.5 years now and I want to ask why she hasn’t done all this yet? &lt;…&gt; We are a weakening nation, people laugh at us all over the world.

Trump: -It is in our interests to end the war.- Harris: -I think if Trump became president, he would simply reject this war and his support for Ukraine. I met with Zelensky a few days before the full-scale war, I gave him intelligence about how they could defend themselves. And so we united 50 countries in helping Ukraine. If Trump were president, Putin would already be sitting in Kyiv. And this applies not only to Ukraine. Therefore, all our comrades are glad that he is not the president. Putin, his friend, would have eaten it for lunch by now.-Trump: -Putin would be sitting in Moscow right now and would be much happier than he is now, but he has nuclear weapons and may eventually he will use it.

Host question from Harris: -You said that Israel has the right to defend itself. But thousands of Palestinians have already died. And they still have 100 hostages. How would you resolve this issue?-Harris: -On October 7, Hamas killed and raped Israeli civilians, so Israel must defend itself. But at the same time, many Palestinian civilians died - both children and mothers. So all we want is peace. We need to look for a solution for the coexistence of the two countries, so that Israel feels safe and the Palestinians have self-determination.- Trump: -If I were president, this would never have happened. And Putin would not have attacked Ukraine either. And Harris hates Israel, if she becomes president, then there will be no Israel in 2 years. Iran did not have money for Hamas and Hezbollah under my rule, but they lifted sanctions on them and now they have money. Look what is happening, and I will solve everything, including ending the war between Russia and Ukraine.-Harris: -This is an absolute lie, I have always supported Israel, so he is lying.
