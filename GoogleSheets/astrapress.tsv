According to them, they are now in the basement of one of the buildings in Toretsk. They claim that they were sent to a one-way meat assault, and they want to get to the evacuation point and survive.Oleg Guivik was born in the village of Krasnoye, Artemovsky district. In 2014, he joined the militia because he -had the idea of ​​reuniting Donbass with Russia.- However, Oleg says, after 2022 his views changed significantly.-At first everything was fine, but then incomprehensible meat assaults began, when the guys began to simply be destroyed. And at one fine moment last year I quarreled with the chief of staff. They disagreed on the use of personnel. As a result, I was sent from headquarters as the commander of a regular motorized rifle platoon, where I served for three months. Soon I was sent to an area unknown to me to participate in assault operations. The main firepower was taken away from me, and since I did not know the terrain, they simply began to destroy me. I asked to leave, at least to regroup. But the authorities said: even if you die, take this landing. I refused to further participate in this event and said that without intelligence and support I would not let the guys go further to their death. I was called to headquarters, I was beaten by the commander of the third motorized rifle battalion. They forced me to write an explanation convenient for them and after that they sent me to a pit,- Oleg recalls.Oleg sat in a pit in Yenakievo for a week. He doesn’t know where exactly it was, he only remembers that there was a train station nearby. -I was there for seven days in dampness, in complete darkness. I was injured. I asked those who were guarding me to provide me with medical assistance. I demanded that an investigator be brought to me and told what I was accused of. To all this they either responded indifferently or simply chuckled. One day I couldn't stand it. I see that this is not a military commandant’s office, not a military police, because everything is civilian. I'm just in a place I don't understand. Who it is, what it is is unknown. Knowing the reputation of the command staff of my battalion, I had the feeling that I was simply brought to some criminal elements. And I ran away without feeling any criminal responsibility,- says Oleg. Oleg returned home and lived there for five months. Soon a criminal case was opened against him for leaving his unit without permission. Until the end of the trial, he was to be removed from participation in hostilities. However, on October 1, he was again sent to the front line.-Anyone who survives from this meat grinder can confirm my words, but, of course, he will not be allowed to leave, because that’s how it works. You come here and die so as not to tell later what happened. Many people don't know what's going on here. Two of us are led in the middle of the night in an unknown direction, purely on the radio station’s prompts. They take you to some building and say, come in. And there they are met by Ukrainian soldiers with fire and destroyed. If the first deuce does not succeed, the next deuce goes and the same fate awaits it. And it doesn’t matter whether you are wounded or not. There was a case when a deuce was walking and they came under artillery fire. One of the guys had his leg blown off and was unable to continue moving. His partner received a command to reset him, that is, kill him, and continue moving on his own,- Oleg recalls.The last mission Oleg went on was the same as the previous ones - -They just stupidly directed the drone and the radio station.- -Right-left, right-left. If you don’t want to go, they throw a grenade at you from above in order to speed you up,- says Oleg.🌱 Subscribe to ASTRA.

In the audio recording published by ASTRA, a person is probably being electrocuted using an army telephone ASTRA told about this one of the military men who served under the leadership of -Cap- - Alexei Korchagin, commander of the 1st MSB of the 123rd brigade of military unit 40463. He recognized his voice from the audio recording. According to him, Korchagin is -a real sadist.- It is he who commands the assault units in the 123rd Brigade.-Maybe he is the best at forcing [to go on the attack]. But Tashkent [deceased brigade commander Denis Ivanov] trusted him; Kashtan [the current brigade leader] trusts him. He himself became a commander after the death of Tashkent, he said. — The direction was very difficult and a lot of people died. More than one thousand were laid on the railway. Those were led by Cap himself, although all 4 battalions participated.- The interlocutor assumes that on the recording - electric shock torture. Moreover, the unknown man, according to him, is being tortured with a military telephone, or -tapik- in military jargon. With the help of it, particularly important information is transmitted at the front.-Two wires are connected to a person and the handle is turned, at this moment the victim receives a current of 110 volts.- The security forces tortured in the same way detained terrorists in Crocus (pictured). Previously ASTRA wrote that the relatives of one of the missing servicemen from Lugansk unit 40463 received personal belongings of the missing person and found an audio recording of the beatings and torture. Along with the audio on the phone, the relatives claim that they found a correspondence on Telegram in which the man who is screaming in the video writes that he is -with Cap and Gold- and that the interlocutor -shouldn’t dare write to him- because he is being tortured with electric shock. He also sent a video message and showed that he had blood on his head. Before this, ASTRA talked about those who disappeared without a trace in Lugansk part 40463, before he had time to arrive there. Loved ones of missing soldiers said that military personnel are disappearing en masse just a few days after their arrival. Among those listed there were prisoners from Volgograd colonies. According to relatives, out of 108 prisoners, 102 are missing. The relatives of the missing are not given any information, and the majority of those who applied did not even have notices that their relatives were missing. At the same time, some women claim that their husbands and sons were sent to unit 40463 either illegally or as -punishment.- For most women, nameless representatives of the unit, hiding under Telegram nicknames, answer that their loved ones stopped communicating after the drone attack. One of the relatives, when asked how the man disappeared, was told that he might-stayed to drink tea in a nearby dugout,- and when asked to evacuate, they even answered that she could pull him out on her own fighter.🌱 Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty CryptoBuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/68185	2024-11-10T03:50:11-08:00

The representative of the Kursk region administration for internal policy, Anatoly Drogan, came out to them. He invited the refugees to disperse from the square and go to the public reception area to draw up a collective appeal, but they refused. -We don’t care where we freeze. It’s freezing outside, what difference does it make to us, we’re not at home anyway,- said one of the refugees.After that, Drogan accused them of organizing a -public illegal action.- -You are being pushed into illegal actions. We live with you in the regime of WHO, unfortunately, this does not depend on the authorities. The authorities did not push any of the enemies to the border, this is war. […] This is not controlled by the authorities, there was a breakthrough, the troops who stood there died. Believe me, the culprits have already been detained. If it makes you feel better, the military who allowed [the breakthrough], if they remained alive, they will be punished,- Drogan said.To this, those gathered shouted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were standing on the border at the time of the invasion conscripts with machine guns, and it is not them who should be punished, but the -generals-. They also demanded that the authorities admit that there is a war going on. Drogan was asked why he, and not the head of the Sudzhansky district, Alexander Bogachev, came to them. -Do you want to communicate with us or yell?

This happened in the Kursk region. Yesterday, the head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Andrey Kovalenko, announced this. According to him... The DPRK military has been sent not only to the Kursk region, but also to the Belgorod region The Washington Post writes about this with reference to the commander of the Ukrainian battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd brigade of Yuri Fedorenko. He learned of the North Koreans' arrival in the Belgorod region while analyzing intelligence data, including intercepted communications.It is alleged that North Korean soldiers will be sent to the second line of defense to free up more manpower for the offensive in northeastern Ukraine. According to American intelligence, there are already about 10 thousand military personnel of the DPRK army in the Kursk region, and a South Korean official previously reported ,that for every North Korean soldier sent to Russia, Pyongyang can receive about $2,000. Thus, North Korea's income from sending 10,000 troops could be more than $200 million a year.	https://t.me/astrapress/68152	2024-11-09T11:55:17-08:00

🎬 A military man escaped from the war and spoke about executions...	A military man escaped from the war and spoke about executions and detachments in his regiment. After the video was published, he was detained and sent backAt the end of October, a message from a soldier with the call sign -Sailor- appeared on Telegram channels, who spoke about the -zeros- in the 19th regiment (military unit 12322 ). According to him, the regiment commander with the call sign -Pioneer- ordered the killing of six of his colleagues - -Elvis-, -Proka-, -Maly-, -Dolomite-, -Gorilla-, -Masyanya- and -Hummer- -- because they refused to go on a combat mission. The execution was carried out by military men with the call signs -Fenich-, -Skazka- and -Nickel-. ASTRA found out that the person in the video is 39-year-old Vitaly Degtyarenko. After the publication of the video, he was detained in Omsk by military police. Footage of the arrest also appeared on TV channels. One of the employees, Stanislav Dubrovin, told ASTRA that Degtyarenko had already been brought to military unit 12322 in Kremennaya (Lugansk region). When asked why the man did not get in touch, he replied that only officers were given telephones, and in general there was supposedly no communication there. According to one of the soldiers from the 19th regiment, Dubrovin and his comrade belong to the so-called -search group- of the regiment, which catch those who left the unit without permission. Two servicemen who also left the combat zone, on condition of anonymity, confirmed to ASTRA information about executions and barrage detachments in the 19th regiment. One of them personally knew all those killed. They claim that the commander of the Pioneer regiment is according to some sources, Lieutenant Colonel Evgeniy Ladnov from Yuzhnouralsk - not only exhibited barrier detachments, but also personally shot at the feet of those who refused to go on the mission. According to them, he sent back the wounded and shell-shocked who returned from a mission with the Urals. Those who refused were opened fire with a machine gun. The worst thing was for the -refuseniks- and those who drank. Those -Pioneer- sent to pull bodies from the battlefield without armor, helmets and machine guns. In winter, this category of military, by order of the military, was put naked in a pit and doused with cold water, after which many suffered frostbite and pneumonia. One of the interlocutors told ASTRA that the -Nickel- fighter mentioned in the video -personally led him under a machine gun, put the machine gun on his chest and asked the question: -Are you ready to die now?-. The man claims that at least 10 people escaped from his company alone. -And a lot of people are running away from the regiment, because we were simply sent to meat. And the regiment commander himself said: -You won’t live long,- he said. The soldier escaped after being wounded for the second time - while he and his colleagues were being led to a mission under machine guns. They had to flee through the forest. Once in Russia, he learned from a friend that he had been transferred to an assault company and -they wanted to reset him- because he was a witness to executions and blocking detachments. At the same time, according to interlocutors, after complaints from relatives, the regiment was repeatedly inspected, during which the -Pioneer- disappeared on a combat mission and appeared only after the inspectors had left. The commander’s subordinates are -afraid to open their mouths- because they know what consequences await them, the military says.🌱 Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/68136	2024-11-09T05:20:27-08:00

They dug trenches and dugouts on the front line,- a convict convicted of the high-profile murder of a schoolgirl returned to Chelyabinsk from the war17-year-old Lena Patrusheva disappeared on Friday, November 7, 2014, during school holidays. That day the girl was going to go to a nightclub with her friends.The court found her boyfriend, 19-year-old Kirill Plankov, guilty of murder. He himself confessed everything to the police after security forces found traces of the victim’s blood on his clothes. However, Plankov hid the murder and his involvement in it until the last moment. This is what he wrote on his VK page the day before giving his confession:-Today is your date, 5 months. On June 15, we started dating. We have experienced a lot, many problems, problems, quarrels. And we always came to something. There are, of course, more good moments. I love you very much and believe that you are reading this. Please come home, I’m really waiting for you.- Plankov killed Patrusheva together with his half-brother, the same age as Maxim Valishin. Plankov suspected the girl of cheating - and according to the girlfriends of the murdered woman, he was a hyper-controlling boyfriend and this infuriated the girl. She wanted to break up with him, but was afraid. On the day of the murder, the brothers went to the forest park for reconnaissance and chose a place suitable for the murder. They turned off their mobile phones and took the girl into the forest. They knocked him down and beat him—Plankov beat him while his brother held him. He strangled and kicked me in the head. Patrusheva’s brothers broke her iPhone and threw it away from the scene of the murder, so that the body of the murdered woman, hidden in the snow, would be more difficult to find. And after the murder, the guys arranged a discharge with alcohol and girls they knew. Plankov and his brother Valishin received 33.5 years in prison between them. Valishin continues to sit, but Plankov has already returned to Chelyabinsk, writes the local publication 74.ru.

He escaped from the war 35-year-old Sergei Zhukov is now hiding in an attic in one of the villages, he told ASTRA. -They didn’t teach me anything. I don't want to fight. I put down my weapon and just ran away,- he said. Zhukov was born in the city of Old Crimea. According to him, he has no relatives, he is an orphan. The man admitted that he had been convicted of burglary and theft in the past. He served his sentence in IK-24 in the Vladimir region and was released in February 2024. After his release, Zhukov decided to stay in the region, settling in the city of Mikhailovka, where he got a job as a laborer at a construction site. ASTRA confirmed Zhukov’s biography based on leaked databases. Zhukov signed the contract in June of this year. He claims that on June 2-3 he was drinking beer on a bench when two police officers approached him and detained him. The department began to put pressure on Sergei to sign a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry. Otherwise, the operatives threatened to -find drugs on him- and close him down for 10-15 years. -You’re an orphan, you have no one. We will bury you, and the rest of the money will go to our needs... Naturally, I refused. They started hitting me in the ribs and back,- he told ASTRA. He only remembers that one of the policemen’s name is Sergei, he is about 40 years old. The next day, operatives brought Zhukov to the registry office, where a fictitious wife was waiting for him, who was supposed to receive money for his death. In the passport that Zhukov sent to the editor, there is indeed a stamp indicating marriage on June 4, 2024. His wife is 53-year-old Elena Podkolzina. ASTRA got through to Podkolzina. She stated that she last contacted her -husband- supposedly 2 months ago, and now he, according to eyewitnesses, is allegedly missing. When asked about how long they were together before getting married, Elena did not immediately answer. After thinking, she said: -For a long time.- During the conversation, the woman ate, laughed and asked why she was being asked these questions. When asked what she plans to do next, Podkolzina said: -Wait. Maybe it will appear, maybe not.- At the same time, the woman confirmed that Zhukov signed the contract under pressure. According to her, he -got into a fight,- and then the security forces offered him to sign a contract with the Russian Armed Forces. The money for working in the RF Armed Forces was stolen from Zhukov right away. -When I signed the contract, I received a payment, the governor’s or some kind, I don’t know... Three hundred thousand. From them I saw only about 20 thousand, maybe that’s all, no more. And they simply took everything else for themselves,- says the man. After escaping, Zhukov stopped in a certain village, he doesn’t know which one, and is now hiding in the attic. -I say it again, I don’t want to fight. And I can’t even do it. It's just going to certain death. Do you understand? So much time, damn it. Hungry, cold. They don't even feed. And they send them to positions. There is no food, nothing at all. It’s good that it rained, at least I drank some rainwater... Here.

He is not released from service even despite his hand rotting after a fight with a colleagueRecently, a video message from Lugansk resident Svetlana Salem about her husband, Egyptian citizen Salem Salem Mohamed Ali, appeared online. At the end of 2022, Salem signed an annual contract with the 2nd brigade of the so-called -LPR People’s Militia- (now the 123rd brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, military unit 40463), which, after Putin’s decree, became indefinite. -Commanders and other soldiers treated him with disdain. They called me a black man, a gypsy, a suicide bomber. Perhaps they beat me, but he didn’t tell me about it, but he told his friends from the Arab diaspora about it. When he was injured in service, the command decided to hide this fact, since the circumstances under which the injury occurred were an attack by a drunken colleague armed with a knife in the back of a truck. Dodging the blow, he fell off the side and hit his head. When he was brought to his senses, he realized that his arm was broken. In the hospital, after assistance was provided, a refusal of hospitalization was issued and he was taken to the first line. Only after 2.5 months I was able to get him sent for osteosynthesis surgery,- Svetlana Salem says in the video.According to her, her husband does not speak Russian at all. He signed the contract without a translator. Salem decided not to return to the unit from leave for surgery. After that, Svetlana says in the video,-Representatives of the unit set up surveillance on me and conducted an illegal search in the apartment. After Salem was discovered, he was taken away as a criminal, handcuffed at gunpoint. Then he was sent to the assault.- The story of Salem in a conversation with ASTRA was confirmed by the imam from the Lugansk Cathedral Mosque Walid and the mufti of the -LPR- Muhammad Ismail. At Salem's service -They constantly called me names. They called me -black-assed,- they said, -get out of here, your place is next to the bucket,- young imam Walid told ASTRA. He is originally from Yemen - and he himself also served in the -People’s Militia- after Medical University. One day, the command of Salem called Walid to the unit to help with translation into Arabic - so he is aware of his situation. -The commander said that Salem disobeyed him. I answered him: ‘How can he disobey you if he doesn’t understand you!’- Walid told ASTRA. According to him, Salem was encouraged to sign the contract by another serving in the army, a member of the Muslim community of Lugansk (his name is known to ASTRA; he did not answer the call). The imam assumes that he did this to get a vacation: -If they signed up through you, then they give you a vacation. It was beneficial for him to invite Salem.- Mufti of the -LPR- Muhammad Ismail told ASTRA that he addressed the command of Salem: -They didn’t let him go, he was in a difficult situation, wounded, I remember that such a situation happened.- However, the command of the unit refused to release the Egyptian even after talking with the mufti. Apparently, Salem was helped by a video message from his wife. In the second video, which appeared online a week ago, Svetlana Salem says that her husband has been found - he was returned from his positions and will soon testify to the command as part of the investigation. Previously ASTRA published appeals from loved ones of other military personnel from the 123rd Brigade. Their men -like ghosts- disappeared just a few days after arriving at the location of this connection. 🌱 Subscribe to ASTRA.

Roskomnadzor -recommended- site owners to abandon Cloudflare encryption, which can be used to counter censorshipYesterday the agency began blocking sites with such encryptionAmerican company Cloudflare is one of the world's largest providers of protection against DDoS attacks. In October, Cloudflare enabled a new encryption method, Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), for all sites using their servers. Roskomnadzor did not like this - after all, ECH can be used to bypass blocking. Since yesterday, the department has been blocking all sites using ECH. And today Roskomnadzor issued a special memo in which it -recommended- website owners to abandon the unified social tax and generally switch from Cloudflare to domestic solutions for protection against DDoS attacks. Essentially, ECH allows you to hide the site that the user is visiting from the Internet provider. -An IP address can be hidden among billions of requests to a CDN. It's like hiding a tree in the forest - you never know where the user was going. Maybe to the blocked VPN Generator site, or maybe to the Gazprom sites, which are also behind Cloudflare,- - IT expert Mikhail Klimarev explained in his tg channel. According to Roskomnadzor, this technology -violates Russian legislation.- However, how actively ECH was used to bypass blocking in Russia is unknown. Two weeks earlier, the publication Meduza and Sota reported that thanks to ECH from Cloudflare, their sites are again available on the RuNet.An anonymous expert from the public organization Roskomsvoboda told ASTRA that after yesterday ECH blocking in RuNet-A lot of things became inaccessible, but then gradually everyone began to change the settings in CloudFlare.- According to the expert, ECH allows you to encrypt the Server Name Indication field, which is used by some blocking mechanisms used by Roskomnadzor. -It has long been a specification that all browsers can start encrypting this [Server Name Indication] field. The introduction of this technology is gradually taking place, but many states are against it - not only Russia - the first to block it, if I’m not mistaken, was China. The UK was very strongly opposed (this prevents them from blocking objectionable content on the issue of piracy, drugs, terrorism and extremism). In general, all governments are trying to fight this technological innovation. The simplest way is to block all traffic that encrypts this field in the packet. I think that in Russia everyone will slowly abandon this story, as they did in China,- a representative of Roskomsvoboda told ASTRA.	https://t.me/astrapress/67986	2024-11-07T07:02:13-08:00

Meanwhile, the Russian Federation is already accused of interfering in the electoral processHow confirms ABC News with link to FBI documents, the agency arrested a certain Isaac Sissel in Michigan, who allegedly published threats on the Internet that he would carry out a mass shooting of conservative Christians if Donald Trump won the election. A man was arrested in Canton 2 days after threats of a mass shooting were published. The criminal case states that his messages about the terrorist attack were reported to the FBI by the administration of the Reddit portal. The reason was various accounts with threatening usernames, including -ShootUpTrulyRally-, -WillShootTrumpSoon-, -PlannigToShootTrump- and -PlanningToKillTrump-. Sissel told agents during questioning that Trump -was a threat...that he should have been killed and that everything would be better if Trump were dead,- his affidavit states.&nbsp; The man is also said to be a migrant who had recently lived on the University of Michigan campus and was the subject of multiple arrest warrants on charges of stalking, harassment and offensive communications. ABC also reported that anonymous bomb threats had been reported at several polling stations, including in the swing state of Georgia. The FBI said that most of these threats come from -Russian mailing addresses.--At this time, none of the threats have been determined to be credible,- reported to the FBI. Right now, the US is holding presidential elections, in which the main confrontation is between former President Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Vice President Kamala Harris from the Democratic wing. Polls show that neither candidate has a clear advantage, so the election will be decided in so-called swing states that do not have a traditional allegiance to one of the two major parties.	https://t.me/astrapress/67827	2024-11-05T11:54:27-08:00

Consolidating the demilitarization zone- - Ukraine responded to Russian peace conditions Advisor to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak commented on the peace plan of the Russian Foreign Ministry and put forward... The very first draft of the peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine has been published. According to it, Ukraine was supposed to recognize Crimea as Russia, but later the position of the Russian Federation changedResearch project -System- (RFE/RL)&nbsp;published&nbsp;the earliest known project peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine. On March 7, for the third round of negotiations, the same peace treaty in its original form was drawn up. The document was provided to the publication by a Ukrainian source, and a Russian source confirmed its authenticity. Under the terms of the original agreement:- Ukraine must -recognize the independence- of the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk republics, and also recognize Crimea and Sevastopol as an -integral part of Russia.-- Ukraine must take bear the costs of restoring the infrastructure of Donbass, destroyed since 2014;- Ukraine must reduce the size of the army to 50,000 people, which is 5 times less than by February 24, 2022; - Ukraine is prohibited from entering into any military alliances and concluding any military agreements with other states;- Ukraine is prohibited from -developing, producing, acquiring and deploying on its territory missile weapons of any type with a firing range of more than 250 km-;- All sanctions against Russia since 2014, including Western and Ukrainian ones, must be lifted;- Russian should become one of the state languages ​​in Ukraine;- Must be canceled and no longer -any bans on symbols associated in states with the victory over Nazism- are introduced.&nbsp;That is, Soviet symbols must be allowed;- Ukraine must stop procedures for accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;In response, the Russian side promised a -ceasefire regime- and certain -measures-, and not a withdrawal of troops.&nbsp;At the same time, Russian representatives wanted to oblige the Ukrainian troops to withdraw to permanent deployment points, and all foreign specialists from the West had to leave the country, and Russian troops, together with the forces of the National Guard, were supposed to remain in positions and monitor Ukraine’s fulfillment of -all obligations under the treaty.- At the same time, in March 2024, The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;published&nbsp;draft peace agreements between Russia and Ukraine , which was discussed after negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place at the end of March in Istanbul. The document is dated April 15, 2022 and in it Russia’s position softened.According to it, it was determined that Ukraine would have a security mechanism similar to Article 5 of NATO, for which, as expected, the guarantor countries: Great Britain, China , the Russian Federation, the USA, France, Russia, Belarus, Turkey would undertake to defend Ukraine with military forces in the event of an attack.However, this point could not be agreed upon, since the wording proposed by Ukraine meant that the signatories of the agreement would be able to Ukraine as collectively and individually. Russia insisted on only collective intervention. That is, Russia itself, as a signatory to the treaty, could, in theory, veto the decision to protect Ukraine from its own attack.The clause on territorial integrity was also changed. How writes -Currently-, Ukraine, according to the April agreement, remains within its recognized borders, including Crimea, Sevastopol and some unspecified territories that are not covered by security guarantees. The communiqué adopted in Istanbul at the end of March indicated that the status of Crimea and Sevastopol would be resolved diplomatically.However, the document published on April 15, 2022 stated that annexed Crimea would remain under Russian control without a formal renunciation of sovereignty above it from the Ukrainian side. The future of parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions that were under Russian control until February 24, 2022, was to be determined during negotiations between the presidents of the two countries. The document did not mention the status of other territories occupied by Russia According to the WSJ, negotiations continued until June 2022 and stopped at the initiative of Ukraine. Moscow previously claimed that the negotiations ended in April.	https://t.me/astrapress/67762	2024-11-04T12:01:27-08:00
