Opposition blogger Mikhail Alferov from the Kemerovo region died in the war with UkraineAbout this reportedby his friend, journalist Natalya Zubkova. According to her, he stopped communicating on December 1, and died, presumably, on December 25. -Before he died, he wrote a strange message to his mother on November 26th. It was like saying goodbye. He said that for now he could not write or call her anymore. He can, -as soon as possible.- Personally, this makes me think that Mikhail could have died not in battle, but in the so-called pit, because there is no point in going on a mission without a phone or not using it there,- she wrote. How SOTA found out that Alferov went to the front in April 2024 after the Kemerovo center -E- gave him a choice: a pre-trial detention center with possible fabrication of the case about rape or a contract with the Ministry of Defense. In addition, security forces threatened him with violence during his imprisonment. Fearing prison, Alferov signed the contract. At first he was at the headquarters of military unit No. 89547 in the -DPR-, and in the summer he returned to the Kemerovo region with instructions from the command to obtain computer equipment. After returning to his unit, his situation worsened, and at the end of November he began to fear for his life. In early December he disappeared, and on January 29 his closed coffin was brought home. The circumstances of his death remain unknown.Mikhail was a political activist and the author of the YouTube channel -Alferov life-. Videos often focused on freedom of assembly in the region, corruption of local and federal officials, and the work of security forces. He was repeatedly persecuted in administrative and criminal cases. Criminal cases were brought against him under articles of inciting hatred or enmity (Part 1 of Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), slander (Part 1 of Article 298.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) and the use of violence against a representative of the authorities (Part 1 of Article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ).Mikhail still has a disabled mother in Kemerovo.	https://t.me/astrapress/73624	2025-02-01T03:35:19-08:00

The lawyer under the legend infiltrated the human rights community and obtained information about persecuted Russiansconfirm -Important Stories-33-year-old lawyer and human rights activist Maria Chashilova, who previously collaborated with OVD-Info, the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives (MCC) and other human rights projects, infiltrated on Wednesday human rights activists, using a fake diploma, edited entries in the work book and a fictitious biography, according to which she allegedly was a police officer and works as a lawyer, the publication writes. -For more than six years, Chashchilova worked in Russian human rights organizations, where she gained access to information that poses a threat to people persecuted by the Russian authorities: those who work anonymously in -undesirable- organizations, lawyers defending Russian political prisoners and Ukrainian prisoners of war, LGBT activists declared extremists in Russia,- writes -Important Stories- journalist Irina Dolinina.As journalists found out, Chashilova used a fake RANEPA diploma, which is not listed in the official register of Rosobrnadzor, and edited entries in the work book. Information about the girl’s lawyer status was also not found in the state register of lawyers of the Russian Federation. In addition, she previously indicated in her resume that she served with the rank of police lieutenant in the Ministry of Internal Affairs from 2012 to 2015. In an interview with Important Stories, she began to deny this fact. Chaschilova organized a human rights conference in Berlin in April 2023, after which two participants complained of symptoms of poisoning. At the same time, Chashchilova herself did not come to the conference, citing the fact that she was going on a business trip to Ukraine. In fact, she never left, stating that she -really wanted to enter [Ukraine], but didn’t- due to visa problems. She was also interested in the sources of publications of -Important Publications-, the structure of the editorial office and the publication’s employees in the Russian Federation, and also asked for the address of journalist Irina Dolinina in the Czech Republic in order to supposedly send a gift. The gift did not arrive, but threats to the editorial office began to be sent to the specified address. In addition, the publication notes that Chashchilova’s uncle is Interior Ministry Colonel Vladimir Pershin, a key witness in the case of Khabarovsk Governor Sergei Furgal, and Chashchilova’s cousin is a former FSB employee.Maria was fired from - OVD-Info- in December 2024. She herself called the reason for her dismissal -rumors- spread by -Important Stories- and rejected the accusations. -We didn’t fire her because of your investigation, but its preparation, which we knew about, became a reason to take a closer look at her. We discovered several situations of deception and failure to provide important information about oneself. And we realized that we cannot vouch for what Masha tells us or our partners about herself, and it’s impossible to work like that,- said OVD-Info director Alexander Polivanov to Important Stories. Now she works in the Conscientious Objector Movement (DSO). They stated that they -conducted a security check, which did not reveal any grounds for mistrust- in Chashilova. There is also no evidence that Chashilova worked for Russian security forces or provided them with any information.	https://t.me/astrapress/73589	2025-01-31T11:44:26-08:00

In one of the temporary accommodation centers in the Kursk region, refugees will no longer be fedFrom February 1, the provision of food to evacuees from the Kursk region will stop at the Olympiets temporary accommodation center, said public activist Vitaly Moiseev.

This information was confirmed to Moiseev by the TAP administration.-We don’t have electric stoves, only a few, and food for cooking too. And if many people buy electric stoves and cook, then there will be an overload of the electrical networks, a short circuit. There could be a fire, because we don’t know what condition the wiring is in? And in general, where to cook everything in each family’s rooms? You also need to stock up on vegetables, potatoes, etc. Where should you store them? The question arises: -Well, what should we do next?- wrote Moiseev.He also noted that, according to rumors, in three days -evictions or resettlement will begin- from the TAP. On January 21, residents of the Glushkovsky district who left their homes due to the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, gatheredat the government building in Kursk.

Russian billionaire Suleiman Kerimov owned a stake in SpaceX even after US sanctions - BloombergMember of the Federation Council from Dagestan, billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, through a trust, owned at least 1% of the shares of SpaceX Elon Musk, despite the sanctions imposed against him by the United States of America. About this reportsthe American edition of Bloomberg with reference to its sources.According to the agency, Kerimov acquired a stake in SpaceX back in 2017, and the asset was managed by Heritage Trust, registered in the US state of Delaware. In 2018, the United States imposed sanctions against the Dagestani billionaire, accusing him of close ties with the Russian authorities and personally with Vladimir Putin.

Only in the summer of 2022 the trust was blocked, but by that time, according to Bloomberg, there were no more SpaceX assets in it.How notes The Moscow Times, the share that Kerimov ultimately lost could have been worth about $3.5 billion - more than a third of the senator's current wealth. Forbes in 2024 estimated his capital at $9.3 billion.Sanctions against Kerimov were imposed not only by the United States, but also European Union. In 2022, after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, American authorities expanded restrictions against the billionaire. In addition to blocking his assets, Kerimov was also banned from entering the United States, and financial institutions were instructed not to conduct any transactions with him.Suleiman Kerimov is one of the most influential Russian entrepreneurs. He represented Dagestan in the Federation Council for many years and owns significant assets in various sectors of the economy, including gold mining.

The court also ordered the owners of the holding, Dmitry Kamenshchik and Valery Kogan, to ensure the safety of all movable and immovable property of the companies in the Domodedovo perimeter and at the same time prohibited them from giving instructions on its alienation or leaving it outside Russian jurisdiction, as well as on stopping the activities of the companies.As they write. -Vedomosti-, the Prosecutor General's Office believes that the group of companies at Domodedovo Airport was under the control of -residents of foreign states- - Dmitry Kamenshchik (Turkey, UAE) and Valery Kogan (Israel).The lawsuit states that Kamenshchik and Kogan should have gained control over the Russian strategic asset only if there was a decision from a government commission (they allegedly did not apply for it).

The authorities want to nationalize Domodedovo Airport The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation filed a lawsuit with the Arbitration Court of the Moscow Region demanding that 100% of the shares of DME Holding LLC, which owns the airport, be transferred to the state. The lawsuit is directed to 32 airport structures, its owner Dmitry Kamenshchik and chairman of the supervisory board Valery Kogan. As Vedomosti writes, the Prosecutor General's Office believes that the group of companies at Domodedovo Airport was under the control of -residents of foreign states- - Dmitry Kamenshchik (Turkey, UAE) and Valery Kogan (Israel ). The lawsuit states that Kamenshchik and Kogan were supposed to gain control over the Russian strategic asset only if there was a decision from a government commission (they allegedly did not apply for it). The possibility of nationalizing the airport was already discussed after the terrorist attack at Domodedovo in 2011. In 2015, a criminal case was opened against Kamenshchik under the article on the provision of services that do not meet safety requirements, resulting in the death of two or more people.

During this time, the cost of work has quadrupledComplete construction of one of the largest infectious diseases hospitals in Siberia in the village of Sadovy, Novosibirsk region, were supposed to open in 2022, but it only started accepting patients now, said Regional Minister of Health Rostislav Zablotsky. Agreement on the construction of an infectious diseases hospital between former Minister of Health of the Novosibirsk Region Konstantin Khalzov and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the K1 holding Dmitry Kolosov signed on September 29, 2021 at the VIII Infrastructure Congress -Russian PPP Week-. Construction work began in 2022, when the cost of the facility was estimated at 4.6 billion rubles. Initially, the commissioning of the facility was planned for the end of 2022. In the summer of 2022, at an off-site meeting at a construction site, First Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Alexander Zhukov noted that, -despite the sanctions and the difficult economic situation, solutions have been found to complete construction on time.- But in the end, the launch date was moved to the third quarter of 2023, and the price of the facility increased fourfold - to 16 billion.In August 2023, the Ministry of Health of the Novosibirsk Region succeeded admission of guilt of the private partner -Development Projects 2-, part of the K1 holding, in delaying the construction of the facility. The company will pay a penalty of 990 thousand rubles, the arbitration court decision stated. At the same time, the initial amount of the claim was 48.041 million.According to the case materials, the private partner was responsible, among other things, for the development of project documentation for the task agreed upon by the Novosibirsk Ministry of Health, as well as for the positive conclusion of the state examination on it. No more than 50 days were allotted for this from the moment the land lease agreements were signed. According to the calculations of the Ministry of Health presented in court, the delay was 198 days. At the same time, while demanding a penalty, the ministry did not take into account the time it took to adjust the assignment for the project, which had been agreed upon for a long time and then finalized by the officials themselves.At the same time, the press service of the regional government at the same time stated that the work had reached the finish line.In November 2023, Governor Alexander Travnikov saidthat the hospital will open after the New Year - due to unfinished storm drains, and in the beginning of December 2023, the opening of the hospital assigned to December 31 - due to the restructuring of the gas network. Nevertheless, it took another six months, and for the last six months the contractor has been trying to obtain all permits to put the building into operation, although should have received them back in June. In total, the Ministry of Health reported, to the budget of the Novosibirsk region received five million rubles in penalties for non-compliance deadlines.💥 ASTRA is important for the continuation of its work even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers:PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/73301	2025-01-27T03:57:13-08:00

The reason for the suspension of the case was that the man decided to sign a contract and go to war in Ukraine, writes&nbsp;56.RU.-In accordance with paragraph 5 of part 1 of Article 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, the court issues a resolution to suspend criminal proceedings if the accused is called up for military service during the period of mobilization or in wartime in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or if he concludes a contract during the period of mobilization, during martial law or in wartime military service in the RF Armed Forces, as well as military service in the RF Armed Forces during the period of mobilization, during martial law or in wartime,- the Leninsky City Court said in a statement.

The child was supposed to be sold for 1.5&nbsp;million rubles.&nbsp; Previously, the man was repeatedly convicted of theft and robbery. The child's mother Elena is now in prison - she has even more criminal records.☮️ Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/73154	2025-01-24T08:56:47-08:00

The head of the 6th commandant's office of Donetsk tortured the illegally mobilized father of 4 children, Alexander Barlet, said victim. After complaints about torture, they tried to kill the hero of ASTRA publicationsFather of 4 children Alexander Barlet, illegally mobilized (after voluntary service), past torture cellar and survivor attempt on December 30 in Donetsk, told ASTRA who participated in the torture and attempted murder. After receiving severe injuries, having lost a kidney and regaining consciousness, Barlet told ASTRA that he was beaten in the sixth commandant’s office of military unit 53435 (former military unit 08826) in Donetsk by the head of the department, Lieutenant Colonel Andrey Redko (call sign -David-). -Personally, he beat Redko in his office, tried to tear up my Russian Federation passport, shouted that I was unworthy to be a citizen of the Russian Federation, and cut my hand with a knife,- Barlet told ASTRA. Human rights activist Maxim Davydov told ASTRA that Redko served in the same military unit as Barlet (42600, former 08826), where Igor Puzik (call sign -Evil-) also worked, who in 2024 year sent soldiers of the DPR long-range reconnaissance regiment on an assault, where they died. Davydov claims that on the day of the attempted murder of Barlet, two people from the 110th brigade (formerly the 100th brigade) of the military unit of Barlet and 4 people from the rapid reaction group of the 6th commandant’s office of Redko came for him, who opened fire on the man. Davydov says they tried to kill Barlet because he was the victim of a fraudulent scheme - As ASTRA previously wrote, in December it turned out that the man was still assigned to his old military unit 42600, although he no longer served there and was released on leave due to injury. It turned out that at the same time in the military unit he was included in the list of those who left the unit without permission (SOCH), but still allegedly received a salary and payments for injury. However, in the personal account of the Russian Ministry of Defense, unknown details of a bank account were noted, which belongs neither to Barlet nor his family - none of them received the money. When this information was revealed, the military unit tried to cover their tracks by capturing or killing the main witness. -The commanders of the military unit falsified documents that he [Barlet] was still serving, and issued some kind of bank card through which he allegedly received payments, and I think for his injury. And when he began to figure out why he was in the SOC and hired a lawyer, it turned out that Barlet was still listed in the unit as receiving money and fighting. And here all the military investigators are in one gang, along with war criminals from military units, and they simply decided to resolve the matter quietly - to remove the main witness. So they arrived and started shooting. They had the task of taking him at any cost, either alive or dead. I think that even if they had taken him alive, he would not have lasted long at the front,- Davydov tells ASTRA. After Barlet's escape, military unit employees were able to find him and his father at the man's property thanks to bribery of neighbors - Davydov claims that the military paid 10,000 rubles so that Barlet's neighbors would inform him when he would appear at home. This is what happened on the day of the assassination attempt, the human rights activist believes.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Andrei Redko, being a Kramatorsk police operative, was kidnapped by pro-Russian forces, but was later released, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry reported. At the same time, Redko is listed in list of -traitors to Ukraine,- like almost all employees of the 6th commandant’s office of Donetsk. Redko did not answer ASTRA's call. Now Barlet’s family is receiving threats, Donetsk channel -Mobilization of the DPR- is raising funds for a male lawyer.Supporting ASTRA, you are contributing to freedom of speech: Patreon Boosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/73142	2025-01-24T04:58:22-08:00
