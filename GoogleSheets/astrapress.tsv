Hoping for luck, we bypass all barriers, We saved our lives and are happy about it.- Previously Trutnev and Ostrovsky they told how the deputy commander of the 109th regiment with the call sign -Caspian- (named Umakhan) after one of the assaults lined up 15 people who survived and returned from the mission, announced to them that the survival rate of prisoners supposedly should not exceed 2%, and locked them in a pit, where three subsequently died.
