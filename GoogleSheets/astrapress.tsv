Providers complained to Roskomnadzor to the FAS due to the uneven slowdown of YouTube and noted that the agency does not have the right to independently restrict access to information Rosteleset Association, which unites more than 200 regional telecom operators, demands to initiate proceedings on grounds of violation of the Law -On Protection of Competition- due to the creation of -discriminatory conditions for telecom operators by unevenly slowing down the operation of the YouTube video platform, the Google search engine and its services-, writesRBC. Over the past few weeks, operators have noticed a -strong and uneven- slowdown in the work of YouTube, Google and its services, -which has provoked a multiple increase in the number of user complaints to providers.- It is the uneven decline in quality, according to Rosteleset, that -violates the rules of the -free market-. The complaint notes that operators are -massively losing their subscriber base,- and subscribers are increasingly switching to the services of cellular operators -only because of the quality of the YouTube Internet resources.--...telecom operators believe that that the slowdown of YouTube is due to external influence using the -slowdown- method, which could only be carried out through TSPU, which are under the jurisdiction of the Main Radio Frequency Center. Since the legislation does not provide for such a measure of influence on Internet resources as -slowing down- in the current regulations, the resource itself, like the youtube domain name. com, at the beginning of August is not included in the list of prohibited or restricted access, authorized bodies and courts did not make a decision to restrict access to the platform, GRCHTS and Roskomnadzor do not have the right, on their own initiative, to take actions to restrict access to information-,&nbsp;- Rosteleset insists.	https://t.me/astrapress/64720	2024-09-20T02:01:16-07:00

The Ministry of Defense persuaded Putin to carry out a new mobilization this year, -WSJOfficials Several months before Putin's inauguration, the Ministry of Defense tried to convince him to carry out a new mobilization, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing an interlocutor familiar with these discussions.At a meeting held at the beginning of the year, the Russian Ministry of Defense asked Putin to use the inauguration and -increasing support- among the population in order to explain the need for a new mobilization. Putin allegedly refused to do this and said that for now he would only use contract soldiers.According to Western experts, Russia is losing more soldiers on the battlefield than it manages to recruit. In addition, the operation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region forced the leadership of the Ministry of Defense to again begin insisting on mobilization. In the Kremlin, as the newspaper writes, they remember the protests that arose during the -partial mobilization- in 2022, and are afraid that a new mobilization could upset the balance in the public‚Äôs perception of the war as a distant conflict.In the State Duma, the WSJ article was called -throwing in-. -The West is trying to create some kind of panic in the brains of the citizens of the Russian Federation with such stuffing, to sow some kind of discord.

She disappeared without a trace in Kaspiysk on the territory of the FSB sanatorium after losing in a Thai boxing competition. Her father, Nikolai Tsomartov, accused the Dagestan security forces of kidnapping his daughter. Apparently, for this he was suspended from service on September 17. Nikolai Tsomartov published the corresponding extract from the order (and then deleted it) in the tg channel about the search for his daughter. Nikolai Tsomartov worked all his life in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Tsomartova was last seen on an embankment about 2 kilometers from the place where she trained in Kaspiysk. Since February 10, investigators and security forces in Dagestan have not received a single clue as to where the girl could have disappeared. Initially, the version of suicide was worked out - but it was confirmed not found. Anna's parents sure - she was kidnapped by Dagestan FSB officers. Her father Nikolai sees confirmation of the version of the girl‚Äôs abduction in the latest footage of Anna published by the FSB. In a video shot on a mobile phone, Anna is walking along the coast. It is unknown who filmed it. Nikolai believes that they were FSB officers. At the same time, the man claims, recordings from neighboring CCTV cameras never appeared in the case. Tsomartova studied at the Rostov Law Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. She wanted to become a police officer, like her father. Nikolai said that after graduating from university, his daughter wanted to go to Siberia -or to new territories- to work in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. She led a popular TikTok about her workouts with 250+ thousand subscribers. A girl similar to Anna this summer seenin a women's subway car in Dubai, but whether it was her is unknown.

Including women. To access the data, you need to know the unique user ID on Gosuslugi and make the appropriate request to the subpoena registry server. In response, the site will provide the full name, date of birth, passport numbers, SNILS, INN and other personal data of the Russian. About the vulnerability of the summons registry last night toldthe Novaya Gazeta Europe publication with reference to an anonymous IT expert. At night, the Ministry of Digital Development and Rostelecom announced the absence of vulnerabilities on the site.The website of the Unified Register of Summons went live yesterday in three regions of Russia - Mari El, Sakhalin and Ryazan regions. While the site is operating in test mode, it should be fully operational from November 1.Reestrpovestok.rf intrusively invites users to install a domestic SSL security certificate from the Ministry of Digital Development. Such certificates encrypt the connection to sites (from the user‚Äôs side it looks like this: -http- in the link is replaced by -https- - where -s- means -secure- or secure connection). Most traffic on the Internet is encrypted using https - this is how Russian providers store it at the request of the FSB. Whether Russian intelligence services can effectively decrypt such traffic is not known for certain. The Summons Registry claims that it is possible to -ensure a secure connection- with it only with the help of a domestic certificate - but this is outright manipulation. The site is already protected by an international certificate from the Belgian company GlobalSign. The security certificate of the Ministry of Digital Development allegedly has a backdoor that will allow Russian intelligence services to decrypt traffic. Not only from the electronic subpoenas website, but also from other resources. About this said an anonymous expert from the Roskomsvoboda organization in a conversation with the publication -Verstka-. -If a Ministry of Digital Development certificate is added to mobile operating systems, it is possible to -listen- to the traffic of not only browsers, but also those instant messengers that did not bother to protect against this,- said the IT expert.	https://t.me/astrapress/64628	2024-09-18T22:28:25-07:00

Putin went to Mongolia to ask shamans for permission to use nuclear weapons - Der SpiegelRussian writer and journalist, ex-editor-in-chief of Dozhd, Mikhail Zygar sharedwith the German publication Der Spiegel rumors that Putin traveled to Mongolia in early September to -meet with shamans- and ask them for -blessings to use nuclear weapons-: -There are now rumors in Moscow that Putin needs the blessing of shamans in order to use nuclear weapons. Without their approval, he could not take such a serious step, for fear of angering the spirits. And he allegedly returned from Mongolia happy. However, this version sounds like a big fantasy. None of my sources can confirm it. However, the meeting with Mongolian shamans seemed to have taken place.- Zygar also focuses on the fact that Mongolia and Tuva - two of Putin's recent trips - are considered the homeland of the most powerful shamans in the world. -Vladimir Putin has long been known for his special attitude towards mysticism. And he appears to combine his interest in orthodox mysticism with pagan traditions,- the publication said. Sergei Shoigu was the first to bring Putin into contact with shamans. As evidence of this version, the author of the article recalls the frequent joint trips of Shoigu and Putin in the early 00s, including to Tuva. Zygar also claims that before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin consulted a lot with mystics. They assured him of military victory.	https://t.me/astrapress/64375	2024-09-15T11:12:46-07:00

Khodorkovsky said that he had information about Nevzlin‚Äôs alleged involvement in the attack on VolkovFormer head of YUKOS Mikhail Khodorkovsky said that his Dossier investigation center received information about Nevzlin‚Äôs involvement in the attack on Volkov, but considered this data unreliable. -Correspondence to clarify the essence of the issue continued until July 9. During the correspondence, the Dossier Center was unable to obtain evidence that would meet the minimum expectations of reliability. The data could not be verified, and combined with the manner of presentation, this created the impression of provocation. &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; We suggested that the person who wrote to us, who, in his opinion, had such evidence, report the crime to the police. At the same time, we suggested that Leonid Nevzlin, if he has evidence, should also contact law enforcement agencies, which, as far as we know, he did on August 5, 2024. The Dossier Center already informed law enforcement agencies on July 2, 2024, about the situation (receiving dubious information about a crime, possibly being a provocation or blackmail),&nbsp;‚Äî told Khodorkovsky. September 12 FBK accused businessman Leonid Nevzlin of ordering the assassination attempt on Leonid Volkov in Vilnius. Maria Pevchikh stated that Khodorkovsky knew from June that Nevzlin organized the attack. -Either this is true and then Leonid Nevzlin has gone crazy. Either this is a FSB provocation and a fake,- - so Khodorkovsky commented on the investigation for the first time.	https://t.me/astrapress/64373	2024-09-15T10:02:22-07:00

Dissident artists prevented public utilities from restoring order - this is how the -Bulldozer Exhibition- of 1974 is described in the history textbook from Medinsky Today, September 15, marks the 50th anniversary of the -Bulldozer Exhibition- - when unofficial Soviet avant-garde artists exhibited their works in a vacant lot in the Bitsevsky Forest Park. The exhibition was dispersed by bulldozers, sprinklers, security forces and people in civilian clothes. The attackers destroyed paintings and beat artists and visitors. Subsequently, the incident was written about in foreign publications. And here is how this event is described in a new history textbook authored by Medinsky. According to the authors of the manual, who coined the phrase -contemporary art,- for protest artists, -the main measure of -success- was coverage in Western media. -They exhibited their works without approval from the city authorities at the intersection of two Moscow streets. However, utility services began to restore order using equipment, including a bulldozer. Western journalists, who found themselves in this situation -completely by accident,- presented the situation as another -violation of human rights,- says the textbook, noteRustem Adagamov.	https://t.me/astrapress/64358	2024-09-15T05:45:23-07:00

üñº -You should have been beaten with hammers more severely, to th...	-You should have been beaten with hammers more severely, until you were in a wheelchair,- FBK claims that an associate of Khodorkovsky organized the beating of Leonid VolkovIt is alleged that they wanted to take Volkov by sea to St. Petersburg and hand him over to the FSB. Navalny's FBK released investigation, according to which Leonid Nevzlin, a close associate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and former top manager of YUKOS, is the organizer of a series of attacks on Russian oppositionists abroad. Andrei Matus, who until recently worked for the structures of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, told FBK about this. It is alleged that Leonid Nevzlin instructed Matus to clean up the electronic traces of the attack on Volkov. He was entrusted with taking away the phones of the perpetrators of the attack, but instead of getting rid of them, he leaked data from the FBK devices (and, apparently, the propaganda TV channel Russia Today, where a week earlier the same correspondence that FBK talks about was published).Matus provided Navalny‚Äôs team with videos filmed in the first person by participants in the attacks on Zhdanov in Geneva and Mironov‚Äôs wife in Argentina, as well as correspondence in which a person recorded as Nevzlin discusses the attack on Volkov with the perpetrator. That the correspondence was real for FBK was confirmed by investigative journalists - Mikhail Maglov from the Proekt publication and Hristo Grozev, who investigated Navalny‚Äôs poisoning. According to FBK, Nevzlin is allegedly behind the attack on Navalny's associates Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, as well as attack on economist Maxim Mironov and his wife in Buenos Aires. FBK interlocutor Andrei Matus also stated that it was allegedly planned to beat Leonid Volkov -to the point of disability- or kidnap him, take him to Russia by sea and hand him over to the FSB. Perhaps the most convincing evidence that Matus showed to FBK is an audio recording in which a man with a voice similar to Nevzlin says, among other things, that he is dissatisfied with the fact that Maxim Mironov‚Äôs wife was not beaten enough. >-We call on everyone who cooperates in any capacity with the structures of Mikhail Khodorkovsky to stop doing so until the circumstances and the degree of his personal involvement and awareness of the crimes of [Leonid Nevzlin] are clarified.- , - said the FBK.	https://t.me/astrapress/64177	2024-09-12T06:45:37-07:00
