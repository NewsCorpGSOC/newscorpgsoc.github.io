According to them, for 10 years they have not received drinking water in full. Over the past two years, the situation has worsened significantly - water began to be turned off for eleven hours every day. At the same time, shutdowns occur according to a certain schedule, which was not agreed upon with local residents. -There is no water day or night, every day, including holidays and weekends,- people emphasized. Local authorities are inactive and cannot explain why such a problem has arisen: one official claims that the system is worn out, another claims that this is only a seasonal water shortage. The regional governor also does not take action, although back in 2018 a specialized commission assessed the state of the water supply system. The commission found that the pipes were 100% worn out. -We cannot cook properly, swim, or do household chores. We have to stock up on water, but this is not enough. &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; We began to notice that our water was of poor quality: soapy, different colors, with white sediment. We are afraid to drink this water,- people say in their video message. They demand that the situation be recognized as an emergency and a new water pipeline be built for them.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

Trump's team is considering the possibility of the US withdrawing from the WHO immediately after the presidential inauguration - Financial TimesEdition writes that members of his team are divided in opinion: some propose to initiate reforms in the organization, others insist on a complete cessation of interaction. Experts warn that leaving the WHO could be -catastrophic- for global health. The United States is the organization's largest donor; in recent years, Washington has provided about 16% of its funding.Back in 2020, Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the WHO, accusing the organization of excessive dependence on China, but the process was not completed . According to Trump, the Chinese authorities and the WHO leadership did not take appropriate measures in connection with the spread of coronavirus. Biden reversed Trump's decision upon taking office as US President in 2021.	https://t.me/astrapress/70854	2024-12-22T03:01:28-08:00

According to him, the state will not be able to fully compensate for the property lost by the Kursk residents - the state -will not bear all the expenses-, since there are not enough budget funds for this, and it is expensive to wage a war with Ukraine.-In our country The SVO is still ongoing, and the SVO is highly technical, the land must be freed! But here, excuse me, every shell costs money!-said Khinshtein.At the same time, on his page on VKontakte, Khinshtein don't forget mention that the director of school No. 1, Sergei Aleksandrovich Kondoyanidi, who was present at the meeting, a deputy of the Representative Assembly of the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, took people out from under shelling.

Exceptions are outstanding figures of sports and art, as well as individual humanitarian cases.Consideration of applications for citizenship from Russians over 15 years of age is suspended for those applications that have already been submitted.The bill was criticized representatives of the Russian diaspora and human rights organizations, pointing out that the conditions put forward are virtually unenforceable, since it is impossible to renounce Russian citizenship without having citizenship of another country. Also, critics of the bill called it discriminatory and pointed out that a significant number of people live in the Czech Republic who left Russia due to disagreement with the war and the power of Vladimir Putin. Now the Russians, who signed the petition about the inadmissibility of the adoption of the bill, are preparing to file a lawsuit with the intention, if necessary, to reach the ECHR.To obtain citizenship, it was necessary to live in the country for more than 10 years and fulfill a number of conditions. Now the document will be sent for consideration to the Senate. After the document is approved there, it will be sent to the President of the Czech Republic for signature. The amendment is expected to come into force in early February 2025. It was included in the Lex Ukrajina law, which provides for the extension of the temporary protection regime for Ukrainian refugees until 2026.ASTRA spoke with a girl who applied for citizenship back in April 2023 - her application has not yet been considered It is unlikely that they will even consider it now. Svetlana Bogdanova moved to Prague from Murmansk and works as a veterinarian.-It‚Äôs sad, of course, because you seem to live in the country, pay taxes, the country lives on these taxes, and then it just considers you a second person varieties and says: -No, you are not worthy to be a citizen of the Czech Republic.- It turns out that in a European country the same thing is happening as in Russia, that is, you can basically do whatever you want, and nothing will happen to you for it,- says Svetlana.She noted that she did not know what to do now. Among the options she is considering is moving to another country.	https://t.me/astrapress/70524	2024-12-18T06:45:20-08:00

Communications operators will be required to transfer data about users who access sites blocked in the Russian Federation, including through VPNThis measure will supposedly prevent access to information that is being disseminated limited on the territory of Russia, and to protect citizens from possible harm, says the documents attached to the draft order published by Roskomnadzor.The RKN must begin receiving information from telecom operators within three months from the date entry into force of the order, the document says. The explanatory note clarifies that operators will be able to fulfill this requirement using technical means of countering threats, which operators are required to install on networks from 2019.In addition, within 15 days from the date of commencement of the provision of services for providing access to network operators will be required to provide authorities with information about customers' communications equipment and user equipment. These are network addresses, place of residence, numbers of hardware and IP.The document does not directly name possible ways to bypass blocking, but, most likely, we are talking about IP address spoofing services, VPN or the Tor browser.	https://t.me/astrapress/70516	2024-12-18T05:10:01-08:00

At least 10 conscripts from the Chebarkul military units of the 90th Guards Tank Division received transfers for allegedly signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense. In the division to the local‚Ä¶ Parents of conscripts from Chelyabinsk demand that Putin figure out why their children sign the contract,having barely entered the military unitRelatives of conscripts serving in the Chebarkul garrison No. 93992, write mass appeals to the direct line with Putin, which will take place on December 19. They are concerned that in military units, conscripts en masse sign contracts in the very first days of service.Parents of conscripts are convinced: their children sign contracts under psychological pressure, and reports on the revocation of the document remain unheeded. In addition to the direct line, families turn to military prosecutors at various levels, human rights ombudsmen, courts and other authorities. So far, to no avail: nothing is known about examples of contract termination in Chebarkul.The initiators of the appeal say that conscripts are being encouraged to sign a contract on the way to the unit. Most recruits do not give in to persuasion, but they continue to be intensively convinced once in the military unit. In particular, threats to send them to the Belgorod or Kursk regions, from where the soldiers -will return with a load of 200.- If the serviceman continues to persist, he is offered to sign a -document- in order to remain in the Chebarkul units (in the military police, in the medical battalion, as drivers).The parents do not have the original or copies of the signed documents, but they believe that the fact of imprisonment military contract is confirmed by large amounts from 400 thousand to 2&nbsp;million rubles received in the bank accounts of their children. From the name of these payments it is clear that we are talking about one-time payments for imprisonment agreement with the Ministry of Defense. Amounts vary as the conclusion passes through different regions. Officially transfer of money explained by a technical failure.The 90th Guards Tank is based in Chebarkul division. In 2022, its fighters took part in the attack on Kyiv, where parts of the division were ambushed, suffered heavy losses and took refuge in Bogdanovka, Brovary district. Previously, Astra journalists talked about the massacres and rapes committed by the division‚Äôs soldiers in Bogdanovka that period.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.
