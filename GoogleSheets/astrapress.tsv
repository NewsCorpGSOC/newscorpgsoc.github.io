Russian saboteurs damaged Bundeswehr warships and tried to penetrate the bases, - Vice Admiral KaackBy words German Vice Admiral Jan Christian Kaack, in January, saboteurs damaged -more than one piece of equipment- of the Bundeswehr and attempted to infiltrate military bases. He warned that the threat from Russia was more pressing in early 2025 than it was two years ago.Navy inspector Vice Admiral Jan Christian Kaack said in Berlin that several cases of targeted sabotage had been recorded on German warships. For example, in January, during an inspection, it was discovered that several kilograms of metal shavings had been loaded onto a warship, which could have caused significant damage. A spokesman for the shipyard declined to comment on the incident.Kaak also said that in addition to sabotage on ships, cases of attempts to infiltrate naval bases were recorded. The vice admiral stressed that this was a -test- and an attempt to upset the public, as well as to set the stage for subsequent active military action.Kaak warned that the growing threat from Russia in early 2025 is a more urgent problem than two years ago, and added that experts and secret services agree that Russia could seek conflict with NATO starting in 2029. In response to the threats, he initiated a strategic expansion of existing plans, saying that necessary measures would be taken in the coming weeks.	https://t.me/astrapress/74322	2025-02-12T01:35:48-08:00

Russia may be preparing for a large-scale war with NATO‚ÄîDanish intelligence The Danish Foreign and Military Intelligence Service published report, which assesses the Russian threat to the Kingdom of Denmark. The document says that Russia is arming itself and increasing its capabilities for a potential armed confrontation with Western countries - however, this does not mean that the decision to start such a war has been made. The authors of the report believe that Russia's readiness to take more risky actions regarding NATO may increase if Russia considers the alliance weakened and disunited, or is confident that the United States will not help Europe. If the war in Ukraine ends, the Russian Federation may free up military resources and, in about six months, enter into a local conflict with one of the NATO countries. In 2 years, Russia may pose a threat to one or more states in the Baltic Sea. About five years after the end of the war with Ukraine, Russia may be ready for a full-scale war in Europe, an intelligence report says.	https://t.me/astrapress/74320	2025-02-12T01:16:34-08:00

Despite the dissuadings of Olga Arnold's mother, the man wanted to atone for his guilt with blood and help his daughter, who is now one year and 8 months old. About this case wrote tg channel -Mobilization of the DPR Live-, the information was confirmed by ASTRA. Ilya ended up in military unit 41698, 5th brigade of the 3rd motorized rifle battalion, company -B-. On a combat mission in September, he was wounded in both legs: a through wound to the left leg, shrapnel, and fractures; right leg - patella, tendon, damaged main nerve, fragments, fracture. The man was sent to the 14th hospital in Donetsk, and then taken to a medical facility in Dokuchaevsk. There, Ilya was put in a basement, beaten and forced to transfer money to commanders. -On October 13, medic Maxim takes him to Dokuchaevsk. There they threatened to knock out his teeth with a hammer, they kept him in handcuffs, it was terrible. Unoperated, he was taken to the hospital because a complication had developed, but they only sutured his soft tissues - nothing more,- the soldier‚Äôs mother, Olga Arnold, told ASTRA.From the hospital, the man was again taken to the basement of the medical unit, where his condition worsened again and he was sent to the 15th hospital in Donetsk for rehabilitation. After this, Ilya is transferred to Kurakhovo, put in a pit, and then sent on a combat mission to the village. Gluboky (30 km from Donetsk). Arnold's mother says that the commander he came across saw Ilya's condition and canceled his participation in the assault. Medics arrived at the scene and took the wounded man to the village of Peski, where Ilya ended up in a basement in which there were 15 other wounded people. Arnold's mother claims that in this place the medic Maxim from the medical unit collects the wounded, including those who walk on crutches, and again sends them to the assaults. From this basement on February 8, the man managed to record video messages for his mother. -All the wounded here walk on crutches, here everyone is sent to the front line. Yesterday they brought the boys, they can‚Äôt walk - they‚Äôre on crutches, and they were simply sent to the front. This Maxim is a complete asshole. I shake every day so that they don‚Äôt send me there, I can‚Äôt run, I can‚Äôt walk well. If I were healthy, I would of course go, I‚Äôm not afraid of anything, I‚Äôve been there twice, but at least I could get treatment,- says Ilya in his video from the basement. Ilya‚Äôs mother filed complaints with the Investigative Committee, the prosecutor‚Äôs office, the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation and other departments, but this did not produce any results. She herself went to the headquarters in Makeevka to write a complaint against the commander of the military unit, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Demkovsky. Unit inspector Anna (her full name is not disclosed) helped Olga, for which she was sent to the assault and was wounded. -They took me out in a serious condition with the replenishment of my lungs and I was declared in SOCH (unauthorized abandonment of the unit) as a criminal, although everyone saw the condition. And my commander is the same as Ilya‚Äôs, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Demkovsky. You send threats to him and not to me, I already helped you in any way I could, for which I paid,- wrote Anna to Ilya‚Äôs mother.After this, Olga received death threats and she had to urgently leave Makeyevka. Now she is threatened with the murder of her son if she does not stop talking about the situation, but the mother demands that her son be taken to Russia for surgery and sent to the N.N. Priorov hospital.

ASTRA: Azerbaijan declared State Duma deputy Valuev persona non grataThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan stated this. The reason for banning the Russian deputy from the country was his statements about the Azerbaijani diaspora after the closure of the Russian House of Rossotrudnichestvo in Baku. -The elements of their influence in Russia are diasporas. Often quite informal education with a wide range of coverage and opportunities. With penetration into power, where they are allowed. These are the transmission centers for everything. Power, influence, crime and much more. Cultural exchange is at the end of the list of statutory tasks there, believe me. And now to the emotions. But they are not needed. Calmly, with an understanding of the political and security support within our Russian state, without swearing and shouting, we are driving all this bullshit through the sieve of the law. And then there‚Äôs illegal migration, tax evasion, raiding and other interesting things,- Valuev wrote in his Telegram channel. Azerbaijan‚Äôs list of persons non grata already includes two of Valuev‚Äôs colleagues in the State Duma: Konstantin Zatulin and Vitaly Milonov.

The publication's source claims that the former head of the Federal Penitentiary Service, Igor Potapenko, abolished all restrictions on violence against prisoners and allowed not to use video recorders, which made it easier to hide crimes. Also, on his instructions, guards could wear balaclavas so that their identities would not be revealed.The FSIN employees who agreed to tell their stories to the publication claim that Ukrainians were subjected to violence until the batons broke. One of the prisoners died of sepsis because his wounds did not heal. In addition, the prisoners were constantly using stun guns.These former employees also gave evidence to investigators of the International Criminal Court and entered the witness protection program.Igor Potapenko, born in 1967 in the village of Shostka, Sumy region, began his service in the Internal Affairs Directorate of the Voronezh region, where he also headed a maximum security correctional colony. In 2009, Potapenko became the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service for the Voronezh Region, and in 2010 he moved to the post of head of the Federal Penitentiary Service for St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region. On November 7, 2024, it was announced that Igor Potapenko took the position of vice-governor of St. Petersburg, becoming part of the administration of the head of the city.	https://t.me/astrapress/74198	2025-02-10T04:12:57-08:00

ASTRA was informed about this by sources in the region's emergency services. This happened during an -abnormal descent- of a missile from a Russian plane. There were no injuries or fatalities.Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 16 FABs and three missiles, as well as one UMPB-250 for 2025, fallen in Russia and in Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine from Russian aircraft. And about 165 cases of FAB air bombs falling in 2024.As before ASTRA toldthat in order to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began equipping Soviet FAB air bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 household and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.

ASTRA: During the day, the Ukrainian Armed Forces advanced 5 kilometers southeast of Sudzha during a new offensive in the Kursk region. This is reported by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and Russian Z-channels. Ukrainian counterattacks slowed Russian offensive, - Le FigaroBy according tothe French newspaper Le Figaro, in January the pace of the offensive of Russian troops in Ukraine slowed down. If in December Russian forces captured 416 km¬≤, and in November - 714 km¬≤, then in January this figure was only 331 km¬≤. Despite ongoing fighting in the Donbass, where Russia has captured the towns of Kurakhovo and, most recently, Toretsk, Ukrainian defenses are holding their ground.Ukrainian forces are launching counterattacks along the entire front, including the Kursk region, where a successful Ukrainian offensive last August led to the capture of more than 1,000 km¬≤ in ten days. Russia has since gradually reclaimed the territory, reducing the Ukrainian overhang in the area to 430 km¬≤.In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has resumed counter-offensives, advancing several kilometers south of the town of Suzhda, easing the threat to Ukrainian positions in the area. Although the Ukrainian offensives are not yet as large-scale, the capture of several small villages, such as Kolmakov and Cherkasskaya Konopelka, strengthens Ukraine's position and could play an important role in possible negotiations with Russia and the United States, as Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky hopes, the publication notes.	https://t.me/astrapress/74193	2025-02-10T01:29:57-08:00

The head of the medical unit of IK-3, in whose arms Navalny was dying, received the mayor of Labytnangi‚Äôs award for helping the Russian military The head of the medical unit of IK-3 -Polar Wolf- Alexey Lisyuk received the award -Your pride, Labytnangi!- from the mayor of the city Marina Treskova. He became the winner of the award in the -Everything for Victory!- category, drawing the attention of the Cheka-OGPU. Local media reportedthat he collects medical supplies for the Russian military and independently delivers them to the North-West zone. Lisyuk's name appears in the resolution to refuse to initiate criminal proceedings against death of politician. It was he who helped him in the last minutes of his life. Previously, The Insider published&nbsp;two versions of the decision to refuse to initiate a criminal case, and from the final version the investigator removed symptoms that did not fit into the official version of death (heart rhythm disturbance). The final version of the resolution only mentions injuries that -occurred as a result of resuscitation measures, and post-mortem injuries during a forensic medical examination.- Missing from the documents was information about sharp abdominal pain, vomiting and convulsions, which, according to words of resuscitator Alexander Polupan, can hardly be explained by anything other than poisoning.	https://t.me/astrapress/74124	2025-02-09T05:26:34-08:00

A Russian plane dropped an aerial bomb near a residential building in a village in the Belgorod region. Injuries were avoided because it did not explodeOn January 29, the Russian Armed Forces again dropped two FAB-250s on the Belgorod region, ASTRA found out. One of them fell near a private residential building on Sadovaya Street in the Trud village of Korochansky district. Since the bomb did not explode, no one was injured, the residents were evacuated on the day of the fall. Another FAB-250 crashed near the village of Malomikhailovka, Shebekinsky urban district. There were no casualties or damage. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year, about 16 FABs and one missile as well as one UMPB-250 for 2025.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.At the beginning of July 2023, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, no casualties were avoided. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.

On February 1, during a long visit with his parents, his body reacted strongly to regular food, which differed from the prison diet. According to activists, for three days after the meeting, Yegor could not get out of bed and was in such bad condition that he could barely stand on his feet. On February 3, the support group reported that Yegor was denied sick leave, despite his deteriorating health. He did not receive the necessary tests that should have been done in December, and problems with his spine reappeared. -Egor went to the doctor, but they refused to give him sick leave, they said that it was okay, that he wouldn‚Äôt die. They gave him some strange pills, and the antibiotic turned out to be not for him, but for another prisoner. For three days he ate practically nothing, drinking only tea. When I returned to the detachment, my condition did not improve. Since it was Saturday, and doctors don‚Äôt work on weekends, he was given activated charcoal and the drugs that I brought for the date. Yesterday, he said, it got even worse, he started vomiting, and his stomach hurt a lot. He went to see a doctor again, but there was no improvement, he was not given sick leave,- Tatyana, the political prisoner‚Äôs mother, told ASTRA. She added that she was worried, not understanding the exact reason for the deterioration of her son‚Äôs condition. -We brought medicine with us, but it is still unclear how to treat him. Maybe it was an intestinal infection or a virus, or maybe just indigestion from the fact that his body was not used to normal food after prison food. He never received the necessary tests, and I don‚Äôt know what to tell him for the next date,- she said, emphasizing that without tests it is impossible to determine the correct treatment. According to the latest reports from the support group, Yegor's condition is still improving. -Egor felt better. I started eating a little. The abdominal pain goes away, the vomiting has stopped,-‚Äî representatives of the group wrote in their Telegram channel.In November 2023, the court sentenced Balazeikin to six years in prison in the case of throwing a Molotov cocktail at the St. Petersburg military registration and enlistment office. Memorial recognized him as a political prisoner. During the trial, he admitted the fact of arson, but stated that he did not intend to intimidate people or cause damage. After reaching adulthood, Yegor was transferred to an adult colony, despite his health condition. In May 2024, he was included in the list of terrorists and extremists, and the Memorial Project recognized him as a political prisoner.
