In London, Russian agents wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev and editor-in-chief of The Insider Roman Dobrokhotov, -BBC and TelegraphA group of five Bulgarian citizens arrested in 2023 are suspected of spying for Moscow for at least three years, the BBC and Telegraph report, citing case materials. They are accused of participating in intelligence collection operations in the UK, Germany, Austria, Spain and Montenegro.At the trial in a London court, it became known that a group of agents planned to kidnap the editor-in-chief of The Insider, Roman Dobrokhotov. The operation, called Operation Fishing Boat, involved a plan to smuggle the journalist out of the UK by boat. In addition to kidnapping, the defendants also considered more radical measures, such as staging Dobrokhotov‚Äôs death, for example, as a result of an accident. However, these ideas were abandoned, considering them ineffective. In addition, the men wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev, the publications write. The investigation claims that one of the coordinators of the operation was the Austrian businessman Jan Marsalek, associated with Russian intelligence. The cell was led by Orlin Rusev. In addition to Rusev, the group also included Bizer Dzhambazov, Katrin Ivanova, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir Ivanchev. Rusev and Dzhambazov have already pleaded guilty to espionage. The remaining defendants continue to deny the charges. Previously, journalists from The Insider and Bellingcat published high-profile investigations, including about the assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The investigation claims that Russian intelligence saw Dobrokhotov as a threat and assigned the cell to monitor him, as well as his colleague Hristo Grozev.In the picture, from left to right: Vanya Gaberova, court employee, Katrin Ivanova, court employee and Tihomir Ivanchev at the Old Bailey	https://t.me/astrapress/70035	2024-12-10T23:37:17-08:00

The wanderer was put on the wanted list and was forced to leave the country. Activists believe that the real reason for the searches was most likely the pickets held by the party in November in defense of Anatoly Bannykh, leader of the trade union AZ -Ural-.

In Primorye, a priest demanded that an art object with an alien be removed because it looked like a -demonic creature-A sculpture of an alien from the cartoon -The Secret of the Third Planet- was recently installed on the square at the bus station in the city of Dalnegorsk. Priest Andrei Vasyakin asked Mayor Alexander Terebilov to demolish the art object in the form of an alien. According to the priest, the figure offends the feelings of believers because it looks like a -demonic creature.--They say that these are art objects. Well, maybe some other objects. In Mariupol, for example, there is a huge stele of Steelmaker. It‚Äôs dedicated to the profession, but in our country it‚Äôs all demonized and somehow ridiculed. And we walk, smile, everything is fine. Well, how much can you do? We already have more of these demonic creatures than churches in Dalnegorsk,- said Vasyakin.	https://t.me/astrapress/69983	2024-12-10T05:50:11-08:00

Now the man is threatened with being forcibly sent to the stormtroopers if he does not come to the military registration and enlistment office before Monday In May 2024, Evgeny Zamanov decided to volunteer for war - his girlfriend needed money for an operation. The man submitted an application, but then changed his mind and did not sign the contract. According to him, he never returned to the selection point and completely forgot about the application. This week Zamanov received a call from the selection point and began to threaten that they would enroll him in the SOC - having left the unit without permission. -They threaten me that if I don‚Äôt go voluntarily, they will find me and send me to the stormtroopers,- he told ASTRA. Zamanov was surprised to learn that he was now a military man and asked for his number. In his personal account on the Ministry of Defense website, he actually found his profile. He has not received a single payment since May for signing the contract - because the bank details are not his. After Zamanov told the selection point employee, Sergeant Vladimir Lelyuk, about this, he stopped calling the man, and could not answer questions about whose account the salary was coming to. Zamanov told ASTRA that he changed his mind about going to war because of his seven-year-old son, and also because -he doesn‚Äôt want to kill people.- According to him, he needs to report to the selection point before December 9. Otherwise, he is threatened with being forcibly sent to the stormtroopers.

For refusing to pay money to commanders, they are sent to deadly assaults, say relatives Relatives of missing soldiers from military unit 09332 recorded an appeal in which they spoke about -colossal losses of personnel- and the lack of evacuation of the wounded and dead from the battlefield. According to them, commanders send groups of two people into assaults, although groups of -six to eight- should be deployed for -cleansing operations.- There is no combat coordination in the unit; the military -do not know each other by sight or call sign.- -They are simply sent one way,- says one of the women in a video message.-I buried my husband on the 22nd. He never served me. He was sent on a combat mission as soon as he arrived there. And the next morning he died. That is, he didn‚Äôt even spend a day on the mission. Commanders are lying. The fighters are being bullied. Everyone is afraid, afraid to say something, afraid to complain, because they will send them to the assault to reset. What to do? Where to look for help? After signing the contract in Stavropol, my husband was in a group of 60 people. At the moment, of these 60 people there are practically none left. In such a short period of time to kill 60 people‚Ä¶-one of the fighters‚Äô wives told ASTRA. -We demand, we write collective letters to the President, the Minister of Defense, asking for help so that this chaos stops, so that they stop throwing boys to slaughter. To help with equipment... We just returned from Ukraine a couple of days ago, ordered socks, shovels, and groceries. We ourselves sit down and go, because there is nothing there. Everything they have is bought with their own money,- she added. At the same time, according to another wife of a fighter, her mobilized husband was sent into the assault because he refused to pay money to the commanders. -My husband was in the artillery. A person who doesn‚Äôt just want to pay money‚Äîlet‚Äôs say the management needs a car, or something else‚Äîthey send them to death assault. My husband was mobilized and served quietly for a year and a half. They had to give him a report on the medal, and for this they set a price of 500 thousand rubles. He said he wouldn't pay. He was sent into the assault. He‚Äôs been lying there for 5 months now, there‚Äôs no way to pick him up,- she said. According to the women, among the leadership of the unit there are three commanders responsible for -lawlessness- and -extortions- - these are Konstantin Porosyuk, Viktor Vorobyov and S. Osaulenko. -They have a field bank -Luchi-, and, as far as I know, they transfer money to their cards from fighters whose relatives are not looking for them. The social payment - 158 thousand - was not given, citing the fact that it no longer exists. They open a card for a dead soul and throw money there. 3 million for injuries too. If you want a legal vacation, pay 320 thousand,- they say. -In general, the guys themselves reset themselves. Porosyuk killed 168 people in just 2 weeks. He says: -I don‚Äôt need 300, I need all 200.- When the guys arrive, in a state of shock, he sends them back. He asks them: -Well, couldn‚Äôt the heroes lie there and die in the fields?- This is the main thug there,- the interlocutors claim. ASTRA had photographs of Porosyuk, Vorobyov and Osaulenko at its disposal.Earlier today ASTRA wrote about how the military from the unit 09332, patients with hepatitis and cancer, are being forced to return to the war.

ASTRA: Tucker Carlson said that he flew to Russia for an interview with Sergei Lavrov InterviewSergei Lavrov to journalist Tucker Carlson. The main theses of the Russian Foreign Minister:On the death of Alexei Navalny: -During his imprisonment, he continued to be ill. Therefore, we constantly asked Germany (where Navalny was treated after poisoning in Russia - Ed.) to show us the results of their research. Because our studies did not show what theirs showed (that he was poisoned - Ed.). So I don‚Äôt know what they (the Germans - Ed.) did with him.-On Russia‚Äôs conditions for a truce with Ukraine: -We are ready to negotiate on the basis of principles , which were agreed upon in Istanbul and rejected by (former British Prime Minister - Ed.) Johnson at the request of the head of the Ukrainian delegation Arakhamia. The key principle is Ukraine's non-aligned status. We were ready to join the group of countries that would provide guarantees of the collective security of Ukraine... No NATO. No military bases, military exercises on Ukrainian soil with the participation of foreign troops. This is what he (Putin - Ed.) repeated.-About sanctions: -Many in Russia would like this (for the lifting of sanctions to be one of the conditions for a truce - Editor's note). But the more we live under sanctions, the more we understand that it is better to rely on ourselves, to develop mechanisms and platforms for interaction with countries friendly to us, which do not interfere with economic interests and political ones. Obama began introducing sanctions, Trump continued, and under Biden they reached an unprecedented level. But everything that doesn't kill us makes us stronger, you know? They can't kill us, so they make us stronger.-On whether Russia can become part of the West again: -No, I don‚Äôt think so.-About Trump: -A very strong man. A person who wants results. A person who doesn't like to procrastinate. He is open to discussion. But this does not make him pro-Russian. When he was president, he imposed many, many, many sanctions against us. So we will wait for the inauguration.-	https://t.me/astrapress/69786	2024-12-05T21:00:05-08:00

Three aerial bombs dropped Russian planes in the Belgorod region in one dayAs ASTRA sources in the region‚Äôs emergency services told us, last week, on Friday, November 29, Russian airborne forces dropped immediately three FABs for the Belgorod region. One of them -went down unexpectedly- near a residential building in the village of Veselaya Lopan, Belgorod region, more than 30 km from the border with Ukraine. No injuries or damage were avoided. Another aerial bomb fell into a field 7 km from the village of Bessonovka. The third FAB of the day was found in the village of Dragunskoye. This time the ammunition fell in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe substation, 3 kilometers from residential buildings. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 162 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19 a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69779	2024-12-05T08:20:29-08:00

The influence of war veterans in Ukraine turned out to be -few-By data of the -Algorithm of Light- project, in 2022‚Äì2023 in the country 2,284 women became victims of domestic violence, of which 2,123 of them were killed by their partners, the rest by relatives. In total, 3,436 women were killed over two years. At the same time, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, which is cited by the -Algorithm of Light-, in 2023, compared to 2022, 2% fewer murders were registered (Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 6% fewer rapes (Article 131 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 4% fewer cases of causing serious harm to health (Article 111 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). During January-July 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs registered 15,600 violent crimes, which is 6% less than the same period last year. According to the state statistics portal, in 2023 the number of deaths from violent crimes decreased from 9,366 people in 2022 to 8,792 in 2023.In 65 criminal cases checked by the Light Algorithm, war participants appeared in Ukraine. In 11 of these convictions the victim was a woman, only 8 of these involved domestic violence - 7 by a partner and 1 by a relative. It is impossible to draw conclusions about how often women died at the hands of SVO participants in 2022-2023; their number turned out to be small for analysis, notes Algorithm of Light.However, it is believed that the courts may not provide information about the previous criminal record of ex-prisoners or their participation in the -SVO-. In the recent research journalists found cases where, after the publication of sentences for participants in the war in Ukraine, materials the courts edited them, removing data on state awards or completely erasing the published text of the verdict.	https://t.me/astrapress/69657	2024-12-03T06:30:52-08:00
