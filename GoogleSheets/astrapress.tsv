Thus, the editors of ASTRA... In Makeevka, the Russian Aerospace Forces dropped a FAB-500 near a residential building3 more aerial bombs were found in the Belgorod region.How ASTRA found out that 3 FABs fell from Russian planes in the Belgorod region over the past few days. So, on November 23, an aerial bomb was found in a field near the village of Surkovo, Shebekinsky urban district. The next day, a FAB-500 was found in the Belgorod district, and on November 25, a FAB-250 fell several kilometers from the Gremyachiy village of the Shebekinsky urban district. There were no casualties or damage.In occupied Makeyevka, Donetsk region, on November 24, a FAB-500 fell right next to a residential building on Ordzhonikidze Street, ASTRA found out. Another FAB was found in the Shakhtarsky district. In both cases, no one was injured. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 156 cases of FAB aerial bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.üí´ By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69241	2024-11-26T02:50:40-08:00

He has been living with the disease since school. As a young man himself toldjournalists about its performance ‚Äî -this is 50-70% of the level of an ordinary person, if you follow all the recommendations and daily routine.--This is not what ordinary people feel in the evenings. It‚Äôs as if your head is being grabbed by a hoop, and lead is poured into the center - and you fall asleep, because it‚Äôs impossible to fight this painful feeling,- Andrei said.Last spring, he received an email ordered an Indian medicine for hypersomnia and became involved in a criminal case for the purchase and smuggling of drugs (Articles 228 and 229.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). In November, as found out -7x7-, the prosecutor asked to sentence Andrei to 11 years in a maximum security colony. The medicine that Andrey ordered from India contains an analogue of modafinil - this is a pharmaceutical stimulant, which in the USA, Europe and even a number of CIS countries is prescribed to patients with narcolepsy, hypersomnia and other sleep disorders. In Russia, this substance has been available since 2012 banned as a drug.Morozov is by no means the first patient with a similar diagnosis to face criminal prosecution for ordering Indian drugs. So, only at the beginning of 2024, a physicist from St. Petersburg Andrei Volotka for ordering modafinil by mail received4 years of strict regime. After the start of criminal prosecution, Andrei Morozov founded the -Ratio- community of Russians with sleep disorders.

All contract soldiers now receive the same payment of 400 thousand rubles. In November, the Russian authorities changed the system of monetary remuneration for the military. So, two weeks ago after Putin‚Äôs decree, the government sharply reduced payments to the militaryfor injuries - up to 30 times. Then Putin (by his own decree) raised payments for injuries resulting in disability by a million rubles. After that State Duma obliged volunteers to pay for military equipment lost in battle. All this is happening against the backdrop of an unprecedented increase in the size of one-time payments for signing a contract in 2024. With the help of these payments, regions compete for the number of contract soldiers sent to war. The current record is held by the Belgorod region, where you can get 3 million rubles for signing a permanent contract with the Ministry of Defense.	https://t.me/astrapress/69201	2024-11-25T07:23:17-08:00

At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations,&nbsp; throw links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name.

Many were lured into the war by deceptionSince at least July 2024, Russia has been recruiting Yemenis to take part in the invasion of Ukraine, writes the British newspaper Financial Times with a link to an interview with mercenaries.&nbsp; Yemen is a poor Muslim country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula that has been torn by civil war for 10 years. Payments for Russian contracts are huge amounts of money by the standards of this country, but even despite this, some Yemenis are recruited into the war by deception.

At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later, you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations, sending us links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name. This will help minimize risks and feel calmer.All donations sent from November 12th will be used to collect salaries.

According to investigators, early that day at the construction site, he shot Aliyev in the head, neck and torso at least 7 times with a pistol (on video). Aliyev died on the spot. Sukharev is an experienced criminal. In the 2000s, he was a member of the -Kingisepp- group, wrote 47 News. In 2007, a jury found him not guilty in the case of a series of contract killings of this organized crime group. True, on the eve of this decision, two of the jurors simply did not come to the meeting, because of this the panel had to be dissolved and re-recruited. In 2016, Sukharev was detained on suspicion of a series of robberies against jewelry stores. Then he was released on bail. In this case, already during the trial of the murder of Aliyev, the killer Sukharev was sentenced to 12 years in prison.	https://t.me/astrapress/68775	2024-11-18T07:36:24-08:00
