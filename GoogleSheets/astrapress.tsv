There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes.

Shvarev's defense does not agree with this.According to the investigation and the state prosecution, Shvarev received 500 thousand rubles from the relatives of one of the convicts, as well as a Swiss Tissot watch. For this, he allegedly promised to create favorable conditions for the prisoner to serve his sentence. In addition, he brought a mobile phone with a SIM card into the colony territory and handed it to the convict.

Gazprom stopped supplying gas to Austria The supply of gas to the Austrian energy company OMV from Russia stopped on the morning of November 16, saidAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. The reason for this was the conflict over interrupted supplies in 2022. Austria received Russian gas through the Nord Stream gas pipeline, but in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, supply disruptions arose. Gazprom explained this by technical difficulties, in response, the Head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that -Russia is trying to blackmail Austria by stopping gas supplies.- Nehammer said the day before that the country -will not allow itself to be blackmailed.-Earlier, OMV filed a lawsuit against Gazprom and won more than ‚Ç¨243 million in damages. OMV decided to deduct this money from the payment for the existing contract. The company claims that it will replace Russian supplies with supplies from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as from other suppliers. According to DW, the Austrian corporation could deliberately come into conflict with the Russian one in order to break the contract valid until 2040, obliging it to purchase significant volumes of gas.	https://t.me/astrapress/68614	2024-11-16T08:55:17-08:00

Later, you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations, sending us links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks.

Nobody cares what state you are in.- ASTRA found out new details of the military riot near NovosibirskASTRA managed to find another witness military riot in the unit under Novosibirsk. He asked for anonymity, but confirmed his words with documents (he himself has category -G-) and told the editors what preceded the escape of the military from military unit 57849 to Kochenevo. According to the editorial interlocutor, in the barracks of the military unit at the time the riot began there were -110-120 people, approximately no less than 100.- He himself ended up in barracks 57849 from unit 98551 in Abakan with another 45 people. -There were probably 8-10 people ready to go beyond the tape [that is, to the so-called -NWO- zone]. All the rest are sick, on crutches, inactive.- They were brought there on the night of November 8th. In the morning, sick military personnel began to write reports to the commander about the provision of medical care and military medical assistance, but these reports never went anywhere. -There was a guy [in barracks 57849], half a foot was missing on both legs. His military unit, I don‚Äôt know which one, fired him and gave him a commission. He was somehow pushed into this Kochanevskaya unit. And he was there for a month,- says ASTRA‚Äôs interlocutor. He retells the words representative of the commandant's office: -You are not being transferred here. Everyone is sent here. Bedridden, on stretchers, blind. Nobody cares what condition you are in.- According to the military man, he and his colleagues repeatedly asked for a doctor‚Äôs help: -We already realized that we couldn‚Äôt pass the Military Military Commissions, because everyone there was screaming, that you are all going to the 'SVO' zone.-For several days they asked the commandant of the Novosibirsk garrison and a representative of the military prosecutor's office to arrive. Due to inaction and refusal to even provide medical care, the military began a riot. According to the latest data, all participants in the escape from the military unit in Kochenevo on November 13 were detained, the Investigative Committee reported this evening. The editor's interlocutor especially noted one of the wounded - this is 36-lieutenant Alexander Andreev. An ASTRA source claims that Andreev lost the ability to speak after being wounded. -Lieutenant Andreev hears, but he is mute and communicates only using the telephone. He writes in notes and lets them read. You understand, he needs to learn sign language and he needs a phone now. And in this military unit, the phone is taken away - from 8 am to 8 pm. And people need help. He has one [right] hand only that works. Personally, I cut his nails. The situation is such that he constantly needs help - to open a jar, pour coffee. It might fall. Personally, I have been constantly with him since the 8th. Because of the wound, his head hurts and his eyes are watering - it feels like he has a constant fever.- Before unit 57849, Andreev was treated in neurology at the Abakan Clinical Hospital, where he was given category -G- (temporarily unfit). According to the latest information, Andreev was sent to Rostov-on-Don. Then he may return to the -NWO- zone.
