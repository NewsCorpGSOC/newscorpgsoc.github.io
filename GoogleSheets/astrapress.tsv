And it‚Äôs not like going home, just fuck it* oh, on the order of a drunkard to throw himself into the attack... We had no other choice. We didn‚Äôt dare to die on the orders of the drunken man,- - a new track from former military prisoners on the run. ASTRA previously wrote about military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields. According to ASTRA, the military is still in hiding. In the new track, Trutnev and Ostrovsky talked about how their friendship began: -A new group is coming - there are four of them. At this time I am in the trench with a radio on the air. U*ala -one hundred and twenty- - that‚Äôs the end of the song,The head of the group is in touch: -I have two two hundred.- -Fuck it,- he shouts into the radio, I‚Äôm in a stupor, And then he starts, bitch, a new group. Come on, go meet me, I left without a reason, This is where Slavik and Dimon met.- And also about why they decided to leave their positions: -And not just go home, just fuck him, By order of the drunk, throw yourself into the attack. It is unknown how this skirmish will go,And our patience burned out like a match. Time passed, the boys left. Dimon and I watched everything from the side. It‚Äôs like everyone stupidly cares about mountains of corpses, Depriving life, groups lay down here. We are like pawns here, they move us, They play with us, they calmly kill us... Reconnaissance in force, they shoot like dogs,He died the death of the brave, here is the news to his relatives. Analyzing everything with Dimon in position, We sit and watch with dumbfounded faces. Let's say fuck it all, make a decision, Let our lives... continue. We had no other choice, We did not dare to die on the orders of the drunken man. Hoping for luck, we bypass all barriers, We saved our lives and are happy about it.- Previously Trutnev and Ostrovsky they told how the deputy commander of the 109th regiment with the call sign -Caspian- (named Umakhan) after one of the assaults lined up 15 people who survived and returned from the mission, announced to them that the survival rate of prisoners supposedly should not exceed 2%, and locked them in a pit, where three subsequently died. Before this, the military recorded two more track: about his commander -Prokop-: -F*cked orders kill the boys . Fuck more of your own people, just to be sure. Apparently, this is the whole task of the 109th Regiment,-as well as about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives: -I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and For fear of dying, I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there.

Alexander Lukashenko threatened war if Russia tries to annex Belarus-In high circles of Russia, some people are itching to annex Belarus, but an attempt to do this will turn into war. You are smaller, we are larger, but our economy is this and that. We will help you and continue to join Russia. You can't ask questions like that. This is impossible and unrealizable. -I‚Äôm afraid to even say that this is a war,- he said and added: -But you see our relationship with Putin. Lots of negotiations, contacts, personal and others. We have never had this question before. Well, in Russia some people are itching, even in high circles. We need to throw this out.-At the same time, he criticized the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwar in the modern world, calling the conquest of territories stupid: -This is not the Middle Ages, when you captured a territory, you pay taxes, and okay - the world has changed, the world is different. Therefore, you shouldn‚Äôt set stupid tasks for yourself, and you should always think about what will happen next.-	https://t.me/astrapress/67130	2024-10-25T01:45:06-07:00

The man was wrapped up in front of his wife The day before at about 6 pm in the grocery store to see Dmitry [name changed at the request of relatives - approx. ASTRA] two men in civilian clothes approached (one of them is in the photo) and demanded to see documents. When asked to introduce themselves, one of them produced a document indicating that he was a military police officer. Dmitry asked them why, firstly, they were dressed -in civilian clothes-, and secondly, why they demanded documents from a civilian, to which they, according to Dmitry‚Äôs wife, allegedly replied that -the laws have changed and they have everyone has the right to check documents.- After this, Dmitry‚Äôs wife began filming what happened on her phone, to which the men threatened her with an article about -discrediting- the military and demanded that she stop filming. Following this, a group of security officers drove up to the store, grabbed Dmitry and put him in the car. -I ran after him, tried to pull him out. These men pushed me away, shoved me, my jacket tore. In the end, they pushed me into this -bobby- and I went with them. They brought him to the commandant‚Äôs office and I never saw him again,- Dmitry‚Äôs wife told ASTRA. The wife was told that a case was allegedly opened against the man for leaving his unit without permission, although Dmitry has Ukrainian citizenship, he did not sign the contract, he does not have a military ID, his wife says. As his wife clarified, Dmitry was still at the front: in February 2022 he was called from the enterprise and illegally mobilized, although he was not registered with the military. Dmitry was able to return home only in February 2023. -They consider him a military serviceman because he was there. As far as I know, a person who has a contract and a military ID can become a military man. And he is a citizen of Ukraine,- says his wife.

In addition, after the start of the war, the American billionaire communicated with the head of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sergei Kiriyenko, and several other high-ranking Russian officials. According to The Wall Street Journal, Russia at the end of 2023 turned to Musk with a request not to activate Starlink satellite communication terminals over Taiwan. This was done as a favor to China. Starlink currently does not have permission to provide Internet services in Taiwan, where authorities restrict foreign satellite operators. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told WSJ that the businessman spoke with Putin only once: they discussed space and technology. Musk himself also said in 2022 that he communicated with Putin only once in the spring of 2021.	https://t.me/astrapress/67122	2024-10-24T23:54:09-07:00
