The commanders are hiding from their relatives and inviting them to evacuate the wounded themselvesWives and mothers of military personnel assigned to Lugansk military unit 40463 turned to Putin and Bastrykin with a request to help them find their missing relatives and conduct an investigation regarding the part. They told ASTRA that military personnel are disappearing en masse before they even arrive there. Here are the stories of just a few missing men: ‚ÄîAnton Golubov. Transferred to the unit on April 29, last contacted on May 1. He has been listed as missing since May 11. ‚Äî Nikita Kim. On September 6 he went on a combat mission and went missing on September 7. ‚ÄîMobilized Dmitry Sagin. Instead of the hospital, they were sent for the assault on July 13th. Disappeared on July 14. ‚Äî World of Kokoev. On August 17 he arrived at the unit, on August 20 he last contacted his relatives. Officially listed as missing since September 3. ‚Äî Alexey Pushkarsky, father of many children. Left on a mission on September 10, disappeared without a trace on September 18. ‚Äî Danil Kiryukhin. Illegally transferred to this military unit on July 26. Since August 3 - missing. ‚Äî Dmitry Muravyov. Sent to military unit 40463 after 2 weeks of training - July 18. Since July 31, Dmitry‚Äôs status has been missing. The relatives of the missing are not given any information, and the majority of those who apply do not even have notices that their relatives are missing. At the same time, some women claim that their husbands and sons were sent to unit 40463 either illegally or as -punishment.- Thus, Mir Kokoev was transferred there as a -penalty officer- after he demanded leave, which he should have been given last year. Most women are told by nameless representatives of the unit, hiding under their Telegram nicknames, that their loved ones stopped communicating after the drone attack. A relative of Mir Kokoev, when asked how the man disappeared, was told that he might-stayed to drink tea in a nearby dugout,-and when asked to evacuate, they even answered that she could pull him out on her own fighter. -The wounded are also not evacuated - only if the soldier himself has reached the zero point... At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry still does not know that my brother is missing,-‚Äî says the sister of the missing Dmitry Muravyov. Evacuation is not carried out even in those settlements over which the Russian Defense Ministry reported control - for example, Berestovoe, where another serviceman,Maxim Startsev, disappeared. The ASTRA editorial office was also contacted by relatives of the missing: Konstantin Polichov, Ivan Romanchenko, Daut Arslanov, Konstantin Ponamarev, Ruslan Kochetkov, Vladislav Sukharevsky, Alexey Razuev, Andrey Chigarkin, Maxim Antonov, Vakil Yaunbaev , Vladimir Danilov, Alexander Khlebinskikh, Ivan Gromachenko.According to the wives, the commander of the 1st MSB is considered to be a military man with the call sign -Cap-. For assaults, after which military personnel disappear en masse - certain -Greedy- and -Zolotoy-. Relatives know the name of only the political officer of the unit - Vitaly Bugaev. Relatives of the soldiers of the same military unit who disappeared in 2022 are already wrote a petition addressed to Putin. In it they demandedto -conduct an investigation into the concealment of information by the command of the military unit about our loved ones and find out their fate.- The ASTRA editors do not know whether there was any reaction to the appeal of loved ones. ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

The activist was taken to the Metro Security Department at the Druzhba metro station. At the same time, the police officers themselves invited the Russian to a meeting in the city center.

It is not known why exactly the case was opened. The diaspora claims that the activist left Russia -in connection with politically motivated criminal prosecution.- Now Shklover has been arrested for three days.

Meduza gained access to the correspondence of employees of IK-6, ...	Meduza gained access to the correspondence of employees of IK-6, where Navalny was imprisoned. The letters indicate conditions of detention that were specially tightened for the politician - falsification of documents, censorship and a punishment cell for rolling up sleevesIn early August, the publication received from a source an archive of correspondence from employees of IK-6 (a maximum security colony in the village of Melekhovo Vladimir region, where Alexei Navalny spent most of his time), namely messages from the email of Ilya Kruglyshev, a lawyer who represented in the courts a maximum security penal colony in the village of Melekhovo. Letters about Navalny from his correspondence were sent out from May 2021 to February 2024. From today's publications it became clear: - In IK-6, documents were falsified to respond to Navalny‚Äôs claims about violations in the colony. For example, at the end of 2023, after Navalny disappeared, representatives of the Federal Penitentiary Service first explained his disappearance by power outages in the colony, then the lawyers were informed that the politician was no longer in IK-6. Three weeks later it turned out that he was transferred to a special regime colony in the village of Kharp in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, where he was subsequently killed. After this, the head of IK-6, Dmitry Nozhkin, reported on the reasons for Navalny‚Äôs transfer, saying that he was transferred to Kharp due to the entry into force of a new sentence. However, in the first version of the document signed by Nozhkin, something else was stated - the reason for Navalny‚Äôs stage was the instruction of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia No. 02-6477-dsp (-for official use-) received by IK-6. By excluding this instruction from the final version, the colony staff were able to hide it from the lawyers.- The colony staff closely monitored the lawyers and read all the letters that Navalny sent and received, especially after the posts appeared online on behalf of Navalny, information from which was not mentioned in the wiretapped conversations between the politician and his wife and mother. Then the workers of IK-6 concluded that Navalny was transmitting the text for publication to his associates through lawyers. In response, the employees sealed the transparent plexiglass covering the grille that separated lawyers and clients in the room where their meetings take place, and got rid of a special slot for the transfer of documents, which is why Navalny‚Äôs lawyers could not transfer to him the materials of new criminal cases cases brought against the politician while he was in prison. And the lawyers also could not show these papers.- Navalny recorded a noticeable increase in blood pressure - 140/90. Such readings could be a sign of arterial hypertension and a reason for starting drug therapy. Navalny was not prescribed medications to lower blood pressure in IK-6. According to the official version of Navalny‚Äôs death, it was the -critical increase in blood pressure- that became the -trigger- for the development of the -combined disease-, which allegedly led to the death of the politician in February 2024.&nbsp;- Navalny was held in a punishment cell more than 300 days in two years. On one occasion, he was sent there because he rolled up the sleeves of his robe, which was several sizes too small for him. Each time, before this punishment, prisoners must be examined by doctors - Navalny complained of pain in his back, stomach and hands, but he was still sent to the isolation ward. - April 17, 2023, two employees of IK-6 ;‚Äî Alexey Kukushkin and Vladimir Katalev beat Navalny because he -categorically refused to enter the cell- of the punishment cell. After the beating, as Meduza writes, Navalny was escorted to the cell where the convicted A.A. Tatarchenko, who was specially put in the same cell with Navalny, since Tatarchenko was homeless and did not take care of hygiene, which made it impossible to be in the same room with him.- In October 2023, Navalny told his lawyer Olga Mikhailova that -it seems like I‚Äôm being bullied here.- About the possible poisoning of Navalny in the colony also statedThe Insider journalists, who claimed that before Navalny‚Äôs death he was vomiting and complained of -sharp pain in the abdominal area.- However, this information disappeared from the official document about the causes of Navalny‚Äôs death.	https://t.me/astrapress/66845	2024-10-21T06:55:15-07:00

The rating of the most expensive Russian artists performing at state expense has gone viral on social networksHis compiled research project -Tenderscope- together with the RTVI editors, having analyzed public procurement with the names of specific artists. The most expensive artists were Yaroslav Dronov (Shaman), Grigory Leps and Oleg Gazmanov. For the performance of several songs at City Days and other regional holidays, the budget paid them from 5 to 16 million rubles.At the same time, the popularity of many of these artists is in doubt. For example, last month Shaman's commercial concerts canceled in several cities due to unsold tickets.

A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar - because of a stupid order from a moron commander,- - former military prisoners on the run recorded a new track - this time about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives. Previously, ASTRA wrote about the military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gavethe order to move to a new point at night by mine fields. The new track of former prisoners is called -Truth-. In it, they reflect on the phrase from the film -Brother-2- -Strength is in truth-, and wonder why -in our time, telling the truth has become more expensive for oneself?-, and why -in our honest and great Russia, the security forces have the truth in strength? Also, Trutnev and Ostrovsky again mention their commander with the call sign -Prokop- and the entire 109th regiment, whom they -sent to hell.- -You trump the fact that I fucked up and left. You found a deserter and a coward in me. You and I will still laugh about this at the end, but right now, fuck it, let‚Äôs figure it out. I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and for fear of dying I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there. A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar because of a stupid order from a moron commander. And it was hard to get the guys out under the bullets, rather than sit and sort out the papers without signatures. I followed all the orders where everyone was dying, but when I told the truth, we, bitch, became cowards. You threatened my mom and what the hell is going on, but now it‚Äôs clear which of us is afraid of the truth. Yes, we left, but not because we pissed ourselves off, we just sent drunken Prokop to fuck off. And the 109th regiment, and all the lying scum, thanks to this we are now alive. And while I‚Äôm standing straight and looking at the clouds, I remember how I smiled, going around the barriers. I'm waiting for the FSB's doomsday. And I ask God for my mother‚Äôs health. For my mother, for my father, for my daughter, for my wife‚ÄîI will come and fuck you. And I will knock out the words on a pedestal for morons: -The weak cannot speak from a position of strength.- Formerly military recorded a song about their commander -Prokop-: -Younot only behind your back, where are you something in the basement. He hid his ass while we died. We open our eyes, seeing the sky from the trench. No food or water, thanks to Prokop. You send the hungry, cold people to slaughter in droves, reporting on their whereabouts via radio [walkie-talkie]. At the cost of our lives, you are testing your luck, drunk and the battalion commander are cutting down the task. The boys die by shedding their blood. F*cked orders kill the boys. Fuck more of your own people, just to be sure. Apparently, this is the whole task of the 109th Regiment.-ü´®Help ASTRA raise money for journalists' salaries	https://t.me/astrapress/66624	2024-10-18T13:20:31-07:00

As ASTRA found out, several jet drones attacked the territory of military unit 58661-90 (former military unit 83368) in the village of Sazanya that night. The strike hit an artillery ammunition depot. After the attack, a fire broke out on the territory of the arsenal, but it was extinguished within half an hour, ASTRA found out. This may mean that the ammunition did not catch fire. From Serdobsk to the border with Ukraine - about 700 km.	https://t.me/astrapress/66620	2024-10-18T12:59:27-07:00

He stated in an official letter that it was -inappropriate- to give certificates for new housing to residents of the Sudzhansky district. -Since the evacuation affected 8 districts of the Kursk region, and this is more than 150 thousand citizens, the provision of social support measures in accordance with the specified procedure can lead to a significant outflow of the working population from the territory of the Kursk region,- it is said in document signed by Afonin. He proposed postponing the resolution of this issue until the completion of the counter-terrorist operation, which is being carried out in the Kursk region after the invasion of the region by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on August 6. Deputies in a complaint to the prosecutor stated that Afonin‚Äôs words violate the constitutional rights of the sudzhan to freedom of movement, as well as choice of place of residence.	https://t.me/astrapress/66567	2024-10-18T00:31:01-07:00

Another aerial bomb was dropped by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the Belgorod Region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod Region, on October 17, a FAB was found near the village of Sergievka, Krasnoyaruzhsky District. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least 130 aerial bombs that accidentally landed on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.How previously told ASTRA, in order to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

At the cathedral in Cherkassy there was a fight between supporters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate As local media write, military chaplain Vladimir Pedko stated that St. Michael's Cathedral in Cherkassy is being transferred to the OCU and will now be a garrison one. Moreover, the transition took place without local priests. In the morning, believers and Metropolitan Theodosius of the UOC-MP came to the temple, who did not agree with this decision, and subsequently a fight broke out. It is noted that the SBU previously handed over 4 suspicions to Metropolitan Theodosius, including for inciting interreligious hatred and denying the armed aggression of the Russian Federation.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which reports to Moscow, reported that about 100 people in camouflage and balaclavas broke into to the territory of the cathedral and -illegally- drove the believers away. At some point, the believers of the UOC-MP and the metropolitan locked themselves in the church and did not let anyone in, writes the publication -Public-. Later, the OCU occupied thecathedral and held a service there for the first time in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian flag was also raised there, writes Radio Liberty. The police opened criminal proceedings on the fact of hooliganism in the cathedral. More than 20 people were injured. The transfer of the cathedral to the subordination of the OCU was supported by the mayor of Cherkasy Anatoly Bondarenko and the head of the OBA Igor Taburets. Metropolitan John of Cherkasy and Chigirin told in a commentary to Suspilny that the transition of the community to the OCU officially took place on June 12.On August 20, 2024, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law regulating the activities of religious organizations, which prohibits the activities of churches in the country associated with Russia. We are talking, in particular, about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC).After February 24, 2022, Ukrainian society and the media began to massively criticize the clergy of the UOC for supporting the theses of the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian special services have repeatedly conducted searches of clergy&nbsp;UOC&nbsp; on&nbsp;suspicion of disseminating&nbsp;Russian propaganda&nbsp;and the work&nbsp;of some of its representatives for the Russian intelligence services.Previously, religious studies examination of the Ukrainian State Service for Freedom of Conscience showed: The UOC is a structural division of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Six Russian deserters were given French visasSix Russian military personnel were given temporary visas so they could apply for political asylum in France. This is the first time such a large group of deserters has been accepted into an EU country, writes The Guardian with reference to human rights organizations. According to the newspaper, the men arrived in Paris on separate flights over the past few months. Before that, they were in Kazakhstan, from where they fled the Russian Federation in 2022 and 2023. -France's decision is the result of extensive cooperation between the French authorities and a group of human rights organizations,- Ivan Chuvilyaev, a representative of the -Walk through the Forest- project, told the publication. -We hope this marks the beginning of more deserters being allowed into Europe.- He added that each of the soldiers was vetted for their -strong, consistent anti-war position- before they were allowed into France. Among those who received temporary visas were those who fought against Ukraine, as well as conscripts and officers who managed to avoid being sent to the front line.	https://t.me/astrapress/66464	2024-10-16T11:47:08-07:00

Previously, Moscow authorities refused to the organizers of the -Return of Names- event, citing coronavirus. Before this it has become known that the Russian authorities have rewritten the official concept of memory of victims of political repression, removing the word -mass- from it.

He was filming them when one of them approached the man, hit him in the face, grabbed his phone and ran away. The stolen phone, according to geolocation, is now located on the territory of the fish factory. The Ryazanovsky fish factory, in turn, is located on the territory of the Russian Defense Ministry, where, according to sources, secret training exercises are taking place to prepare for the -SVO-. No one is allowed into the territory, so the security forces cannot question those involved in the beating of the victim. Presumably, the reason for beating the man was that he was launching a quadcopter, which allegedly interfered with military exercises.üí´ Subscribe to ASTRA.

Barriers appeared at least on sections of highways in the Bolshesoldatsky and Rylsky districts of the Kursk region. At the moment, two accidents are known.

About this reports -Novaya Gazeta-. Lisitsyna told the newspaper that she tried to protect her son from any military training at school. The woman planned that her son, instead of serving in the army, would go to alternative civilian service (ACS), and did not want her son to be -taught to pull the trigger.-On the eve of the training camp, in May 2024, Lisitsyna was summoned to the education department of the city of Berezovsky. -The representative of the commission said: -You know, it seems to us that you are a bad influence on your son. We will have conversations with him. We will question him in tests - psychological, socio-psychological... Do you understand how this will end?- I say: 'I don't understand.' He: ‚ÄòWe can take the child away from you.‚Äô I asked: ‚ÄòOn what basis?‚Äô He began to list some articles, but then the military commissar got involved,- the newspaper quotes Lisitsyna. The military commissar called the woman‚Äôs son a -draft dodger- and stated that the high school student -doesn‚Äôt want to defend the country- while -now bombs will fly on our heads.-According to the article about discrediting the army, a woman was fined because of her answer to the military commissar. Novaya Gazeta does not quote what was said verbatim because of the threat of being fined under the same article, but writes that the general meaning of the phrase was: -The country was not in any danger in February 2022.- However, as noted, in the protocol on discrediting Lisitsyna, completely different words were attributed that the woman did not utter. There are no audio recordings in the administrative file confirming her words. It is based on the testimony of the head of the city education department and the former former teacher of Lisitsyna‚Äôs son, who were present during the conversation with the military commissar. Later, representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and an FSB officer tried to take the woman to court. The latter told Lisitsyna that-Our fight for Vanya could end badly because we contacted human rights activists. I recommended not to communicate with them.- Ultimately, the woman did not go to trial and was fined in absentia. -It seems to me that school should be a place where teachers are your child‚Äôs protectors. It‚Äôs terrible to realize that this is not so,- said Lisitsyna, who herself previously worked as a teacher in schools and kindergartens.	https://t.me/astrapress/66399	2024-10-15T12:44:12-07:00

Roskomnadzor has made its register of blocking more closedNow it has become more difficult to find out about blocking of sites in Russia - RKN has changed the search mechanism for database of prohibited links on your website. Now, to find out about blocking, you need to enter the full address of the page, and not just its domain name. This makes using the registry much more difficult. The search mechanism for the database of blocked sites changed without warning this afternoon. Because of this, a number of media wrotethat Discord and Steam have disappeared from the registry - and, apparently , will be unlocked soon. Journalists simply could not find records about the blocking of Discord and Steam in the registry.Against this background, the RKN press service statedthat it sees no reason to unblock Discord. The department accompanied the message to journalists with an explanation: -Please note that &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; in the Unified Register of Prohibited Information of Roskomnadzor, it is necessary to enter into the search bar the link (address) of a specific page with a violation, and not the domain name of the entire service.- Roskomnadzor did not explain the reasons for changing the search mechanism in the registry of blocked sites. A representative of the public organization Roskomsvoboda, in a comment to ASTRA, said that in this way the department probably decided to make the register of blocked pages non-public. The organization reminded that it is still possible to monitor blockings the old way through their website even if prohibited links do not appear there immediately, but with a slight delay.The actions of Roskomnadzor fit into the general trend towards increasing the secrecy of information in Russia. So, since the beginning of the war, your data and statistics classified has already been classified by more than a dozen departments. And yesterday it became known that the websites of Moscow courts have stopped showing what exactly people are being arrested for. This complicates the work of journalists and human rights activists in finding those accused of political charges.	https://t.me/astrapress/66395	2024-10-15T11:00:08-07:00

FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the occupied village of Korsun, Donetsk region According to ASTRA, an unexploded FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the village of Korsun in the Yenakievo City Council. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 129th air bomb that fell as a result of an emergency landing on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before ASTRA reported that in order to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began equipping Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 129 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino.

The Russian military has continued its counteroffensive in the Kursk region for the fifth day. Previously, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost approximately a quarter of all territories of the Kursk border region captured by UkraineSince the beginning of October, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have lost control over more than 120 square kilometers of the territory of the Kursk region. This is information from the OSINT project DeepState, which is close to the Ukrainian army, the data of which is often assessed by journalists and analysts as genuine.However, assessments of the successes of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region vary. Thus, the commander of the Akhmat special forces, Apti Alaudinov, said that the Russian Armed Forces had already liberated -about half- of the territories of the Kursk region occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since breaking through the border in the Kursk region, Alaudinov has regularly made loud statements that need to be verified turn out to be half-truths or outright false. This time, his words can be contrasted with DeepState data, according to which over the past week Russia returned more than 13% of the territory controlled by Ukraine on October 8.Currently, the area captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces The territory in the Kursk region is about 660 sq. km, another 360 sq. km remain in the gray zone.

ASTRA confirmed the identities of Trutnev and Ostrovsky. It is unknown where the military is now. Vyacheslav‚Äôs common-law wife Alena told ASTRA that she and the young man‚Äôs mother admit that the videos could have been recorded in Ukrainian captivity. However, there is no evidence of this.

According to him, call centers operating -under the auspices- of the Ukrainian special services are involved in this.

Just two months ago, he received a similar post in another region41-year-old Maxim Kovalev was appointed vice-governor of the Samara region - he headed the department for law and order and anti-corruption, reported the regional governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev. Apparently, the appointment of Kovalev as vice-governor is part of the trend to promote war participants in Ukraine to government positions. Kovalev is a native of Sevastopol, who before the annexation of Crimea served in the special forces unit of the Ukrainian police -Berkut-. After the annexation, Berkut came under the command of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (and then the Russian National Guard), and Kovalev eventually received the post of commander of the Sevastopol Berkut-S. The soldiers of this riot police unit participated in the war in Ukraine from the very beginning, mark -Important stories.- In August 2024, Kovalev took the post of vice-governor in another region - in the Vologda region. There he was responsible for public safety and law enforcement issues. According to local media, the former riot policeman resigned from this post in September. What caused the dismissal (and whether it was completely voluntary) is unknown. In Ukraine, a criminal case has been opened against Kovalev under articles of encroachment on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, treason, and misappropriation of firearms.	https://t.me/astrapress/66336	2024-10-14T08:40:52-07:00

Stupid missions from which it is impossible to return,-- military,those who claimed to have escaped after drunkorders from the commander told how they were recruited in the colonies to war.According to Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, they signed contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry -not of their own free will.- As military personnel of military unit 34494 of the 132nd brigade of the 109th regiment of the 3rd company said in a conversation with an ASTRA correspondent, at the time of signing contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry (in May 2024), each of them was serving a sentence in the colony, where they were persuaded to go to war. Vyacheslav says that he was sentenced to 8 years under Articles 228 and 166 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, and at the time of signing the contract he -had 1.5 years left before parole.- He served his sentence in IK-10 in the city of Rubtsovsk, Altai Territory. Dmitry was also imprisoned under 228 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation in Penal Colony 19 of the Irkutsk Region.-We were serving our sentences in colonies, and there they began to tighten the screws and drive people to war. They gave the illusion of choice: for example, you are eligible for parole in a year and a half or two years, supposedly why do you need parole when you can win a year at the SVO, get money and come back clean. And if not, then you won‚Äôt see any parole, maybe they‚Äôll even throw you in for desertion, and in general, the punishment cell is your home until the end of your term,- they said. The prisoners were also promised that during the war they would be treated as full-fledged military personnel, but -the attitude has not changed one bit. -When we arrived here, we were guarded everywhere. Detachments, treated like cattle. Stupid missions from which it is impossible to return, and if we had sat down, we would not have taken such a step, we would not have recorded anything at all. The orders were like this... Stupid meat, they killed people,- the military said. In addition, the men complained that for 4 months they had never received payments on the card, and they had received nothing except allowances. -Maybe someone will come to their senses and not come here, because there is nothing to do here, they are deceiving their own people here,- they concluded.Earlier Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky ASTRA reported that they fled from their positions after the company commander with the call sign -Prokop-, in a drunken state, gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields.ASTRA confirmed personalities of Trutnev and Ostrovsky. It is unknown where the military is now. Vyacheslav‚Äôs common-law wife Alena told ASTRA that she and the young man‚Äôs mother admit that the videos could have been recorded in Ukrainian captivity. However, there is no evidence of this. Vyacheslav‚Äôs mother Irina wrote an appeal to the Russian Ministry of Defense demanding that they understand the situation and bring her son‚Äôs commanders to justice. ü´® Help ASTRA raise money for journalists' salaries Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/66330	2024-10-14T06:20:51-07:00

Servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces fled from their positions after a drunken commander gave them a -deadly- orderServicemen of the 132nd brigade of the 109th regiment of the 3rd company Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky fled from positions after the company commander with the call sign -Prokop-, in a drunken state, gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields. They spoke about this over a video call to an ASTRA correspondent, and also recorded relevant videos. -Not only will we walk to it at night, but there will be mines, sand and other crap. Three groups have already gone there, we are the fourth, those three are not getting in touch. So, in any case, we're fucked, we won't be back. F*ck knows what to do with our such command of the 109th regiment, with our company commander -Prokop-, who gives us orders when he‚Äôs drunk and will lead us further along the -bird-, says the first appeal of the military, which they recorded while still in position. Later, Trutnev and Ostrovsky got in touch again, but in civilian clothes, and reported that they had left their positions because they -had run out of patience with their [Prokop and battalion commander Glyba‚Äôs] unlimited orders.- -Two of our comrades for refusing to carry out the task - to move forward through the minefield - the same -Prokop- bombarded them with -dumps-, the boys were hit by two hundred. Their call signs were -Bosyak- and -Grim-. The last straw was that the company commander contacted us in an inadequate state, either he was drunk or something, and he and -Glyba- gave us the order to move on. But there was no point in this, because it is a one-way ticket. We laid down our arms, decided to retreat, and found a civilian. We are not pissers, not deserters, but we cannot advance further under such leadership. &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; Now we have found shelter, we have been fed, sheltered, clothed. We bypassed the barrier detachments, thank God. We hope that they will help us,- they said.ASTRA confirmed the identities of Trutnev and Ostrovsky. It is unknown where the military is now. Vyacheslav‚Äôs common-law wife told ASTRA that she and the young man‚Äôs mother admit that the videos could have been recorded in Ukrainian captivity. However, there is no evidence of this. -There was a feeling that the guys were behaving a little unnaturally, but they themselves got in touch and said that everything was fine and they were safe,- Alena told ASTRA. ü´® Help ASTRA collect on salaries for journalists Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/66327	2024-10-14T04:57:31-07:00

ASTRA: The Russian Aerospace Forces again dropped an aerial bomb on the Belgorod region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod region, on October 10 in the Shebekinsky urban district, in FAB-500 was found several kilometers from the village of Neklyudovo. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 128th air bomb that fell on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem with the updated FABs was immediately revealed - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, during an emergency gathering, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

China began blockade exercises against TaiwanChinese fighter jets and warships began encircling the island of Taiwan as part of the Joint Sword exercises - 2024B. Thus, Beijing is sending a-stern warning &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; separatist forces-on the island, statedthe command of the People's Liberation Army of China. Taiwan called China's military exercises a provocation. In recent years, China intensified its military presence around Taiwan - China does not recognize the independence of the 23 million island. It is noteworthy that the island blockade exercise began shortly after October 10, the founding day of the first Chinese Republic, which is celebrated as a national holiday in Taiwan. The first republic in China replaced the last imperial dynasty, and this regime ended with civil war and the rise to power of the communists. Taiwan was founded by opponents of the communists who fled to the island - and in many ways this democratic country considers itself the successor of the first Chinese Republic. Taiwan's sovereignty is recognized by only a dozen states. The United States is not among them, which provides Taiwan with military support and acts as a guarantor of the island's independence.	https://t.me/astrapress/66314	2024-10-13T22:45:53-07:00
