And it‚Äôs not like going home, just fuck it* oh, on the order of a drunkard to throw himself into the attack... We had no other choice. We didn‚Äôt dare to die on the orders of the drunken man,- - a new track from former military prisoners on the run. ASTRA previously wrote about military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields. According to ASTRA, the military is still in hiding. In the new track, Trutnev and Ostrovsky talked about how their friendship began: -A new group is coming - there are four of them. At this time I am in the trench with a radio on the air. U*ala -one hundred and twenty- - that‚Äôs the end of the song,The head of the group is in touch: -I have two two hundred.- -Fuck it,- he shouts into the radio, I‚Äôm in a stupor, And then he starts, bitch, a new group. Come on, go meet me, I left without a reason, This is where Slavik and Dimon met.- And also about why they decided to leave their positions: -And not just go home, just fuck him, By order of the drunk, throw yourself into the attack. It is unknown how this skirmish will go,And our patience burned out like a match. Time passed, the boys left. Dimon and I watched everything from the side. It‚Äôs like everyone stupidly cares about mountains of corpses, Depriving life, groups lay down here. We are like pawns here, they move us, They play with us, they calmly kill us... Reconnaissance in force, they shoot like dogs,He died the death of the brave, here is the news to his relatives. Analyzing everything with Dimon in position, We sit and watch with dumbfounded faces. Let's say fuck it all, make a decision, Let our lives... continue. We had no other choice, We did not dare to die on the orders of the drunken man. Hoping for luck, we bypass all barriers, We saved our lives and are happy about it.- Previously Trutnev and Ostrovsky they told how the deputy commander of the 109th regiment with the call sign -Caspian- (named Umakhan) after one of the assaults lined up 15 people who survived and returned from the mission, announced to them that the survival rate of prisoners supposedly should not exceed 2%, and locked them in a pit, where three subsequently died. Before this, the military recorded two more track: about his commander -Prokop-: -F*cked orders kill the boys . Fuck more of your own people, just to be sure. Apparently, this is the whole task of the 109th Regiment,-as well as about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives: -I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and For fear of dying, I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there. A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar, because of a stupid order from a moron commander. > Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/67223	2024-10-26T13:01:07-07:00

Alexander Lukashenko threatened war if Russia tries to annex Belarus-In high circles of Russia, some people are itching to annex Belarus, but an attempt to do this will turn into war. You are smaller, we are larger, but our economy is this and that. We will help you and continue to join Russia. You can't ask questions like that. This is impossible and unrealizable. -I‚Äôm afraid to even say that this is a war,- he said and added: -But you see our relationship with Putin. Lots of negotiations, contacts, personal and others. We have never had this question before. Well, in Russia some people are itching, even in high circles. We need to throw this out.-At the same time, he criticized the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwar in the modern world, calling the conquest of territories stupid: -This is not the Middle Ages, when you captured a territory, you pay taxes, and okay - the world has changed, the world is different. Therefore, you shouldn‚Äôt set stupid tasks for yourself, and you should always think about what will happen next.-	https://t.me/astrapress/67130	2024-10-25T01:45:06-07:00

The man was wrapped up in front of his wife The day before at about 6 pm in the grocery store to see Dmitry [name changed at the request of relatives - approx. ASTRA] two men in civilian clothes approached (one of them is in the photo) and demanded to see documents. When asked to introduce themselves, one of them produced a document indicating that he was a military police officer. Dmitry asked them why, firstly, they were dressed -in civilian clothes-, and secondly, why they demanded documents from a civilian, to which they, according to Dmitry‚Äôs wife, allegedly replied that -the laws have changed and they have everyone has the right to check documents.- After this, Dmitry‚Äôs wife began filming what happened on her phone, to which the men threatened her with an article about -discrediting- the military and demanded that she stop filming. Following this, a group of security officers drove up to the store, grabbed Dmitry and put him in the car. -I ran after him, tried to pull him out. These men pushed me away, shoved me, my jacket tore. In the end, they pushed me into this -bobby- and I went with them. They brought him to the commandant‚Äôs office and I never saw him again,- Dmitry‚Äôs wife told ASTRA. The wife was told that a case was allegedly opened against the man for leaving his unit without permission, although Dmitry has Ukrainian citizenship, he did not sign the contract, he does not have a military ID, his wife says. As his wife clarified, Dmitry was still at the front: in February 2022 he was called from the enterprise and illegally mobilized, although he was not registered with the military. Dmitry was able to return home only in February 2023. -They consider him a military serviceman because he was there. As far as I know, a person who has a contract and a military ID can become a military man. And he is a citizen of Ukraine,- says his wife.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Russia at the end of 2023 turned to Musk with a request not to activate Starlink satellite communication terminals over Taiwan. This was done as a favor to China. Starlink currently does not have permission to provide Internet services in Taiwan, where authorities restrict foreign satellite operators. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told WSJ that the businessman spoke with Putin only once: they discussed space and technology. Musk himself also said in 2022 that he communicated with Putin only once in the spring of 2021.	https://t.me/astrapress/67122	2024-10-24T23:54:09-07:00

The event became the most representative from the point of view of the leaders of countries who arrived in Russia after the start of the war in UkraineFormally, the BRICS summit opens in Kazan on October 22 and ends on October 24, but official events began today. According to Vladimir Putin's assistant Yuri Ushakov, 36 delegations from states and six from international organizations will attend the summit. Of the leaders of the group's member countries, only Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who had previously suffered a head injury, did not attend the summit.

At the summit, a list of 13 candidate countries was agreed upon, but it was not disclosed. Also at the event, Putin was shown the proposed single currency of the BRICS member countries, although the head of the Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, did not value the banknote. The Economist wrote that one of the main objectives of this summit was the construction of a new global financial and payment system called BRICS Bridge, which is designed to -deal a blow to the US dominance in world finance- and -to protect Russia and its friends from&nbsp;sanctions-. The publication notes that this system will allow countries to conduct cross-border settlements using digital platforms managed by their central banks. Russia plans to build it within a year.

Three died there,- -former military prisoners on the run spoke about the punishments their colleagues were subjected to for failure to complete the task. Previously, ASTRA wrote about the military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gavethe order to move to a new point at night by mine fields. This time they told another incident from their service days. According to them, the deputy commander of the 109th regiment with the call sign -Caspian-, after one of the assaults, lined up 15 people who survived and returned from the mission. -Caspian- accused them of not completing their tasks, and the survival rate of prisoners supposedly should not exceed 2%. -We walked as many meters as they needed. Why he decided that they did not comply is unclear. And in the form of, so to speak, punishment, he decided to throw them into a pit. This is a cellar that closes. And he abandoned all the wounded. There was no food or water in this cellar. Well, maybe a bottle. Just so that they don‚Äôt just die of thirst and that‚Äôs it. Three wounded died immediately in the cellar. And the remaining twelve people, some wounded, some unharmed, he sent without weapons, without armor, without anything, to the assault immediately,- they said. According to them, no one survived after that assault. Among the dead, allegedly, were military men whom Trutnev and Ostrovsky knew personally: -Gram-, -French-, -Sanych-, -Karas- and -Ryzhiy-. As Trutnev and Ostrovsky clarified in a conversation with ASTRA, the name of the -Caspian Sea- is Umakhan. -In short, they kill their own people. If something went wrong there, it‚Äôs not like a commander.... People‚Äôs lives are not valued, in short,- the military added. Trutnev and Ostrovsky noted that if one of the relatives of the victims recognizes the call signs of their loved ones, they can contact them for information. -They are considered SOCH [those who left a part without permission - approx. ASTRA]. With us, until the body is pulled out, they are recorded in the SOC, not even in the -missing- category. They left in mid-July,- they added.Formerly military recorded a song about their commander -Prokop-: -At the cost of our lives you test your luck, drunk with the battalion commander you cut up the task. The boys die by shedding their blood. F*cked orders kill the boys. Fuck your own people more, just to be sure. Apparently, this is the whole task of the 109th Regiment-, as well as about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives: -I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and For fear of dying, I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there.

We now have a slightly different approach: the worse the family is socially, the better off the child will be, but for a person who gave his life for his homeland or became a disabled person of the first group, his child for some reason remains homeless. We need the child to understand: yes, the father accomplished a feat and died, but thanks to his feat I have an apartment, I live. This makes children patriotic.-Lvova-Belova called Kozhemyako‚Äôs words correct. -Unfortunately, when a father dies or becomes disabled, a mother has a difficult emotional state, so at this moment they really need support and what we do must necessarily extend to the families of participants in a special military operation -,&nbsp;- she said.	https://t.me/astrapress/66957	2024-10-22T23:30:27-07:00

About this toldhis mother Tatyana Gulevskaya. -During the next court hearing on August 12, 2024, to which the lawyer connected via video link, Grigory looked beaten and exhausted. The defense lawyer saw Sinchenko with bruises on his face: there were fresh hematomas under Grigory‚Äôs eyes, abrasions on his chin and lips, his whole face was swollen. The lawyer only had time to ask Grigory a question about his condition, after which the video link was immediately turned off,- Gulevskaya said. Two days later, the lawyer arrived at the pre-trial detention center, but he was not allowed to see Sinchenko and was given a note in which the prisoner said that he allegedly did not want to see him. At the next meeting on August 26, Sinchenko sat silently with his head down and admitted his guilt for the first time. Sinchenko's mother and lawyer believe that the man was tortured in order to extract a confession. The defense attorney never managed to get to Grigory after that meeting. A few months earlier, in May, Sinchenko declared a hunger strike and opened his veins. Sinchenko is accused of -espionage-, -sabotage- and other crimes committed in the -DPR- in 2016-2019. After his arrest in Donetsk in 2016, according to his mother, he was tortured with electric shocks, hung from the ceiling by his hands and strangled. Later in the exchange he returned to Ukraine. In 2019, he was detained again in his native Donetsk - after he blew up a mobile station and posted a video on YouTube with the caption: -This was done to draw attention to inhuman torture in the basements of the MGB. The people of Donbass must go out to protest against torture or the fascist republic will remain without communication.-In 2020, Sinchenko managed to escape from the detention center, but the man was recaptured.	https://t.me/astrapress/66942	2024-10-22T10:50:10-07:00

Moscow conscripts were forced to sign a form with access to state secrets Moscow college student told -Conscript School- that he and about 20 other young people were invited to the Unified Recruitment Point (EPP) in Moscow to -clarify military registration data,- where they received a questionnaire in which they were asked to sign under the clause on access to state secrets and responsibility for their dissemination. Admission to state secrets means a ban on leaving the country for up to 5 years after its termination. An attempt to leave the country while having access to state secrets is also a crime.-The requirements of the Moscow Military Commissariat to fill out the item on access to state secrets are illegal. Neither the law nor the Regulations on conscription for military service require this of conscripts. Access to state secrets is issued when a person must work with classified information. But this should only happen with the consent of the citizen. The exception is conscripts. They may be allowed access to state secrets without consent, since the military unit itself may be secret. The conscripts do not touch any state secrets,- human rights activists note. -Getting access to state secrets means that the military registration and enlistment office will have one more reason to make threats.

The commanders are hiding from their relatives and inviting them to evacuate the wounded themselvesWives and mothers of military personnel assigned to Lugansk military unit 40463 turned to Putin and Bastrykin with a request to help them find their missing relatives and conduct an investigation regarding the part. They told ASTRA that military personnel are disappearing en masse before they even arrive there. Here are the stories of just a few missing men: ‚ÄîAnton Golubov. Transferred to the unit on April 29, last contacted on May 1. He has been listed as missing since May 11. ‚Äî Nikita Kim. On September 6 he went on a combat mission and went missing on September 7. ‚ÄîMobilized Dmitry Sagin. Instead of the hospital, they were sent for the assault on July 13th. Disappeared on July 14. ‚Äî World of Kokoev. On August 17 he arrived at the unit, on August 20 he last contacted his relatives. Officially listed as missing since September 3. ‚Äî Alexey Pushkarsky, father of many children. Left on a mission on September 10, disappeared without a trace on September 18. ‚Äî Danil Kiryukhin. Illegally transferred to this military unit on July 26. Since August 3 - missing. ‚Äî Dmitry Muravyov. Sent to military unit 40463 after 2 weeks of training - July 18. Since July 31, Dmitry‚Äôs status has been missing. The relatives of the missing are not given any information, and the majority of those who apply do not even have notices that their relatives are missing. At the same time, some women claim that their husbands and sons were sent to unit 40463 either illegally or as -punishment.- Thus, Mir Kokoev was transferred there as a -penalty officer- after he demanded leave, which he should have been given last year. Most women are told by nameless representatives of the unit, hiding under their Telegram nicknames, that their loved ones stopped communicating after the drone attack. A relative of Mir Kokoev, when asked how the man disappeared, was told that he might-stayed to drink tea in a nearby dugout,-and when asked to evacuate, they even answered that she could pull him out on her own fighter. -The wounded are also not evacuated - only if the soldier himself has reached the zero point... At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry still does not know that my brother is missing,-‚Äî says the sister of the missing Dmitry Muravyov. Evacuation is not carried out even in those settlements over which the Russian Defense Ministry reported control - for example, Berestovoe, where another serviceman,Maxim Startsev, disappeared. The ASTRA editorial office was also contacted by relatives of the missing: Konstantin Polichov, Ivan Romanchenko, Daut Arslanov, Konstantin Ponamarev, Ruslan Kochetkov, Vladislav Sukharevsky, Alexey Razuev, Andrey Chigarkin, Maxim Antonov, Vakil Yaunbaev , Vladimir Danilov, Alexander Khlebinskikh, Ivan Gromachenko.According to the wives, the commander of the 1st MSB is considered to be a military man with the call sign -Cap-. For assaults, after which military personnel disappear en masse - certain -Greedy- and -Zolotoy-. Relatives know the name of only the political officer of the unit - Vitaly Bugaev. Relatives of the soldiers of the same military unit who disappeared in 2022 are already wrote a petition addressed to Putin. In it they demandedto -conduct an investigation into the concealment of information by the command of the military unit about our loved ones and find out their fate.- The ASTRA editors do not know whether there was any reaction to the appeal of loved ones. ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

Meduza gained access to the correspondence of employees of IK-6, ...	Meduza gained access to the correspondence of employees of IK-6, where Navalny was imprisoned. The letters indicate conditions of detention that were specially tightened for the politician - falsification of documents, censorship and a punishment cell for rolling up sleevesIn early August, the publication received from a source an archive of correspondence from employees of IK-6 (a maximum security colony in the village of Melekhovo Vladimir region, where Alexei Navalny spent most of his time), namely messages from the email of Ilya Kruglyshev, a lawyer who represented in the courts a maximum security penal colony in the village of Melekhovo. Letters about Navalny from his correspondence were sent out from May 2021 to February 2024. From today's publications it became clear: - In IK-6, documents were falsified to respond to Navalny‚Äôs claims about violations in the colony. For example, at the end of 2023, after Navalny disappeared, representatives of the Federal Penitentiary Service first explained his disappearance by power outages in the colony, then the lawyers were informed that the politician was no longer in IK-6. Three weeks later it turned out that he was transferred to a special regime colony in the village of Kharp in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, where he was subsequently killed. After this, the head of IK-6, Dmitry Nozhkin, reported on the reasons for Navalny‚Äôs transfer, saying that he was transferred to Kharp due to the entry into force of a new sentence. However, in the first version of the document signed by Nozhkin, something else was stated - the reason for Navalny‚Äôs stage was the instruction of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia No. 02-6477-dsp (-for official use-) received by IK-6. By excluding this instruction from the final version, the colony staff were able to hide it from the lawyers.- The colony staff closely monitored the lawyers and read all the letters that Navalny sent and received, especially after the posts appeared online on behalf of Navalny, information from which was not mentioned in the wiretapped conversations between the politician and his wife and mother. Then the workers of IK-6 concluded that Navalny was transmitting the text for publication to his associates through lawyers. In response, the employees sealed the transparent plexiglass covering the grille that separated lawyers and clients in the room where their meetings take place, and got rid of a special slot for the transfer of documents, which is why Navalny‚Äôs lawyers could not transfer to him the materials of new criminal cases cases brought against the politician while he was in prison. And the lawyers also could not show these papers.- Navalny recorded a noticeable increase in blood pressure - 140/90. Such readings could be a sign of arterial hypertension and a reason for starting drug therapy. Navalny was not prescribed medications to lower blood pressure in IK-6. According to the official version of Navalny‚Äôs death, it was the -critical increase in blood pressure- that became the -trigger- for the development of the -combined disease-, which allegedly led to the death of the politician in February 2024.&nbsp;- Navalny was held in a punishment cell more than 300 days in two years. On one occasion, he was sent there because he rolled up the sleeves of his robe, which was several sizes too small for him. Each time, before this punishment, prisoners must be examined by doctors - Navalny complained of pain in his back, stomach and hands, but he was still sent to the isolation ward. - April 17, 2023, two employees of IK-6 ;‚Äî Alexey Kukushkin and Vladimir Katalev beat Navalny because he -categorically refused to enter the cell- of the punishment cell. After the beating, as Meduza writes, Navalny was escorted to the cell where the convicted A.A. Tatarchenko, who was specially put in the same cell with Navalny, since Tatarchenko was homeless and did not take care of hygiene, which made it impossible to be in the same room with him.- In October 2023, Navalny told his lawyer Olga Mikhailova that -it seems like I‚Äôm being bullied here.- About the possible poisoning of Navalny in the colony also statedThe Insider journalists, who claimed that before Navalny‚Äôs death he was vomiting and complained of -sharp pain in the abdominal area.- However, this information disappeared from the official document about the causes of Navalny‚Äôs death.	https://t.me/astrapress/66845	2024-10-21T06:55:15-07:00

The rating of the most expensive Russian artists performing at state expense has gone viral on social networksHis compiled research project -Tenderscope- together with the RTVI editors, having analyzed public procurement with the names of specific artists. The most expensive artists were Yaroslav Dronov (Shaman), Grigory Leps and Oleg Gazmanov. For the performance of several songs at City Days and other regional holidays, the budget paid them from 5 to 16 million rubles.At the same time, the popularity of many of these artists is in doubt. For example, last month Shaman's commercial concerts canceled in several cities due to unsold tickets. Also the singer‚Äôs performance at a regional festival in the Stavropol Territory did not take place. The concert was canceled after a survey of the regional governor on social networks - the majority of subscribers opposed the holding of entertainment events, including Dronov's concert.Project team Tenderscope launched petitioncalling to reduce budget spending on artist fees and redirect the saved money to solve real social problems. The Orenburg fee, also Shaman, of 16.6 million rubles would be enough to pay 166 compensations to people who lost their homes as a result of the spring flood in the region.Leave a signature, forward this post to your friends and family or tell us about the petition on your social networks!	https://t.me/astrapress/66837	2024-10-21T04:45:06-07:00

Alexander Matkheev with mental retardation was added to the list of terrorists. Previously, he was sentenced to 10 years in the case of -high treason-, which ASTRA wrote about in its text. Rosfinmonitoring added 26-year-old Alexander Matkheev from the village of Osa, Ust-Ordynsky Buryat, to the list of terrorists and extremists districts with a diagnosis of -mild mental retardation-, writes the publication -People of Baikal-.Matkheyev was detainedDecember 22, 2023 in the Kemerovo region. The FSB accused him of trying to enter Ukraine to join the -Freedom of Russia Legion- of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Then he was charged with treason (Part 1 of Article 30, Article 275 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) and -organizing the activities of a terrorist organization- (Part 1 of Article 30, Part 2 of Article 205.5 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). As a result, Matkheev was sentenced to 10 years in this case. Later it turned out that the mentally disabled young man was going to send to the war in Ukraine, although he did not signa contract with the Ministry of Defense, which is, in principle, impossible for those convicted of -treason.- Read more about the story of Alexander Matkheev, who could not decide which side he was on in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in text ASTRA.
