Gazprom stopped supplying gas to Austria The supply of gas to the Austrian energy company OMV from Russia stopped on the morning of November 16, saidAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. The reason for this was the conflict over interrupted supplies in 2022. Austria received Russian gas through the Nord Stream gas pipeline, but in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, supply disruptions arose. Gazprom explained this by technical difficulties, in response, the Head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that -Russia is trying to blackmail Austria by stopping gas supplies.- Nehammer said the day before that the country -will not allow itself to be blackmailed.-Earlier, OMV filed a lawsuit against Gazprom and won more than ‚Ç¨243 million in damages. OMV decided to deduct this money from the payment for the existing contract. The company claims that it will replace Russian supplies with supplies from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as from other suppliers. According to DW, the Austrian corporation could deliberately come into conflict with the Russian one in order to break the contract valid until 2040, obliging it to purchase significant volumes of gas.	https://t.me/astrapress/68614	2024-11-16T08:55:17-08:00

Nobody cares what state you are in.- ASTRA found out new details of the military riot near NovosibirskASTRA managed to find another witness military riot in the unit under Novosibirsk. He asked for anonymity, but confirmed his words with documents (he himself has category -G-) and told the editors what preceded the escape of the military from military unit 57849 to Kochenevo. According to the editorial interlocutor, in the barracks of the military unit at the time the riot began there were -110-120 people, approximately no less than 100.- He himself ended up in barracks 57849 from unit 98551 in Abakan with another 45 people. -There were probably 8-10 people ready to go beyond the tape [that is, to the so-called -NWO- zone]. All the rest are sick, on crutches, inactive.- They were brought there on the night of November 8th. In the morning, sick military personnel began to write reports to the commander about the provision of medical care and military medical assistance, but these reports never went anywhere. -There was a guy [in barracks 57849], half a foot was missing on both legs. His military unit, I don‚Äôt know which one, fired him and gave him a commission. He was somehow pushed into this Kochanevskaya unit. And he was there for a month,- says ASTRA‚Äôs interlocutor. He retells the words representative of the commandant's office: -You are not being transferred here. Everyone is sent here. Bedridden, on stretchers, blind. Nobody cares what condition you are in.- According to the military man, he and his colleagues repeatedly asked for a doctor‚Äôs help: -We already realized that we couldn‚Äôt pass the Military Military Commissions, because everyone there was screaming, that you are all going to the 'SVO' zone.-For several days they asked the commandant of the Novosibirsk garrison and a representative of the military prosecutor's office to arrive. Due to inaction and refusal to even provide medical care, the military began a riot. According to the latest data, all participants in the escape from the military unit in Kochenevo on November 13 were detained, the Investigative Committee reported this evening. The editor's interlocutor especially noted one of the wounded - this is 36-lieutenant Alexander Andreev. An ASTRA source claims that Andreev lost the ability to speak after being wounded. -Lieutenant Andreev hears, but he is mute and communicates only using the telephone. He writes in notes and lets them read. You understand, he needs to learn sign language and he needs a phone now. And in this military unit, the phone is taken away - from 8 am to 8 pm. And people need help. He has one [right] hand only that works. Personally, I cut his nails. The situation is such that he constantly needs help - to open a jar, pour coffee. It might fall. Personally, I have been constantly with him since the 8th. Because of the wound, his head hurts and his eyes are watering - it feels like he has a constant fever.- Before unit 57849, Andreev was treated in neurology at the Abakan Clinical Hospital, where he was given category -G- (temporarily unfit). According to the latest information, Andreev was sent to Rostov-on-Don. Then he may return to the -NWO- zone.

She was found 3 kilometers from residential buildings.November 12 ASTRA reported about the fall of a half-ton FAB bomb near a residential building in the occupied city of Almaznaya in Lugansk region November 10. As a result, about 50 people were evacuated. The resident's home suffered damage to her garage and car. Before this, it became known that on October 28, a Russian plane dropped a bomb on a village 6 km from Belgorod. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 148 cases of FAB aerial bombs falling in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the shells are destroyed by explosives experts after the fact. Such adjustable air bombs The Russian Armed Forces use for attacks, in particular, on Donetsk and Kharkov regions - as well as city Kharkov.ü´® Supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech:PatreonBoostyCrypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/68455	2024-11-14T04:30:52-08:00

According to him, the reason was the assault on Belogorovka in the Seversky direction, where about 200 soldiers were missing in the infantry alone. In the assault, according to the source, about 100 tankers were killed and injured. Before this, the assault was widely discussed in Z-channels. According to them, on November 2, Kashtan sent 3 motorized rifle battalions and one tank battalion on an unprepared frontal assault. As a result, -great losses- were suffered.The fact that the -butcher brigade commander- was being removed was indirectly confirmed by Z-blogger Yuri Podolyaka. -Systematic deceptions have finally been exposed, and the command from above is looking for the culprits. As I understand it, so as not to become guilty ourselves (I am sure that many people, even higher than the brigade commander-inventor, were involved in the topic of deception). And therefore, all these recent imaginary successes of ours in Serebryanka-Grigoryevka and Vernekamensky can be -painted back.- To understand the real situation at the moment, Belogorovka is now almost entirely under the enemy,- he wrote.At the same time, according to an ASTRA source, he led the meat assault not -Kashtan- himself, but -Cap-,- commander of the 1st SME of the 123rd brigade of military unit 40463 Alexey Korchagin. ASTRA previously published audio recording of torture, presumably by electric shock from an army phone, of a man from military unit 40463, which the relatives of the missing soldier found on his phone. Korchagin‚Äôs voice was recognized on audio by one of the military men who served under his leadership. He stated that Korchagin is -a real sadist.- It is he who commands the assault units in the 123rd brigade. Previously, ASTRA talked about those who disappeared without a trace in Lugansk part 40463, not managed to get there. Loved ones of missing soldiers said that military personnel are disappearing en masse just a few days after their arrival. Among those listed there were prisoners from Volgograd colonies.

The names of the suspects were not named in the 60 Minutes program, however, they still managed to find out something about them.

Those accused of smuggling 200 kg of cocaine went to war instead of trialThe court in St. Petersburg suspended the case of drug sales on an especially large scale (Article 30 and Part 5 of Art. 228.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) against Alexander Markov and Dmitry Antipov. They signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense and are going to war in Ukraine, the press service of the courts of St. Petersburg reported. In 2023, Markov and Antipov were caught with a cache of 200 kg of cocaine in the Big Port of St. Petersburg. The briquettes bore the emblem of the Rolls-Royce automobile brand. The media wrote that the stamp with the logo of a prestigious car brand on the briquettes may indicate the good quality of the cocaine.The indictment states that the cargo left the city of Paita in Peru in February, after which it arrived at the Belgian port of Antwerp and there was reloaded onto a ship that sailed to St. Petersburg. Investigators calculated that -at the time of the arrest of the accused, the cost of 1 gram of cocaine was 15,000 rubles.- Thus, the cost of the drug shipment was about 3 billion rubles. Markov and Antipov took advantage of the law adopted in September to stop criminal prosecution of defendants if they enter into a contract for military service. Kommersant wrote that they did not admit guilt.	https://t.me/astrapress/68258	2024-11-11T10:37:57-08:00

After an inspection, the regional Ministry of Social Protection of the Population and Labor deprived 173 people of rent compensation due to suspicions of fraud. About this at a meeting of the regional government said the head of the department, Elena Batanova. The check was random. -Firstly, the owners themselves lived at the addresses, that is, they know nothing about this person who presented this agreement. There are times when people say that they did not rent out this property, and we have no idea who they are. There are cases when office buildings are located at this address, when they previously rented, but moved out a long time ago, they just moved out, when the apartments clearly do not bear the signs of a residential building, because there are simply no doors, no handles, no locks. The apartments have been sealed,- said Batanova.In total, since the beginning of the year, more than 138 million rubles have been paid to residents of the Belgorod region for rent, with a total of 3,683 people receiving compensation.	https://t.me/astrapress/68254	2024-11-11T08:18:04-08:00

A prototype of the Russian mobilization database became publicly availableIn June 2024, on website for launching online presentations ppt-online.org a presentation of a certain -technological database- with the emblem of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was uploaded. In the fall, this document found by Meduza reader. Probably, the presentation contains a prototype of some kind of system for registering Russians subject to mobilization. As Meduza notes, there is no unconditional evidence of the authenticity of this presentation, however, even this document contains some important information.So, in addition to the expected personal data such as full name, passport number, information about work, place of residence, health and etc. the presentation contains the contribution -Priority information of military personnel- - apparently, this means -Military records-. It contains information whether the Russian subject to mobilization has the rights of a tractor driver, a medical education or a sports reserve. And also whether the person has children or other persons in their care. Meduza writes that, presumably, military registration and enlistment office employees will rely on this information when deciding whether to send a mobilization summons. At the front, drivers and doctors are obviously needed - and Russians with many children have the right to a deferment. The presentation was created in a pirated version of Microsoft Office by a user under the name -GVTs-2- - the Main Computer Center of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation has an identical abbreviation, working under the command of the General Staff and engaged, among other things, in guiding missiles for attacks on Ukraine.	https://t.me/astrapress/68249	2024-11-11T06:10:43-08:00

A new criminal case was opened against Zarema Musaeva for -disorganizing the activities of the colony-Against the wife of a retired federal judge, Saydi Yangulbaeva, the mother of human rights activists and oppositionists Abubakar, Ibragim and Baysangur Yangulbaev and Zarema Musayeva opened a criminal case in the colony. The woman is suspected of disrupting the activities of institutions that ensure isolation from society (Part 2 of Article 321 of the Criminal Code), reported -Team Against Torture- with reference to lawyer Alexander Savin.According to this article, 55-year-old Musaeva faces up to five years in prison. At the same time, the likelihood of a new case became known at the end of October, when the woman was interviewed by an investigator from the Investigative Committee. He came to the colony settlement in the city of Argun, where she is serving her sentence. Musaeva says she was questioned because she allegedly attacked a Federal Penitentiary Service officer who accompanied her on daily trips to the hospital. Zarema denies these accusations and says that she physically could not attack the security officer. In addition, the woman suffers from a chronic disease - she has insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, and she has to use a cane to move.Zarema Musaeva was abducted by Chechen police in Nizhny Novgorod in January 2022. According to investigators, she scratched the face of one of them. On July 4, 2023, the Akhmatovsky District Court of Grozny sentenced Zarema Musaeva to 5.5 years in prison in a general regime colony for -using violence against a government official,- but later her sentence was reduced to 4 years and 9 months. The European Court concluded that the persecution of the elderly woman was exclusively political and was explained by the opposition activities of her sons. Therefore, the ECHR awarded 52 thousand euros in compensation to Musaeva.	https://t.me/astrapress/68243	2024-11-11T03:40:14-08:00
