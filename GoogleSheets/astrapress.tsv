üñº Crimea may be poisoned by fuel oil as early as New Year‚Äôs Eve ...	Crimea may be poisoned by fuel oil as early as New Year‚Äôs Eve - scientist about eco-disaster in the Black SeaGeorgy&nbsp;Kavanosyan&nbsp;is a hydrogeologist who has been working on environmental problems for 10 years. Since the beginning of the environmental disaster in the Black Sea, he, together with a group of scientists led by Doctor of Science Sergei Zatsepa working to improve a computer model that can predict the consequences of fuel oil pollution in Cherny sea.&nbsp;-Based on this model, we can roughly predict where the pollution will go several days in advance. We predicted the previous behavior of the pollution spot quite accurately. Over the past few days, a very strong northeast wind blew with gusts of more than 20-25 meters per second, and the pollution went southwest along the southern coast of Crimea. If the wind suddenly changes to the southeast, then Alushta, Feodosia, Sudak and Yalta itself will be poisoned by fuel oil on New Year‚Äôs Eve,- says the scientist.&nbsp;At the same time, Kavanosyan looks at the long term relatively optimistic about the current situation:&nbsp;-We are very lucky - if such a word can be used in relation to an environmental disaster. At the moment, the migration of the main commercial fish species has already taken place. Marine mammals also left with them. We have three species of dolphins in the Black Sea, all of them are listed in the Red Book. We are on the shore foundprobably more than 10, but less than 20 dead dolphins, but 95% of them did not die from fuel oil. They died earlier, but they were washed ashore along with the fuel oil. There are practically no cases in the literature of dolphins dying from hydrocarbons. It‚Äôs just that such populations get sick more often.-&nbsp;The same -luck-, according to the ecologist, can be called the situation with birds. Today we can assume that the number of birds caught in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpollution is approximately 2000. If a westerly wind had blown, the fuel oil stain could have reached the Taman Bay, where the Tamano-Zaporozhye Nature Reserve is located.&nbsp;- There are 500-600 thousand birds there at this time of year. A bunch of swans. It would have been a catastrophe of a completely different nature. Everything listed in the Red Book, everything rare, everything that is valuable, it is located 50 meters from the shore. The fuel oil did not reach there,- says Kavanosyan.&nbsp;According to the scientist, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe southern ecosystem, where many oil-processing bacteria live, the sea will be able to cleanse itself naturally in 5-6 years.&nbsp;-I see, of course, pickled benthos. There's a lot of it. Rapana, shells, and crabs cannot escape anywhere. -Everyone who lives on two will not run away,- the scientist sums up.&nbsp;The main attention is now directed precisely to scientific developments, because in essence the methods for eliminating such a catastrophe and the capacities necessary for this no neither in Kuban, nor in neighboring regions, nor in the country as a whole.-The most important work is happening today in the scientific community. The fuel oil is stratified. The hard part fell to the bottom. The lung washed ashore. It contains more than 50% volatile hydrocarbons. That is why you should never remove fuel oil without a mask. And scientists - my native Moscow State University, Gain, Skoltech - are working to obtain suitable sorbents that would not harm the environment,- says Kavanosyan.&nbsp;At the same time, he notes also problems with the system itself. In principle, there are no protocols for eliminating such disasters, and management is always several days late. So, if not for the delay at the beginning of the tragedy, the fuel oil would not have gone deep into the sand. About what we are talking about federal level of emergency was clear to many in advance, but at the regional level the authorities were simply powerless to make a decision on recognizing the disaster as a -federal emergency.- In this regard, Kavanosyan separately emphasizes the importance of civil society:&nbsp;-That is, we are trying as a civil society to influence the situation, because the regional authorities have no experience in eliminating such disasters. And some representatives of civil society have. For example, this is the fourth such accident in my practice. And practically everything here is taken out by volunteers.-	https://t.me/astrapress/71433	2024-12-30T03:43:01-08:00

The commander ordered the military man to shoot at the legs of his fellow soldiers so that they would continue to carry out the combat mission, and personally set up minefields for them. The subordinate refused to do this and ended up in prison in Zaitsevo A contract worker from Naro-Fominsk ended up in illegal basement for -refuseniks- in Zaitsevo in -LPR- togetherwith three colleagues. The reason is to contact the prosecutor's office about the illegal actions of the commanders. Now they themselves are under threat of criminal charges for -failure to comply with orders.- Wife of a serviceman from Naro-Fominsk Dmitry [name changed - approx. ASTRA], who serves in military unit 91701 423 motorized rifle regiment of the 4th Guards Tank Division, told ASTRA that the commander of the assault detachment with the call sign -Luna- set up minefields for those who wanted to return from a combat mission. On September 12, -Luna- sent Anna‚Äôs husband to storm Stelmakhovka in the -LPR.- When he set out on a mission, he found three colleagues in the trench with shrapnel wounds and reported this to Luna. He, according to Dmitry, told him: -Let them go out as they want and without electronic warfare cover.- A day later, -Luna- himself appeared at the position. He stated that many soldiers were retreating and that Dmitry needed to open fire on them. He refused.-Then on the legs, and let them crawl out of here wounded,- -Luna- answered him. Dmitry also did not fulfill this order. Another day later, -Luna- informed all groups that were carrying out the combat mission that he personally installed a tripwire and -mined the retreat passage, even for the wounded.-On September 17, Dmitry returned to the landing , where his colleagues were beaten by the senior group with the call sign -Kizlyar-. He sent the two of them to a concrete pillbox in the middle of a field, buried in the ground to a depth of 4 meters, where a gas pipe runs. At that time, 8 military men were already sitting there. Two days later, a mortar fired in this area, but even after that the military was not released from the basement. Dmitry stayed there for 5 days. All this time, the prisoners slept on bare concrete and went to the toilet in bottles. September 22 Dmitry and junior lieutenant Alexey [name changed - approx. ASTRA] were released from the basement. They - two officers - and two privates were lined up and a report was read out about their failure to comply with orders in the presence of an -interrogator- with the call sign -Bely-. After this, they were asked if they were ready to go on the mission. They answered: -Yes.- After being in the basement, the man spent 5 days in the medical unit, while at the same time digging a dugout for the commanders, where they decided to equip themselves with a -gym.- Then he and his colleagues were sent to an illegal basement in Zaitsevo, and from there they were assigned to another military unit. On October 7, Dmitry informed the prosecutor of Starobelsk that he wanted to testify against Luna and Kizlyar, adding that he feared for his life and health. -It later turned out that the political officer of the assault detachment -Lednik- -- former judge and prosecutor n.p. Starobelsk are classmates, and my husband began to worry that this case would not be allowed to proceed and they would try to hush everything up,- says Anna. A month later, on November 7, the assistant prosecutor summoned Dmitry and his three colleagues for questioning. Afterwards they stopped communicating with their loved ones. Anna learned that her husband was being held in Zaitsevo from a military man who came out of this basement and saw her husband there. At the military unit, the woman is told that her husband is there for -failure to follow orders.- -My husband served his Motherland faithfully and honestly, he has 2 awards -For Courage- and a Zhukov medal, he did not do anything illegal, he only refused to carry out a criminal order and did not keep silent about it, he wanted to achieve justice, but instead he was handcuffed and taken to an unofficial prison,- says Anna‚Äôs numerous appeals to the departments. So far, she has only received a response from the RF Ministry of Defense - that no one sent the wounded on missions, evacuation was carried out, and her husband was called in for questioning as a witness regarding the alleged extortions from the officer - Alexei - who was sitting together with him in a concrete pit.Previously, ASTRA found evidence the existence of 20 places for holding and torturing military personnelin the occupied territories (some of them are no longer work).	https://t.me/astrapress/71417	2024-12-29T23:11:32-08:00
