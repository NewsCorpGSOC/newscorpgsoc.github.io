How do you feel about your owner, what do you like, what don‚Äôt like, what are you afraid of, what do you dream about,- reports the pro-Kremlin publication Shot. However, this creative exercise caused dissatisfaction among some parents. They considered the task -creative quadrobing- and appealed to the director of the lyceum with complaints. In addition, after the situation was written about in the press, people began to be indignant that the teacher‚Äôs name is Aruvkhan Vazirovna: -Is it in your lyceum that migrant teachers force children to bark like dogs from Turgenev‚Äôs text Mu-mu?

The Ministry of Education of the Moscow Region took the woman's side. Department explained that such a task helps children develop emotional intelligence and analyze the feelings of literary characters. State Duma deputy Vitaly Milonov also joined the discussion: he called the parents‚Äô claims unfounded and proposed organizing an open lesson for them to explain the content of Turgenev‚Äôs work.

The fact that the signature was fake was confirmed by an examination20-year-old conscript Nikita Molochkovsky from the Sakhalin region died in the war. Before that, he sued the Ministry of Defense over a false contract. As a result, the court refused to satisfy the claim, and the criminal case based on his claim was completely closed by the Investigative Committee. Sources Siberia.Realii, familiar with the matter, reported that the Institute of Forensic Expertise and Criminalistics has established that a signature in a military contract is in the name of Nikita Molochkovsky does not belong to him. -Can you imagine what they are doing?! The criminal case on forgery of signatures was closed when the examination proving the falsification was already ready. In the refusal they wrote that he was in the Kuril Islands, and not in the unit in Khabarovsk. Although his family was visiting at that time in the Khabarovsk part. They lie at every step - they also say that Molochkovsky‚Äôs personal file was not found. Why look for it? It lies in the military registration and enlistment office of his native Okha,- say the relatives of the deceased.The young man was sent to war on July 7, and already in August he went missing in the Donetsk region. In addition, relatives of the conscript told the Window project that -all conscripts from Nikita‚Äôs company- were sent to the war in this way - under fake contracts.	https://t.me/astrapress/70084	2024-12-11T06:20:17-08:00

In London, Russian agents wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev and editor-in-chief of The Insider Roman Dobrokhotov, -BBC and TelegraphA group of five Bulgarian citizens arrested in 2023 are suspected of spying for Moscow for at least three years, the BBC and Telegraph report, citing case materials. They are accused of participating in intelligence collection operations in the UK, Germany, Austria, Spain and Montenegro.At the trial in a London court, it became known that a group of agents planned to kidnap the editor-in-chief of The Insider, Roman Dobrokhotov. The operation, called Operation Fishing Boat, involved a plan to smuggle the journalist out of the UK by boat. In addition to kidnapping, the defendants also considered more radical measures, such as staging Dobrokhotov‚Äôs death, for example, as a result of an accident. However, these ideas were abandoned, considering them ineffective. In addition, the men wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev, the publications write. The investigation claims that one of the coordinators of the operation was the Austrian businessman Jan Marsalek, associated with Russian intelligence. The cell was led by Orlin Rusev. In addition to Rusev, the group also included Bizer Dzhambazov, Katrin Ivanova, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir Ivanchev. Rusev and Dzhambazov have already pleaded guilty to espionage. The remaining defendants continue to deny the charges. Previously, journalists from The Insider and Bellingcat published high-profile investigations, including about the assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The investigation claims that Russian intelligence saw Dobrokhotov as a threat and assigned the cell to monitor him, as well as his colleague Hristo Grozev.In the picture, from left to right: Vanya Gaberova, court employee, Katrin Ivanova, court employee and Tihomir Ivanchev at the Old Bailey	https://t.me/astrapress/70035	2024-12-10T23:37:17-08:00

If this had been done, residents of the Kursk region would not have contacted the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation with complaints,- - he wrote on VKontakte, drew the attention of -7x7-. Firsov added that he turned to the prosecutor's office with a request to check the actions of the authorities. Previously it was reported that about 24 thousand people applied for housing certificates. Prior to this, the head of the Kursk region, Smirnov, issued the first two certificates to military wives. This happened after the protests.

Zamanov was surprised to learn that he was now a military man and asked for his number. In his personal account on the Ministry of Defense website, he actually found his profile. He has not received a single payment since May for signing the contract - because the bank details are not his. After Zamanov told the selection point employee, Sergeant Vladimir Lelyuk, about this, he stopped calling the man, and could not answer questions about whose account the salary was coming to. Zamanov told ASTRA that he changed his mind about going to war because of his seven-year-old son, and also because -he doesn‚Äôt want to kill people.- According to him, he needs to report to the selection point before December 9.

In such a short period of time to kill 60 people‚Ä¶-one of the fighters‚Äô wives told ASTRA. -We demand, we write collective letters to the President, the Minister of Defense, asking for help so that this chaos stops, so that they stop throwing boys to slaughter. To help with equipment... We just returned from Ukraine a couple of days ago, ordered socks, shovels, and groceries. We ourselves sit down and go, because there is nothing there. Everything they have is bought with their own money,- she added. At the same time, according to another wife of a fighter, her mobilized husband was sent into the assault because he refused to pay money to the commanders. -My husband was in the artillery. A person who doesn‚Äôt just want to pay money‚Äîlet‚Äôs say the management needs a car, or something else‚Äîthey send them to death assault. My husband was mobilized and served quietly for a year and a half. They had to give him a report on the medal, and for this they set a price of 500 thousand rubles. He said he wouldn't pay. He was sent into the assault. He‚Äôs been lying there for 5 months now, there‚Äôs no way to pick him up,- she said. According to the women, among the leadership of the unit there are three commanders responsible for -lawlessness- and -extortions- - these are Konstantin Porosyuk, Viktor Vorobyov and S. Osaulenko. -They have a field bank -Luchi-, and, as far as I know, they transfer money to their cards from fighters whose relatives are not looking for them. The social payment - 158 thousand - was not given, citing the fact that it no longer exists. They open a card for a dead soul and throw money there. 3 million for injuries too. If you want a legal vacation, pay 320 thousand,- they say. -In general, the guys themselves reset themselves. Porosyuk killed 168 people in just 2 weeks. He says: -I don‚Äôt need 300, I need all 200.- When the guys arrive, in a state of shock, he sends them back. He asks them: -Well, couldn‚Äôt the heroes lie there and die in the fields?- This is the main thug there,- the interlocutors claim. ASTRA had photographs of Porosyuk, Vorobyov and Osaulenko at its disposal.Earlier today ASTRA wrote about how the military from the unit 09332, patients with hepatitis and cancer, are being forced to return to the war. This is not the first time such complaints have been received. In August, about being sent to the front in handcuffs told 25-year-old Alexander Belov, who is undergoing treatment. According to Belov, he was assigned to a medical unit with a crutch, where he was forced to dig dugouts on the line of combat contact.üå± Subscribe to ASTRA.

This happened at the end of August this year. An employee of the -DNS- equipment supermarket reported that an unknown person took the speaker away from the store in broad daylight. The damage amounted to a little more than 12 thousand rubles. According to ASTRA, the suspect is 36-year-old resident of Stary Oskol Alexander Shcherbinin. Apparently, the military man was on leave at the time of the theft. A criminal case has been initiated against him under Part 1 of Art. 158 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

ASTRA: Tucker Carlson said that he flew to Russia for an interview with Sergei Lavrov InterviewSergei Lavrov to journalist Tucker Carlson. The main theses of the Russian Foreign Minister:On the death of Alexei Navalny: -During his imprisonment, he continued to be ill. Therefore, we constantly asked Germany (where Navalny was treated after poisoning in Russia - Ed.) to show us the results of their research. Because our studies did not show what theirs showed (that he was poisoned - Ed.). So I don‚Äôt know what they (the Germans - Ed.) did with him.-On Russia‚Äôs conditions for a truce with Ukraine: -We are ready to negotiate on the basis of principles , which were agreed upon in Istanbul and rejected by (former British Prime Minister - Ed.) Johnson at the request of the head of the Ukrainian delegation Arakhamia. The key principle is Ukraine's non-aligned status. We were ready to join the group of countries that would provide guarantees of the collective security of Ukraine... No NATO. No military bases, military exercises on Ukrainian soil with the participation of foreign troops. This is what he (Putin - Ed.) repeated.-About sanctions: -Many in Russia would like this (for the lifting of sanctions to be one of the conditions for a truce - Editor's note). But the more we live under sanctions, the more we understand that it is better to rely on ourselves, to develop mechanisms and platforms for interaction with countries friendly to us, which do not interfere with economic interests and political ones. Obama began introducing sanctions, Trump continued, and under Biden they reached an unprecedented level. But everything that doesn't kill us makes us stronger, you know? They can't kill us, so they make us stronger.-On whether Russia can become part of the West again: -No, I don‚Äôt think so.-About Trump: -A very strong man. A person who wants results. A person who doesn't like to procrastinate. He is open to discussion. But this does not make him pro-Russian. When he was president, he imposed many, many, many sanctions against us. So we will wait for the inauguration.-	https://t.me/astrapress/69786	2024-12-05T21:00:05-08:00

Three aerial bombs dropped Russian planes in the Belgorod region in one dayAs ASTRA sources in the region‚Äôs emergency services told us, last week, on Friday, November 29, Russian airborne forces dropped immediately three FABs for the Belgorod region. One of them -went down unexpectedly- near a residential building in the village of Veselaya Lopan, Belgorod region, more than 30 km from the border with Ukraine. No injuries or damage were avoided. Another aerial bomb fell into a field 7 km from the village of Bessonovka. The third FAB of the day was found in the village of Dragunskoye. This time the ammunition fell in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe substation, 3 kilometers from residential buildings. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 162 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19 a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69779	2024-12-05T08:20:29-08:00
