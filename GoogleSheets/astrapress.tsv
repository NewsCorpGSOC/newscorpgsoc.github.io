Zarema Musayeva will remain in custody until March 26Today, February 20, the Sheikh-Mansurovsky District Court of Grozny extended the preventive measure for Zarema Musayeva, leaving her in custody until March 26. It was expected that by this time her term of imprisonment in the first criminal case should have expired - March 23, 2025.However, a new criminal case was opened against Musaeva. She is accused of disorganizing the activities of a colony (Part 3, Article 321 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), for which she could face up to five years in prison.Musaeva‚Äôs lawyer, Alexander Savin, said that her client continues to have health problems, including due to diabetes. She was recently prescribed treatment for a leg joint, as she has been walking on crutches for a long time due to complications.Zarema Musaeva was abducted by Chechen police in Nizhny Novgorod in January 2022. According to investigators, she scratched the face of one of them. On July 4, 2023, the Akhmatovsky District Court of Grozny sentenced Zarema Musayeva to 5.5 years in prison in a general regime colony for -using violence against a representative of the authorities,- but later it was reduced to four years and nine months.The European Court concluded that the persecution of the elderly woman is exclusively political and is explained by the opposition activities of her sons.

The exercise commander was fined two hundred thousand rubles for an explosion at the training ground that injured two cadets The Vladimir Garrison Military Court fined Captain Denis Vonotkov, commander of the military training tank regiment, two hundred thousand rubles Part 30616-7, in a case of violation of the rules for handling weapons, resulting in serious harm to health (Part 1 of Article 349 of the Criminal Code). Mediazona reports this with reference to the press service of the court. During exercises at the Sergeytsevo training ground, Vonotkov tied together imitation IM-100 cartridges in pairs, intensifying the explosion. He did not fence off the dangerous area and incorrectly calculated the distance, which is why the explosion occurred under the rear of the infantry fighting vehicle, where the cadets were located. As a result, Zemskov received a mine explosion injury with severe injuries, and Ivashchenko received fractures and hematomas. -This explosion stunned him [Ivashchenko], and he experienced a state of shock, the doors of the BMP-1 opened from the blast wave, he fell on his back from the landing compartment to the ground, after which he began to shout -really the 300th,- pointing his finger inside the landing compartment of the BMP-1, since he realized that [Zemskov] had suffered bodily harm,- the verdict says. Vonotkov admitted guilt, but refused to comment.In 2020, a junior sergeant died at the same training ground, receiving a through wound to the chest. Then the court imposed a two-year suspended sentence on the leader of the shooting.	https://t.me/astrapress/74973	2025-02-20T09:55:01-08:00

A resident of Cherepovets was denied an abortion in all medical institutions in the city A 38-year-old resident of Cherepovets, Natalya (name changed), was denied an abortion in antenatal clinics in the city, as well as in private clinics in Cherepovets and Vologda. According to the woman, medical institutions in the region actually stopped providing this service without official explanation. -I live in the Cherepovets region, I have three children, my youngest daughter is three years old. I planned to go to work, but found out I was pregnant. I contacted a doctor at my place of residence, but I was told that he was not responsible for performing abortions. In a private clinic they did an ultrasound, set the period at eight weeks and explained that medical termination of pregnancy at this stage is no longer possible,- Natalya told the Rech newspaper. After this, the woman tried to sign up for an operation at the city maternity hospital, but was refused. -Yesterday was the last day we performed abortions. From today we have no right,- they told her over the phone.She received a similar answer in other antenatal clinics in the city. During a personal visit to one of the consultations, Natalia was explained that at the regional level a decision had been made to recommend that all women under 50 years of age continue pregnancy. However, she was not provided with any official documents, and she was not given a written refusal to have an abortion. Later, the woman turned to the official community of the maternity hospital on the social network VKontakte with a request to explain the reasons for the refusal. In response, she was informed that -termination of pregnancy is carried out only for medical reasons in a 24-hour hospital- and that this issue is regulated at the level of the government of the Vologda region. The couple considered the possibility of leaving the child, but came to the conclusion that they would not be able to provide for him morally and financially. -My husband already works three jobs. I spent ten years on maternity leave, and now I wanted to return to my professional activities,- explained Natalya. As a result, the woman had to go to a private clinic in the Yaroslavl region, where they agreed to carry out the operation without restrictions. The cost of the procedure was about nine thousand rubles.	https://t.me/astrapress/74962	2025-02-20T08:14:45-08:00

A monument to Stalin will not be erected in Kaliningrad because of his repressions and terror The head of the Kaliningrad administration, Elena Dyatlova, rejected the proposal of the local branch of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation to erect a monument to Joseph Stalin, citing historical documents condemning the cult of personality and political repression. In a response published on the party‚Äôs website, Dyatlova noted that the installation of monuments should not lead to conflicts in society, and recalled the 1956 resolution of the CPSU Central Committee -On overcoming the cult of personality and its consequences,- as well as the law -On the rehabilitation of victims of political repression.- She emphasized that the period from the 1930s to the early 1950s is recognized as the time of Stalinist repressions, and many years of terror and persecution of citizens of the USSR were condemned as incompatible with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaw and justice.The Communist Party of the Russian Federation called Dyatlova‚Äôs position -a clear anti-Soviet position aimed at denigrating Soviet history and the great feat of the people.- The head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction in the Legislative Assembly of the Kaliningrad Region, Maxim Bulanov, said that, in his opinion, the mayor is trying to whitewash his incompetence and inaction, which led to the deplorable state of the city. He emphasized that the party will not allow history to be rewritten and evaded responsibility.In recent years, monuments to Stalin have been erected regularly in Russia. These include busts and full-length monuments. In November-December 2024 alone, three monuments to Stalin were erected - in the Primorsky Territory, in North Ossetia and in the Vologda region. There are more than a hundred of them in total.Elena Dyatlova has held the post of mayor of Kaliningrad since November 2020 and at the same time heads the city branch of the United Russia party.	https://t.me/astrapress/74937	2025-02-20T03:19:15-08:00

They gave the most precious thing - their lives, so that we could live in a free state. It was during these days of 2014 that Russia chose war and began the first steps to occupy Crimea. While people were being killed in Kyiv, and people were defending their freedom, Putin decided to strike another blow - a very vile one. Since then, the world has been living in a new reality, where Russia is trying to deceive everyone. And it is very important not to give in, to be together.

Because of this, people cannot buy housing. In addition, residents say that 150 thousand rubles, which were paid one-time to people who lost property, turned out to be -disproportionate to the damage.- Therefore, they are asking for a monthly payment of 65 thousand rubles, as was done for the residents of Kursk.-Our village has actually been erased from the map, but we remain citizens of Russia and ask not for alms, but for justice.

Trump called Zelensky a -dictator without elections- and accused him of greedHe wrote about this on his social network Truth Social.-Just think: the relatively successful comedian Vladimir Zelensky persuaded the United States to spend $350 billion on a war that cannot be won and should not have been started in the first place. But this is a war that he will never be able to end without US help,- the American president wrote.He also claims that Zelensky -admits- that half of the -money sent to him is ‚Äòlost‚Äô.--He refuses to hold elections, has low ratings in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he has succeeded in is playing Biden like a doll. A dictator without elections - Zelensky better hurry up, otherwise he won‚Äôt have a country left at all. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia‚Äîsomething that everyone agrees only my administration and I can do.

According to the publication, three border service officers are in her apartment and gave her four hours to choose a country to leave. Latvian security forces called the reason for the deportation a -security threat.- Earlier that same day, Chashchilova received another decision from the Latvian authorities, according to which she had a month to challenge the deportation, but this document was declared invalid. Chaschilova worked with human rights organizations, including OVD-Info and the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives. In January 2024, Important Stories published an investigation about her, calling into question her biography, diplomas and professional activities. The material alleged that Chashchilova used a fake diploma, edited entries in the work book and a fictitious biography, and was also allegedly interested in information about the publication‚Äôs employees and their sources. The investigation was based on negative reviews from her ex-husband and acquaintances, as well as a number of unreliable facts in Chashchilova‚Äôs interview, such as her failed trip to Ukraine. -Important Stories- also tried to connect her with the unproven poisoning of the head of Free Russia, Natalia Arno. The Conscious Objector Movement, where Chashilova now works, also stated that they found no reason for mistrust. She may face persecution in Russia for her work with LGBT activists.	https://t.me/astrapress/74870	2025-02-19T08:14:24-08:00

In the Moscow region, residents of Tomilino protested against the construction of a toll backup for Yegoryevskoye HighwayAccording to the authorities‚Äô plans, the route should connect the Moscow Ring Road and the Central Ring Road. Locals are worried that the four-lane road will destroy the ecosystem and infrastructure of the village, and the government of the Moscow region assures that it will help relieve congestion on the Yegoryevskoye Highway and improve transport accessibility for more than two million people.-Who will it make life easier for? Obviously not our village,- local resident Evgeniy told RTVI. He claims that the new alternate route will -divide- Tomilino, depriving people of convenient routes and destroying important facilities such as schools and clinics.According to the project, the route will stretch 36 km through the Lyubertsy district and Ramenskoye and will cost 110 billion rubles. The authorities promise that the route will be located at a distance of 50-65 meters from the nearest houses and will be fenced with noise barriers, but locals are skeptical about these statements.-We have old houses, during construction they will simply collapse and turn into emergency ones. We will all be homeless,- a local resident added to RTVI.The project is criticized by environmentalists, saying that the decision will affect not only the ecosystem, but also people‚Äôs health.-The strategic importance of Moscow‚Äôs green shield is priceless.

ASTRA: -Not a basement, but a specially equipped bomb shelter.- An ambulant resident of the Krasnodar Territory was sent from a Donetsk basement on a combat mission Earlier ASTRA wrote about a resident of Novokubansk, Krasnodar Territory, Ilya Arnold, who from the colony went to the war with Ukraine and ended up in military unit 41698, 5th brigade of the 3rd motorized rifle battalion, company -B-. He was wounded in the battle, the hospital did not treat him, he was put in a basement, from which, as it turned out, he was again sent to the line of combat contact. The man‚Äôs mother, Olga Arnold, told ASTRA about this. She learned that her disabled son was wounded at the front from the military prosecutor of Donetsk Sergei Ivanov (whether this is his real name is unknown). At the same time, a day earlier, the employee said that he sent his assistant to check Ilya‚Äôs condition, but did not find him there. -The prosecutor told me that my son was not found at the location that my son had previously given me. He said he was sent on a combat mission. Tell me where else the mother needs to go to report that the man was wounded, he could not walk, his knee did not bend. What combat mission was he sent on?!- ‚Äî the mother of a serviceman told ASTRA. Also, in a conversation with Olga Arnold, the prosecutor said that Ilya was discharged from the hospital because he allegedly violated the conditions of treatment, namely, he got drunk. However, the victim‚Äôs mother believes that this is a falsification, and similar cases have already happened - in this way, commanders, including a certain doctor Maxim, forcibly pull unwanted soldiers out of treatment. Also two days ago, the political officer of the unit with the call sign -Ural- Vasily Lugovoy, in correspondence (screenshots are available to ASTRA) with Olga Arnold, said that her son is not in the basement, but in -a specially equipped bomb shelter, the function of which is to protect soldiers from attacks by drones and enemy artillery.- -Everything in the bomb shelter is equipped for a comfortable stay. No one sleeps on the floor, the ventilated room is warm and dry, water, tea, hot meals are fully provided, as well as medical care. He receives medical care regularly, under the supervision of medical personnel,- Lugovoy said. According to him, there are no basements in the -DPR-. Previously, ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military units 41698 and 42600). According to the editor‚Äôs interlocutors, the commanders set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was there that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured the American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine.

Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security,- Starmer stressed. He noted that Washington does not plan to leave NATO, but the issue of -burden sharing- is becoming more pressing. -President Trump has long said that Europe must do more. We Europeans must take these signals seriously and rise to new challenges,- the Prime Minister said. Starmer confirmed that Great Britain is ready to consider the possibility of sending its military to Ukraine if a peace agreement is concluded, but stressed that without guarantees from the United States such steps will not give the desired result. Previously, Washington ruled out the possibility of sending its own troops to Ukraine-Only American security guarantees can effectively deter Russia from new aggression,- he noted. Starmer also said he would soon travel to Washington for talks with Donald Trump to discuss key elements of a possible peace deal for Ukraine and further security cooperation.	https://t.me/astrapress/74755	2025-02-17T11:53:21-08:00

‚Ü©Ô∏èüé¨üñº A serviceman with rotting wounds was sent into the assault...	ASTRA: A soldier with rotting wounds was sent into the assault. He disappearedThe wife of military officer Alexander Merzlyak, serving in the 5th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade named after A. Zakharchenko in military unit 41698 in the 1st rifle company of the DPR rifle battalion, appealed to Putin with a demand to punish the command of the unit. According to Sofia, on November 14, 2024, during the assault on Kurakhovo, Alexander received multiple shrapnel wounds. He had to get to the evacuation site on his own, and he was admitted to the hospital only a month later, on December 13, 2024, at Central City Hospital No. 14 in Donetsk. After an X-ray examination, he was given a medical report, but the fragments were not removed. Later he was sent to the reserve battalion in the city of Dokuchaevsk, where he submitted a report to undergo military military training, but received only a verbal response with the requirement to wait. At this time, his condition worsened - the wounds began to rot, shrapnel in his back and legs caused severe pain, he could only move on crutches, and eventually he had to see a surgeon to remove the pus. On January 31, 2025, he and other wounded were transferred from the medical unit to the assault unit and assigned to the 3rd MSB. The last time Alexander got in touch with his family was on February 2, 2025, saying that he was in Avdeevka.Since then, the command has not provided relatives with accurate information about his whereabouts, as well as the reason for the wounded soldier being in the ranks, and not in a medical center or hospital.Now Sofia is asking the highest authorities to sort out the situation with the command of military unit 41698 and provide her husband with full-fledged medical care treatment.Previously, ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military unit 41698 and 42600). According to the editor‚Äôs interlocutors, the commanders set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was there that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured the American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine. There they tortured men who refused to fight, andthen forced them to carry out deadly assaults. ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/74653	2025-02-16T12:31:43-08:00

A 15-year-old schoolgirl from Balashikha spent 10 months in a pre-trial detention center because of a firecracker: her relatives claimed that her rights were violated in the pre-trial detention centerA 15-year-old schoolgirl from Balashikha, Alisa (name changed), spent almost a year in a pre-trial detention center on charges of preparing for mass murder and terrorism because of a homemade firecracker. The situation is reported by Lenta. ru.-As Alisa‚Äôs sister said, the girl was detained in November 2023. Before this, she was called to school under the pretext of checking her grades. There, the schoolgirl was met by police officers, who confiscated her phone and conducted an interrogation without her parents or a psychologist.Later, after a search, during which utility knives and a homemade firecracker were found, Alisa was accused of terrorism. The girl's family claims that the firecracker was bought to film a video for social networks and the girl had no intention of using it as a weapon. The investigation, according to Alice's relatives, ignored the results of the examination, which confirmed that the item was not an explosive.The family accuses the authorities of numerous violations of Alice's rights during her arrest and in the pre-trial detention center. The girl did not receive educational materials to continue her studies, as well as the necessary medications. In addition, in May she was beaten by a fellow inmate, but the facts of violence, according to relatives, were ignored by the investigator. Alisa was not allowed visits from her family for several months, which made it difficult to protect her rights.The girl‚Äôs family is determined to fight for her release, arguing that the actions of law enforcement agencies were excessive and violated the rights of the teenager.	https://t.me/astrapress/74605	2025-02-16T02:59:58-08:00

Latvians were banned from tourism to Russia and BelarusLatvian Parliament on Thursday decided to ban tourist trips to Russia and Belarus.

ASTRA: The owner of the tanker -Volgoneft 239- was fined 300 thousand rubles for violating technical regulationsThe Arbitration Court of the Krasnodar Territory made a decision in the case of violation of technical regulations by the owner of the tanker -Volgoneft 239-, which wreckedin the Kerch Strait. The company Volgatransneft CJSC was fined 300 thousand rubles. The court found the company guilty of violating the rules for operating mixed-type vessels, since the tanker continued to sail after the expiration of the season and outside the established navigation area, which is contrary to the requirements of Russian legislation.CJSC Volgatransneft plans to appeal the decision.-Guilty is proven when the shipowner has the opportunity to fulfill the requirements of the law, but did not comply with them. We referred in court to the fact that we did not have the opportunity to comply with these legal requirements. We believe that it is not entirely correct to place all the blame on the shipowner for this situation, because, firstly, on December 5, the ship was released on the instructions of the captain of the port of Kavkaz. The passage as part of a caravan was allowed, and after crossing the Kerch Strait, the ship, without unloading, could no longer return back to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov under any circumstances,- RIA Novosti quotes company representative Olga Pautova.An environmental disaster in the Black Sea occurred on December 15, 2024 in the Kerch Strait, when two tankers, Volgoneft 212- and -Volgoneft 239-, transporting fuel oil, crashed. As a result of the incident, significant pollution of the sea occurred: about 2.4 thousand tons of fuel oil got into the waters of the strait from four damaged tanks about 2.4 thousand tons of fuel oil. This led to the release of oil products on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory and the Crimean Peninsula, which provoked the introduction of emergency regimes both at regional level, and at federal.	https://t.me/astrapress/74453	2025-02-14T04:43:29-08:00

An official from Komi, accused of corruption, asks to go to war with UkraineFormer first deputy head of the administration of the city of Pechora in the Komi Republic, Andrei Kanishchev, who is under investigation on charges of corruption, signed a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense and expressed his intention to go to the zone of a special military operation in Ukraine. A corresponding petition to suspend the criminal case was received by the Pechora City Court, but at the moment it has not yet been considered, local media writes. &nbsp;Kanishchev is accused of receiving a bribe on an especially large scale and exceeding official authority. According to investigators, he, together with the former mayor of Pechora Valery Serov, received a bribe in the amount of four million rubles from a commercial company for assistance in concluding a government contract to carry out work to improve the city.&nbsp;At the time of the initiation of this criminal case, Kanishchev was already in custody on another charge. In February 2024, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for intentionally causing grievous bodily harm, negligently resulting in the death of the victim. In August 2022, Kanishchev hit sound engineer Viktor Fateev during a fire show on the main stage of Pechora, which led to his death.&nbsp;The case of Kanishchev is notsingle. Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 108 Russian officials and deputies have declared their desire to go to the front. Of these, 70 did this voluntarily, and 18, who were under criminal prosecution, chose to avoid it by signing contracts with the Ministry of Defense. The remaining 20 people subsequently abandoned their intentions.In March 2023, the mayor of Vorkuta, Yaroslav Shaposhnikov, announced that he would go to war in Ukraine. But he did this only after 118 days, citing the fact that the then acting head of Komi, Vladimir Uyba, asked him to stay.In May 2023, the acting Minister of Health of Komi, Igor Diaghilev, voluntarily went to the front, where he worked as a traumatologist in a military hospital. A year and a half later, in October 2024, after his return, he was appointed deputy prime minister of the government of the republic.The former first deputy head of the administration of Syktyvkar, Alexander Mozhegov, also found himself in the combat zone. The reasons for his participation in the war were not officially reported.Another official from Komi, ex-head of the Kortkeros district Alexander Arteev, came to the front from a penal colony. In 2023, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting bribes. In July 2024, his death became known.	https://t.me/astrapress/74450	2025-02-14T03:33:07-08:00

A resident of a Chechen village who killed his daughter-in-law went to war with Ukraine instead of punishmentA 46-year-old resident of the Chechen village of Bachi-Yurt, Ruslan Umayev, accused of murdering his 22-year-old daughter-in-law Kristina Kokova, was released from the pre-trial detention center and aimed at war against Ukraine. This was reported by the mother of the murdered girl, Anastasia Kokova.According to her information, on February 11, after the next meeting of the Shalinsky City Court of Chechnya, Umayev was sent to a military unit. It is expected that in two weeks he will be sent to an assault unit at the front.&nbsp;-The killer wants to go, as he said at the trial, to defend our homeland. &lt;...&gt; And this is not an isolated case, such scum are still released to this day in the -SVO-, for whom it is 50/50 whether they will be lucky or not to return from there alive. And they will also be heroes. These animals who kill other people's children rather than protect them are not heroes. And they are not worthy of awards,- Anastasia believes.Earlier, Anastasia Kokova appealed to the Russian Prosecutor General's Office with a request to prevent Umaev from concluding a contract with the Ministry of Defense, fearing that he would escape punishment for the crime he committed. Kokova‚Äôs lawyer also expressed concern that the accused could go to war without a record of conviction for murder.&nbsp;Now Kokova has again sent complaints to the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office and Vladimir Putin.A resident of the Moscow region town of Lobnya, Kristina Kokova, married Akhmed Umaev, the son of Ruslan Umaev, in 2020. After moving to Chechnya, she gave birth to a daughter, but soon began to complain of physical violence from her husband and pressure from her mother-in-law. After the divorce, the relatives of her ex-husband prevented her from communicating with her daughter, and her father-in-law Ruslan Umayev controlled and persecuted her, threatening to prohibit meetings with the child.&nbsp;In September 2024, Christina stopped communicating. After the search began, Ruslan Umayev admitted that he strangled her in her sleep with a rope and then tried to burn the body. He indicated the -immoral behavior- of his daughter-in-law as the motive. The mother of the deceased believes that Umaev killed her daughter to hide traces of sexual violence - traces of sperm were found on the bed where the murder was committed, but an examination was never ordered.	https://t.me/astrapress/74439	2025-02-14T01:16:16-08:00

The military prosecutor's office proved massive falsification of contracts for conscripts near ChebarkulThe military prosecutor's office conducted an inspection in five military units of the Chebarkul division and proved massive falsification of contracts for conscripts, reports the human rights organization -Conscript School-. The command of the unit deceived soldiers in order to fulfill the plan for recruiting contract soldiers.The claims began in the fall of 2024, when conscripts began to complain about forged contracts. Relatives of the soldiers reported that the command used various pretexts to force them to sign contracts. They promised that the recruits would remain to serve in the rear if they signed the papers, but later they were sent to war.The military prosecutor's office of the Chebarkul garrison confirmed that the command of military units 86274, 87441, 93992, 89547 and 31612 deceived soldiers, forged signatures and forced them to sign contracts under false pretenses. For example, in unit 87441 conscripts were forced to sign a contract without preparation, and in other cases contracts were signed without the knowledge of the soldiers.Conscript School lawyer Timofey Vaskin commented on the situation: -The prosecutor‚Äôs office did not say a word about the violation of conscripts‚Äô rights. But they said that there is public outcry and discontent; parents are writing complaints to the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the president. This, according to the prosecutor's office, undermines the authority of the Armed Forces.
