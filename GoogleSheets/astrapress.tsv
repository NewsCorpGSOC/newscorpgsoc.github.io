Among them are Tina Kandelaki and employees of the presidential administration and the GRUSystem journalists&nbsp;(Radio Liberty project) prepareda partial list of Russians, against whom the European Union is preparing sanctions due to involvement in Russian hybrid operations in Europe and Africa. It will include 16 people and three companies.For example, the head of GC Structura LLC, Nikolai Tupikin, according to EU officials, headed the Doppelganger (-Double-) operation. This is a disinformation campaign launched after the start of the war in Ukraine and is aimed at audiences in the EU and the USA. It was used to publish fake news on websites imitating major international media and other authoritative sources.An employee of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sofya Zakharova, also participated in this campaign, who, among other things, may be associated with projects to discredit the Russian opposition , which for the first time became one of the reasons for the introduction of EU sanctions.The sanctions list, which has not yet been officially published, also included a former TV presenter, deputy general director Gazprom Media Tinatin (Tina) Kandelaki. It is alleged that it is engaged in propaganda justifying Russian aggression in Ukraine, and in the occupied territories its structures replaced Ukrainian TV channels with Russian ones.FSB officer Artem Kureev should be subject to EU sanctions - he launched propaganda projects Rusafro and African Initiative (- African Initiative-), spread disinformation accusing the West of -experiments to create bioweapons-, which talked about -genetically modified mosquitoes-, as well as the fact that Western companies, under the guise of vaccination, allegedly used the African population as a -free clinical base-.Another people on the list: GRU officers Yuri Sizov and Vladimir Lipchenko, who were allegedly involved in the creation of intelligence networks, arson and attacks on critical infrastructure in the EU countries and Ukraine. The sanctions should include GRU military unit 29155, headed by GRU Major General Andrei Averyanov. The unit's employees were associated with a number of European GRU operations. For example, in an investigation by the Czech weekly Respekt and Bellingcat it was said that the Russian military intelligence operation to organize sabotage at weapons depots in the Czech Republic in the fall of 2014 took place under the personal control of Averyanov. Averyanov himself leads operations in Africa to undermine democracy, the draft sanctions say. Russian forces may have mined gold in Mali to finance these operations, the document's authors claim.EU foreign ministers are due to approve the new sanctions list on December 16.	https://t.me/astrapress/70206	2024-12-13T11:07:29-08:00

The total annual demand for saline solution is 50-60 million packages, he added. -If current production and supply volumes are maintained, the market will receive, at best, 37-38 million packages. This leads to a shortage in the market,- Bespalov explained.This week, for the first time, there is an official shortage of saline solution in Russia recognizedby the Ministry of Health. -As part of monitoring by Roszdravnadzor, risks of defects were identified. Suppliers have been found who are ready to supply the drug to regions in need. The situation with the re-registration of prices for sodium chloride is under control,- the department said. On Friday morning Roszdravnadzor reported that stocks currently amount to more than 9.4 million packages, -supplies of saline solution to medical organizations and pharmacies continue.- Sodium chloride is included in the list of vital and essential medicines for which fixed prices are set.	https://t.me/astrapress/70190	2024-12-13T02:30:45-08:00

A criminal case was opened against an Iranian singer because of an online concert where she sang without a hijabIranian singer Parastu Ahmadi performed in one of the traditional Iranian caravanserais (a resting place for caravans in the Persian Empire), broadcast on her YouTube channel. Parastu was not wearing a hijab and was wearing an evening dress, which is contrary to Iranian laws. After 1979, women in the country also do not have the right to sing in public, so her concert is also a violation of the laws.Before the performance, Ahmadi said: -I want to sing for the people I love. This is a right that I cannot ignore: to sing for the land that I love dearly.-The concert was watched by many viewers, despite the YouTube ban in Iran. After widespread publicity, security agents came to Ahmadi's house with a search, and she was summoned to the Tehran security prosecutor's office for questioning, writes Euronews. A criminal case was opened against the singer and her team for violating morality and the law and lack of permission to conduct an online broadcast of the concert.🌱 Subscribe to ASTRA.

Almost half of all imprisoned journalists in the world are in prisons in just four countries: China, including Hong Kong (124), Myanmar (61), Israel (41) and Belarus (40).-Journalists don’t die, they are killed ; they are not in prison, the regimes lock them up; they don't disappear, they are kidnapped.

A teacher from the Moscow region was accused of -propaganda of quadrobing- because of an assignment based on Turgenev’s story -Mumu- ​​ At the Aviatika Lyceum in the city of Lobnya, a literature teacher asked fifth-graders to write an essay on behalf of Mumu dogs. The task sounded like this: -Imagine yourself in Mumu’s place. Tell us how your day goes, what and how you usually do. How do you feel about your owner, what do you like, what don’t like, what are you afraid of, what do you dream about,- reports the pro-Kremlin publication Shot. However, this creative exercise caused dissatisfaction among some parents. They considered the task -creative quadrobing- and appealed to the director of the lyceum with complaints. In addition, after the situation was written about in the press, people began to be indignant that the teacher’s name is Aruvkhan Vazirovna: -Is it in your lyceum that migrant teachers force children to bark like dogs from Turgenev’s text Mu-mu? Shame!-, addressed attention -Non-Moscow speaking.- At the same time, Aruvkhan is a citizen of Russia - she comes from Karachay-Cherkessia. The Ministry of Education of the Moscow Region took the woman's side. Department explained that such a task helps children develop emotional intelligence and analyze the feelings of literary characters. State Duma deputy Vitaly Milonov also joined the discussion: he called the parents’ claims unfounded and proposed organizing an open lesson for them to explain the content of Turgenev’s work. According to him, his parents probably never understood what the story -Mumu- ​​was really about.	https://t.me/astrapress/70121	2024-12-11T23:14:53-08:00

In London, Russian agents wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev and editor-in-chief of The Insider Roman Dobrokhotov, -BBC and TelegraphA group of five Bulgarian citizens arrested in 2023 are suspected of spying for Moscow for at least three years, the BBC and Telegraph report, citing case materials. They are accused of participating in intelligence collection operations in the UK, Germany, Austria, Spain and Montenegro.At the trial in a London court, it became known that a group of agents planned to kidnap the editor-in-chief of The Insider, Roman Dobrokhotov. The operation, called Operation Fishing Boat, involved a plan to smuggle the journalist out of the UK by boat. In addition to kidnapping, the defendants also considered more radical measures, such as staging Dobrokhotov’s death, for example, as a result of an accident. However, these ideas were abandoned, considering them ineffective. In addition, the men wanted to kidnap journalist Hristo Grozev, the publications write. The investigation claims that one of the coordinators of the operation was the Austrian businessman Jan Marsalek, associated with Russian intelligence. The cell was led by Orlin Rusev. In addition to Rusev, the group also included Bizer Dzhambazov, Katrin Ivanova, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir Ivanchev. Rusev and Dzhambazov have already pleaded guilty to espionage. The remaining defendants continue to deny the charges. Previously, journalists from The Insider and Bellingcat published high-profile investigations, including about the assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The investigation claims that Russian intelligence saw Dobrokhotov as a threat and assigned the cell to monitor him, as well as his colleague Hristo Grozev.In the picture, from left to right: Vanya Gaberova, court employee, Katrin Ivanova, court employee and Tihomir Ivanchev at the Old Bailey	https://t.me/astrapress/70035	2024-12-10T23:37:17-08:00
