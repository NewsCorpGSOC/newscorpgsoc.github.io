They began to pay him less and every other time, and for trying to find out the reason or at least transfer to another place, Berlyakov, according to him, was sent to the assault detachment along with the fighters of the -Storm Z- unit. From there, the serviceman deserted a few months later to get to the military registration and enlistment office in Saratov and find out what was happening. It turned out that the Saratov resident was listed with the 6th Cossack Regiment as mobilized from the -LPR- and was wanted for desertion. -Who mobilized me here? -By order of the Beekeeper.- I say: -Who is the Beekeeper?- They say: -The head of the -LPR-. What difference does it make to me who the head of the -LPR- is, I am registered and live in the Saratov region, I am registered with the military registration and enlistment office, I have permanent registration, where my child is located. I am a single father. They couldn’t mobilize me there. I came here voluntarily,- Berlyakov is indignant.At the same time, Russian military commissars, police and operatives The FSB constantly emphasized in a conversation with Berlyakov their inability to influence the situation: the command of the 6th Cossack regiment simply ignored all their requests. The serviceman tried to take the requests to the command of the 6th regiment himself. Because of this, he, according to him, ended up in jail several times. pit, they threatened to kill him several times, he was sent to the front line several times, and once without weapons and uniform The last time. Berlyakov appeared at the location of the Cossack regiment, he was already being led to be shot, but the execution did not happen: he was stopped by FSB officers, whom Berlyakov had encountered earlier: -I’m sitting and thinking, damn, I wonder if the bullet hurts in the head or not. As a result, the voice is familiar, but I can’t figure out who it is. [...] He tells me his call sign. I understand that this is that [familiar] FSB officer. [...] I’m safe.--Through the personal account of a serviceman, which everyone has, according to the badge number that I have, I found out that the salary I am credited only to some unknown bank. [...] There are many such children who are supposedly in captivity of crests, but in fact the sixth Cossack army keeps them in basements and receives money for them,- says the Saratovite. Now Vladislav Berlyakov is preparing to go to the capital, because -he is tired of writing to Moscow.- He has neither a salary nor the opportunity to get a job: according to documents, he is still a wanted deserter.-I tell [the FSB officers who saved him. - Approx. ed.]: -Can I get a job?- They say: -You can’t get a job. You are a military man. You are purely a military man. Not a single security service will let you through. Even right away, they can even quietly call the police, the commandant’s office or something else from you...- I say: - I won’t go stealing. I don’t have any salary! I’ve been in captivity for so long! I can’t get a job. I have a child on my hands. they took it away from me because I don’t provide a certificate from anywhere. I can’t take a certificate that I am in service,- Berlyakov sums up his conversation with the FSB officers, who, according to him, saved him from execution at 6:00. m Cossack regiment.Berlyakov’s video message appeared in the Z-channel -Soldatskaya Pravda-.

Two more aerial bombs dropped on Russian planes near residential buildings in the Belgorod region, more than 150 residents were evacuated According to ASTRA, an -abnormal collapse- FAB-500 on December 26 occurred near a residential building on Pobeda Street in the village of Kustovoe, Yakovlevsky urban district, Belogrrl region. More than 150 village residents were evacuated, no injuries were reported. The bomb must be removed and destroyed today. Another aerial bomb fell near a residential building in the village of Pushkarnoye. Residents were also not injured. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year. November 19 a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/71241	2024-12-27T01:07:06-08:00

Under the name of the serial informer -Anna Korobkova,- a scandalous journalist may be hidingTogether with linguist Daniil Skorinkin, social anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova conducted a comparative analysis of the article about -Korobkova- on Wikipedia and the letters she sent to journalists and Arkhipova herself. For this purpose, the stylometric method was used, which analyzes the frequency of use of function words in the text, thanks to which authorship can be determined. The results showed that the style of the Wikipedia article and Korobkova’s letter are very similar. The history of edits to the article indicates that the text was added by the user -Arkady2023- on the night of October 4-5, which is probably the pseudonym of Ivan Abaturov.Previously, Ivan Abaturov was already involved in a scandal related to denunciations. In August 2022, the director of the Nestor-History publishing house, Sergei Erlikh, said that the police came to the office following a complaint from Abaturov, who accused their book about the Holocaust in Romania of disseminating -false information- about the actions of the USSR in World War II.It is also known that Abaturov is a historian by training. In 2021 he appealed to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office with a proposal to cancel the decision to rehabilitate Mineki. However, the military prosecutor's office said that Mineki is certainly a victim of political repression. Two years later, Alexandra Arkhipova learned that a denunciation had been filed against her from a certain -Anna Korobkova.- The denunciation was sent to the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration under the President (RANEPA), where Arkhipova worked for many years. Since then, -Anna Korobkova- has sent dozens of denunciations and given numerous interviews, posing as a serial informer.	https://t.me/astrapress/71164	2024-12-26T01:50:01-08:00
