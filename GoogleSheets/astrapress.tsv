The son of a Wagnerist was detained at the Minsk airport for helping the Freedom of Russia LegionEvgeniy Ubiraev, a 29-year-old 3D modeler from Pyt-Yakh (KhMAO) amid worries from a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began to suffer from thoughts of suicide. Because of this, he turned to the -Freedom of Russia- legion, because -he wanted to finally help people and chose this method of suicide.- SOTAvision Ubiraev's relatives told about this. For the -legion- the young man photographed and filmed several military installations and parking lots in the Russian Federation. After this, the curator suggested that Ubiraev place a certain device, presumably an IED, under someone’s car. The man categorically refused, as he was against killing people. In response, the supposed curator of the -legion- began to threaten Ubiraev that he would hand him over to the Russian special services. Because of this, Ubiraev left for Armenia. There he tried to get a foreign passport, but after 180 days he had to make a visa from Armenia, for which he chose Belarus in December 2024. While trying to leave Minsk, he was detained by FSB officers; now the young man is in pre-trial detention center No. 1 in Yekaterinburg. He faces up to 20 years in prison under the article on participation in a terrorist organization. At the same time, Evgeniy Ubiraev’s father used to fight in Chechnya, and is now serving in the war in Ukraine under a contract, having been recruited from the colony to the Wagner PMC. A young man called his father from Armenia and told him that he and his wife were applying for foreign passports for travel. The military man answered his son rudely and promised to return him to Russia -under escort.-	https://t.me/astrapress/74711	2025-02-17T02:23:18-08:00

He disappearedThe wife of military officer Alexander Merzlyak, serving in the 5th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade named after A. Zakharchenko in military unit 41698 in the 1st rifle company of the DPR rifle battalion, appealed to Putin with a demand to punish the command of the unit. According to Sofia, on November 14, 2024, during the assault on Kurakhovo, Alexander received multiple shrapnel wounds. He had to get to the evacuation site on his own, and he was admitted to the hospital only a month later, on December 13, 2024, at Central City Hospital No. 14 in Donetsk. After an X-ray examination, he was given a medical report, but the fragments were not removed. Later he was sent to the reserve battalion in the city of Dokuchaevsk, where he submitted a report to undergo military military training, but received only a verbal response with the requirement to wait. At this time, his condition worsened - the wounds began to rot, shrapnel in his back and legs caused severe pain, he could only move on crutches, and eventually he had to see a surgeon to remove the pus. On January 31, 2025, he and other wounded were transferred from the medical unit to the assault unit and assigned to the 3rd MSB. The last time Alexander got in touch with his family was on February 2, 2025, saying that he was in Avdeevka.Since then, the command has not provided relatives with accurate information about his whereabouts, as well as the reason for the wounded soldier being in the ranks, and not in a medical center or hospital.Now Sofia is asking the highest authorities to sort out the situation with the command of military unit 41698 and provide her husband with full-fledged medical care treatment.Previously, ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military unit 41698 and 42600). According to the editor’s interlocutors, the commanders set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was there that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured the American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine. There they tortured men who refused to fight, andthen forced them to carry out deadly assaults. 🫨 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/74653	2025-02-16T12:31:43-08:00

A 15-year-old schoolgirl from Balashikha spent 10 months in a pre-trial detention center because of a firecracker: her relatives claimed that her rights were violated in the pre-trial detention centerA 15-year-old schoolgirl from Balashikha, Alisa (name changed), spent almost a year in a pre-trial detention center on charges of preparing for mass murder and terrorism because of a homemade firecracker. The situation is reported by Lenta. ru.-As Alisa’s sister said, the girl was detained in November 2023. Before this, she was called to school under the pretext of checking her grades. There, the schoolgirl was met by police officers, who confiscated her phone and conducted an interrogation without her parents or a psychologist.Later, after a search, during which utility knives and a homemade firecracker were found, Alisa was accused of terrorism. The girl's family claims that the firecracker was bought to film a video for social networks and the girl had no intention of using it as a weapon. The investigation, according to Alice's relatives, ignored the results of the examination, which confirmed that the item was not an explosive.The family accuses the authorities of numerous violations of Alice's rights during her arrest and in the pre-trial detention center. The girl did not receive educational materials to continue her studies, as well as the necessary medications. In addition, in May she was beaten by a fellow inmate, but the facts of violence, according to relatives, were ignored by the investigator. Alisa was not allowed visits from her family for several months, which made it difficult to protect her rights.The girl’s family is determined to fight for her release, arguing that the actions of law enforcement agencies were excessive and violated the rights of the teenager.	https://t.me/astrapress/74605	2025-02-16T02:59:58-08:00

The company Volgatransneft CJSC was fined 300 thousand rubles. The court found the company guilty of violating the rules for operating mixed-type vessels, since the tanker continued to sail after the expiration of the season and outside the established navigation area, which is contrary to the requirements of Russian legislation.CJSC Volgatransneft plans to appeal the decision.-Guilty is proven when the shipowner has the opportunity to fulfill the requirements of the law, but did not comply with them. We referred in court to the fact that we did not have the opportunity to comply with these legal requirements. We believe that it is not entirely correct to place all the blame on the shipowner for this situation, because, firstly, on December 5, the ship was released on the instructions of the captain of the port of Kavkaz. The passage as part of a caravan was allowed, and after crossing the Kerch Strait, the ship, without unloading, could no longer return back to the Sea of ​​Azov under any circumstances,- RIA Novosti quotes company representative Olga Pautova.An environmental disaster in the Black Sea occurred on December 15, 2024 in the Kerch Strait, when two tankers, Volgoneft 212- and -Volgoneft 239-, transporting fuel oil, crashed. As a result of the incident, significant pollution of the sea occurred: about 2.4 thousand tons of fuel oil got into the waters of the strait from four damaged tanks about 2.4 thousand tons of fuel oil. This led to the release of oil products on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory and the Crimean Peninsula, which provoked the introduction of emergency regimes both at regional level, and at federal.	https://t.me/astrapress/74453	2025-02-14T04:43:29-08:00

In August 2022, Kanishchev hit sound engineer Viktor Fateev during a fire show on the main stage of Pechora, which led to his death.&nbsp;The case of Kanishchev is notsingle. Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 108 Russian officials and deputies have declared their desire to go to the front. Of these, 70 did this voluntarily, and 18, who were under criminal prosecution, chose to avoid it by signing contracts with the Ministry of Defense. The remaining 20 people subsequently abandoned their intentions.In March 2023, the mayor of Vorkuta, Yaroslav Shaposhnikov, announced that he would go to war in Ukraine. But he did this only after 118 days, citing the fact that the then acting head of Komi, Vladimir Uyba, asked him to stay.In May 2023, the acting Minister of Health of Komi, Igor Diaghilev, voluntarily went to the front, where he worked as a traumatologist in a military hospital. A year and a half later, in October 2024, after his return, he was appointed deputy prime minister of the government of the republic.The former first deputy head of the administration of Syktyvkar, Alexander Mozhegov, also found himself in the combat zone. The reasons for his participation in the war were not officially reported.Another official from Komi, ex-head of the Kortkeros district Alexander Arteev, came to the front from a penal colony. In 2023, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting bribes. In July 2024, his death became known.	https://t.me/astrapress/74450	2025-02-14T03:33:07-08:00

A resident of a Chechen village who killed his daughter-in-law went to war with Ukraine instead of punishmentA 46-year-old resident of the Chechen village of Bachi-Yurt, Ruslan Umayev, accused of murdering his 22-year-old daughter-in-law Kristina Kokova, was released from the pre-trial detention center and aimed at war against Ukraine. This was reported by the mother of the murdered girl, Anastasia Kokova.According to her information, on February 11, after the next meeting of the Shalinsky City Court of Chechnya, Umayev was sent to a military unit. It is expected that in two weeks he will be sent to an assault unit at the front.&nbsp;-The killer wants to go, as he said at the trial, to defend our homeland. &lt;...&gt; And this is not an isolated case, such scum are still released to this day in the -SVO-, for whom it is 50/50 whether they will be lucky or not to return from there alive. And they will also be heroes. These animals who kill other people's children rather than protect them are not heroes. And they are not worthy of awards,- Anastasia believes.Earlier, Anastasia Kokova appealed to the Russian Prosecutor General's Office with a request to prevent Umaev from concluding a contract with the Ministry of Defense, fearing that he would escape punishment for the crime he committed. Kokova’s lawyer also expressed concern that the accused could go to war without a record of conviction for murder.&nbsp;Now Kokova has again sent complaints to the Prosecutor General’s Office and Vladimir Putin.A resident of the Moscow region town of Lobnya, Kristina Kokova, married Akhmed Umaev, the son of Ruslan Umaev, in 2020. After moving to Chechnya, she gave birth to a daughter, but soon began to complain of physical violence from her husband and pressure from her mother-in-law. After the divorce, the relatives of her ex-husband prevented her from communicating with her daughter, and her father-in-law Ruslan Umayev controlled and persecuted her, threatening to prohibit meetings with the child.&nbsp;In September 2024, Christina stopped communicating. After the search began, Ruslan Umayev admitted that he strangled her in her sleep with a rope and then tried to burn the body. He indicated the -immoral behavior- of his daughter-in-law as the motive. The mother of the deceased believes that Umaev killed her daughter to hide traces of sexual violence - traces of sperm were found on the bed where the murder was committed, but an examination was never ordered.	https://t.me/astrapress/74439	2025-02-14T01:16:16-08:00

The command of the unit deceived soldiers in order to fulfill the plan for recruiting contract soldiers.The claims began in the fall of 2024, when conscripts began to complain about forged contracts. Relatives of the soldiers reported that the command used various pretexts to force them to sign contracts. They promised that the recruits would remain to serve in the rear if they signed the papers, but later they were sent to war.The military prosecutor's office of the Chebarkul garrison confirmed that the command of military units 86274, 87441, 93992, 89547 and 31612 deceived soldiers, forged signatures and forced them to sign contracts under false pretenses. For example, in unit 87441 conscripts were forced to sign a contract without preparation, and in other cases contracts were signed without the knowledge of the soldiers.Conscript School lawyer Timofey Vaskin commented on the situation: -The prosecutor’s office did not say a word about the violation of conscripts’ rights. But they said that there is public outcry and discontent; parents are writing complaints to the prosecutor’s office and the president. This, according to the prosecutor's office, undermines the authority of the Armed Forces.

Political prisoners will not be included in the May amnestyDeputies of the Communist Party faction led by Gennady Zyuganov submitted to the State Duma a draft resolution on an amnesty dedicated to the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, writes TASS. The document provides for the release from punishment of persons convicted for the first time for intentional crimes of minor and moderate gravity, as well as certain categories of citizens, including combatants, home front workers, minors, pregnant women and disabled people of groups I and II.&nbsp;However, the draft contains exceptions for a number of articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, to which the amnesty does not apply. Among them are articles 280.3 (repeated discrediting of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation), 207.3 (public dissemination of knowingly false information about the use of the RF Armed Forces) and 205.2 (public calls for terrorist activities or public justification of terrorism). Thus, persons convicted under these articles are not subject to the proposed amnesty, even if they belong to preferential categories such as pregnant women, single parents or pensioners.Previously, some deputies from the United Russia party expressed the opinion that holding an amnesty this year is inappropriate, since the convicts can -atone for their guilt- by signing a contract and going to war with Ukraine.Last A large-scale amnesty in Russia, dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Victory, was carried out in 2015 and affected about 60 thousand people sentenced to imprisonment and up to 200 thousand suspended sentences.&nbsp;The final decision on the amnesty and its conditions will be made after consideration and discussion of the project in the State Duma.	https://t.me/astrapress/74371	2025-02-13T00:20:21-08:00

Before the verdict was announced, he noted that, despite his illness, he decided to attend the hearing because he was confident that he was right. He emphasized that his publication was aimed at drawing attention to the problem of missing soldiers and maintaining contact with their relatives.&nbsp;Earlier, in March 2024, Kustov had already faced pressure from the authorities. After covering the crash of the Il-76 military transport plane, he was detained and arrested for 10 days on charges of disobeying the police.

The authors of the report believe that Russia's readiness to take more risky actions regarding NATO may increase if Russia considers the alliance weakened and disunited, or is confident that the United States will not help Europe. If the war in Ukraine ends, the Russian Federation may free up military resources and, in about six months, enter into a local conflict with one of the NATO countries. In 2 years, Russia may pose a threat to one or more states in the Baltic Sea. About five years after the end of the war with Ukraine, Russia may be ready for a full-scale war in Europe, an intelligence report says.	https://t.me/astrapress/74320	2025-02-12T01:16:34-08:00

The fishermen tried to get out by jumping from the breakaway ice floe, but not all of them managed to leave the dangerous place.The operation to rescue the fishermen began with the departure of an Mi-8 helicopter from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, but some refused to leave the ice floe so as not to lose their catch and gear. The operation involves the Hivus hovercraft, which takes out fishermen 4-5 people at a time.	https://t.me/astrapress/74301	2025-02-11T21:05:31-08:00
