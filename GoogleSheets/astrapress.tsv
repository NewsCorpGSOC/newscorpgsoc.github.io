He said the reason was that he had received a large water bill. After this, security forces examined the building, but did not find any explosive devices.

üñº State hospitals in Vologda began to refuse women abortions. Th...	Public hospitals in Vologda began to refuse women abortions. They have to travel to neighboring regions A local deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Alexander Morozov, wrote about this. According to him, three residents of the city contacted him after local hospitals refused to provide an abortion. -Having been refused by medical organizations in the Vologda region, women are forced to apply to health care institutions in neighboring regions on a paid basis. For example, for one of the women who contacted me, a trip to the Yaroslavl region for this purpose cost 50,000 rubles,- says the deputy‚Äôs appeal to the prosecutor.According to him, the heads of medical institutions report to the Ministry of Health of the Vologda Region that hospitals -refuse to perform abortions, except in cases of direct medical indications and situations related to the consequences of criminal acts in against women.-According to ASTRA, the heads of medical institutions were -tacitly prohibited- from performing abortions. There are no official orders in this regard. Now doctors have to arrange abortions for medical reasons, two employees told ASTRA on condition of anonymity.Earlier, regional governor Georgy Filimonov called on public hospitals and private clinics not to terminate pregnancies except for medical reasons and after rape. Morozov asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of refusals in clinics.State Duma deputy from the Vologda region Alexey Kanaev told Vedomosti that he also received two appeals from residents of the region who were denied an abortion, one of them in a state clinic.According to Morozov, abortion will not solve the problem with the birth rate. He believes that the state should help future parents with housing, work, medicine, and education. What influences demography most of all is -confidence in the future; it is its absence today that most influences the demographic situation.--Moreover, negative emotions are caused not even by the obstruction of abortion itself, but by the fact that the decision on this is made behind the scenes, without broad consultation with society. There are no fools living in the Vologda region. I believe that the executive branch needs to change its attitude towards making such important decisions for everyone,- he added.	https://t.me/astrapress/75489	2025-02-28T01:33:48-08:00

The bot is not working nowAbout a week ago, security forces came to members of the Eye of God service team, several sources said -Media zones- and journalist Andrey Zakharov.-The entire team of his bot is really being persecuted. -Whoever they can reach,- said one of the sources in the data market. According to the publication, the searches took place as part of a criminal case under Article 272.1 of the Criminal Code (illegal use of personal data obtained unlawfully). It is noted that this is the first known case of using the new article, which appeared at the end of 2024 to combat the trade in personal data and penetration services.Currently, the -Eye of God- does not work. Mediazona‚Äôs source claims that the founder of the service, programmer Evgeny Antipov, is not in Russia. At the same time, he himself stated that this was not true. -They already wrote to me about [the searches] 4 days ago. But we don't have a team. There is only [me], and I have not had any searches. I think they were talking about someone else,- Antipov told Zakharov.On Thursday, Antipov wrote that there would be -small technical changes- in the functionality of the -Eyes of God.-After the adoption of the new law, according to Zakharov, several breakout bots were closed, and one took all its employees out of Russia. The -Eye of God- limited the release of data. -And this is somewhat paradoxical: Antipov officially collaborated with the security forces and gave them unlimited access to his service. In 2023, researchers from universities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Penitentiary Service published the results of a study among current employees of their departments. The survey was conducted in several regions and showed that, for example, 41 out of 50 police officers used the -Eye of God- in their work, the rest simply knew what it was. The bot was convenient: there is no information from banks and marketplaces in government databases; you can get it upon request, which takes time. And here you have everything in one certificate, from the loudest leaks - and even with links to social networks. But what was convenient for the operas was clearly not liked by someone in other departments - for example, in the FSB or some Security Council,- the journalist notes.	https://t.me/astrapress/75488	2025-02-28T00:51:09-08:00

This was reported by the department's press service.&nbsp;The incident occurred in February 2024. The girl refused to marry by consent, after which her parents, belonging to the Yazidi community, allegedly beat her and forcibly took her to the groom's house, where she was deprived of freedom, the opportunity to study and communicate with relatives and friends.&nbsp;The marriage was concluded only according to tradition, but not in the registry office.Girl's friends toldE1 that she was under constant control in her husband's house, she was forbidden to continue her studies, her phone was monitored and she was forbidden to leave the house. Five years ago, the groom's family already a tragedy occurred: the man's younger sister committed suicide at the age of 16 when they tried to marry her off to a 50-year-old man.&nbsp;The girl's relatives claim that she was happy in her marriage, calling the accusations -slander.- The head of the public organization -Yazidis of the Urals,- Georgy Asoev, said that the couple lives in peace and harmony, and called the complaints -nonsense.- He emphasized that in the 21st century, forced marriage is impossible, and called not to interfere in family affairs.&nbsp;Nurzida Bensgier, director of the Interethnic Information Center in Yekaterinburg, also commented on the situation. She noted that in diasporas outside their country, the desire to preserve national identity, faith and traditions is especially pronounced, especially in matters of marriage and funerals.&nbsp;According to a study by the human rights organization Ad Rem published in 2024, 4,453 marriages involving underage girls were registered in the country in 2021 alone. However, official statistics do not reflect the real scale of the problem, since many such unions are not officially registered.Yazidis are an ethno-confessional group of Kurds living mainly in northwestern Iraq, northern and northeastern Syria.

Previously, the Moscow Garrison Military Court acquitted Mrishchuk and other defendants in the case on charges of creating a criminal community, but the Second Western District Military Court overturned the acquittal and sent the case for review.According to the investigation, the PMC -ENOT- was created by Roman Telenkevich, known under the call sign -Vodyanoy-.

Other victims cannot receive compensation almost a yearA serviceman from Orsk, Alexander L., recorded a video message in which he stated that after losing his home due to the flood in April 2024 and receiving a certificate for a new one, he was deprived of both his old home and the opportunity to purchase a new home. After the flood, the commission declared Alexander's housing unfit for habitation and subject to demolition, after which he was given a certificate for the purchase of new housing. Having concluded a purchase and sale agreement, he transferred the old house into the ownership of the city and went to war. It later turned out that the certificate was canceled and the purchase and sale transaction was declared invalid. As a result, Alexander was left homeless.In his video message to Vladimir Putin and the Chairman of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, Alexander stated: -At a time when I am defending the Fatherland, Russia, the officials of Orsk made me homeless.-The situation was complicated by the fact that the house in which Alexander lived consisted of two halves with different owners. The neighbors decided to carry out a major overhaul of their part, while Alexander sought to demolish his half. This disagreement led to a legal conflict, as a result of which the certificate for new housing was canceled.The head of Orsk, Artem Vorobyov, responded to the video message on his Telegram channel, noting that such cases after a flood are not uncommon and are usually resolved in court. He assured that, together with the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the regional Ministry of Construction, all possible measures are being taken to restore Alexander‚Äôs rights. -It cannot be otherwise,- Vorobiev emphasized. Chairman of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin instructed the regional department of the Investigative Committee to conduct an investigation into this fact and provide a report on the activities carried out.Soon Vorobiev recorded another video message, saying that he had found a solution to safely resolve the situation, but did not provide details.At the same time, the problems of other residents of Orsk, left without housing, remain unresolved.April 8 2024, more than a hundred residents of Orsk came out to a rally to the local administration building, protesting against insufficient compensation and the inaction of the authorities. The protesters demanded a review of the terms of payments and acceleration of the process of providing assistance. In response to this, the governor of the Orenburg region, Denis Pasler, promised to double regional payments.At the end of May 2024, residents of Orsk also claimed that they did not receive compensation. They complained about the same in August. Their problems were not solved either in one day or in several months. In December, the Orenburg authorities rejected a proposal to allocate 800 million from the budget for compensation to flood victims‚òÆ Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/75323	2025-02-25T10:16:31-08:00

In Dagestan, parents -re-educated- a 15-year-old girl by chaining her to a radiatorAccording to the investigation, relatives held the girl for three days in her uncle‚Äôs apartment in Kizilyurt, chaining her to a radiator heating chain.As reports the telegram channel -Sapa Kavkaz-, the girl's parents resorted to these measures for the purpose of -re-education-, since she repeatedly left from the house.The girl saved herself by tying a note asking for help to the TV remote control and throwing it out the window. A random passer-by, having discovered the remote control with a note, contacted the police.The teenager is now in a rehabilitation center. According to her, two years ago she was repeatedly gang raped by schoolchildren. She claims that after her relatives found out about this, they began to persecute her and put pressure on her, accusing her of disgracing the honor of the family.There is no official confirmation of this information. The statement by the Investigative Committee states that a criminal case has been initiated under articles of unlawful deprivation of liberty and failure to fulfill obligations to raise a minor.	https://t.me/astrapress/75231	2025-02-24T10:35:53-08:00

After returning from the war in Ukraine, -veterans- killed at least 240 people in Russian regionsOn the third anniversary of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, journalists from the publication -7x7- conducted an analysis of judicial statistics and establishedthat combatants returning from the front were involved in the murder of at least 240 people in various regions of the Russian Federation. The study covers sentences under five articles of the Criminal Code related to murder handed down between 2022 and 2025. However, given that some cases are still pending and detailed data is not available for a number of convictions, the actual number of victims may be higher.&nbsp;According to the study, Russian courts handed down 225 verdicts in cases of murders committed by former combatants in Ukraine. The geography of crimes covers 62 regions of the country. The largest number of victims was recorded in the Krasnodar Territory and the Kostroma Region - 14 people in each region. In the Rostov region, 12 people died at the hands of those returning from the war, in the Trans-Baikal Territory - 10, in the Krasnoyarsk Territory - 9. In the Volgograd and Perm regions, 8 victims were registered each.&nbsp;The victims of these crimes are not only relatives or acquaintances of former military personnel, but also random people: children, pensioners, passers-by. In some cases, the defendants are charged with additional charges related to rape and robbery. Courts often consider participation in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine as a mitigating circumstance, and awards and certificates received at the front as a positive characteristic of the defendant‚Äôs personality.	https://t.me/astrapress/75228	2025-02-24T09:36:17-08:00

Since the start of the war in Russia, the number of political persecutions has almost doubled - report Avtozak LiveFrom 2022 to 2024, the number of political persecutions in Russia almost doubled - from 1265 to 2373 cases. At the same time, the average time for consideration of politically motivated cases has also decreased significantly, the Avtozak Live team found out.According to their data, from February 24, 2022 to February 9, 2025, more than 5,400 politically motivated criminal cases were initiated under 146 articles of the criminal code against 5,254 people, at least 2,940 of whom are now in custody. In more than 1,900 cases, cases against the persecuted were initiated under two or more articles.&nbsp;The most charges - 16 - were brought against Andrei Pronsky, who is accused of preparing an attempt on the life of Vladimir Solovyov. The remaining nine defendants in this case are charged with 15 articles each.One of the most common articles for political persecution in Russia is Article 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Terrorist Act-). According to it, people are regularly imprisoned for arson of military registration and enlistment offices and other damage to military infrastructure. Also, this article often prosecutes victims of telephone scammers who convince people to participate in arson.The number of criminal cases against minors increased significantly with the start of the war. In 2024, 177 cases were opened, mainly on charges of preparing terrorist acts, sabotage and rehabilitation of Nazism. The youngest accused was a 14-year-old girl who fried sausages on the Eternal Flame in Ruza.Avtozak Live notes that with the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine repressions became more brutal and widespread.	https://t.me/astrapress/75226	2025-02-24T09:02:18-08:00

A measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico amid the growing popularity of the anti-vaccination movement - almost 100 cases90 cases of infection have been confirmed in Texas, nine in New Mexico. The highest number of cases is in Gaines County, where the vaccination rate is below the state average.The outbreak began in the South Plains region of Texas in late January, the state Department of Health Services said. According to the latest data, among the 90 cases, 77 are children. 16 people are hospitalized.In New Mexico, infections were reported in Lee County, which borders the epicenter of the outbreak in Texas, the local Department of Health said. Nine people fell ill there, including four children.Local services are urgently setting up additional vaccination and testing points to contain the spread of infection. Free vaccinations are available in Seminole (Gaines County, Texas) and Lee County (New Mexico). Additional testing sites have also opened in these areas.Measles is considered one of the most contagious infections, and outbreaks occur when herd immunity levels fall below 95%. In Gaines County, the rate is significantly lower: last year, only 82% of children received the two required doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.Vaccine refusal rates are on the rise in the region. In Texas, the law allows for -conscientious objection- to vaccinate a child, and in Gaines County, 13% of students exercised this right.The situation is complicated by the appointment of Robert Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health. Kennedy is known to be skeptical of vaccines and cited controversial studies about their possible side effects. He has already stated that he intends to review the childhood vaccination system.In the United States, measles was officially considered eliminated, but due to a decrease in the level of vaccination, cases of the disease are being recorded more and more often. In 2024, the country reported 285 cases of measles in more than 30 states.	https://t.me/astrapress/75108	2025-02-22T20:50:01-08:00

In the Kirov region, a cleaner was convicted for commenting about a deceased participant in the war in UkraineThe Kirov regional court sentenced the cleaner Raisa Novoselova, convicting her for insulting the memory of defenders of the Fatherland (Part 4 of Article 354.1 of the Criminal Code), writes the SOVA research center. The woman received a six-month suspended sentence and a ban on publishing materials on the Internet for a year. The verdict was handed down on January 15, 2025.The reason for the criminal prosecution was a comment published by Novoselova under a post about a serviceman who died in the war in Ukraine. -The comment contained linguistic and psychological signs of humiliation of the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces who died during a special military operation,- says the published decision of the court.Novoselova admitted her guilt and asked to consider the case in a special manner without examining the evidence. The case was opened in October 2024, after the regional department of the Investigative Committee reported the publication of a comment that, in their opinion, expressed disrespect and insult to the fallen defenders of the Fatherland. The SOVA Research Center considered the actions of law enforcement agencies unnecessary, noting that the relatives of the deceased could have filed a civil lawsuit to protect their honor and dignity, rather than resort to criminal prosecution.	https://t.me/astrapress/75071	2025-02-22T01:05:09-08:00

With the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rudneva became one of the public representatives of the anti-war movement.The Swedish Security Service considered that Rudneva's research could allegedly benefit the Russian military or related organizations. As a result, she may be banned from entering Sweden and the Schengen countries for 20 years.Rudneva denies the charges.-This is very unfair. My work is related to theoretical mathematics, which has no military application,- she said in an interview with Sveriges Radio.The girl previously worked at Skoltech, which is under US and EU sanctions and, according to the US, allegedly collaborated with the Russian military.Rudneva admits that she is defending her dissertation at the Higher School of Economics, which cooperates with Skoltech, but claims that this is necessary to complete it work.At Skoltech itself, according to the educational institution‚Äôs website, Rudneva was listed as a research intern at the Krichever Center for Advanced Study from 2018 to 2022 and worked on a dissertation on the topic -Asymmetric vertex models and stochastic integrable processes.-The Swedish Migration Service refused to discuss individual cases. The country's security service said in an interview with Sveriges Radio that -their decisions are based on a comprehensive assessment of various factors- and that their task is -to ensure the protection of valuable technologies and research.-Rudneva appealed the deportation decision.-This research does not pose a threat. This is a fundamental science that studies exotic states of matter,- said Professor Emeritus Thors Hans Hansson in an interview with Sveriges Radio.	https://t.me/astrapress/75070	2025-02-22T00:25:10-08:00
