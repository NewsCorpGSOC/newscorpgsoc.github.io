Former President of the Philippines was detained on an ICC warrantFormer President of the Philippines, 79-year-old Rodrigo Duterte, was detained at Manila International Airport on a warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The arrest is related to charges of crimes against humanity committed during his anti-drug campaign, reports the Associated Press. According to human rights activists, more than 12 thousand people were killed in anti-drug operations during Duterte's presidency from 2016 to 2022.&nbsp;In 2019, Duterte removed the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the Rome Statute, under which the ICC operates, so Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Panelo, called the arrest illegal. However, the court stated that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed up to that point - from November 1, 2011 to March 16, 2019 inclusive.&nbsp;The detainee's daughter, Sara Duterte, is the vice president of the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte as president in 2022, has stated his readiness to cooperate with the ICC on issues related to the arrest.&nbsp;It is currently unknown where Duterte is being held after his arrest and when he will be brought to Europe to be transferred to the ICC.	https://t.me/astrapress/76281	2025-03-11T01:45:44-07:00

The next day, Durdiev began to threaten Ekaterina Mizulina, which led to his arrest. Today the Kirovsky District Court of Yaroslavl found Durdiev not guilty. The court noted that his actions did not constitute a crime. The prosecution asked for four and a half years in prison.However, on the second charge - causing minor harm to the health of a 28-year-old resident of Yaroslavl - Durdiev was found guilty and sentenced to five months of correctional labor. But due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the punishment was canceled and he was released.Previously, Durdiev's lawyer reported that his client‚Äôs wife, at the streamer‚Äôs initiative, transferred 10 thousand rubles in compensation to Mizulina and paid a fine in the same amount. However, Mizulina herself wrote in her Telegram channel that she does not know about the transfer of money from Durdiev. -Moreover, I will not accept any donations from the lower Internet.

The United States is ending support for F-16 fighters transferred to Ukraine, - Forbes The administration of US President Donald Trump has stopped supporting F-16 fighters transferred to Ukraine, including the supply of vital components for electronic warfare systems. Before being sent to Ukraine, F-16 fighters were equipped with electronic warfare systems, including AN/ALQ-131 suspended containers and PIDS+ and ECIPS+ systems. The cessation of supplies of spare parts and software for these systems significantly reduces the combat capabilities of Ukrainian aircraft, says Forbes analysts.In response to this situation, Ukraine is looking for alternative solutions. France has expressed its readiness to provide Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters equipped with its own electronic warfare systems, independent of American support. These aircraft can partially compensate for the loss of combat capabilities of the F-16.&nbsp;Earlier, in August 2024, the White House refused to send American specialists to maintain the F-16 in Ukraine for security reasons, fearing a possible escalation of the conflict.	https://t.me/astrapress/76125	2025-03-09T09:54:00-07:00

Romanian presidential candidates accused of having ties to Russia were allowed to participate in the electionsRomania's Constitutional Court rejected protests against the registration of far-right candidate Calin Georgescu in the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for May 4, reportedon the institution's website. This decision allows Georgescu to participate in the elections, subject to the approval of his candidacy by the Central Electoral Bureau.CƒÉlin Georgescu, known for his far-right and pro-Russian views, unexpectedly led in the first round of the November 2024 presidential election with 22.94% of the vote. However, the results of this round were annulled by the Constitutional Court in December 2024 due to suspicions of Russian interference in the electoral process. This decision caused mass protests by Georgescu's supporters, who accused the authorities of undermining democracy.&nbsp;In February 2025, a criminal case was opened against Georgescu on charges of creating a fascist organization, disseminating false information and undermining the constitutional order. On February 26, he was detained by police on his way to submit documents to register for the repeat elections. Despite this, on March 7, Georgescu filed his candidacy for the upcoming elections, collecting more than 324,000 signatures in his support.&nbsp;The Constitutional Court decision on March 8 clears the way for Georgescu to participate in the elections on May 4, if his candidacy is approved by the Central Electoral Bureau. However, his participation remains in doubt due to the ongoing criminal investigation and preventive measures imposed against him, including a ban on leaving the country and publishing xenophobic content on the Internet.&nbsp;The political crisis in Romania intensified after the resignation of President Klaus Iohannis on February 10, 2025. Iohannis resigned to avoid impeachment proceedings initiated by the opposition after the election results were annulled. Senate President Ilie Bolojan was appointed acting president.	https://t.me/astrapress/76116	2025-03-09T05:48:00-07:00

About 100 seats in the State Duma will be occupied by participants in the war with Ukraine, Faridaily sources The Kremlin wants that in the new composition of the State Duma, which will be elected in 2026, about a quarter of the deputies (about 100 out of 450) were participants in the war with Ukraine. Candidates will be nominated from United Russia - both on lists and in single-mandate constituencies. Vladimir Putin previously emphasized that the military should become the -real elite- of Russia. To prepare military personnel for civil service, the -Time of Heroes- program was created. Some veterans have already received government positions: for example, the commander of the Sparta battalion Artem Zhoga became the presidential plenipotentiary envoy in the Ural Federal District.According to source -electing- war participants as State Duma deputies is the easiest way to report on their recruitment to power: -[Appoint them] not to the executive branch, where the money is, not to the financial and industrial groups [financial and industrial groups], where the real masters of Russia, but to the powerless representative government.-Among the problematic issues is the controllability of such deputies. Some sources doubt that professional politicians will find it easy to work with them. However, it is expected that it will be mainly officials who previously went to war, and not ordinary fighters, who will get into the State Duma.	https://t.me/astrapress/75961	2025-03-06T02:48:32-08:00

Social activists suspect man-made discharges from Norilsk Nickel factories and minesIn Norilsk, water has been leaking onto the road to the airport for more than a month, despite frosts down to -40‚Äì45 degrees. Social activists believe that this is not a natural phenomenon, but a discharge of technical water from Norilsk Nickel factories and mines. They contacted Rosprirodnadzor and the prosecutor's office, stating that at this temperature the water should have frozen, but this does not happen, which may indicate its man-made origin.-The continuous spill of water creates a dangerous situation on the road, the man-made nature of the water can lead to harm to the life and health of citizens, and harm the environment,- says a letter from the public organization -My Home- in Norilsk,- transmits -Siberian Express-. Norilsk Nickel explains the problem by natural processes and terrain features, due to which water flows down to the highway. The company sent equipment to remove the ice and clean the culvert, but the situation has still not been resolved. Chairman of the organization -My Home- in Norilsk Ruslan Abdullaev compared what was happening with the fuel spill in Taimyr in 2020 and believes that the authorities should introduce a state of emergency at least at the local level in order to understand in detail the causes of the leak. In the meantime, according to him, Norilsk Nickel is simply clearing the way, but not solving the problem itself.	https://t.me/astrapress/75937	2025-03-05T21:52:30-08:00

Thus, from December 1, 2024 to January 20, 2025, aircraft from the Russian fleet experienced 11 engine failures. It was previously reported that last year the number of air incidents in the Russian Federation increased by 25%. At least 90% of these were due to system failures, mainly engines and chassis. If the West does not lift sanctions, the situation will worsen this year, experts are sure, interviewed Radio Liberty. Vessels require a thorough inspection - C Check - every 18-24 months, and D Check - every 6-12 years. This cannot be done without direct cooperation with aircraft manufacturers. -I don‚Äôt have exact data on the service life of all Russian aircraft, but 2025 will be the last year of legal operation of most of them,- said a Russian aviation safety expert.Russian airlines are trying to extend the life of aircraft by smuggling certified parts from the US and Europe, as well as resorting to unofficial technical inspections and reducing the frequency of flights. Today, the Russian aircraft fleet consists of about 700 foreign and 150 Sukhoi Superjet. However, sanctions also affect the production of domestic aircraft, since they also depend on Western parts. Even though they can pass C and D Check in the Russian Federation, airlines will still have to resort to finding Western parts for modernization. -Both foreign aircraft and the Superjet will eventually be taken out of service due to parts shortages. Superjet will last only a year longer,- another flight safety expert told the publication.Russia is pinning its hopes on the new domestic MC-21 aircraft, but the Russian Federation does not have a replacement for American engines. If China can supply Russia with reliable engines, the MC-21 may have a future, but not before 2029, experts say. -As a result, China will receive a plane for rogue countries - Iran, North Korea and Russia,- one of the interlocutors concluded.	https://t.me/astrapress/75900	2025-03-05T12:05:34-08:00

The Ministry of Finance proposed to monitor tax residency through banking applicationsThe Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation proposed to take into account the frequency of use of banking applications abroad when checking tax residency, write Vedomosti. If a client accesses the bank‚Äôs electronic services from abroad more than half the time over the course of six months, this may become the basis for requesting data on his tax status. Banks will be required to check with such users information about residency and transfer it to the Federal Tax Service. However, the very fact of using a mobile bank abroad will not automatically confirm a change in tax status - they do not plan to use geolocation data for these purposes. Currently, tax residents of Russia are considered to be those who spend at least 183 days in the country during the year. The loss of this status means that income received in the Russian Federation will be taxed at a rate of 30%, with the exception of remote employees of Russian companies.	https://t.me/astrapress/75865	2025-03-05T04:02:04-08:00

Today I was thinking that if not for February 24, 2022, ASTRA would probably never have appeared. In fact, I would give a lot for February 24th to never happen. But it happened the way it happened. And now we are - from March 5, 2022 to this day, March 5, 2025. We work, therefore we exist. We try to do what we can, but of course this is still not enough. We try to change the world for the better with our work - but, of course, it is not changing that actively. I don't particularly like birthdays lately, but for some reason this three-year publication milestone seems important. First of all, it‚Äôs surprising: we lasted 3 years, seriously? Secondly, this is amazing: there are already more than 260 thousand of you, you really need us. Thirdly, it makes you think: a full-scale war has been going on for 3 years, is everything okay with this world?But despite the fact that the reason for our appearance was not at all joyful, during this time we were able to change something. Something in this world, it seems to me, needs to be improved. Our holiday posts today will also be devoted to these changes. I congratulate every reader who has walked this path with us; without you it would definitely not have happened. Thank you. If you want to congratulate us, first, take care of yourself and your loved ones: rest, hug or confess your love to someone close to you once again; secondly, help those in need, there seem to be so many oppressed people in the world and they require our support. And thirdly, you can please and thank our team (all the ways are here: @astradonate) so that each of them buys a birthday cake today and drinks tea with family or friends. For you, us and this whole world, so that it someday becomes truly peaceful.‚òÆÔ∏è Happy Birthday to -Astra-, its readers and team!	https://t.me/astrapress/75839	2025-03-05T00:17:38-08:00

Vika weighed up to 30 kilograms. I helped her get up, because she was in such a state that she couldn‚Äôt even lift her head from the pillow. At first I raised my head, Vika grabbed the handle of the bed, and only then could she get up like that,- says the cellmate.The last time Vika was seen was on September 8, 2024, when she was taken out of the cell in an unknown direction.Roshchina stopped communicatingin August 2023 while preparing a report on the occupied territories of Ukraine.
