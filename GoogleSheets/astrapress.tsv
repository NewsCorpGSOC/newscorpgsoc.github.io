Let us remind you that Vladimir Solovyov responded to the post, saying, that this is a lie, and the Ukrainian TsIPSO allegedly throws in fake materials through Astra with the aim of -distracting our brilliant commanders from the work of destroying the Nazi vermin.- After this, dozens of relatives of the military contacted the editor, who replied to Solovyov, and they also told how Ksenofontov and Andrey Syrotyuk (-Eagle-), sending the military into deadly assaults and receiving state awards for this, underestimate the losses of their -death brigade- by tens of times thanks to the so-called -seconded- military personnel - from other military units. After the publication, according to the wife of the missing military man, Alina Bolvinova, Soloviev never contacted the soldiers of the 25th brigade, and also did not interview the injured relatives, as the women requested. In addition, Bolvinova learned that Ksenofontov has already been convicted of beating a military man - in 2021, he beat a subordinate for not I was able to light the stove. Bolvinova, in a new appeal to Belousov, said that she had received even more appeals from the wives and relatives of military men who were subordinate to Ksenofontov. Here is the story of one of them: -In July, 102 people from the IK were brought to the 25th brigade. By order of Ksenofontov, 30 of them were handcuffed to three ordinary contract soldiers. Our [contract soldiers] were given body armor and machine guns, but no ammunition. And the prisoners were given nothing at all. They were sent away as cannon fodder. In this way they were ground in 2-3 days.- I spent two days recovering from this story, and all the stories with drunken assaults seemed like flowers to me. Can a mentally healthy person give such orders? The kind of person who doesn't enjoy killing. I think not,- says Alina.Bolvinova emphasizes that, if necessary, she is ready to cooperate with the investigation and is ready to disclose the names and contacts of all sources, -provided that all of them are guaranteed safety and security.- In addition, according to her, after ASTRA‚Äôs publications, the administrator of the Insider channel began to receive proposals to publish posts whitewashing Ksenofontov. A few days later, in one of the Z-channels called -Misha from Canada- (10 thousand subscribers), a publication appeared in which the women who complained about Ksenofontov were called -enemies-, and the -bloggers- who published this information were called -trash, which needs to be planted.- Among other things, Bolvinova complained that they still refuse to issue her a certificate of her husband‚Äôs death, and military unit 29760, which owed her husband half a million rubles, paid the debt only after the uproar. The true commander of this unit, according to close military personnel, is Ksenophontov, -and all these acting commanders perform his duties while he is behind the belt and commands the 25th brigade.- The appeal was also recorded by the wife of the mobilized Kirill Velichko. He last got in touch on January 18, 2024 and reported that he was being taken to the assault. According to his colleagues, he died on January 19 near Sinkovka as a result of a drone strike. Commander Syrotyuk Andrei Ivanovich (call sign -Eagle-) himself did not know where Kirill was, and when asked how this could be, he blocked the woman, Ekaterina said. Also, according to a colleague, during those 2 days of preparation for the assault, they never saw the commanders of their 25th brigade.-It turns out that 2 days of preparation before the assault are enough to be a combat and experienced grenade launcher,- she said.ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to free speech: PatreonBoosty CryptoBuyMeACoffee Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/65709	2024-10-03T09:40:22-07:00

On August 26, he decided to escape from the unit and return home. He did not tell her the reasons why he did this. He stayed at home for only a few days - soon he was stopped on the street to have his documents checked and taken to the police station. There it turned out that he was wanted.-My husband called me and said that he had been detained, so I accordingly came there. We sat in the police for two hours, the military commandant‚Äôs office arrived. He said: -Guys, I‚Äôm not going anywhere. Either I stay here or I just die.- A scuffle broke out, and eventually he was handcuffed, forced into a car, and taken to the military commandant‚Äôs office. I called the duty officer there, they don‚Äôt provide information - it‚Äôs the weekend.&nbsp;And three days later the prosecutor‚Äôs office told me that he was sent to Zaitsevo,- says Valentina.Valentina says that Alexey left at home all his personal belongings - from a military ID to a telephone, on which his comrades periodically write. Answering them, she found out that some of her husband‚Äôs colleagues also passed through Zaitsevo.-One tells me, I know what kind of place this is, I was there for two weeks. He was put there because he insulted the commander. Why, if my husband broke the law, is he not in a pre-trial detention center, but in a hole? And why are his rights not respected? They should at least have informed me as a relative that my husband was detained under such and such an article, and not torture people and mock me. They are not even allowed to go to the toilet, people walk under themselves.&nbsp;Up to 100 people sit there at a time. You wouldn‚Äôt wish this on your enemy,- Valentina told ASTRA.According to Valentina, her husband went to war not out of patriotic convictions or for the sake of money, but because -he was interested in - - he did not serve in military service for medical reasons. - When he made his choice, it was a shock for me. I couldn‚Äôt come to my senses for three days. If I had known about this in advance, I would never have let him in in my life. I don't need any blood money. And they don‚Äôt even have this money, because they provided for themselves. They bought socks, tents, food, cigarettes, some tools, pens, paid for their communications, the Internet. We bought tents so that we wouldn‚Äôt sleep on the cold ground. I think this is not normal. Why did they go to fight then? They, like patriots, went for Russia. What did you get in the end? Such an appeal? What money? What is shown on TV is all nonsense,- says Valentina.Valentina has sent appeals to the presidential administration, as well as to several deputies, but is worried that the answer to them will not arrive on time , and now -every minute counts.--I just need to get my husband out of there. Let him be punished according to the law, they will give him a prison term, but he did not deserve what is happening in Zaitsevo. I don't think anyone deserves this. I owe my husband my whole life, I cannot leave him. I've known him for over 20 years. I‚Äôm ready to do anything for him, but he needs to be pulled back out of this hole. And I don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs alive or not. My head is just a mess.

A video appeared on the Internet in which a man in civilian clothes fires a burst of pistol into the sky and dances Lezginka surrounded by other men in military uniform. As the publication -Ashes- writes... A Chechen from Akhmat threw a grenade at the car of a military man from Dagestan in the Belgorod region 35-year-old Kurban Akaev is the commander of a repair company from the 752nd regiment, which is based in the city of Valuiki. Kurban is Dargin by origin. When asked by an ASTRA correspondent whether his nationality is the cause of the conflict, Kurban replies-I didn‚Äôt have any conflict with him.- On the night of September 29, Kurban's vacation began. He met him at the Roly-Poly cafe in Valuyki, chatting in a company of about a dozen friends near his Toyota Camry. Police officers and a company of about 20 Chechens stood nearby. According to Kurban, before the flash he heard someone pulling the pin from a grenade. -It[the grenade] rolled a little and suddenly exploded. An officer stood next to me - he bent over. I see he‚Äôs bleeding from his head because of the fragments.- The wounded officer, says Kurban, was afraid to go to the hospital so that his unit would not accuse him of being AWOL. According to Kurban, the military man who attacked him serves in the Akhmat regiment -When he threw a grenade, panic set in, people began to run inside and he shouted ‚ÄòAkhmat strength‚Äô. He raised his hand and I recognized him immediately,- says Kurban. As a result of the explosion, his car was scratched many times by shrapnel, and in one place his door was broken.When asked whether the grenade was a live one, Kurban answers in the affirmative. The owner of the Roly-Poly cafe, in a conversation with ASTRA, suggested that the grenade could have been a -dummy-, since there was no serious damage as a result of the explosion and there was no need to call an ambulance. Kurban says that the Chechen who attacked him was together with two other people. Chechens from a company of 20 people approached him after the explosion to discuss car repairs. -They came running, shouting that he would do [repair] your car &lt;..&gt; Then they got into a fight. An innocent man stood with a phone and talked - and they attacked him, they thought that he was filming them,- says the military man. According to Kurban, the Chechens have long been -lawless- in Valuyki.&nbsp;In July, in this city, soldiers from Chechnya danced lezginka and shot in the air - after which the head of the district said that -measures have been taken to prevent such cases.- This is not the first time that Cafe Roly-Poly has been in the news: in March, residents of Valuyka they called for it to be closedbecause of two strippers who washed each other during the performance.	https://t.me/astrapress/65518	2024-09-30T13:01:58-07:00

It is noteworthy that in January 2022, on Oleg Kashin‚Äôs stream, Readovka editor-in-chief Alexey Kostylev said that he does not receive money from the Kremlin or other government agencies.Previously, Meduza and The Bell released a joint investigation about&nbsp;the work of this publication. Before the war, Readovka had a reputation as an opposition media outlet, but after the invasion of Ukraine began, they began to actively support the Kremlin. -In March 2022, our editorial office literally turned into a sect. Kostylev began to gather employees and give lectures about the fact that the world after the start of the war will no longer be the same, you need to accept the new course of events, not ask questions and trust the information he conveys. Kostylev always wanted to be in the&nbsp;center, and&nbsp;in&nbsp;in&nbsp;the center of what&nbsp;is not&nbsp;important,- said a former employee of the publication. In 2022 Kostylev tried to become the contractor for the Ministry of Defense for the supply of down jackets. It was planned to buy khaki down jackets in China and sell them to the Russian army. Depending on the fabric, the Ministry of Defense then purchased down jackets at a price of 15 to 200 thousand rubles per piece. The idea failed when China blocked the export of army-colored down jackets to Russia so as not to violate American sanctions.At the end of December 2023, he launched the clothing brand -24 New Russian Brand-, where trousers were sold for 20,000 rubles, and quilted jackets for 60,000. He explained the high prices by the exclusivity and tailoring of things in Russia. Soon after the news was published, Kostylev wrote to ASTRA that -everywhere he emphasizes that he is not the founder of the brand.-	https://t.me/astrapress/65517	2024-09-30T12:20:06-07:00

This military formation was formed in 2022 and consists mainly of mobilized people. His command is accused of torturing their own military personnel - as well as their mass murder.The murder of 7 military personnel took place in the early morning of July 4, 2023 in the village of Bakhmutskoye, the so-called -DPR-. At that time, battles were still going on for this village - which the military from the 6th division took advantage of. They took their colleagues to the basement and threw 5 F-1 grenades there. The survivors of the explosion were finished off with a silent PB pistol. 19 Russian military personnel are listed as victims in the case. All of them were held at different times in the basements of apartment buildings in the city of Popasnaya -LPR-. According to the command, they were placed there for refusing to follow orders. There they were subjected to torture: they were beaten -with their feet, fists, and also with various objects and special equipment in the face and body.- The military was also denied access to food, water and hygiene products. Out of 19 victims, military prosecutors -saved- 8 people by dismissing the military personnel. Another military man escaped execution in Bakhmutskoye due to injury. For the first time, a criminal case against the command of the 6th division became known this summer from investigations of the Ukrainian portal -Suspilne-. The publication confirmed information about the criminal case in conversations with relatives of the murdered and murderers. To them, Ukrainian journalists introduced themselves as employees of -public television,- without specifying either the TV channel or the country of broadcasting. Among others, -Suspilna- was able to reach the wife of the commander of the 6th division, Marat Ospanov (call sign -Gyurza- - in the photo), whom investigators consider the main organizer of the massacre. This summer, his wife told reporters that Ospanov was being examined at a psychiatric clinic in Lugansk. According to Suspilne, 19 soldiers from the 6th division were sent to torture cellars in the city of Popasnaya due to publications on social networks of complaints about the conditions of service. ASTRA was among the first to publish these appeals from the military of the 6th division - for example, the complaint of those mobilized from the 1307th regiment that they were being used as -cannon fodder-. 5 of the 7 soldiers killed in Bakhmutsky served in this regiment.In total, there are 7 defendants in the criminal case. As ASTRA found out, the case was initiated under articles of abuse of power (parts 3 and 4 of article 286), unlawful deprivation of liberty (part 3 of article 127) and murder of two or more persons (part 2 of article 105).	https://t.me/astrapress/65507	2024-09-30T09:50:08-07:00

As evidence, the channel‚Äôs author spoke about Chernenko‚Äôs meeting with the political adviser to the British Embassy in Tbilisi, Christopher Joyce, whom the channel calls -the curator of Mi-6 in Georgia.- The article states that Joyce was in Russia from the end of 2017 to March 2018, held the position of secretary at the British Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãafter which he was expelled from Russia on charges of espionage - the reason was the incident with the Skripals. In addition to Joyce, the journalist is accused of collaborating with a number of Western organizations, for example, with the Carnegie Foundation (in Russia the foundation is declared a -foreign agent-). -Given the level of access and social circles, Chernenko could not only share information, but also highlight new people for British intelligence, as well as organize contacts with them,- writes Rybar. For a journalist Kommersant editor-in-chief Mikhail Lukin stood up. According to him, the posts of the telegram channel -are designed in the classic genre of denunciation.- He stated that communicating with various speakers is the job of a journalist. -Writing -Elena Chernenko communicates with people from the British embassy- is the same as reproaching the employees of the Kommersant incident department for communicating with police officers, prosecutors, lawyers and crime bosses,- he added.February 24, 2022 Chernenko published an open anti-war letter.
