At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later, you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations, sending us links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without posting about it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name. This will help minimize risks and feel calmer.All donations sent from November 12th will be used to collect salaries.

Nobody cares what state you are in.- ASTRA found out new details of the military riot near NovosibirskASTRA managed to find another witness military riot in the unit under Novosibirsk. He asked for anonymity, but confirmed his words with documents (he himself has category -G-) and told the editors what preceded the escape of the military from military unit 57849 to Kochenevo. According to the editorial interlocutor, in the barracks of the military unit at the time the riot began there were -110-120 people, approximately no less than 100.- He himself ended up in barracks 57849 from unit 98551 in Abakan with another 45 people. -There were probably 8-10 people ready to go beyond the tape [that is, to the so-called -NWO- zone]. All the rest are sick, on crutches, inactive.- They were brought there on the night of November 8th. In the morning, sick military personnel began to write reports to the commander about the provision of medical care and military medical assistance, but these reports never went anywhere. -There was a guy [in barracks 57849], half a foot was missing on both legs. His military unit, I don‚Äôt know which one, fired him and gave him a commission. He was somehow pushed into this Kochanevskaya unit. And he was there for a month,- says ASTRA‚Äôs interlocutor. He retells the words representative of the commandant's office: -You are not being transferred here. Everyone is sent here. Bedridden, on stretchers, blind. Nobody cares what condition you are in.- According to the military man, he and his colleagues repeatedly asked for a doctor‚Äôs help: -We already realized that we couldn‚Äôt pass the Military Military Commissions, because everyone there was screaming, that you are all going to the 'SVO' zone.-For several days they asked the commandant of the Novosibirsk garrison and a representative of the military prosecutor's office to arrive. Due to inaction and refusal to even provide medical care, the military began a riot. According to the latest data, all participants in the escape from the military unit in Kochenevo on November 13 were detained, the Investigative Committee reported this evening. The editor's interlocutor especially noted one of the wounded - this is 36-lieutenant Alexander Andreev. An ASTRA source claims that Andreev lost the ability to speak after being wounded. -Lieutenant Andreev hears, but he is mute and communicates only using the telephone. He writes in notes and lets them read. You understand, he needs to learn sign language and he needs a phone now. And in this military unit, the phone is taken away - from 8 am to 8 pm. And people need help. He has one [right] hand only that works. Personally, I cut his nails. The situation is such that he constantly needs help - to open a jar, pour coffee. It might fall. Personally, I have been constantly with him since the 8th. Because of the wound, his head hurts and his eyes are watering - it feels like he has a constant fever.- Before unit 57849, Andreev was treated in neurology at the Abakan Clinical Hospital, where he was given category -G- (temporarily unfit). According to the latest information, Andreev was sent to Rostov-on-Don. Then he may return to the -NWO- zone.

But I‚Äôm not going to leave my homeland, and if that means I have to go to prison, I‚Äôll go to prison.

For the first two crimes (Part 1 of Article 30 and Article 352.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) he faces a total of up to 20 years in prison, and for desertion (Part 3 of Article 338 of the Criminal Code) - another 15 years.The investigation claims that Ivanishin twice tried to surrender to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the second time successfully, and also deserted from his 39th separate Guards Motorized Rifle Red Banner Brigade. In a video recorded while in captivity, the serviceman spoke out against the war and claimed that he and his comrades allegedly did not want to fight and were fleeing their positions. The man spent six months in captivity, and in January 2024, along with 248 Russian military personnel, he was released as a result of an exchange. At home on Sakhalin he was arrested. The case began to be considered by a local court, but then it was transferred to Moscow. Details of the crimes he is accused of are unknown. -In the modern realities of the Northern Military District and the emerging law enforcement practice, which the plenum of the Supreme Court summarized in its resolution, it is almost impossible to -legally- surrender. You can only be captured against your will - for example, in an unconscious or helpless state. And the burden of proving these circumstances lies in fact on the fighter himself,- said lawyer Alexander Pochuev. Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/68401	2024-11-13T05:45:11-08:00

Investigators calculated that -at the time of the arrest of the accused, the cost of 1 gram of cocaine was 15,000 rubles.- Thus, the cost of the drug shipment was about 3 billion rubles.

In the fall, this document found by Meduza reader. Probably, the presentation contains a prototype of some kind of system for registering Russians subject to mobilization. As Meduza notes, there is no unconditional evidence of the authenticity of this presentation, however, even this document contains some important information.So, in addition to the expected personal data such as full name, passport number, information about work, place of residence, health and etc. the presentation contains the contribution -Priority information of military personnel- - apparently, this means -Military records-. It contains information whether the Russian subject to mobilization has the rights of a tractor driver, a medical education or a sports reserve. And also whether the person has children or other persons in their care. Meduza writes that, presumably, military registration and enlistment office employees will rely on this information when deciding whether to send a mobilization summons.

The woman is suspected of disrupting the activities of institutions that ensure isolation from society (Part 2 of Article 321 of the Criminal Code), reported -Team Against Torture- with reference to lawyer Alexander Savin.According to this article, 55-year-old Musaeva faces up to five years in prison. At the same time, the likelihood of a new case became known at the end of October, when the woman was interviewed by an investigator from the Investigative Committee. He came to the colony settlement in the city of Argun, where she is serving her sentence. Musaeva says she was questioned because she allegedly attacked a Federal Penitentiary Service officer who accompanied her on daily trips to the hospital. Zarema denies these accusations and says that she physically could not attack the security officer. In addition, the woman suffers from a chronic disease - she has insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, and she has to use a cane to move.Zarema Musaeva was abducted by Chechen police in Nizhny Novgorod in January 2022. According to investigators, she scratched the face of one of them. On July 4, 2023, the Akhmatovsky District Court of Grozny sentenced Zarema Musaeva to 5.5 years in prison in a general regime colony for -using violence against a government official,- but later her sentence was reduced to 4 years and 9 months. The European Court concluded that the persecution of the elderly woman was exclusively political and was explained by the opposition activities of her sons. Therefore, the ECHR awarded 52 thousand euros in compensation to Musaeva.	https://t.me/astrapress/68243	2024-11-11T03:40:14-08:00

According to them, they are now in the basement of one of the buildings in Toretsk. They claim that they were sent to a one-way meat assault, and they want to get to the evacuation point and survive.Oleg Guivik was born in the village of Krasnoye, Artemovsky district. In 2014, he joined the militia because he -had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreuniting Donbass with Russia.- However, Oleg says, after 2022 his views changed significantly.-At first everything was fine, but then incomprehensible meat assaults began, when the guys began to simply be destroyed. And at one fine moment last year I quarreled with the chief of staff. They disagreed on the use of personnel. As a result, I was sent from headquarters as the commander of a regular motorized rifle platoon, where I served for three months. Soon I was sent to an area unknown to me to participate in assault operations. The main firepower was taken away from me, and since I did not know the terrain, they simply began to destroy me. I asked to leave, at least to regroup. But the authorities said: even if you die, take this landing. I refused to further participate in this event and said that without intelligence and support I would not let the guys go further to their death. I was called to headquarters, I was beaten by the commander of the third motorized rifle battalion. They forced me to write an explanation convenient for them and after that they sent me to a pit,- Oleg recalls.Oleg sat in a pit in Yenakievo for a week. He doesn‚Äôt know where exactly it was, he only remembers that there was a train station nearby. -I was there for seven days in dampness, in complete darkness. I was injured. I asked those who were guarding me to provide me with medical assistance. I demanded that an investigator be brought to me and told what I was accused of. To all this they either responded indifferently or simply chuckled. One day I couldn't stand it. I see that this is not a military commandant‚Äôs office, not a military police, because everything is civilian. I'm just in a place I don't understand. Who it is, what it is is unknown. Knowing the reputation of the command staff of my battalion, I had the feeling that I was simply brought to some criminal elements. And I ran away without feeling any criminal responsibility,- says Oleg. Oleg returned home and lived there for five months. Soon a criminal case was opened against him for leaving his unit without permission. Until the end of the trial, he was to be removed from participation in hostilities. However, on October 1, he was again sent to the front line.-Anyone who survives from this meat grinder can confirm my words, but, of course, he will not be allowed to leave, because that‚Äôs how it works. You come here and die so as not to tell later what happened. Many people don't know what's going on here. Two of us are led in the middle of the night in an unknown direction, purely on the radio station‚Äôs prompts. They take you to some building and say, come in. And there they are met by Ukrainian soldiers with fire and destroyed. If the first deuce does not succeed, the next deuce goes and the same fate awaits it. And it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you are wounded or not. There was a case when a deuce was walking and they came under artillery fire. One of the guys had his leg blown off and was unable to continue moving. His partner received a command to reset him, that is, kill him, and continue moving on his own,- Oleg recalls.The last mission Oleg went on was the same as the previous ones - -They just stupidly directed the drone and the radio station.- -Right-left, right-left. If you don‚Äôt want to go, they throw a grenade at you from above in order to speed you up,- says Oleg.üå± Subscribe to ASTRA.

In the audio recording published by ASTRA, a person is probably being electrocuted using an army telephone ASTRA told about this one of the military men who served under the leadership of -Cap- - Alexei Korchagin, commander of the 1st MSB of the 123rd brigade of military unit 40463. He recognized his voice from the audio recording. According to him, Korchagin is -a real sadist.- It is he who commands the assault units in the 123rd Brigade.-Maybe he is the best at forcing [to go on the attack]. But Tashkent [deceased brigade commander Denis Ivanov] trusted him; Kashtan [the current brigade leader] trusts him. He himself became a commander after the death of Tashkent, he said. ‚Äî The direction was very difficult and a lot of people died. More than one thousand were laid on the railway. Those were led by Cap himself, although all 4 battalions participated.- The interlocutor assumes that on the recording - electric shock torture. Moreover, the unknown man, according to him, is being tortured with a military telephone, or -tapik- in military jargon. With the help of it, particularly important information is transmitted at the front.-Two wires are connected to a person and the handle is turned, at this moment the victim receives a current of 110 volts.- The security forces tortured in the same way detained terrorists in Crocus (pictured). Previously ASTRA wrote that the relatives of one of the missing servicemen from Lugansk unit 40463 received personal belongings of the missing person and found an audio recording of the beatings and torture. Along with the audio on the phone, the relatives claim that they found a correspondence on Telegram in which the man who is screaming in the video writes that he is -with Cap and Gold- and that the interlocutor -shouldn‚Äôt dare write to him- because he is being tortured with electric shock. He also sent a video message and showed that he had blood on his head. Before this, ASTRA talked about those who disappeared without a trace in Lugansk part 40463, before he had time to arrive there. Loved ones of missing soldiers said that military personnel are disappearing en masse just a few days after their arrival. Among those listed there were prisoners from Volgograd colonies. According to relatives, out of 108 prisoners, 102 are missing. The relatives of the missing are not given any information, and the majority of those who applied did not even have notices that their relatives were missing. At the same time, some women claim that their husbands and sons were sent to unit 40463 either illegally or as -punishment.- For most women, nameless representatives of the unit, hiding under Telegram nicknames, answer that their loved ones stopped communicating after the drone attack. One of the relatives, when asked how the man disappeared, was told that he might-stayed to drink tea in a nearby dugout,- and when asked to evacuate, they even answered that she could pull him out on her own fighter.üå± Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty CryptoBuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/68185	2024-11-10T03:50:11-08:00

The representative of the Kursk region administration for internal policy, Anatoly Drogan, came out to them. He invited the refugees to disperse from the square and go to the public reception area to draw up a collective appeal, but they refused. -We don‚Äôt care where we freeze. It‚Äôs freezing outside, what difference does it make to us, we‚Äôre not at home anyway,- said one of the refugees.After that, Drogan accused them of organizing a -public illegal action.- -You are being pushed into illegal actions. We live with you in the regime of WHO, unfortunately, this does not depend on the authorities. The authorities did not push any of the enemies to the border, this is war. [‚Ä¶] This is not controlled by the authorities, there was a breakthrough, the troops who stood there died. Believe me, the culprits have already been detained. If it makes you feel better, the military who allowed [the breakthrough], if they remained alive, they will be punished,- Drogan said.To this, those gathered shouted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were standing on the border at the time of the invasion conscripts with machine guns, and it is not them who should be punished, but the -generals-. They also demanded that the authorities admit that there is a war going on. Drogan was asked why he, and not the head of the Sudzhansky district, Alexander Bogachev, came to them. -Do you want to communicate with us or yell?

ASTRA: For the first time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked military personnel from the DPRK, Ukrainian intelligence says. This happened in the Kursk region. Yesterday, the head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Andrey Kovalenko, announced this. According to him... The DPRK military has been sent not only to the Kursk region, but also to the Belgorod region The Washington Post writes about this with reference to the commander of the Ukrainian battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd brigade of Yuri Fedorenko. He learned of the North Koreans' arrival in the Belgorod region while analyzing intelligence data, including intercepted communications.It is alleged that North Korean soldiers will be sent to the second line of defense to free up more manpower for the offensive in northeastern Ukraine. According to American intelligence, there are already about 10 thousand military personnel of the DPRK army in the Kursk region, and a South Korean official previously reported ,that for every North Korean soldier sent to Russia, Pyongyang can receive about $2,000. Thus, North Korea's income from sending 10,000 troops could be more than $200 million a year.	https://t.me/astrapress/68152	2024-11-09T11:55:17-08:00

üé¨ A military man escaped from the war and spoke about executions...	A military man escaped from the war and spoke about executions and detachments in his regiment. After the video was published, he was detained and sent backAt the end of October, a message from a soldier with the call sign -Sailor- appeared on Telegram channels, who spoke about the -zeros- in the 19th regiment (military unit 12322 ). According to him, the regiment commander with the call sign -Pioneer- ordered the killing of six of his colleagues - -Elvis-, -Proka-, -Maly-, -Dolomite-, -Gorilla-, -Masyanya- and -Hummer- -- because they refused to go on a combat mission. The execution was carried out by military men with the call signs -Fenich-, -Skazka- and -Nickel-. ASTRA found out that the person in the video is 39-year-old Vitaly Degtyarenko. After the publication of the video, he was detained in Omsk by military police. Footage of the arrest also appeared on TV channels. One of the employees, Stanislav Dubrovin, told ASTRA that Degtyarenko had already been brought to military unit 12322 in Kremennaya (Lugansk region). When asked why the man did not get in touch, he replied that only officers were given telephones, and in general there was supposedly no communication there. According to one of the soldiers from the 19th regiment, Dubrovin and his comrade belong to the so-called -search group- of the regiment, which catch those who left the unit without permission. Two servicemen who also left the combat zone, on condition of anonymity, confirmed to ASTRA information about executions and barrage detachments in the 19th regiment. One of them personally knew all those killed. They claim that the commander of the Pioneer regiment is according to some sources, Lieutenant Colonel Evgeniy Ladnov from Yuzhnouralsk - not only exhibited barrier detachments, but also personally shot at the feet of those who refused to go on the mission. According to them, he sent back the wounded and shell-shocked who returned from a mission with the Urals. Those who refused were opened fire with a machine gun. The worst thing was for the -refuseniks- and those who drank. Those -Pioneer- sent to pull bodies from the battlefield without armor, helmets and machine guns. In winter, this category of military, by order of the military, was put naked in a pit and doused with cold water, after which many suffered frostbite and pneumonia. One of the interlocutors told ASTRA that the -Nickel- fighter mentioned in the video -personally led him under a machine gun, put the machine gun on his chest and asked the question: -Are you ready to die now?-. The man claims that at least 10 people escaped from his company alone. -And a lot of people are running away from the regiment, because we were simply sent to meat. And the regiment commander himself said: -You won‚Äôt live long,- he said. The soldier escaped after being wounded for the second time - while he and his colleagues were being led to a mission under machine guns. They had to flee through the forest. Once in Russia, he learned from a friend that he had been transferred to an assault company and -they wanted to reset him- because he was a witness to executions and blocking detachments. At the same time, according to interlocutors, after complaints from relatives, the regiment was repeatedly inspected, during which the -Pioneer- disappeared on a combat mission and appeared only after the inspectors had left. The commander‚Äôs subordinates are -afraid to open their mouths- because they know what consequences await them, the military says.üå± Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/68136	2024-11-09T05:20:27-08:00

He also sent a video message and showed that he had blood on his head. Previously, ASTRA talked about those who disappeared without a trace in Luhansk part 40463, before he had time to arrive there.

üé¨üñº Two police officers used threats to force a native of Crimea...	Two police officers used threats to force a native of Crimea to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense and fictitiously married him in order to receive money for his death. He escaped from the war 35-year-old Sergei Zhukov is now hiding in an attic in one of the villages, he told ASTRA. -They didn‚Äôt teach me anything. I don't want to fight. I put down my weapon and just ran away,- he said. Zhukov was born in the city of Old Crimea. According to him, he has no relatives, he is an orphan. The man admitted that he had been convicted of burglary and theft in the past. He served his sentence in IK-24 in the Vladimir region and was released in February 2024. After his release, Zhukov decided to stay in the region, settling in the city of Mikhailovka, where he got a job as a laborer at a construction site. ASTRA confirmed Zhukov‚Äôs biography based on leaked databases. Zhukov signed the contract in June of this year. He claims that on June 2-3 he was drinking beer on a bench when two police officers approached him and detained him. The department began to put pressure on Sergei to sign a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry. Otherwise, the operatives threatened to -find drugs on him- and close him down for 10-15 years. -You‚Äôre an orphan, you have no one. We will bury you, and the rest of the money will go to our needs... Naturally, I refused. They started hitting me in the ribs and back,- he told ASTRA. He only remembers that one of the policemen‚Äôs name is Sergei, he is about 40 years old. The next day, operatives brought Zhukov to the registry office, where a fictitious wife was waiting for him, who was supposed to receive money for his death. In the passport that Zhukov sent to the editor, there is indeed a stamp indicating marriage on June 4, 2024. His wife is 53-year-old Elena Podkolzina. ASTRA got through to Podkolzina. She stated that she last contacted her -husband- supposedly 2 months ago, and now he, according to eyewitnesses, is allegedly missing. When asked about how long they were together before getting married, Elena did not immediately answer. After thinking, she said: -For a long time.- During the conversation, the woman ate, laughed and asked why she was being asked these questions. When asked what she plans to do next, Podkolzina said: -Wait. Maybe it will appear, maybe not.- At the same time, the woman confirmed that Zhukov signed the contract under pressure. According to her, he -got into a fight,- and then the security forces offered him to sign a contract with the Russian Armed Forces. The money for working in the RF Armed Forces was stolen from Zhukov right away. -When I signed the contract, I received a payment, the governor‚Äôs or some kind, I don‚Äôt know... Three hundred thousand. From them I saw only about 20 thousand, maybe that‚Äôs all, no more. And they simply took everything else for themselves,- says the man. After escaping, Zhukov stopped in a certain village, he doesn‚Äôt know which one, and is now hiding in the attic. -I say it again, I don‚Äôt want to fight. And I can‚Äôt even do it. It's just going to certain death. Do you understand? So much time, damn it. Hungry, cold. They don't even feed. And they send them to positions. There is no food, nothing at all. It‚Äôs good that it rained, at least I drank some rainwater... Here.

He is not released from service even despite his hand rotting after a fight with a colleagueRecently, a video message from Lugansk resident Svetlana Salem about her husband, Egyptian citizen Salem Salem Mohamed Ali, appeared online. At the end of 2022, Salem signed an annual contract with the 2nd brigade of the so-called -LPR People‚Äôs Militia- (now the 123rd brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, military unit 40463), which, after Putin‚Äôs decree, became indefinite. -Commanders and other soldiers treated him with disdain. They called me a black man, a gypsy, a suicide bomber. Perhaps they beat me, but he didn‚Äôt tell me about it, but he told his friends from the Arab diaspora about it. When he was injured in service, the command decided to hide this fact, since the circumstances under which the injury occurred were an attack by a drunken colleague armed with a knife in the back of a truck. Dodging the blow, he fell off the side and hit his head. When he was brought to his senses, he realized that his arm was broken. In the hospital, after assistance was provided, a refusal of hospitalization was issued and he was taken to the first line. Only after 2.5 months I was able to get him sent for osteosynthesis surgery,- Svetlana Salem says in the video.According to her, her husband does not speak Russian at all. He signed the contract without a translator. Salem decided not to return to the unit from leave for surgery. After that, Svetlana says in the video,-Representatives of the unit set up surveillance on me and conducted an illegal search in the apartment. After Salem was discovered, he was taken away as a criminal, handcuffed at gunpoint. Then he was sent to the assault.- The story of Salem in a conversation with ASTRA was confirmed by the imam from the Lugansk Cathedral Mosque Walid and the mufti of the -LPR- Muhammad Ismail. At Salem's service -They constantly called me names. They called me -black-assed,- they said, -get out of here, your place is next to the bucket,- young imam Walid told ASTRA. He is originally from Yemen - and he himself also served in the -People‚Äôs Militia- after Medical University. One day, the command of Salem called Walid to the unit to help with translation into Arabic - so he is aware of his situation. -The commander said that Salem disobeyed him. I answered him: ‚ÄòHow can he disobey you if he doesn‚Äôt understand you!‚Äô- Walid told ASTRA. According to him, Salem was encouraged to sign the contract by another serving in the army, a member of the Muslim community of Lugansk (his name is known to ASTRA; he did not answer the call). The imam assumes that he did this to get a vacation: -If they signed up through you, then they give you a vacation. It was beneficial for him to invite Salem.- Mufti of the -LPR- Muhammad Ismail told ASTRA that he addressed the command of Salem: -They didn‚Äôt let him go, he was in a difficult situation, wounded, I remember that such a situation happened.- However, the command of the unit refused to release the Egyptian even after talking with the mufti. Apparently, Salem was helped by a video message from his wife. In the second video, which appeared online a week ago, Svetlana Salem says that her husband has been found - he was returned from his positions and will soon testify to the command as part of the investigation. Previously ASTRA published appeals from loved ones of other military personnel from the 123rd Brigade. Their men -like ghosts- disappeared just a few days after arriving at the location of this connection. üå± Subscribe to ASTRA.

The man died and was buried in a closed coffin. Another purpose of torture was to extort salaries and payments for injuries from one‚Äôs own subordinates.In the comments to post about his death - dozens of messages from relatives of fallen soldiers who wrote about the beating, torture and extortion from Klimenko.	https://t.me/astrapress/67991	2024-11-07T08:39:56-08:00

Roskomnadzor -recommended- site owners to abandon Cloudflare encryption, which can be used to counter censorshipYesterday the agency began blocking sites with such encryptionAmerican company Cloudflare is one of the world's largest providers of protection against DDoS attacks. In October, Cloudflare enabled a new encryption method, Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), for all sites using their servers. Roskomnadzor did not like this - after all, ECH can be used to bypass blocking. Since yesterday, the department has been blocking all sites using ECH. And today Roskomnadzor issued a special memo in which it -recommended- website owners to abandon the unified social tax and generally switch from Cloudflare to domestic solutions for protection against DDoS attacks. Essentially, ECH allows you to hide the site that the user is visiting from the Internet provider. -An IP address can be hidden among billions of requests to a CDN. It's like hiding a tree in the forest - you never know where the user was going. Maybe to the blocked VPN Generator site, or maybe to the Gazprom sites, which are also behind Cloudflare,- - IT expert Mikhail Klimarev explained in his tg channel. According to Roskomnadzor, this technology -violates Russian legislation.- However, how actively ECH was used to bypass blocking in Russia is unknown. Two weeks earlier, the publication Meduza and Sota reported that thanks to ECH from Cloudflare, their sites are again available on the RuNet.An anonymous expert from the public organization Roskomsvoboda told ASTRA that after yesterday ECH blocking in RuNet-A lot of things became inaccessible, but then gradually everyone began to change the settings in CloudFlare.- According to the expert, ECH allows you to encrypt the Server Name Indication field, which is used by some blocking mechanisms used by Roskomnadzor. -It has long been a specification that all browsers can start encrypting this [Server Name Indication] field. The introduction of this technology is gradually taking place, but many states are against it - not only Russia - the first to block it, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, was China. The UK was very strongly opposed (this prevents them from blocking objectionable content on the issue of piracy, drugs, terrorism and extremism). In general, all governments are trying to fight this technological innovation. The simplest way is to block all traffic that encrypts this field in the packet. I think that in Russia everyone will slowly abandon this story, as they did in China,- a representative of Roskomsvoboda told ASTRA.	https://t.me/astrapress/67986	2024-11-07T07:02:13-08:00

This became known last week, after women in labor addressed Governor Oleg Melnichenko on social networks: -The drug is considered vital and is prescribed to all Rh-negative pregnant women from the 28th week.

Several large chain pharmacies stated that supplies of the drug to Crimea stopped more than six months ago - as the newspaper was convinced, it really is not available in online chain pharmacies in the region. The newspaper writes that one of the reasons for the shortage of the drug is the global shortage of plasma from which this medicine is produced.Roszdravnadzor told Kommersant that there are now 46 thousand packages of anti-Rhesus immunoglobulin in the country - and by the end of the year, another 90 thousand packages are expected to be delivered. In total, since the beginning of the year, more than 86 thousand packages of the drug have been introduced into civilian circulation.	https://t.me/astrapress/67967	2024-11-07T03:50:13-08:00
