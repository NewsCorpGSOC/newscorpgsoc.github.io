The European party, which includes Yabloko, has been declared undesirable in RussiaThe Prosecutor General's Office has declared the activities of the European party Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE) and its youth wing European Liberal Youth undesirable in Russia. In the department's report, ALDE is called one of the -most anti-Russian political forces in the EU- - they claim that the party is -consistently engaged in discrediting Russian domestic and foreign policy-, supports the international isolation of Russia, strengthening sanctions and assistance to Ukraine, and also -calls on the United States and European countries to lift restrictions on striking Russian territory.-The Russian Yabloko has also been a member of ALDE since 2006. Now its members may face administrative and criminal liability for participating in the activities of an undesirable organization.-Based on the logic of the accusation brought against Melkonyants, the Yabloko party, as a member of an undesirable organization, must decide on self-liquidation. And this is as absurd as the charge brought against Melkonyants,- said lawyer Mikhail Biryukov.According to him, the -Voice- movement, immediately after recognizing ENEMO as an undesirable organization, -announced the cessation of all contacts- with it, although it was not part of it. -However, according to the investigation, this was not enough,- the lawyer adds. -If Melkonyants is convicted, this will create a dangerous precedent for Yabloko.-Lawyer Mikhail Benyash believes that -the Yabloko party needs to leave the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe today.--And if Yabloko hesitates with this decision, all its members should leave the party in order to avoid administrative and, in the future, criminal liability,- emphasized he.The Yabloko press service stated that party chairman Nikolai Rybakov has not yet commented on the situation, and the official position is only being prepared. The party was also asked to refrain from public comments until the leadership‚Äôs decision is made.	https://t.me/astrapress/75765	2025-03-03T09:35:43-08:00

The founder of the company, Vladimir Melnikov explained this to losses associated with the lack of new technologies and personnel losses: -Because there are no new technologies for development and productivity and we are unprofitable, since some go to the SVO (both men and women), while others sew monotonous clothes with large orders and higher salaries. We have a very diverse product and we [while maintaining our own production in Russia] are very inferior in quality, fashion and price to alternative suppliers. Simply put, this is very unprofitable.

They have to travel to neighboring regions A local deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Alexander Morozov, wrote about this. According to him, three residents of the city contacted him after local hospitals refused to provide an abortion. -Having been refused by medical organizations in the Vologda region, women are forced to apply to health care institutions in neighboring regions on a paid basis. For example, for one of the women who contacted me, a trip to the Yaroslavl region for this purpose cost 50,000 rubles,- says the deputy‚Äôs appeal to the prosecutor.According to him, the heads of medical institutions report to the Ministry of Health of the Vologda Region that hospitals -refuse to perform abortions, except in cases of direct medical indications and situations related to the consequences of criminal acts in against women.-According to ASTRA, the heads of medical institutions were -tacitly prohibited- from performing abortions. There are no official orders in this regard. Now doctors have to arrange abortions for medical reasons, two employees told ASTRA on condition of anonymity.Earlier, regional governor Georgy Filimonov called on public hospitals and private clinics not to terminate pregnancies except for medical reasons and after rape. Morozov asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of refusals in clinics.State Duma deputy from the Vologda region Alexey Kanaev told Vedomosti that he also received two appeals from residents of the region who were denied an abortion, one of them in a state clinic.According to Morozov, abortion will not solve the problem with the birth rate. He believes that the state should help future parents with housing, work, medicine, and education. What influences demography most of all is -confidence in the future; it is its absence today that most influences the demographic situation.--Moreover, negative emotions are caused not even by the obstruction of abortion itself, but by the fact that the decision on this is made behind the scenes, without broad consultation with society.

üñº The penetration service team - Eye of God - was searched. Now ...	The -Eye of God- service team was searched. The bot is not working nowAbout a week ago, security forces came to members of the Eye of God service team, several sources said -Media zones- and journalist Andrey Zakharov.-The entire team of his bot is really being persecuted. -Whoever they can reach,- said one of the sources in the data market. According to the publication, the searches took place as part of a criminal case under Article 272.1 of the Criminal Code (illegal use of personal data obtained unlawfully). It is noted that this is the first known case of using the new article, which appeared at the end of 2024 to combat the trade in personal data and penetration services.Currently, the -Eye of God- does not work. Mediazona‚Äôs source claims that the founder of the service, programmer Evgeny Antipov, is not in Russia. At the same time, he himself stated that this was not true. -They already wrote to me about [the searches] 4 days ago. But we don't have a team. There is only [me], and I have not had any searches. I think they were talking about someone else,- Antipov told Zakharov.On Thursday, Antipov wrote that there would be -small technical changes- in the functionality of the -Eyes of God.-After the adoption of the new law, according to Zakharov, several breakout bots were closed, and one took all its employees out of Russia. The -Eye of God- limited the release of data. -And this is somewhat paradoxical: Antipov officially collaborated with the security forces and gave them unlimited access to his service. In 2023, researchers from universities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Penitentiary Service published the results of a study among current employees of their departments. The survey was conducted in several regions and showed that, for example, 41 out of 50 police officers used the -Eye of God- in their work, the rest simply knew what it was. The bot was convenient: there is no information from banks and marketplaces in government databases; you can get it upon request, which takes time. And here you have everything in one certificate, from the loudest leaks - and even with links to social networks. But what was convenient for the operas was clearly not liked by someone in other departments - for example, in the FSB or some Security Council,- the journalist notes.	https://t.me/astrapress/75488	2025-02-28T00:51:09-08:00

Sledkom became interested in the caseAfter information spread in local public pages that a 16-year-old girl was forcibly married by her parents to a 24-year-old man, the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered to open a criminal case on the fact of forced marriage and restriction of freedom of a minor. This was reported by the department's press service.&nbsp;The incident occurred in February 2024. The girl refused to marry by consent, after which her parents, belonging to the Yazidi community, allegedly beat her and forcibly took her to the groom's house, where she was deprived of freedom, the opportunity to study and communicate with relatives and friends.&nbsp;The marriage was concluded only according to tradition, but not in the registry office.Girl's friends toldE1 that she was under constant control in her husband's house, she was forbidden to continue her studies, her phone was monitored and she was forbidden to leave the house. Five years ago, the groom's family already a tragedy occurred: the man's younger sister committed suicide at the age of 16 when they tried to marry her off to a 50-year-old man.&nbsp;The girl's relatives claim that she was happy in her marriage, calling the accusations -slander.- The head of the public organization -Yazidis of the Urals,- Georgy Asoev, said that the couple lives in peace and harmony, and called the complaints -nonsense.- He emphasized that in the 21st century, forced marriage is impossible, and called not to interfere in family affairs.&nbsp;Nurzida Bensgier, director of the Interethnic Information Center in Yekaterinburg, also commented on the situation. She noted that in diasporas outside their country, the desire to preserve national identity, faith and traditions is especially pronounced, especially in matters of marriage and funerals.&nbsp;According to a study by the human rights organization Ad Rem published in 2024, 4,453 marriages involving underage girls were registered in the country in 2021 alone. However, official statistics do not reflect the real scale of the problem, since many such unions are not officially registered.Yazidis are an ethno-confessional group of Kurds living mainly in northwestern Iraq, northern and northeastern Syria. In Russia, according to the 2010 census, there are more than 40 thousand of them.	https://t.me/astrapress/75421	2025-02-27T01:51:34-08:00

Previously, the Moscow Garrison Military Court acquitted Mrishchuk and other defendants in the case on charges of creating a criminal community, but the Second Western District Military Court overturned the acquittal and sent the case for review.According to the investigation, the PMC -ENOT- was created by Roman Telenkevich, known under the call sign -Vodyanoy-. The fighters of this group took part in escorting humanitarian supplies in Donbass, Syria and other hot spots. In 2022, Telenkevich was sentenced to 13 years in prison for a series of crimes, but instead of serving his sentence in a colony, he signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense and went to fight. After Telenkevich‚Äôs arrest, control of the -raccoons-, according to the investigation, passed to FSB officers Alexander Mrishchuk and Anton Baryakshev.&nbsp;The prosecution claims that fighters of the PMC -ENOT- were used for operational search activities, as well as for attacks on businessmen.

Other victims cannot receive compensation almost a yearA serviceman from Orsk, Alexander L., recorded a video message in which he stated that after losing his home due to the flood in April 2024 and receiving a certificate for a new one, he was deprived of both his old home and the opportunity to purchase a new home. After the flood, the commission declared Alexander's housing unfit for habitation and subject to demolition, after which he was given a certificate for the purchase of new housing. Having concluded a purchase and sale agreement, he transferred the old house into the ownership of the city and went to war. It later turned out that the certificate was canceled and the purchase and sale transaction was declared invalid. As a result, Alexander was left homeless.In his video message to Vladimir Putin and the Chairman of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, Alexander stated: -At a time when I am defending the Fatherland, Russia, the officials of Orsk made me homeless.-The situation was complicated by the fact that the house in which Alexander lived consisted of two halves with different owners. The neighbors decided to carry out a major overhaul of their part, while Alexander sought to demolish his half. This disagreement led to a legal conflict, as a result of which the certificate for new housing was canceled.The head of Orsk, Artem Vorobyov, responded to the video message on his Telegram channel, noting that such cases after a flood are not uncommon and are usually resolved in court. He assured that, together with the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the regional Ministry of Construction, all possible measures are being taken to restore Alexander‚Äôs rights. -It cannot be otherwise,- Vorobiev emphasized. Chairman of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin instructed the regional department of the Investigative Committee to conduct an investigation into this fact and provide a report on the activities carried out.Soon Vorobiev recorded another video message, saying that he had found a solution to safely resolve the situation, but did not provide details.At the same time, the problems of other residents of Orsk, left without housing, remain unresolved.April 8 2024, more than a hundred residents of Orsk came out to a rally to the local administration building, protesting against insufficient compensation and the inaction of the authorities. The protesters demanded a review of the terms of payments and acceleration of the process of providing assistance. In response to this, the governor of the Orenburg region, Denis Pasler, promised to double regional payments.At the end of May 2024, residents of Orsk also claimed that they did not receive compensation. They complained about the same in August. Their problems were not solved either in one day or in several months.

The court in Moscow refused to consider the first case in the Russian Federation of voluntary surrender to the enemy, initiated after the interrogation of a mobilized prisoner in Ukrainian captivity The court in Moscow refused to consider the first criminal case of voluntary surrender during the war in Ukraine. The courts passed the case of the mobilized miner from Sakhalin Roman Ivanishin in a circle - Sakhalin, Khabarovsk, Moscow, eventually returning to the Far East, writes -–™-. The Investigative Committee believes that Ivanishin not only voluntarily surrendered, but also deserted. In total, he faces more than 20 years of strict regime.It is unknown how exactly the serviceman surrendered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The defense believes that the accusation has not been proven; the defendant does not admit it. On the Internet there is a recording of Ivanishin‚Äôs interrogation in Captivity, where he says that he is against war, but he and his comrades do not want to fight. In the footage, he says that he was mobilized in September 2022. The man was exchanged in early January 2024. Once in his homeland, in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the FSB military counterintelligence began checking him. After this, Ivanishin escaped from the unit. He was subsequently detained. Now the trial must take place again on Sakhalin. According to Kommersant's sources, the problem can be resolved if the case is sent to the notorious Donetsk Garrison Military Court. -It is there that many controversial criminal cases often end up, which are considered there without any public scandals,- notes Kommersant.	https://t.me/astrapress/75274	2025-02-24T23:39:29-08:00

After returning from the war in Ukraine, -veterans- killed at least 240 people in Russian regionsOn the third anniversary of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, journalists from the publication -7x7- conducted an analysis of judicial statistics and establishedthat combatants returning from the front were involved in the murder of at least 240 people in various regions of the Russian Federation. The study covers sentences under five articles of the Criminal Code related to murder handed down between 2022 and 2025. However, given that some cases are still pending and detailed data is not available for a number of convictions, the actual number of victims may be higher.&nbsp;According to the study, Russian courts handed down 225 verdicts in cases of murders committed by former combatants in Ukraine. The geography of crimes covers 62 regions of the country. The largest number of victims was recorded in the Krasnodar Territory and the Kostroma Region - 14 people in each region. In the Rostov region, 12 people died at the hands of those returning from the war, in the Trans-Baikal Territory - 10, in the Krasnoyarsk Territory - 9. In the Volgograd and Perm regions, 8 victims were registered each.&nbsp;The victims of these crimes are not only relatives or acquaintances of former military personnel, but also random people: children, pensioners, passers-by. In some cases, the defendants are charged with additional charges related to rape and robbery. Courts often consider participation in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine as a mitigating circumstance, and awards and certificates received at the front as a positive characteristic of the defendant‚Äôs personality.	https://t.me/astrapress/75228	2025-02-24T09:36:17-08:00

Since the start of the war in Russia, the number of political persecutions has almost doubled - report Avtozak LiveFrom 2022 to 2024, the number of political persecutions in Russia almost doubled - from 1265 to 2373 cases. At the same time, the average time for consideration of politically motivated cases has also decreased significantly, the Avtozak Live team found out.According to their data, from February 24, 2022 to February 9, 2025, more than 5,400 politically motivated criminal cases were initiated under 146 articles of the criminal code against 5,254 people, at least 2,940 of whom are now in custody. In more than 1,900 cases, cases against the persecuted were initiated under two or more articles.&nbsp;The most charges - 16 - were brought against Andrei Pronsky, who is accused of preparing an attempt on the life of Vladimir Solovyov. The remaining nine defendants in this case are charged with 15 articles each.One of the most common articles for political persecution in Russia is Article 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Terrorist Act-). According to it, people are regularly imprisoned for arson of military registration and enlistment offices and other damage to military infrastructure. Also, this article often prosecutes victims of telephone scammers who convince people to participate in arson.The number of criminal cases against minors increased significantly with the start of the war. In 2024, 177 cases were opened, mainly on charges of preparing terrorist acts, sabotage and rehabilitation of Nazism. The youngest accused was a 14-year-old girl who fried sausages on the Eternal Flame in Ruza.Avtozak Live notes that with the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine repressions became more brutal and widespread.	https://t.me/astrapress/75226	2025-02-24T09:02:18-08:00
