The event became the most representative from the point of view of the leaders of countries who arrived in Russia after the start of the war in UkraineFormally, the BRICS summit opens in Kazan on October 22 and ends on October 24, but official events began today. According to Vladimir Putin's assistant Yuri Ushakov, 36 delegations from states and six from international organizations will attend the summit. Of the leaders of the group's member countries, only Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who had previously suffered a head injury, did not attend the summit. So, the leaders of the BRICS member countries, namely China, India, South Africa, as well as Egypt, Iran, the UAE and Ethiopia, which joined on January 1, 2024, came to the summit.&nbsp; Among those who arrived in Kazan was the deputy head of the Hamas Politburo Musa Abu Marzuk, the leader of Republika Srpska, which is part of Bosnia and Herzegovina Milorad Dodik, the heads of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Mongolia, Belarus, Congo, Laos, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and others states, as well as the President of NATO member Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. At the summit, a list of 13 candidate countries was agreed upon, but it was not disclosed. Also at the event, Putin was shown the proposed single currency of the BRICS member countries, although the head of the Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, did not value the banknote. The Economist wrote that one of the main objectives of this summit was the construction of a new global financial and payment system called BRICS Bridge, which is designed to -deal a blow to the US dominance in world finance- and -to protect Russia and its friends from&nbsp;sanctions-. The publication notes that this system will allow countries to conduct cross-border settlements using digital platforms managed by their central banks. Russia plans to build it within a year. At the same time, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov argued that cooperation within the BRICS framework -is not directed against anyone or anything‚Äîneither against the dollar, nor against other currencies.-	https://t.me/astrapress/67016	2024-10-23T12:31:11-07:00

You are prisoners, prisoners have a 2% survival rate.- And he decided to throw them into the pit. Three died there,- -former military prisoners on the run spoke about the punishments their colleagues were subjected to for failure to complete the task. Previously, ASTRA wrote about the military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gavethe order to move to a new point at night by mine fields. This time they told another incident from their service days. According to them, the deputy commander of the 109th regiment with the call sign -Caspian-, after one of the assaults, lined up 15 people who survived and returned from the mission. -Caspian- accused them of not completing their tasks, and the survival rate of prisoners supposedly should not exceed 2%. -We walked as many meters as they needed. Why he decided that they did not comply is unclear. And in the form of, so to speak, punishment, he decided to throw them into a pit. This is a cellar that closes. And he abandoned all the wounded. There was no food or water in this cellar. Well, maybe a bottle. Just so that they don‚Äôt just die of thirst and that‚Äôs it. Three wounded died immediately in the cellar. And the remaining twelve people, some wounded, some unharmed, he sent without weapons, without armor, without anything, to the assault immediately,- they said. According to them, no one survived after that assault. Among the dead, allegedly, were military men whom Trutnev and Ostrovsky knew personally: -Gram-, -French-, -Sanych-, -Karas- and -Ryzhiy-. As Trutnev and Ostrovsky clarified in a conversation with ASTRA, the name of the -Caspian Sea- is Umakhan. -In short, they kill their own people. If something went wrong there, it‚Äôs not like a commander.... People‚Äôs lives are not valued, in short,- the military added. Trutnev and Ostrovsky noted that if one of the relatives of the victims recognizes the call signs of their loved ones, they can contact them for information. -They are considered SOCH [those who left a part without permission - approx. ASTRA]. With us, until the body is pulled out, they are recorded in the SOC, not even in the -missing- category. They left in mid-July,- they added.Formerly military recorded a song about their commander -Prokop-: -At the cost of our lives you test your luck, drunk with the battalion commander you cut up the task. The boys die by shedding their blood. F*cked orders kill the boys. Fuck your own people more, just to be sure. Apparently, this is the whole task of the 109th Regiment-, as well as about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives: -I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and For fear of dying, I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there. A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar, because of a stupid order from a moron commander. > Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/67015	2024-10-23T11:40:24-07:00

We cannot pull off such an -economy-. &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; The truth is that you buy out 6 to 10% of the room. The rest is invitations for volunteers, military personnel, members of their families, etc. The size of the received PFKI grant of 8 million rubles cannot cover the costs of such a large-scale tour.-For the same reason, the concerts were later canceled in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.The cheapest tickets cost 800 rubles, and the most expensive - 3500.	https://t.me/astrapress/66967	2024-10-23T02:40:09-07:00

We now have a slightly different approach: the worse the family is socially, the better off the child will be, but for a person who gave his life for his homeland or became a disabled person of the first group, his child for some reason remains homeless. We need the child to understand: yes, the father accomplished a feat and died, but thanks to his feat I have an apartment, I live. This makes children patriotic.-Lvova-Belova called Kozhemyako‚Äôs words correct. -Unfortunately, when a father dies or becomes disabled, a mother has a difficult emotional state, so at this moment they really need support and what we do must necessarily extend to the families of participants in a special military operation -,&nbsp;- she said.	https://t.me/astrapress/66957	2024-10-22T23:30:27-07:00

Ukrainian partisan Grigory Sinchenko, who once escaped from the basements of the -DPR-, is being tortured in a Russian pre-trial detention center, his mother reported Grigory Sinchenko, a disabled person of the third group, a native of Donetsk, is subjected to systematic torture in pre-trial detention center No. 2 in Taganrog and are denied medical care. About this toldhis mother Tatyana Gulevskaya. -During the next court hearing on August 12, 2024, to which the lawyer connected via video link, Grigory looked beaten and exhausted. The defense lawyer saw Sinchenko with bruises on his face: there were fresh hematomas under Grigory‚Äôs eyes, abrasions on his chin and lips, his whole face was swollen. The lawyer only had time to ask Grigory a question about his condition, after which the video link was immediately turned off,- Gulevskaya said. Two days later, the lawyer arrived at the pre-trial detention center, but he was not allowed to see Sinchenko and was given a note in which the prisoner said that he allegedly did not want to see him. At the next meeting on August 26, Sinchenko sat silently with his head down and admitted his guilt for the first time. Sinchenko's mother and lawyer believe that the man was tortured in order to extract a confession. The defense attorney never managed to get to Grigory after that meeting. A few months earlier, in May, Sinchenko declared a hunger strike and opened his veins. Sinchenko is accused of -espionage-, -sabotage- and other crimes committed in the -DPR- in 2016-2019. After his arrest in Donetsk in 2016, according to his mother, he was tortured with electric shocks, hung from the ceiling by his hands and strangled. Later in the exchange he returned to Ukraine. In 2019, he was detained again in his native Donetsk - after he blew up a mobile station and posted a video on YouTube with the caption: -This was done to draw attention to inhuman torture in the basements of the MGB. The people of Donbass must go out to protest against torture or the fascist republic will remain without communication.-In 2020, Sinchenko managed to escape from the detention center, but the man was recaptured.	https://t.me/astrapress/66942	2024-10-22T10:50:10-07:00

Moscow conscripts were forced to sign a form with access to state secrets Moscow college student told -Conscript School- that he and about 20 other young people were invited to the Unified Recruitment Point (EPP) in Moscow to -clarify military registration data,- where they received a questionnaire in which they were asked to sign under the clause on access to state secrets and responsibility for their dissemination. Admission to state secrets means a ban on leaving the country for up to 5 years after its termination. An attempt to leave the country while having access to state secrets is also a crime.-The requirements of the Moscow Military Commissariat to fill out the item on access to state secrets are illegal. Neither the law nor the Regulations on conscription for military service require this of conscripts. Access to state secrets is issued when a person must work with classified information. But this should only happen with the consent of the citizen. The exception is conscripts. They may be allowed access to state secrets without consent, since the military unit itself may be secret. The conscripts do not touch any state secrets,- human rights activists note. -Getting access to state secrets means that the military registration and enlistment office will have one more reason to make threats.

The commanders are hiding from their relatives and inviting them to evacuate the wounded themselvesWives and mothers of military personnel assigned to Lugansk military unit 40463 turned to Putin and Bastrykin with a request to help them find their missing relatives and conduct an investigation regarding the part. They told ASTRA that military personnel are disappearing en masse before they even arrive there. Here are the stories of just a few missing men: ‚ÄîAnton Golubov. Transferred to the unit on April 29, last contacted on May 1. He has been listed as missing since May 11. ‚Äî Nikita Kim. On September 6 he went on a combat mission and went missing on September 7. ‚ÄîMobilized Dmitry Sagin. Instead of the hospital, they were sent for the assault on July 13th. Disappeared on July 14. ‚Äî World of Kokoev. On August 17 he arrived at the unit, on August 20 he last contacted his relatives. Officially listed as missing since September 3. ‚Äî Alexey Pushkarsky, father of many children. Left on a mission on September 10, disappeared without a trace on September 18. ‚Äî Danil Kiryukhin. Illegally transferred to this military unit on July 26. Since August 3 - missing. ‚Äî Dmitry Muravyov. Sent to military unit 40463 after 2 weeks of training - July 18. Since July 31, Dmitry‚Äôs status has been missing. The relatives of the missing are not given any information, and the majority of those who apply do not even have notices that their relatives are missing. At the same time, some women claim that their husbands and sons were sent to unit 40463 either illegally or as -punishment.- Thus, Mir Kokoev was transferred there as a -penalty officer- after he demanded leave, which he should have been given last year. Most women are told by nameless representatives of the unit, hiding under their Telegram nicknames, that their loved ones stopped communicating after the drone attack. A relative of Mir Kokoev, when asked how the man disappeared, was told that he might-stayed to drink tea in a nearby dugout,-and when asked to evacuate, they even answered that she could pull him out on her own fighter. -The wounded are also not evacuated - only if the soldier himself has reached the zero point... At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry still does not know that my brother is missing,-‚Äî says the sister of the missing Dmitry Muravyov. Evacuation is not carried out even in those settlements over which the Russian Defense Ministry reported control - for example, Berestovoe, where another serviceman,Maxim Startsev, disappeared. The ASTRA editorial office was also contacted by relatives of the missing: Konstantin Polichov, Ivan Romanchenko, Daut Arslanov, Konstantin Ponamarev, Ruslan Kochetkov, Vladislav Sukharevsky, Alexey Razuev, Andrey Chigarkin, Maxim Antonov, Vakil Yaunbaev , Vladimir Danilov, Alexander Khlebinskikh, Ivan Gromachenko.According to the wives, the commander of the 1st MSB is considered to be a military man with the call sign -Cap-. For assaults, after which military personnel disappear en masse - certain -Greedy- and -Zolotoy-. Relatives know the name of only the political officer of the unit - Vitaly Bugaev. Relatives of the soldiers of the same military unit who disappeared in 2022 are already wrote a petition addressed to Putin. In it they demandedto -conduct an investigation into the concealment of information by the command of the military unit about our loved ones and find out their fate.- The ASTRA editors do not know whether there was any reaction to the appeal of loved ones. ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

The letters indicate conditions of detention that were specially tightened for the politician - falsification of documents, censorship and a punishment cell for rolling up sleevesIn early August, the publication received from a source an archive of correspondence from employees of IK-6 (a maximum security colony in the village of Melekhovo Vladimir region, where Alexei Navalny spent most of his time), namely messages from the email of Ilya Kruglyshev, a lawyer who represented in the courts a maximum security penal colony in the village of Melekhovo. Letters about Navalny from his correspondence were sent out from May 2021 to February 2024. From today's publications it became clear: - In IK-6, documents were falsified to respond to Navalny‚Äôs claims about violations in the colony. For example, at the end of 2023, after Navalny disappeared, representatives of the Federal Penitentiary Service first explained his disappearance by power outages in the colony, then the lawyers were informed that the politician was no longer in IK-6. Three weeks later it turned out that he was transferred to a special regime colony in the village of Kharp in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, where he was subsequently killed. After this, the head of IK-6, Dmitry Nozhkin, reported on the reasons for Navalny‚Äôs transfer, saying that he was transferred to Kharp due to the entry into force of a new sentence. However, in the first version of the document signed by Nozhkin, something else was stated - the reason for Navalny‚Äôs stage was the instruction of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia No. 02-6477-dsp (-for official use-) received by IK-6. By excluding this instruction from the final version, the colony staff were able to hide it from the lawyers.- The colony staff closely monitored the lawyers and read all the letters that Navalny sent and received, especially after the posts appeared online on behalf of Navalny, information from which was not mentioned in the wiretapped conversations between the politician and his wife and mother. Then the workers of IK-6 concluded that Navalny was transmitting the text for publication to his associates through lawyers. In response, the employees sealed the transparent plexiglass covering the grille that separated lawyers and clients in the room where their meetings take place, and got rid of a special slot for the transfer of documents, which is why Navalny‚Äôs lawyers could not transfer to him the materials of new criminal cases cases brought against the politician while he was in prison. And the lawyers also could not show these papers.- Navalny recorded a noticeable increase in blood pressure - 140/90. Such readings could be a sign of arterial hypertension and a reason for starting drug therapy. Navalny was not prescribed medications to lower blood pressure in IK-6. According to the official version of Navalny‚Äôs death, it was the -critical increase in blood pressure- that became the -trigger- for the development of the -combined disease-, which allegedly led to the death of the politician in February 2024.&nbsp;- Navalny was held in a punishment cell more than 300 days in two years. On one occasion, he was sent there because he rolled up the sleeves of his robe, which was several sizes too small for him. Each time, before this punishment, prisoners must be examined by doctors - Navalny complained of pain in his back, stomach and hands, but he was still sent to the isolation ward. - April 17, 2023, two employees of IK-6 ;‚Äî Alexey Kukushkin and Vladimir Katalev beat Navalny because he -categorically refused to enter the cell- of the punishment cell. After the beating, as Meduza writes, Navalny was escorted to the cell where the convicted A.A. Tatarchenko, who was specially put in the same cell with Navalny, since Tatarchenko was homeless and did not take care of hygiene, which made it impossible to be in the same room with him.- In October 2023, Navalny told his lawyer Olga Mikhailova that -it seems like I‚Äôm being bullied here.- About the possible poisoning of Navalny in the colony also statedThe Insider journalists, who claimed that before Navalny‚Äôs death he was vomiting and complained of -sharp pain in the abdominal area.- However, this information disappeared from the official document about the causes of Navalny‚Äôs death.	https://t.me/astrapress/66845	2024-10-21T06:55:15-07:00

The rating of the most expensive Russian artists performing at state expense has gone viral on social networksHis compiled research project -Tenderscope- together with the RTVI editors, having analyzed public procurement with the names of specific artists. The most expensive artists were Yaroslav Dronov (Shaman), Grigory Leps and Oleg Gazmanov. For the performance of several songs at City Days and other regional holidays, the budget paid them from 5 to 16 million rubles.At the same time, the popularity of many of these artists is in doubt. For example, last month Shaman's commercial concerts canceled in several cities due to unsold tickets. Also the singer‚Äôs performance at a regional festival in the Stavropol Territory did not take place. The concert was canceled after a survey of the regional governor on social networks - the majority of subscribers opposed the holding of entertainment events, including Dronov's concert.Project team Tenderscope launched petitioncalling to reduce budget spending on artist fees and redirect the saved money to solve real social problems. The Orenburg fee, also Shaman, of 16.6 million rubles would be enough to pay 166 compensations to people who lost their homes as a result of the spring flood in the region.Leave a signature, forward this post to your friends and family or tell us about the petition on your social networks!	https://t.me/astrapress/66837	2024-10-21T04:45:06-07:00

A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar - because of a stupid order from a moron commander,- - former military prisoners on the run recorded a new track - this time about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives. Previously, ASTRA wrote about the military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gavethe order to move to a new point at night by mine fields. The new track of former prisoners is called -Truth-. In it, they reflect on the phrase from the film -Brother-2- -Strength is in truth-, and wonder why -in our time, telling the truth has become more expensive for oneself?-, and why -in our honest and great Russia, the security forces have the truth in strength? Also, Trutnev and Ostrovsky again mention their commander with the call sign -Prokop- and the entire 109th regiment, whom they -sent to hell.- -You trump the fact that I fucked up and left. You found a deserter and a coward in me. You and I will still laugh about this at the end, but right now, fuck it, let‚Äôs figure it out. I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and for fear of dying I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there. A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar because of a stupid order from a moron commander. And it was hard to get the guys out under the bullets, rather than sit and sort out the papers without signatures. I followed all the orders where everyone was dying, but when I told the truth, we, bitch, became cowards. You threatened my mom and what the hell is going on, but now it‚Äôs clear which of us is afraid of the truth. Yes, we left, but not because we pissed ourselves off, we just sent drunken Prokop to fuck off. And the 109th regiment, and all the lying scum, thanks to this we are now alive. And while I‚Äôm standing straight and looking at the clouds, I remember how I smiled, going around the barriers. I'm waiting for the FSB's doomsday. And I ask God for my mother‚Äôs health. For my mother, for my father, for my daughter, for my wife‚ÄîI will come and fuck you. And I will knock out the words on a pedestal for morons: -The weak cannot speak from a position of strength.- Formerly military recorded a song about their commander -Prokop-: -Younot only behind your back, where are you something in the basement. He hid his ass while we died. We open our eyes, seeing the sky from the trench. No food or water, thanks to Prokop. You send the hungry, cold people to slaughter in droves, reporting on their whereabouts via radio [walkie-talkie]. At the cost of our lives, you are testing your luck, drunk and the battalion commander are cutting down the task. The boys die by shedding their blood. F*cked orders kill the boys. Fuck more of your own people, just to be sure.

Kursk authorities refused to pay for new housing for residents of captured Sudzha due to the -outflow of the working population from the region-About this writes publication -7x7- with a link to a source close to the deputies of the Sudzhansky district.

Another aerial bomb was dropped by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the Belgorod Region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod Region, on October 17, a FAB was found near the village of Sergievka, Krasnoyaruzhsky District. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least 130 aerial bombs that accidentally landed on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.How previously told ASTRA, in order to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

At the cathedral in Cherkassy there was a fight between supporters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate As local media write, military chaplain Vladimir Pedko stated that St. Michael's Cathedral in Cherkassy is being transferred to the OCU and will now be a garrison one. Moreover, the transition took place without local priests. In the morning, believers and Metropolitan Theodosius of the UOC-MP came to the temple, who did not agree with this decision, and subsequently a fight broke out. It is noted that the SBU previously handed over 4 suspicions to Metropolitan Theodosius, including for inciting interreligious hatred and denying the armed aggression of the Russian Federation.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which reports to Moscow, reported that about 100 people in camouflage and balaclavas broke into to the territory of the cathedral and -illegally- drove the believers away. At some point, the believers of the UOC-MP and the metropolitan locked themselves in the church and did not let anyone in, writes the publication -Public-. Later, the OCU occupied thecathedral and held a service there for the first time in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian flag was also raised there, writes Radio Liberty. The police opened criminal proceedings on the fact of hooliganism in the cathedral. More than 20 people were injured. The transfer of the cathedral to the subordination of the OCU was supported by the mayor of Cherkasy Anatoly Bondarenko and the head of the OBA Igor Taburets. Metropolitan John of Cherkasy and Chigirin told in a commentary to Suspilny that the transition of the community to the OCU officially took place on June 12.On August 20, 2024, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law regulating the activities of religious organizations, which prohibits the activities of churches in the country associated with Russia. We are talking, in particular, about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC).After February 24, 2022, Ukrainian society and the media began to massively criticize the clergy of the UOC for supporting the theses of the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian special services have repeatedly conducted searches of clergy&nbsp;UOC&nbsp; on&nbsp;suspicion of disseminating&nbsp;Russian propaganda&nbsp;and the work&nbsp;of some of its representatives for the Russian intelligence services.Previously, religious studies examination of the Ukrainian State Service for Freedom of Conscience showed: The UOC is a structural division of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Russian Orthodox Church supports the Russian invasion of Ukraine, dismisses priests who refuse to read prayers for -victory.- Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/66516	2024-10-17T05:33:56-07:00

The author of the denunciation is a certain Konstantin Ivanov. The man did not like the postabout a soldier returning from the warwho became a victim of extortion by bandits and attempted suicide. According to the applicant, by covering the incident, the administrators of the TG channels allegedly formed -negative public opinion on the subject of SVO.- Ivanov was also indignant that they publish advertising in channels and at the same time, as he believes, do not pay taxes. In this regard, he demanded that they be prosecuted for carrying out advertising activities without registration.

Six Russian deserters were given French visasSix Russian military personnel were given temporary visas so they could apply for political asylum in France. This is the first time such a large group of deserters has been accepted into an EU country, writes The Guardian with reference to human rights organizations. According to the newspaper, the men arrived in Paris on separate flights over the past few months. Before that, they were in Kazakhstan, from where they fled the Russian Federation in 2022 and 2023. -France's decision is the result of extensive cooperation between the French authorities and a group of human rights organizations,- Ivan Chuvilyaev, a representative of the -Walk through the Forest- project, told the publication. -We hope this marks the beginning of more deserters being allowed into Europe.- He added that each of the soldiers was vetted for their -strong, consistent anti-war position- before they were allowed into France. Among those who received temporary visas were those who fought against Ukraine, as well as conscripts and officers who managed to avoid being sent to the front line.	https://t.me/astrapress/66464	2024-10-16T11:47:08-07:00

Access is limited by a -mask,- that is, to all domains and subdomains of the site at once,- they noted. Previously, Moscow authorities refused to the organizers of the -Return of Names- event, citing coronavirus. Before this it has become known that the Russian authorities have rewritten the official concept of memory of victims of political repression, removing the word -mass- from it.

In the Primorsky Territory, military personnel beat up a fish factory employee and stole his phoneAccording to ASTRA, on October 13, in the Khasansky district, at the mouth of the Poima River, unknown armed men in masks beat up 41 -year-old employee of the Ryazanovsky fish factory and stole his phone. He was filming them when one of them approached the man, hit him in the face, grabbed his phone and ran away. The stolen phone, according to geolocation, is now located on the territory of the fish factory. The Ryazanovsky fish factory, in turn, is located on the territory of the Russian Defense Ministry, where, according to sources, secret training exercises are taking place to prepare for the -SVO-. No one is allowed into the territory, so the security forces cannot question those involved in the beating of the victim. Presumably, the reason for beating the man was that he was launching a quadcopter, which allegedly interfered with military exercises.üí´ Subscribe to ASTRA.
