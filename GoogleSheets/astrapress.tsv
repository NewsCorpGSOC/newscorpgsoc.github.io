The security forces invited him to go back to war In the city of Spassk-Dalniy, Primorsky Territory, a former mercenary of the Wagner PMC is suspected of sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl. According to ASTRA, her friend complained about 41-year-old Anatoly. She accused him of rape. The girl met Anatoly last December at his entrance, and 3 days ago she decided to go to his house to visit a former participant in the war with Ukraine. The man has an Elizarov device installed on his leg after being injured back in 2023. He walks on crutches. According to ASTRA, that evening the man was drinking with the girl. He claims that she herself -jumped on him and started kissing him,- and he could not resist because he was drunk. The man states that before this he allegedly tried to take her home several times, but she refused to leave. -She came on her own, she started pestering her, I kick her out, but she doesn‚Äôt leave, she says that it‚Äôs boring at home, where are the parents looking?-he said in a conversation with ASTRA . The investigator has already suggested that Anatoly leave the court for the war with Ukraine. He agreed, but the military registration and enlistment office refused him, because the man still had an Elizarov apparatus installed on his leg. Previously, the former mercenary was already convicted of robbery and theft. üéÑ Help ASTRA raise money for journalists‚Äô salaries in January: https://t.me/astrapress/72312	https://t.me/astrapress/72899	2025-01-21T00:41:03-08:00

A Russian plane dropped an aerial bomb on an occupied village in the Zaporozhye region, ASTRA found outOn January 9, a Russian FAB fell near the village of Vishnevka in the Mikhailovsky district of Zaporozhye region areas. The air bomb did not explode; a crater formed at the site. There were no casualties. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year, about 6 FABs and one rocket for 2025.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using UMPC last spring. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July 2023, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian. November 19 last year a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region.

It is alleged that all those infected underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. The information was confirmed by the head of the regional Ministry of Health, Alexander Gashkov (on video).After the outbreak, experts from Moscow were brought in to conduct an epidemiological investigation. They found that the infection spread due to violations of sanitary standards - lack of antiseptics, improper handling of equipment and the use of multi-dose bottles of saline solution. In addition, the virus can be transmitted to patients due to the fact that staff did not clean their hands and used disposable instruments several times.There may be more people infected, since about 1,000 people had MRIs with contrast in the office. Now the work of the CT room has been suspended for a month. The Investigative Committee in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky opened a criminal case on the fact of criminal negligence of unidentified employees of the Kamchatka Regional Oncology Dispensary, which negligently resulted in the infliction of grievous harm to human health (Part 2 of Article 293 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).

In the Russian Federation, the first sentence was passed on an air defense officer who, instead of a drone, shot down a helicopter with three military personnel - KommersantIgor Pashkov, who served as a senior assistant at the operational duty command post of one of the units Air defense forces stationed in Russian-occupied Crimea became the first defendant in a criminal case under Part 3 of Article 293 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Negligence-), manifested during repelling the alleged attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, reports the newspaper.As established by the garrison military court of Sevastopol, October 18, 2023 in 6:30 in the morning, when Pashkov was on combat duty, he received a report about the detection of a low-flying, low-speed air target.The head of the combat crew gave his call sign, but the officer made a mistake in the number and reported to management that the unidentified target was located in a different location . As a result, a decision was made to destroy it. The check showed that -there are no aircraft of our own- in the indicated area, and two minutes after the first message, a helicopter was shot down by a missile from the TOR-M2DT anti-aircraft missile system. Later it turned out that the downed Mi-8MTV-5-1, which fell into the Black Sea, was Russian, and three members of its crew, captains, died.Military investigative bodies of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a criminal case for violation of combat rules duty, which led to grave consequences. Pashkov admitted his guilt in May 2024, admitting the mistake that led to the downing of a Russian Aerospace Forces helicopter. The investigation charged him with negligence for careless attitude to service, which led to false information about the aircraft.The Garrison Court found Pashkov guilty, but he took advantage of Article 51 of the Constitution and refused to testify. The court ordered him to pay 5 million rubles to the Ministry of Defense and compensate moral damages to the widows of the pilots in the amount of 1 million rubles each. In the appeal, the parties appealed the verdict, claiming insufficient severity of punishment and unlawful mitigation of circumstances.The Southern District Military Court, having reviewed the verdict, reduced Pashkov‚Äôs sentence to two years and ten months in a penal colony, taking into account his admission of guilt and repentance and other mitigating circumstances, such as having a dependent disabled son and positive characteristics.	https://t.me/astrapress/72507	2025-01-15T11:35:08-08:00
