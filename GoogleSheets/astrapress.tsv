Kursk authorities refused to pay for new housing for residents of captured Sudzha due to the -outflow of the working population from the region-About this writes publication -7x7- with a link to a source close to the deputies of the Sudzhansky district. It is alleged that deputies of the Representative Assembly of the Sudzhansky district turned to the prosecutor's office because of a statement by the acting Minister of Construction Alexander Afonin. He stated in an official letter that it was -inappropriate- to give certificates for new housing to residents of the Sudzhansky district. -Since the evacuation affected 8 districts of the Kursk region, and this is more than 150 thousand citizens, the provision of social support measures in accordance with the specified procedure can lead to a significant outflow of the working population from the territory of the Kursk region,- it is said in document signed by Afonin. He proposed postponing the resolution of this issue until the completion of the counter-terrorist operation, which is being carried out in the Kursk region after the invasion of the region by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on August 6. Deputies in a complaint to the prosecutor stated that Afonin’s words violate the constitutional rights of the sudzhan to freedom of movement, as well as choice of place of residence.	https://t.me/astrapress/66567	2024-10-18T00:31:01-07:00

Another aerial bomb was dropped by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the Belgorod Region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod Region, on October 17, a FAB was found near the village of Sergievka, Krasnoyaruzhsky District. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least 130 aerial bombs that accidentally landed on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.How previously told ASTRA, in order to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨 Subscribe to ASTRA.

At the cathedral in Cherkassy there was a fight between supporters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate As local media write, military chaplain Vladimir Pedko stated that St. Michael's Cathedral in Cherkassy is being transferred to the OCU and will now be a garrison one. Moreover, the transition took place without local priests. In the morning, believers and Metropolitan Theodosius of the UOC-MP came to the temple, who did not agree with this decision, and subsequently a fight broke out. It is noted that the SBU previously handed over 4 suspicions to Metropolitan Theodosius, including for inciting interreligious hatred and denying the armed aggression of the Russian Federation.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which reports to Moscow, reported that about 100 people in camouflage and balaclavas broke into to the territory of the cathedral and -illegally- drove the believers away. At some point, the believers of the UOC-MP and the metropolitan locked themselves in the church and did not let anyone in, writes the publication -Public-. Later, the OCU occupied thecathedral and held a service there for the first time in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian flag was also raised there, writes Radio Liberty. The police opened criminal proceedings on the fact of hooliganism in the cathedral. More than 20 people were injured. The transfer of the cathedral to the subordination of the OCU was supported by the mayor of Cherkasy Anatoly Bondarenko and the head of the OBA Igor Taburets. Metropolitan John of Cherkasy and Chigirin told in a commentary to Suspilny that the transition of the community to the OCU officially took place on June 12.On August 20, 2024, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law regulating the activities of religious organizations, which prohibits the activities of churches in the country associated with Russia. We are talking, in particular, about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC).After February 24, 2022, Ukrainian society and the media began to massively criticize the clergy of the UOC for supporting the theses of the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian special services have repeatedly conducted searches of clergy&nbsp;UOC&nbsp; on&nbsp;suspicion of disseminating&nbsp;Russian propaganda&nbsp;and the work&nbsp;of some of its representatives for the Russian intelligence services.Previously, religious studies examination of the Ukrainian State Service for Freedom of Conscience showed: The UOC is a structural division of the Russian Orthodox Church.

He was filming them when one of them approached the man, hit him in the face, grabbed his phone and ran away. The stolen phone, according to geolocation, is now located on the territory of the fish factory. The Ryazanovsky fish factory, in turn, is located on the territory of the Russian Defense Ministry, where, according to sources, secret training exercises are taking place to prepare for the -SVO-. No one is allowed into the territory, so the security forces cannot question those involved in the beating of the victim. Presumably, the reason for beating the man was that he was launching a quadcopter, which allegedly interfered with military exercises.💫 Subscribe to ASTRA.

Barriers appeared at least on sections of highways in the Bolshesoldatsky and Rylsky districts of the Kursk region. At the moment, two accidents are known.

About this reports -Novaya Gazeta-. Lisitsyna told the newspaper that she tried to protect her son from any military training at school. The woman planned that her son, instead of serving in the army, would go to alternative civilian service (ACS), and did not want her son to be -taught to pull the trigger.-On the eve of the training camp, in May 2024, Lisitsyna was summoned to the education department of the city of Berezovsky. -The representative of the commission said: -You know, it seems to us that you are a bad influence on your son. We will have conversations with him. We will question him in tests - psychological, socio-psychological... Do you understand how this will end?- I say: 'I don't understand.' He: ‘We can take the child away from you.’ I asked: ‘On what basis?’ He began to list some articles, but then the military commissar got involved,- the newspaper quotes Lisitsyna. The military commissar called the woman’s son a -draft dodger- and stated that the high school student -doesn’t want to defend the country- while -now bombs will fly on our heads.-According to the article about discrediting the army, a woman was fined because of her answer to the military commissar. Novaya Gazeta does not quote what was said verbatim because of the threat of being fined under the same article, but writes that the general meaning of the phrase was: -The country was not in any danger in February 2022.- However, as noted, in the protocol on discrediting Lisitsyna, completely different words were attributed that the woman did not utter. There are no audio recordings in the administrative file confirming her words. It is based on the testimony of the head of the city education department and the former former teacher of Lisitsyna’s son, who were present during the conversation with the military commissar. Later, representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and an FSB officer tried to take the woman to court. The latter told Lisitsyna that-Our fight for Vanya could end badly because we contacted human rights activists. I recommended not to communicate with them.- Ultimately, the woman did not go to trial and was fined in absentia. -It seems to me that school should be a place where teachers are your child’s protectors. It’s terrible to realize that this is not so,- said Lisitsyna, who herself previously worked as a teacher in schools and kindergartens.	https://t.me/astrapress/66399	2024-10-15T12:44:12-07:00

Roskomnadzor has made its register of blocking more closedNow it has become more difficult to find out about blocking of sites in Russia - RKN has changed the search mechanism for database of prohibited links on your website. Now, to find out about blocking, you need to enter the full address of the page, and not just its domain name. This makes using the registry much more difficult. The search mechanism for the database of blocked sites changed without warning this afternoon. Because of this, a number of media wrotethat Discord and Steam have disappeared from the registry - and, apparently , will be unlocked soon. Journalists simply could not find records about the blocking of Discord and Steam in the registry.Against this background, the RKN press service statedthat it sees no reason to unblock Discord. The department accompanied the message to journalists with an explanation: -Please note that &lt;…&gt; in the Unified Register of Prohibited Information of Roskomnadzor, it is necessary to enter into the search bar the link (address) of a specific page with a violation, and not the domain name of the entire service.- Roskomnadzor did not explain the reasons for changing the search mechanism in the registry of blocked sites. A representative of the public organization Roskomsvoboda, in a comment to ASTRA, said that in this way the department probably decided to make the register of blocked pages non-public. The organization reminded that it is still possible to monitor blockings the old way through their website even if prohibited links do not appear there immediately, but with a slight delay.The actions of Roskomnadzor fit into the general trend towards increasing the secrecy of information in Russia. So, since the beginning of the war, your data and statistics classified has already been classified by more than a dozen departments. And yesterday it became known that the websites of Moscow courts have stopped showing what exactly people are being arrested for. This complicates the work of journalists and human rights activists in finding those accused of political charges.	https://t.me/astrapress/66395	2024-10-15T11:00:08-07:00

FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the occupied village of Korsun, Donetsk region According to ASTRA, an unexploded FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the village of Korsun in the Yenakievo City Council. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 129th air bomb that fell as a result of an emergency landing on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before ASTRA reported that in order to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began equipping Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 129 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨Subscribe to ASTRA.

Dmitry and Vyacheslav suspect commanders of hacking their VK pages, while Dmitry’s mother believes that it is -someone not from our country.--We sat in the trenches, unwashed, unshaven, hungry, carrying out tasks. They walked under bullets, damn it, lay under mortars, didn’t eat, didn’t sleep, while they didn’t fulfill their tasks under the contract, didn’t pay a penny of money, and now they’re still trying to harm us, suck money out of our families.

The Associated Press also writes that in her -small and smelly- prison cell, Kolesnikova moaned and begged the guards for medical care - this was heard by prisoners who served time with her in IK-4 near Gomel. They told a journalist about this after leaving the colony. In November 2022, Kolesnikova was transferred to the intensive care unit for surgery to remove an ulcer—the AP does not specify whether Kolesnikova pleaded for medical help before or after that. Kolesnikova was a prominent figure in the Belarusian opposition amid the presidential elections and subsequent mass protests in 2020.

Later, Trutnev and Ostrovsky got in touch again, but in civilian clothes, and reported that they had left their positions because they -had run out of patience with their [Prokop and battalion commander Glyba’s] unlimited orders.- -Two of our comrades for refusing to carry out the task - to move forward through the minefield - the same -Prokop- bombarded them with -dumps-, the boys were hit by two hundred.

The last straw was that the company commander contacted us in an inadequate state, either he was drunk or something, and he and -Glyba- gave us the order to move on. But there was no point in this, because it is a one-way ticket. We laid down our arms, decided to retreat, and found a civilian.

ASTRA: The Russian Aerospace Forces again dropped an aerial bomb on the Belgorod region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod region, on October 10 in the Shebekinsky urban district, in FAB-500 was found several kilometers from the village of Neklyudovo. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 128th air bomb that fell on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem with the updated FABs was immediately revealed - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, during an emergency gathering, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨 Subscribe to ASTRA.

In recent years, China intensified its military presence around Taiwan - China does not recognize the independence of the 23 million island. It is noteworthy that the island blockade exercise began shortly after October 10, the founding day of the first Chinese Republic, which is celebrated as a national holiday in Taiwan. The first republic in China replaced the last imperial dynasty, and this regime ended with civil war and the rise to power of the communists. Taiwan was founded by opponents of the communists who fled to the island - and in many ways this democratic country considers itself the successor of the first Chinese Republic. Taiwan's sovereignty is recognized by only a dozen states. The United States is not among them, which provides Taiwan with military support and acts as a guarantor of the island's independence.	https://t.me/astrapress/66314	2024-10-13T22:45:53-07:00

They publicly expressed their anti-war point of view, which caused them problems at work. -I am a pacifist and generally do not accept any military conflicts, much less attacks on the fraternal people, because every Russian has close and distant relatives in Ukraine. After the war, we were in a very stressful state, and we decided to leave, because we can’t change anything in Russia,- Olga told ASTRA.According to her, Sweden was the only country where where they could most quickly obtain visas and enter legally. In June 2022, they crossed the border and applied for asylum. A few months later, immediately after mobilization began, they received a refusal. Olga and her husband filed an appeal, which was considered for another six months.-In fact, migration clerks do not have a document by which they should evaluate Russians who opposed the war. In fact, they rely on outdated documents, according to which there is no war,- Olga claims.Olga says that she and her husband still found a way to suspend the decision on their deportation, but after 11 months they anyway, an order was issued to leave the country.-On August 1, I was absolutely illegally put in a pre-trial detention center. I am an asylum seeker, all my documents are legal, but since then they have not released me. I lived in migration housing, came and renewed my asylum seeker card. I was where I was supposed to be. If they suspected that I would run away, they should have forced me to report to come. But they missed this point and simply arrested me, separating me from my five children,- Olga told ASTRA.A review of the decision to place her in a pre-trial detention center in early October did not yield anything. i>-I am in the leaked FSB database -Oppositionists- because I have a small journalistic job. I wrote articles about anti-war organizations that are banned in Russia. I took part in rallies and demonstrations, wrote a book, and ran a telegram channel in which I told how to get asylum. Provocateurs are writing to my husband from the FSB,- Olga shares.She says what she saw asylum seekers from Belarus were deportedagainst whom criminal proceedings were initiated. According to Olga, the son from this family was arrested immediately at the border, and his mother stopped communicating. -I am now simply afraid for my life, because the latest paper says that nothing threatens us, there is no war in Yekaterinburg, everything is fine, the FSB will not touch us. And my interview was published on YouTube, there were 1100 comments. 80 percent of them - come, we will crucify you,- says Olga.Olga has now created petition asking the Swedish authorities to prevent her deportation. Scandinavian countries have repeatedly denied political asylum to Russians. So, Russian Pavel Suetin left Severomorsk for Norway and requested asylum in the city of Vadsø, but in September 2024, the Norwegian migration department informed him that he was not entitled to asylum and must leave the Schengen zone within three weeks. Another Russian, Stanislav Brysin, was refused asylum in Sweden, despite the experience of holding protests and an open criminal case for -calls for terrorism.- ASTRA wrote that in search of refuge, Brysin boarded a boat and sailed towards Ireland. Before this Sweden has deported a family from Belarus, against whom a criminal case has been opened in their homeland. Not The situation with asylums in the USA is better.

Russia is deceiving young girls from Africa, Asia and Latin America to assemble Shaheds - Associated PressAbout 200 foreign women are assembling Iranian drones in the Alabuga special economic zone in Tatarstan. Girls aged 18–22 are attracted to Russia using the Alabuga Start online program: on the program’s website they are promised studies in Europe, a free plane and work in the service and catering sectors, but this turns out to be a hoax. As a result, girls face constant monitoring, broken wage promises, and dangerous work with caustic chemicals that damage their skin. -I regret and curse the day when I started doing this,- the publication quotes one of the women. Together with foreign women, 15-16-year-old Russian students of vocational schools work there, who also complain about working conditions. Analysts found that since July 29, about 95% of drones have not hit any visible targets in Ukraine. Instead, they fall into the rivers and fields of Ukraine, fly into Latvia and land on the territory of Russia or Belarus. Until July, about 14% of Shaheds hit targets in Ukraine. The publication writes that one of the reasons for the decline in the quality of drones may be unskilled labor. The special economic zone -Alabuga- was created in 2006 to attract business and investment to Tatarstan. After February 2022, it quickly grew and its parts switched to military production.	https://t.me/astrapress/66155	2024-10-10T11:37:03-07:00
