They are complaining about him from the frontIn the Belgorod region, the general director of the construction company Vek LLC, Alexander Spiridonov, has been refusing to pay a team of 18 workers 18 million rubles for almost two years. The last time, Spiridonov explained his refusal by saying that former builders had gone to war in Ukraine, which means -why do you need money if you die there?- ASTRA was told about this by Arzuman Manukyan, who, as he claims, was defrauded of 8,700,000 rubles by a foreman, a resident of Belgorod and a participant in the war in Ukraine from military unit 74507.-When we told him about our desire to participate in the -SVO- and asked to make payments for completed government orders, he replied: -Why do you need money, you‚Äôll die anyway.- These words pierce the heart. We fulfilled all government orders, worked honestly, and now we are left without a livelihood,- Manukyan said. Spiridonov's company -Vek- has an authorized capital of only 10,000 rubles and 7 employees: a janitor, a security guard, a security guard, a chief engineer, a foreman, a deputy general director - Spiridonov's wife Yulia, and Spiridonov himself (the list of employees is at the disposal of ASTRA). Despite this, judging by open sources, Spiridonov‚Äôs company receives dozens of government orders, including from the Ministry of Construction of the Belgorod Region, totaling approximately 1.2 billion rubles. For example: the construction of a house for orphans and a hostel in Valuiki, residential buildings in Alekseevka, a school in Krasny Khutor, the House of Culture in Prokhorovka, landscaping in Nelidovka and Bessonovka and others, ASTRA was convinced.Manukyan claims that he worked for Spiridonov from March 2022 to September 2023 at a rate of 200,000 rubles a month, processed, albeit without a contract. He recruited his familiar workers to fulfill the orders, but in the end, instead of the promised salaries, the builders received no more than 30,000 rubles a month. Spiridonov delayed full payments to workers, claiming that the regional administration owed him 450 million rubles for completed projects, so there was nothing to pay the builders with. Because of this, Manukyan, who called his acquaintances to work, had to sell his property for 1 million rubles - this is how he paid the workers himself. -We are appealing from 40 people, but not everyone can be present here, because some are in hospitals. [Spiridonov] gave us small advances for the work done, and promised the rest after the objects were delivered. The objects were handed over, but we didn‚Äôt receive the money,- deceived residents of the Belgorod region addressed Leonid Kapliy, a member of the Public Council at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, in a video from the front. Other workers appealed to the governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov. Manukyan turned to the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin. It is alleged that he reacted and a criminal case was opened under Article 145.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Non-payment of wages), but Spiridonov is a witness in the case, the criminal case itself was opened against an unspecified person. Manukyan says that Spiridonov has a -protection- in local branches of law enforcement agencies that are trying to delay the case, including investigator Kira Zhenikova. -From October 2022 to February 2023, the management of Vek LLC, knowing reliably about the presence of A.G. Manukyan, an employee of the said Company. wage arrears, in violation of Art. 37 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Articles 2, 21, 22, 136 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, due to other personal interests, wages were not partially paid to the specified employee for more than three months, while the available funds were directed to the economic needs of the enterprise,- said the decision of the deputy head of the investigative committee for Belgorod, Gulin. -It‚Äôs all deception and extortion,- Spiridonov responded to an ASTRA correspondent‚Äôs request to comment on the situation and hung up.

In Saratov, a photographer received 5 days of arrest for a photograph of NavalnyOn February 16, photographer Nurlan Sultanov (in the photo in a white jacket) attached an image of politician Alexei Navalny to the monument to Nikolai Vavilov in Saratov. The police saw this, asked the photographer to peel off the photograph and asked for his passport information, after which they released him. However, then the security forces tried to contact Sultanov, but he did not answer. Then the police persuaded an unknown girl to become a customer for a photo shoot with Sultanov. When the young man arrived at the place on March 14 - at a photo studio on Bolshaya Kazachyaya - instead of a female fashion model, he was met by two policemen. Then, during his arrest, he was beaten, says lawyer and deputy chairman of the Saratov branch of the Yabloko party, Kirill Rumyantsev. -According to my client, the police struck him in the solar plexus and the back of the head, spoke rudely to get him to admit guilt and give the necessary testimony (about participation in the activities of an extremist organization and support for its ideology). After the confession, the police officers promised Sultanov -to get off with just a fine,- -saidRumyantsev. Sultanov refused to admit guilt. In the two days that he spent in the cell before the trial, he was fed only once, Rumyantsev says. As a result, on March 16, the judge found Sultanov guilty under Part 1 of Art. 20.3. Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation (demonstration of extremist symbols) and imposed a sentence of administrative arrest for 5 days. Taking into account the two days already served, he will spend another 3 days in the detention center.‚òÆÔ∏è Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/76738	2025-03-16T13:23:25-07:00

His defense intends to appeal the verdict.Petrovsky was charged with five war crimes committed in 2014, when he fought on the side of the pro-Russian militants, being the deputy commander of the sabotage and assault reconnaissance group -Rusich-:üí´ Ambush on the Ukrainian military - Petrovsky‚Äôs unit lured Ukrainian soldiers using Ukrainian flag, after which they opened fire.

According to him, Moscow is putting forward conditions that could make reaching an agreement impossible.-Putin often does this - he doesn‚Äôt say -no- directly, but creates conditions under which normal decisions become impossible,- he noted. Previously, Putin said that Russia agrees with -proposals to stop hostilities,- but -the cessation must be one that would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the original causes of this crisis.- -We are for [a ceasefire for 30 days]. But there are nuances. What will we do with the wedge site in the Kursk region? If we stop hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who remained there will leave without a fight? Should we let them out of there? After they committed a lot of crimes against civilians? How will it be? It‚Äôs not clear,- Putin said. Zelensky said that Ukraine supported the American proposal for unconditional silence at the front and is ready for negotiations.-We do not set conditions that complicate anything. This is what Russia does. As we have always said, the only one who will delay the process, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia,- he said.
