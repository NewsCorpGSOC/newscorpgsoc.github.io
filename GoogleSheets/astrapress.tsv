For refusing to pay money to commanders, they are sent to deadly assaults, say relatives Relatives of missing soldiers from military unit 09332 recorded an appeal in which they spoke about -colossal losses of personnel- and the lack of evacuation of the wounded and dead from the battlefield. According to them, commanders send groups of two people into assaults, although groups of -six to eight- should be deployed for -cleansing operations.- There is no combat coordination in the unit; the military -do not know each other by sight or call sign.- -They are simply sent one way,- says one of the women in a video message.-I buried my husband on the 22nd. He never served me. He was sent on a combat mission as soon as he arrived there. And the next morning he died. That is, he didn’t even spend a day on the mission. Commanders are lying. The fighters are being bullied. Everyone is afraid, afraid to say something, afraid to complain, because they will send them to the assault to reset. What to do? Where to look for help? After signing the contract in Stavropol, my husband was in a group of 60 people. At the moment, of these 60 people there are practically none left. In such a short period of time to kill 60 people…-one of the fighters’ wives told ASTRA. -We demand, we write collective letters to the President, the Minister of Defense, asking for help so that this chaos stops, so that they stop throwing boys to slaughter. To help with equipment... We just returned from Ukraine a couple of days ago, ordered socks, shovels, and groceries. We ourselves sit down and go, because there is nothing there. Everything they have is bought with their own money,- she added. At the same time, according to another wife of a fighter, her mobilized husband was sent into the assault because he refused to pay money to the commanders. -My husband was in the artillery. A person who doesn’t just want to pay money—let’s say the management needs a car, or something else—they send them to death assault. My husband was mobilized and served quietly for a year and a half. They had to give him a report on the medal, and for this they set a price of 500 thousand rubles. He said he wouldn't pay. He was sent into the assault. He’s been lying there for 5 months now, there’s no way to pick him up,- she said. According to the women, among the leadership of the unit there are three commanders responsible for -lawlessness- and -extortions- - these are Konstantin Porosyuk, Viktor Vorobyov and S. Osaulenko. -They have a field bank -Luchi-, and, as far as I know, they transfer money to their cards from fighters whose relatives are not looking for them. The social payment - 158 thousand - was not given, citing the fact that it no longer exists. They open a card for a dead soul and throw money there. 3 million for injuries too. If you want a legal vacation, pay 320 thousand,- they say. -In general, the guys themselves reset themselves. Porosyuk killed 168 people in just 2 weeks. He says: -I don’t need 300, I need all 200.- When the guys arrive, in a state of shock, he sends them back. He asks them: -Well, couldn’t the heroes lie there and die in the fields?- This is the main thug there,- the interlocutors claim. ASTRA had photographs of Porosyuk, Vorobyov and Osaulenko at its disposal.Earlier today ASTRA wrote about how the military from the unit 09332, patients with hepatitis and cancer, are being forced to return to the war. This is not the first time such complaints have been received. In August, about being sent to the front in handcuffs told 25-year-old Alexander Belov, who is undergoing treatment. According to Belov, he was assigned to a medical unit with a crutch, where he was forced to dig dugouts on the line of combat contact.🌱 Subscribe to ASTRA.

A previously convicted war participant stole a smart speaker In Stary Oskol, a participant in the war with Ukraine is suspected of stealing a smart speaker. This happened at the end of August this year. An employee of the -DNS- equipment supermarket reported that an unknown person took the speaker away from the store in broad daylight. The damage amounted to a little more than 12 thousand rubles. According to ASTRA, the suspect is 36-year-old resident of Stary Oskol Alexander Shcherbinin. Apparently, the military man was on leave at the time of the theft. A criminal case has been initiated against him under Part 1 of Art. 158 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

ASTRA: Tucker Carlson said that he flew to Russia for an interview with Sergei Lavrov InterviewSergei Lavrov to journalist Tucker Carlson. The main theses of the Russian Foreign Minister:On the death of Alexei Navalny: -During his imprisonment, he continued to be ill. Therefore, we constantly asked Germany (where Navalny was treated after poisoning in Russia - Ed.) to show us the results of their research. Because our studies did not show what theirs showed (that he was poisoned - Ed.). So I don’t know what they (the Germans - Ed.) did with him.-On Russia’s conditions for a truce with Ukraine: -We are ready to negotiate on the basis of principles , which were agreed upon in Istanbul and rejected by (former British Prime Minister - Ed.) Johnson at the request of the head of the Ukrainian delegation Arakhamia. The key principle is Ukraine's non-aligned status. We were ready to join the group of countries that would provide guarantees of the collective security of Ukraine... No NATO. No military bases, military exercises on Ukrainian soil with the participation of foreign troops. This is what he (Putin - Ed.) repeated.-About sanctions: -Many in Russia would like this (for the lifting of sanctions to be one of the conditions for a truce - Editor's note). But the more we live under sanctions, the more we understand that it is better to rely on ourselves, to develop mechanisms and platforms for interaction with countries friendly to us, which do not interfere with economic interests and political ones. Obama began introducing sanctions, Trump continued, and under Biden they reached an unprecedented level. But everything that doesn't kill us makes us stronger, you know? They can't kill us, so they make us stronger.-On whether Russia can become part of the West again: -No, I don’t think so.-About Trump: -A very strong man. A person who wants results. A person who doesn't like to procrastinate. He is open to discussion. But this does not make him pro-Russian. When he was president, he imposed many, many, many sanctions against us. So we will wait for the inauguration.-	https://t.me/astrapress/69786	2024-12-05T21:00:05-08:00

Three aerial bombs dropped Russian planes in the Belgorod region in one dayAs ASTRA sources in the region’s emergency services told us, last week, on Friday, November 29, Russian airborne forces dropped immediately three FABs for the Belgorod region. One of them -went down unexpectedly- near a residential building in the village of Veselaya Lopan, Belgorod region, more than 30 km from the border with Ukraine. No injuries or damage were avoided. Another aerial bomb fell into a field 7 km from the village of Bessonovka. The third FAB of the day was found in the village of Dragunskoye. This time the ammunition fell in the area of ​​the substation, 3 kilometers from residential buildings. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 162 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. November 19 a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69779	2024-12-05T08:20:29-08:00

The influence of war veterans in Ukraine turned out to be -few-By data of the -Algorithm of Light- project, in 2022–2023 in the country 2,284 women became victims of domestic violence, of which 2,123 of them were killed by their partners, the rest by relatives. In total, 3,436 women were killed over two years. At the same time, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, which is cited by the -Algorithm of Light-, in 2023, compared to 2022, 2% fewer murders were registered (Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 6% fewer rapes (Article 131 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 4% fewer cases of causing serious harm to health (Article 111 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). During January-July 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs registered 15,600 violent crimes, which is 6% less than the same period last year. According to the state statistics portal, in 2023 the number of deaths from violent crimes decreased from 9,366 people in 2022 to 8,792 in 2023.In 65 criminal cases checked by the Light Algorithm, war participants appeared in Ukraine. In 11 of these convictions the victim was a woman, only 8 of these involved domestic violence - 7 by a partner and 1 by a relative. It is impossible to draw conclusions about how often women died at the hands of SVO participants in 2022-2023; their number turned out to be small for analysis, notes Algorithm of Light.However, it is believed that the courts may not provide information about the previous criminal record of ex-prisoners or their participation in the -SVO-. In the recent research journalists found cases where, after the publication of sentences for participants in the war in Ukraine, materials the courts edited them, removing data on state awards or completely erasing the published text of the verdict.	https://t.me/astrapress/69657	2024-12-03T06:30:52-08:00

But people are actually holding not a memorial action, but an action against the employees of the building on Lubyanka - the FSB, the KGB, the NKVD. They say: -We are here, we remember everything, and you are the same,- - he said in an interview with RBC. In his opinion, the memorial stone should -eventually be moved.- The Solovetsky Stone is the oldest memorial to victims of political repression in the country. It is a granite stone brought from the territory of the former Solovetsky camp and was installed in front of the KGB building in October 1990. Every year, on the day of remembrance of the victims of political repression, memorial events are held near it.The official also negatively assessed Last Address projectwhich hangs memorial plaques on houses victims of repression, and spoke in favor of removing the signs that had already been installed: -There is a memorial to Sakharov, there is a Day of Remembrance for Political Victims, Political Repression, there are corresponding paragraphs in the history textbook. But it’s so obsessive to poke people in the face every day, and here you are killing each other, this country has no future. As they say, some are guards, and others are sitters. This is not true.

Emergency power outages lasting up to 10 hours for 2-3 days occur regularly. They consider the culprit to be SZ Kvant LLC, which manages local power grids. This company -in some dubious way- became the owner of the networks, began connecting new consumers without complying with technical conditions and took huge amounts of money for it. As a result: networks are overloaded and not maintained, and modernization is not carried out. -The administration turns a blind eye to the problem. As a result, residents suffer from regular outages, and no one is in a hurry to help us,- local resident Ekaterina told ASTRA.They hope for a quick solution to the problem so that the winter months do not become a test for them. -Don’t let our families will freeze this winter.

As ASTRA found out, due to the -abnormal descent- of a FAB-250 from a Russian plane in the village of Kazatskoye, Yakovlevsky urban district, on November 26, residents of several streets were evacuated, in total - about 100 people. Sources in the region's emergency services told ASTRA that an aerial bomb fell near a residential building on Novaya Street. The bomb did not explode, so no one was injured. Now the FAB has already been confiscated, the residents have returned to their homes. Another aerial bomb was found on the same day a few kilometers from the village of Nikolskoye, Belgorod district. Another FAB was dropped on November 26 in the Bystry farm. In both cases there were no casualties or damage.Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 159 cases of FAB bombs fallingin Russia and in Russian-controlled territories Ukraine for 2024. November 19, as ASTRA reported, a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district. According to sources, the bomb penetrated the roof. There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.🫨 By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/69552	2024-11-30T23:19:21-08:00

Journalists found a Russian filtration camp for captured Ukrainians in Belarus - investigation by the Belarusian Investigative CenterAt the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military created a filtration camp on the territory of Belarus. Journalists found out that it was located on the basis of one of the buildings that belonged to a Belarusian state-owned enterprise -Pripyat Alliance- in Narovlya (Gomel region). Some human rights activists call this camp one of the most cruel against prisoners. Not only Ukrainian military personnel were taken there, but also civilians, including minors. For example, a resident of the Kyiv region Larisa Yagodinskaya said that in March 2022, her two sons were taken there, one of whom had not yet reached the age of eighteen at that time: -They said that the sons were saboteurs, and they took them and took them to Chernobyl. There it turned out that they were beating them, and as [the younger son] Slava later told them, [that the eldest son] most likely even broke his ribs, they beat him hard with a bat.- UAF serviceman Bogdan Lysenko, who was captured by the Russian military at the end of March 2022, also spoke about the torture of civilians: -Narovlya - it was such a propaganda picture that we [Russian military] are, like, humane... But none of them shows how civilians were interrogated there. And they beat civilians there, God forbid... That is, screams were constantly heard there.- According to human rights activists, now some of the Ukrainians who passed through the filtration camp in Narovlya are still in captivity, in particular, on the territory of penal colonies in Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/69426	2024-11-28T23:32:32-08:00
