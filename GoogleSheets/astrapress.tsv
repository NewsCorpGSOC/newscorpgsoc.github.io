According to him, Moscow is putting forward conditions that could make reaching an agreement impossible.-Putin often does this - he doesn’t say -no- directly, but creates conditions under which normal decisions become impossible,- he noted. Previously, Putin said that Russia agrees with -proposals to stop hostilities,- but -the cessation must be one that would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the original causes of this crisis.- -We are for [a ceasefire for 30 days]. But there are nuances. What will we do with the wedge site in the Kursk region? If we stop hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who remained there will leave without a fight? Should we let them out of there? After they committed a lot of crimes against civilians? How will it be? It’s not clear,- Putin said. Zelensky said that Ukraine supported the American proposal for unconditional silence at the front and is ready for negotiations.-We do not set conditions that complicate anything. This is what Russia does. As we have always said, the only one who will delay the process, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia,- he said.

According to the publication, the document was prepared in February, a week before the negotiations between Russia and the USA, held on February 18 in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.According to information received by journalists from European intelligence sources, the document proposals from the administration of US President Donald Trump to end the war in Ukraine within 100 days, as well as plans to send peacekeepers to the region, are rejected. Instead, it is argued that -a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis cannot occur until 2026.-The authors of the document insist on official recognition of Russian sovereignty over the occupied territories of Ukraine. In addition, it is proposed to create a buffer zone in the north-east of Ukraine, adjacent to the Bryansk and Belgorod regions of Russia, as well as a demilitarized zone in the south of Ukraine, which will also affect the Odessa region.The document also contains a demand for the -complete dismantling- of the current Ukrainian government, since the authors believe that -the current Kiev regime cannot be changed from within the country.- In addition, there is disagreement with maintaining the size of the Ukrainian army at the current level and with the continued supply of American weapons to Ukraine after a possible peace agreement.The document emphasizes the need to normalize relations between Washington and Moscow by restoring the full diplomatic staff of embassies. It is proposed to appoint Alexander Darchiev as Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the United States, which, according to the authors, should help improve bilateral relations.As for the sanctions imposed against Russia, the authors of the document believe that their significance is -clearly exaggerated- and reject attempts to involve Russia in a peace agreement through partial lifting of sanctions. They argue that -it is unclear what Russia would benefit from- such an approach.Russian Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Washington Post that the Kremlin was -not aware of such recommendations- and called them -extremely contradictory.- -We&nbsp;are working with&nbsp;more thoughtful options,-&nbsp;said Peskov.At the same time, as the publication notes, some of the proposals presented in the document have already been put forward by the Russian authorities. In particular, Russia offered the US access to its mineral resources, including in the occupied territories of Ukraine, and also advocated for the restoration of the staff of diplomats in the embassies of the two countries. Both of these proposals were in&nbsp;the document.	https://t.me/astrapress/76432	2025-03-13T02:05:41-07:00

Former President of the Philippines was detained on an ICC warrantFormer President of the Philippines, 79-year-old Rodrigo Duterte, was detained at Manila International Airport on a warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The arrest is related to charges of crimes against humanity committed during his anti-drug campaign, reports the Associated Press. According to human rights activists, more than 12 thousand people were killed in anti-drug operations during Duterte's presidency from 2016 to 2022.&nbsp;In 2019, Duterte removed the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the Rome Statute, under which the ICC operates, so Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Panelo, called the arrest illegal. However, the court stated that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed up to that point - from November 1, 2011 to March 16, 2019 inclusive.&nbsp;The detainee's daughter, Sara Duterte, is the vice president of the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte as president in 2022, has stated his readiness to cooperate with the ICC on issues related to the arrest.&nbsp;It is currently unknown where Duterte is being held after his arrest and when he will be brought to Europe to be transferred to the ICC.	https://t.me/astrapress/76281	2025-03-11T01:45:44-07:00

The court in Yaroslavl acquitted the trash streamer in the case of threatening Ekaterina MizulinaThe case against Aslan Durdiev began after the head of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, received a message from her subscribers in 2024 that the blogger had beaten two acquaintances during an online broadcast, as well as other incidents of violence related to his streams. The next day, Durdiev began to threaten Ekaterina Mizulina, which led to his arrest. Today the Kirovsky District Court of Yaroslavl found Durdiev not guilty. The court noted that his actions did not constitute a crime. The prosecution asked for four and a half years in prison.However, on the second charge - causing minor harm to the health of a 28-year-old resident of Yaroslavl - Durdiev was found guilty and sentenced to five months of correctional labor. But due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the punishment was canceled and he was released.Previously, Durdiev's lawyer reported that his client’s wife, at the streamer’s initiative, transferred 10 thousand rubles in compensation to Mizulina and paid a fine in the same amount. However, Mizulina herself wrote in her Telegram channel that she does not know about the transfer of money from Durdiev. -Moreover, I will not accept any donations from the lower Internet. This is absurd,- she said.	https://t.me/astrapress/76163	2025-03-10T05:08:44-07:00

This decision caused mass protests by Georgescu's supporters, who accused the authorities of undermining democracy.&nbsp;In February 2025, a criminal case was opened against Georgescu on charges of creating a fascist organization, disseminating false information and undermining the constitutional order. On February 26, he was detained by police on his way to submit documents to register for the repeat elections. Despite this, on March 7, Georgescu filed his candidacy for the upcoming elections, collecting more than 324,000 signatures in his support.&nbsp;The Constitutional Court decision on March 8 clears the way for Georgescu to participate in the elections on May 4, if his candidacy is approved by the Central Electoral Bureau. However, his participation remains in doubt due to the ongoing criminal investigation and preventive measures imposed against him, including a ban on leaving the country and publishing xenophobic content on the Internet.&nbsp;The political crisis in Romania intensified after the resignation of President Klaus Iohannis on February 10, 2025. Iohannis resigned to avoid impeachment proceedings initiated by the opposition after the election results were annulled. Senate President Ilie Bolojan was appointed acting president.	https://t.me/astrapress/76116	2025-03-09T05:48:00-07:00

At the landfill there were black special bags for bodies, already opened zinc coffins, covered on the outside with burgundy-red velvet, as well as transport wooden containers, which are used in such cases to transport bodies. All this belongs to waste of a special hazard class and is subject to mandatory disposal in a specialized organization—in this case, a regional waste operator. Employees from the control department of the local administration went to the site to check, and the police were called. Now the owner of the funeral agency that purchased the coffins is being sought.☮️ Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/75986	2025-03-06T12:05:42-08:00

Candidates will be nominated from United Russia - both on lists and in single-mandate constituencies. Vladimir Putin previously emphasized that the military should become the -real elite- of Russia. To prepare military personnel for civil service, the -Time of Heroes- program was created. Some veterans have already received government positions: for example, the commander of the Sparta battalion Artem Zhoga became the presidential plenipotentiary envoy in the Ural Federal District.According to source -electing- war participants as State Duma deputies is the easiest way to report on their recruitment to power: -[Appoint them] not to the executive branch, where the money is, not to the financial and industrial groups [financial and industrial groups], where the real masters of Russia, but to the powerless representative government.-Among the problematic issues is the controllability of such deputies.

Social activists believe that this is not a natural phenomenon, but a discharge of technical water from Norilsk Nickel factories and mines. They contacted Rosprirodnadzor and the prosecutor's office, stating that at this temperature the water should have frozen, but this does not happen, which may indicate its man-made origin.-The continuous spill of water creates a dangerous situation on the road, the man-made nature of the water can lead to harm to the life and health of citizens, and harm the environment,- says a letter from the public organization -My Home- in Norilsk,- transmits -Siberian Express-.
