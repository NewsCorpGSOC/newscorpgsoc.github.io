They dug trenches and dugouts on the front line,- a convict convicted of the high-profile murder of a schoolgirl returned to Chelyabinsk from the war17-year-old Lena Patrusheva disappeared on Friday, November 7, 2014, during school holidays. That day the girl was going to go to a nightclub with her friends.The court found her boyfriend, 19-year-old Kirill Plankov, guilty of murder. He himself confessed everything to the police after security forces found traces of the victim‚Äôs blood on his clothes. However, Plankov hid the murder and his involvement in it until the last moment. This is what he wrote on his VK page the day before giving his confession:-Today is your date, 5 months. On June 15, we started dating. We have experienced a lot, many problems, problems, quarrels. And we always came to something. There are, of course, more good moments. I love you very much and believe that you are reading this. Please come home, I‚Äôm really waiting for you.- Plankov killed Patrusheva together with his half-brother, the same age as Maxim Valishin. Plankov suspected the girl of cheating - and according to the girlfriends of the murdered woman, he was a hyper-controlling boyfriend and this infuriated the girl. She wanted to break up with him, but was afraid. On the day of the murder, the brothers went to the forest park for reconnaissance and chose a place suitable for the murder. They turned off their mobile phones and took the girl into the forest. They knocked him down and beat him‚ÄîPlankov beat him while his brother held him. He strangled and kicked me in the head. Patrusheva‚Äôs brothers broke her iPhone and threw it away from the scene of the murder, so that the body of the murdered woman, hidden in the snow, would be more difficult to find. And after the murder, the guys arranged a discharge with alcohol and girls they knew. Plankov and his brother Valishin received 33.5 years in prison between them. Valishin continues to sit, but Plankov has already returned to Chelyabinsk, writes the local publication 74.ru. In the colony, he signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense. -As I understand it, they were not given weapons. They dug trenches and dugouts on the front line. One looks after the -birds-, the rest dig. No one was killed who was with them. Nowadays it‚Äôs not often, but we meet. I know that he lives in the city, works, rents an apartment with a woman,- 74.ru Plankov's father.

üé¨üñº Two police officers used threats to force a native of Crimea...	Two police officers used threats to force a native of Crimea to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense and fictitiously married him in order to receive money for his death. He escaped from the war 35-year-old Sergei Zhukov is now hiding in an attic in one of the villages, he told ASTRA. -They didn‚Äôt teach me anything. I don't want to fight. I put down my weapon and just ran away,- he said. Zhukov was born in the city of Old Crimea. According to him, he has no relatives, he is an orphan. The man admitted that he had been convicted of burglary and theft in the past. He served his sentence in IK-24 in the Vladimir region and was released in February 2024. After his release, Zhukov decided to stay in the region, settling in the city of Mikhailovka, where he got a job as a laborer at a construction site. ASTRA confirmed Zhukov‚Äôs biography based on leaked databases. Zhukov signed the contract in June of this year. He claims that on June 2-3 he was drinking beer on a bench when two police officers approached him and detained him. The department began to put pressure on Sergei to sign a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry. Otherwise, the operatives threatened to -find drugs on him- and close him down for 10-15 years. -You‚Äôre an orphan, you have no one. We will bury you, and the rest of the money will go to our needs... Naturally, I refused. They started hitting me in the ribs and back,- he told ASTRA. He only remembers that one of the policemen‚Äôs name is Sergei, he is about 40 years old. The next day, operatives brought Zhukov to the registry office, where a fictitious wife was waiting for him, who was supposed to receive money for his death. In the passport that Zhukov sent to the editor, there is indeed a stamp indicating marriage on June 4, 2024. His wife is 53-year-old Elena Podkolzina. ASTRA got through to Podkolzina. She stated that she last contacted her -husband- supposedly 2 months ago, and now he, according to eyewitnesses, is allegedly missing. When asked about how long they were together before getting married, Elena did not immediately answer. After thinking, she said: -For a long time.- During the conversation, the woman ate, laughed and asked why she was being asked these questions. When asked what she plans to do next, Podkolzina said: -Wait. Maybe it will appear, maybe not.- At the same time, the woman confirmed that Zhukov signed the contract under pressure. According to her, he -got into a fight,- and then the security forces offered him to sign a contract with the Russian Armed Forces. The money for working in the RF Armed Forces was stolen from Zhukov right away. -When I signed the contract, I received a payment, the governor‚Äôs or some kind, I don‚Äôt know... Three hundred thousand. From them I saw only about 20 thousand, maybe that‚Äôs all, no more. And they simply took everything else for themselves,- says the man. After escaping, Zhukov stopped in a certain village, he doesn‚Äôt know which one, and is now hiding in the attic. -I say it again, I don‚Äôt want to fight. And I can‚Äôt even do it. It's just going to certain death. Do you understand? So much time, damn it. Hungry, cold. They don't even feed. And they send them to positions. There is no food, nothing at all. It‚Äôs good that it rained, at least I drank some rainwater... Here.

They called me a black man, a gypsy, a suicide bomber. Perhaps they beat me, but he didn‚Äôt tell me about it, but he told his friends from the Arab diaspora about it. When he was injured in service, the command decided to hide this fact, since the circumstances under which the injury occurred were an attack by a drunken colleague armed with a knife in the back of a truck. Dodging the blow, he fell off the side and hit his head. When he was brought to his senses, he realized that his arm was broken. In the hospital, after assistance was provided, a refusal of hospitalization was issued and he was taken to the first line. Only after 2.5 months I was able to get him sent for osteosynthesis surgery,- Svetlana Salem says in the video.According to her, her husband does not speak Russian at all. He signed the contract without a translator. Salem decided not to return to the unit from leave for surgery. After that, Svetlana says in the video,-Representatives of the unit set up surveillance on me and conducted an illegal search in the apartment. After Salem was discovered, he was taken away as a criminal, handcuffed at gunpoint. Then he was sent to the assault.- The story of Salem in a conversation with ASTRA was confirmed by the imam from the Lugansk Cathedral Mosque Walid and the mufti of the -LPR- Muhammad Ismail. At Salem's service -They constantly called me names. They called me -black-assed,- they said, -get out of here, your place is next to the bucket,- young imam Walid told ASTRA. He is originally from Yemen - and he himself also served in the -People‚Äôs Militia- after Medical University. One day, the command of Salem called Walid to the unit to help with translation into Arabic - so he is aware of his situation. -The commander said that Salem disobeyed him. I answered him: ‚ÄòHow can he disobey you if he doesn‚Äôt understand you!‚Äô- Walid told ASTRA. According to him, Salem was encouraged to sign the contract by another serving in the army, a member of the Muslim community of Lugansk (his name is known to ASTRA; he did not answer the call). The imam assumes that he did this to get a vacation: -If they signed up through you, then they give you a vacation. It was beneficial for him to invite Salem.- Mufti of the -LPR- Muhammad Ismail told ASTRA that he addressed the command of Salem: -They didn‚Äôt let him go, he was in a difficult situation, wounded, I remember that such a situation happened.- However, the command of the unit refused to release the Egyptian even after talking with the mufti. Apparently, Salem was helped by a video message from his wife. In the second video, which appeared online a week ago, Svetlana Salem says that her husband has been found - he was returned from his positions and will soon testify to the command as part of the investigation. Previously ASTRA published appeals from loved ones of other military personnel from the 123rd Brigade. Their men -like ghosts- disappeared just a few days after arriving at the location of this connection. üå± Subscribe to ASTRA.

Roskomnadzor -recommended- site owners to abandon Cloudflare encryption, which can be used to counter censorshipYesterday the agency began blocking sites with such encryptionAmerican company Cloudflare is one of the world's largest providers of protection against DDoS attacks. In October, Cloudflare enabled a new encryption method, Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), for all sites using their servers. Roskomnadzor did not like this - after all, ECH can be used to bypass blocking. Since yesterday, the department has been blocking all sites using ECH. And today Roskomnadzor issued a special memo in which it -recommended- website owners to abandon the unified social tax and generally switch from Cloudflare to domestic solutions for protection against DDoS attacks. Essentially, ECH allows you to hide the site that the user is visiting from the Internet provider. -An IP address can be hidden among billions of requests to a CDN. It's like hiding a tree in the forest - you never know where the user was going. Maybe to the blocked VPN Generator site, or maybe to the Gazprom sites, which are also behind Cloudflare,- - IT expert Mikhail Klimarev explained in his tg channel. According to Roskomnadzor, this technology -violates Russian legislation.- However, how actively ECH was used to bypass blocking in Russia is unknown. Two weeks earlier, the publication Meduza and Sota reported that thanks to ECH from Cloudflare, their sites are again available on the RuNet.An anonymous expert from the public organization Roskomsvoboda told ASTRA that after yesterday ECH blocking in RuNet-A lot of things became inaccessible, but then gradually everyone began to change the settings in CloudFlare.- According to the expert, ECH allows you to encrypt the Server Name Indication field, which is used by some blocking mechanisms used by Roskomnadzor. -It has long been a specification that all browsers can start encrypting this [Server Name Indication] field. The introduction of this technology is gradually taking place, but many states are against it - not only Russia - the first to block it, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, was China. The UK was very strongly opposed (this prevents them from blocking objectionable content on the issue of piracy, drugs, terrorism and extremism). In general, all governments are trying to fight this technological innovation. The simplest way is to block all traffic that encrypts this field in the packet. I think that in Russia everyone will slowly abandon this story, as they did in China,- a representative of Roskomsvoboda told ASTRA.	https://t.me/astrapress/67986	2024-11-07T07:02:13-08:00

Meanwhile, the Russian Federation is already accused of interfering in the electoral processHow confirms ABC News with link to FBI documents, the agency arrested a certain Isaac Sissel in Michigan, who allegedly published threats on the Internet that he would carry out a mass shooting of conservative Christians if Donald Trump won the election. A man was arrested in Canton 2 days after threats of a mass shooting were published. The criminal case states that his messages about the terrorist attack were reported to the FBI by the administration of the Reddit portal. The reason was various accounts with threatening usernames, including -ShootUpTrulyRally-, -WillShootTrumpSoon-, -PlannigToShootTrump- and -PlanningToKillTrump-. Sissel told agents during questioning that Trump -was a threat...that he should have been killed and that everything would be better if Trump were dead,- his affidavit states.&nbsp; The man is also said to be a migrant who had recently lived on the University of Michigan campus and was the subject of multiple arrest warrants on charges of stalking, harassment and offensive communications. ABC also reported that anonymous bomb threats had been reported at several polling stations, including in the swing state of Georgia. The FBI said that most of these threats come from -Russian mailing addresses.--At this time, none of the threats have been determined to be credible,- reported to the FBI. Right now, the US is holding presidential elections, in which the main confrontation is between former President Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Vice President Kamala Harris from the Democratic wing. Polls show that neither candidate has a clear advantage, so the election will be decided in so-called swing states that do not have a traditional allegiance to one of the two major parties.	https://t.me/astrapress/67827	2024-11-05T11:54:27-08:00

Due to sanctions, Russian exporters began to use barter, writes the Financial TimesSo, in October of this year, the Russian agricultural trader Astarta Agrotrading&nbsp;concluded&nbsp;concluded a barter deal with two companies from Pakistan. In exchange for 15 thousand tons of chickpeas and 10 thousand tons of lentils, the company from Saratov will receive a similar volume of tangerines and potatoes. This, writes the British newspaper Financial Times, part of a trend among Russian exporters. Under the terms of another deal, which the newspaper writes about, Russia swapped flax seeds for household appliances and building materials from China.Financial Times notes that the USSR conducted international trade in a similar way. So, in the 1980s, the USSR exchanged Stolichnaya vodka for Pepsi from the USA - and sold warships for scrap metal. The publication associates the transition to barter with sanctions. As you know, by 2024, sanctions began to hit even Chinese suppliers,who now have to hide supplies to Russia through third countries.	https://t.me/astrapress/67803	2024-11-05T04:06:57-08:00

The document is dated April 15, 2022 and in it Russia‚Äôs position softened.According to it, it was determined that Ukraine would have a security mechanism similar to Article 5 of NATO, for which, as expected, the guarantor countries: Great Britain, China , the Russian Federation, the USA, France, Russia, Belarus, Turkey would undertake to defend Ukraine with military forces in the event of an attack.However, this point could not be agreed upon, since the wording proposed by Ukraine meant that the signatories of the agreement would be able to Ukraine as collectively and individually. Russia insisted on only collective intervention. That is, Russia itself, as a signatory to the treaty, could, in theory, veto the decision to protect Ukraine from its own attack.The clause on territorial integrity was also changed. How writes -Currently-, Ukraine, according to the April agreement, remains within its recognized borders, including Crimea, Sevastopol and some unspecified territories that are not covered by security guarantees. The communiqu√© adopted in Istanbul at the end of March indicated that the status of Crimea and Sevastopol would be resolved diplomatically.However, the document published on April 15, 2022 stated that annexed Crimea would remain under Russian control without a formal renunciation of sovereignty above it from the Ukrainian side. The future of parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions that were under Russian control until February 24, 2022, was to be determined during negotiations between the presidents of the two countries. The document did not mention the status of other territories occupied by Russia According to the WSJ, negotiations continued until June 2022 and stopped at the initiative of Ukraine. Moscow previously claimed that the negotiations ended in April.	https://t.me/astrapress/67762	2024-11-04T12:01:27-08:00

The reason for initiating the case was the transfer of about seven thousand rubles to an account published by blogger Arkady Babchenko. Popova made it on February 27, 2022, reports -First department-. Popova‚Äôs cousin Tatyana believes that she was identified in the -Rozysk-Magistral- while purchasing sea tickets, since passport information is needed to purchase tickets. After searches in her own and her parents‚Äô apartments, Popova was sentenced to 10 days of administrative arrest under the article on -hooliganism.- She was accused of hooligan behavior three times and spent a total of 35 days in jail. After the third arrest, Popova was charged with treason. Tatyana calls the accusation of treason nonsense: -She made a huge number of transfers to various charitable foundations - to help women, children, animals. Hundreds of thousands in donations. In this case, the state simply took advantage of her naivety, because probably in the first days [of the war] many people transferred money to various bloggers and organizations. As a result, for seven thousand rubles - 12 years and a fine of 500 thousand.
