In Ukraine, since the beginning of the year, 266 military and volunteer vehicles have been burnedAs a representative of the Prosecutor General’s office, Nadezhda Maksimets, said, Russian special services are behind the arson. According to her, 169 people have been charged with arson, most of them under 35 years old. They set fire to military vehicles for -easy money.- According to Maksimets, on average they promise from 700 to 3 thousand dollars for arson. According to the prosecutor's office, this money is not paid later.An earlier edition of -Important Stories- discovered that unknown persons are looking for perpetrators of arson attacks on Ukrainian military vehicles, including through the Russian-language drug forum RuTor. For similar acts of sabotage in Europe, Russian special services are looking for perpetrators, including through telegram chats for drug sales.Russian state media associate the arson of Ukrainian military vehicles with -ongoing forced mobilization.- In advertisements for the search for arson perpetrators, which ASTRA reviewed, the motive of supposedly fighting mobilization also often appears. At the same time, during the year in Ukraine, cars were set on fire not only by military registration and enlistment offices, but also directly by the military, and, as Maksimets reported today, by volunteers. The video shows the arson of a TCC car, allegedly. The video was taken from a channel offering to commit arson for money.	https://t.me/astrapress/64852	2024-09-21T08:35:28-07:00

It is unknown who filmed it. Nikolai believes that they were FSB officers. At the same time, the man claims, recordings from neighboring CCTV cameras never appeared in the case. Tsomartova studied at the Rostov Law Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. She wanted to become a police officer, like her father. Nikolai said that after graduating from university, his daughter wanted to go to Siberia -or to new territories- to work in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

ASTRA: Through a vulnerability in the new electronic subpoenas website, you can obtain the personal data of any Russian, claims Novaya Gazeta EuropeOn the website reestrpovestok.rf a huge vulnerability has been discovered that allows you to obtain through this site the data of anyone registered on the State Services -Russian. Including women. To access the data, you need to know the unique user ID on Gosuslugi and make the appropriate request to the subpoena registry server. In response, the site will provide the full name, date of birth, passport numbers, SNILS, INN and other personal data of the Russian. About the vulnerability of the summons registry last night toldthe Novaya Gazeta Europe publication with reference to an anonymous IT expert. At night, the Ministry of Digital Development and Rostelecom announced the absence of vulnerabilities on the site.The website of the Unified Register of Summons went live yesterday in three regions of Russia - Mari El, Sakhalin and Ryazan regions. While the site is operating in test mode, it should be fully operational from November 1.Reestrpovestok.rf intrusively invites users to install a domestic SSL security certificate from the Ministry of Digital Development. Such certificates encrypt the connection to sites (from the user’s side it looks like this: -http- in the link is replaced by -https- - where -s- means -secure- or secure connection). Most traffic on the Internet is encrypted using https - this is how Russian providers store it at the request of the FSB. Whether Russian intelligence services can effectively decrypt such traffic is not known for certain. The Summons Registry claims that it is possible to -ensure a secure connection- with it only with the help of a domestic certificate - but this is outright manipulation. The site is already protected by an international certificate from the Belgian company GlobalSign. The security certificate of the Ministry of Digital Development allegedly has a backdoor that will allow Russian intelligence services to decrypt traffic. Not only from the electronic subpoenas website, but also from other resources. About this said an anonymous expert from the Roskomsvoboda organization in a conversation with the publication -Verstka-. -If a Ministry of Digital Development certificate is added to mobile operating systems, it is possible to -listen- to the traffic of not only browsers, but also those instant messengers that did not bother to protect against this,- said the IT expert.	https://t.me/astrapress/64628	2024-09-18T22:28:25-07:00

It is noted that before the explosion, the pagers made a beeping sound, which prompted many to bring the devices to their faces. Israeli intelligence services are probably behind the attack, having mined about 5 thousand pagers, Reuters reports. About 3 thousand of them exploded. A senior source in Lebanon told the agency that the devices were booby-trapped by the Israeli spy service -at the production level.-The Mossad inserted a circuit board containing explosive material into the device, which receives a code. It is very difficult to detect by any means. Even with the help of any device or scanner,- said the interlocutor.The day before, 4,000 people were injured in Lebanon, 11 of them died as a result of pager explosions. Reuters writesthat hundreds of members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, including fighters and medics, were seriously injured due to the explosions of pagers that they use for secret communication.	https://t.me/astrapress/64588	2024-09-18T04:55:25-07:00

Without their approval, he could not take such a serious step, for fear of angering the spirits. And he allegedly returned from Mongolia happy. However, this version sounds like a big fantasy. None of my sources can confirm it. However, the meeting with Mongolian shamans seemed to have taken place.- Zygar also focuses on the fact that Mongolia and Tuva - two of Putin's recent trips - are considered the homeland of the most powerful shamans in the world. -Vladimir Putin has long been known for his special attitude towards mysticism. And he appears to combine his interest in orthodox mysticism with pagan traditions,- the publication said. Sergei Shoigu was the first to bring Putin into contact with shamans. As evidence of this version, the author of the article recalls the frequent joint trips of Shoigu and Putin in the early 00s, including to Tuva. Zygar also claims that before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin consulted a lot with mystics. They assured him of military victory.	https://t.me/astrapress/64375	2024-09-15T11:12:46-07:00

Dissident artists prevented public utilities from restoring order - this is how the -Bulldozer Exhibition- of 1974 is described in the history textbook from Medinsky Today, September 15, marks the 50th anniversary of the -Bulldozer Exhibition- - when unofficial Soviet avant-garde artists exhibited their works in a vacant lot in the Bitsevsky Forest Park. The exhibition was dispersed by bulldozers, sprinklers, security forces and people in civilian clothes. The attackers destroyed paintings and beat artists and visitors. Subsequently, the incident was written about in foreign publications. And here is how this event is described in a new history textbook authored by Medinsky. According to the authors of the manual, who coined the phrase -contemporary art,- for protest artists, -the main measure of -success- was coverage in Western media. -They exhibited their works without approval from the city authorities at the intersection of two Moscow streets. However, utility services began to restore order using equipment, including a bulldozer. Western journalists, who found themselves in this situation -completely by accident,- presented the situation as another -violation of human rights,- says the textbook, noteRustem Adagamov.	https://t.me/astrapress/64358	2024-09-15T05:45:23-07:00
