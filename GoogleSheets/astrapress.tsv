A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar - because of a stupid order from a moron commander,- - former military prisoners on the run recorded a new track - this time about the truth, the FSB, a drunken commander and threats to their relatives. Previously, ASTRA wrote about the military men Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky, who left their positions after a drunken company commander with the call sign -Prokop- gavethe order to move to a new point at night by mine fields. The new track of former prisoners is called -Truth-. In it, they reflect on the phrase from the film -Brother-2- -Strength is in truth-, and wonder why -in our time, telling the truth has become more expensive for oneself?-, and why -in our honest and great Russia, the security forces have the truth in strength? Also, Trutnev and Ostrovsky again mention their commander with the call sign -Prokop- and the entire 109th regiment, whom they -sent to hell.- -You trump the fact that I fucked up and left. You found a deserter and a coward in me. You and I will still laugh about this at the end, but right now, fuck it, let‚Äôs figure it out. I dug my trenches, bitch, with my bare hands, and for fear of dying I washed myself with tears. Falling in places, I rose again. Where I was, you wouldn't have gotten there. A friend was killed in front of his eyes by a mortar because of a stupid order from a moron commander. And it was hard to get the guys out under the bullets, rather than sit and sort out the papers without signatures. I followed all the orders where everyone was dying, but when I told the truth, we, bitch, became cowards. You threatened my mom and what the hell is going on, but now it‚Äôs clear which of us is afraid of the truth. Yes, we left, but not because we pissed ourselves off, we just sent drunken Prokop to fuck off. And the 109th regiment, and all the lying scum, thanks to this we are now alive. And while I‚Äôm standing straight and looking at the clouds, I remember how I smiled, going around the barriers. I'm waiting for the FSB's doomsday. And I ask God for my mother‚Äôs health. For my mother, for my father, for my daughter, for my wife‚ÄîI will come and fuck you. And I will knock out the words on a pedestal for morons: -The weak cannot speak from a position of strength.- Formerly military recorded a song about their commander -Prokop-: -Younot only behind your back, where are you something in the basement. He hid his ass while we died. We open our eyes, seeing the sky from the trench. No food or water, thanks to Prokop. You send the hungry, cold people to slaughter in droves, reporting on their whereabouts via radio [walkie-talkie]. At the cost of our lives, you are testing your luck, drunk and the battalion commander are cutting down the task. The boys die by shedding their blood. F*cked orders kill the boys.

Another aerial bomb was dropped by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the Belgorod Region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod Region, on October 17, a FAB was found near the village of Sergievka, Krasnoyaruzhsky District. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least 130 aerial bombs that accidentally landed on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.How previously told ASTRA, in order to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

At the cathedral in Cherkassy there was a fight between supporters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate As local media write, military chaplain Vladimir Pedko stated that St. Michael's Cathedral in Cherkassy is being transferred to the OCU and will now be a garrison one. Moreover, the transition took place without local priests. In the morning, believers and Metropolitan Theodosius of the UOC-MP came to the temple, who did not agree with this decision, and subsequently a fight broke out. It is noted that the SBU previously handed over 4 suspicions to Metropolitan Theodosius, including for inciting interreligious hatred and denying the armed aggression of the Russian Federation.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which reports to Moscow, reported that about 100 people in camouflage and balaclavas broke into to the territory of the cathedral and -illegally- drove the believers away. At some point, the believers of the UOC-MP and the metropolitan locked themselves in the church and did not let anyone in, writes the publication -Public-. Later, the OCU occupied thecathedral and held a service there for the first time in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian flag was also raised there, writes Radio Liberty. The police opened criminal proceedings on the fact of hooliganism in the cathedral. More than 20 people were injured. The transfer of the cathedral to the subordination of the OCU was supported by the mayor of Cherkasy Anatoly Bondarenko and the head of the OBA Igor Taburets. Metropolitan John of Cherkasy and Chigirin told in a commentary to Suspilny that the transition of the community to the OCU officially took place on June 12.On August 20, 2024, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law regulating the activities of religious organizations, which prohibits the activities of churches in the country associated with Russia. We are talking, in particular, about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC).After February 24, 2022, Ukrainian society and the media began to massively criticize the clergy of the UOC for supporting the theses of the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian special services have repeatedly conducted searches of clergy&nbsp;UOC&nbsp; on&nbsp;suspicion of disseminating&nbsp;Russian propaganda&nbsp;and the work&nbsp;of some of its representatives for the Russian intelligence services.Previously, religious studies examination of the Ukrainian State Service for Freedom of Conscience showed: The UOC is a structural division of the Russian Orthodox Church.

In the Primorsky Territory, military personnel beat up a fish factory employee and stole his phoneAccording to ASTRA, on October 13, in the Khasansky district, at the mouth of the Poima River, unknown armed men in masks beat up 41 -year-old employee of the Ryazanovsky fish factory and stole his phone. He was filming them when one of them approached the man, hit him in the face, grabbed his phone and ran away. The stolen phone, according to geolocation, is now located on the territory of the fish factory. The Ryazanovsky fish factory, in turn, is located on the territory of the Russian Defense Ministry, where, according to sources, secret training exercises are taking place to prepare for the -SVO-. No one is allowed into the territory, so the security forces cannot question those involved in the beating of the victim. Presumably, the reason for beating the man was that he was launching a quadcopter, which allegedly interfered with military exercises.üí´ Subscribe to ASTRA.

About this reports -Novaya Gazeta-. Lisitsyna told the newspaper that she tried to protect her son from any military training at school. The woman planned that her son, instead of serving in the army, would go to alternative civilian service (ACS), and did not want her son to be -taught to pull the trigger.-On the eve of the training camp, in May 2024, Lisitsyna was summoned to the education department of the city of Berezovsky. -The representative of the commission said: -You know, it seems to us that you are a bad influence on your son. We will have conversations with him. We will question him in tests - psychological, socio-psychological... Do you understand how this will end?- I say: 'I don't understand.' He: ‚ÄòWe can take the child away from you.‚Äô I asked: ‚ÄòOn what basis?‚Äô He began to list some articles, but then the military commissar got involved,- the newspaper quotes Lisitsyna. The military commissar called the woman‚Äôs son a -draft dodger- and stated that the high school student -doesn‚Äôt want to defend the country- while -now bombs will fly on our heads.-According to the article about discrediting the army, a woman was fined because of her answer to the military commissar. Novaya Gazeta does not quote what was said verbatim because of the threat of being fined under the same article, but writes that the general meaning of the phrase was: -The country was not in any danger in February 2022.- However, as noted, in the protocol on discrediting Lisitsyna, completely different words were attributed that the woman did not utter. There are no audio recordings in the administrative file confirming her words. It is based on the testimony of the head of the city education department and the former former teacher of Lisitsyna‚Äôs son, who were present during the conversation with the military commissar. Later, representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and an FSB officer tried to take the woman to court. The latter told Lisitsyna that-Our fight for Vanya could end badly because we contacted human rights activists. I recommended not to communicate with them.- Ultimately, the woman did not go to trial and was fined in absentia. -It seems to me that school should be a place where teachers are your child‚Äôs protectors. It‚Äôs terrible to realize that this is not so,- said Lisitsyna, who herself previously worked as a teacher in schools and kindergartens.	https://t.me/astrapress/66399	2024-10-15T12:44:12-07:00

Roskomnadzor has made its register of blocking more closedNow it has become more difficult to find out about blocking of sites in Russia - RKN has changed the search mechanism for database of prohibited links on your website. Now, to find out about blocking, you need to enter the full address of the page, and not just its domain name. This makes using the registry much more difficult. The search mechanism for the database of blocked sites changed without warning this afternoon. Because of this, a number of media wrotethat Discord and Steam have disappeared from the registry - and, apparently , will be unlocked soon. Journalists simply could not find records about the blocking of Discord and Steam in the registry.Against this background, the RKN press service statedthat it sees no reason to unblock Discord. The department accompanied the message to journalists with an explanation: -Please note that &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; in the Unified Register of Prohibited Information of Roskomnadzor, it is necessary to enter into the search bar the link (address) of a specific page with a violation, and not the domain name of the entire service.- Roskomnadzor did not explain the reasons for changing the search mechanism in the registry of blocked sites. A representative of the public organization Roskomsvoboda, in a comment to ASTRA, said that in this way the department probably decided to make the register of blocked pages non-public. The organization reminded that it is still possible to monitor blockings the old way through their website even if prohibited links do not appear there immediately, but with a slight delay.The actions of Roskomnadzor fit into the general trend towards increasing the secrecy of information in Russia. So, since the beginning of the war, your data and statistics classified has already been classified by more than a dozen departments. And yesterday it became known that the websites of Moscow courts have stopped showing what exactly people are being arrested for. This complicates the work of journalists and human rights activists in finding those accused of political charges.	https://t.me/astrapress/66395	2024-10-15T11:00:08-07:00

Injured and damaged... FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the occupied village of Korsun, Donetsk region According to ASTRA, an unexploded FAB-500 was found near a cafe in the village of Korsun in the Yenakievo City Council. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 129th air bomb that fell as a result of an emergency landing on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before ASTRA reported that in order to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began equipping Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 129 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´®Subscribe to ASTRA.

By his own admission, Trutnev sketched out the song -on his knees.- It's called -Not Comrade Commander.- As far as the ASTRA editors know, this is the first rap incriminating the command, recorded in the conditions of the so-called -SVO.-Previously, Vyacheslav Trutnev and Dmitry Ostrovsky told ASTRAthat they escaped with positions after the company commander with the call sign -Prokop-, in a drunken state, gave them the order to move to a new point at night through minefields. ASTRA confirmed the identities of Trutnev and Ostrovsky. It is unknown where the military is now. Vyacheslav‚Äôs common-law wife Alena told ASTRA that she and the young man‚Äôs mother admit that the videos could have been recorded in Ukrainian captivity. However, there is no evidence of this. In the military unit, the woman was informed that Vyacheslav was listed as having left the unit without permission. Vyacheslav‚Äôs mother Irina wrote an appeal to the Russian Ministry of Defense demanding that they understand the situation and bring her son‚Äôs commanders to justice. ASTRA also contacted Dmitry Ostrovsky's mother, Irina. She said that -the son is definitely not in captivity-, confirmed the authenticity of the video with her son and said that 10 soldiers from his unit were missing. In addition, according to the woman, Prokop even threatened relatives of the military. The woman also says that unknown people hacked her son‚Äôs VKontakte account and began extorting money from his relatives (the editors have the corresponding screenshots at their disposal). Dmitry and Vyacheslav suspect commanders of hacking their VK pages, while Dmitry‚Äôs mother believes that it is -someone not from our country.--We sat in the trenches, unwashed, unshaven, hungry, carrying out tasks. They walked under bullets, damn it, lay under mortars, didn‚Äôt eat, didn‚Äôt sleep, while they didn‚Äôt fulfill their tasks under the contract, didn‚Äôt pay a penny of money, and now they‚Äôre still trying to harm us, suck money out of our families.

They told a journalist about this after leaving the colony. In November 2022, Kolesnikova was transferred to the intensive care unit for surgery to remove an ulcer‚Äîthe AP does not specify whether Kolesnikova pleaded for medical help before or after that.

These buildings are being checked by the police. In addition, more than 60 foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine received reports of mining, the country's Foreign Ministry reported. -It is possible that in this way the enemy is trying to destabilize the situation in the regions of our state, and therefore uses information and psychological special operations for this purpose. There are enough police forces and means to check every object,- the Ukrainian police said.Against this background, TASS publisheda comment from Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Igor Zubov, who announced the involvement of the Ukrainian special services in false mining already in Russia. According to him, call centers operating -under the auspices- of the Ukrainian special services are involved in this. Apparently, Zubov is talking about Ukrainian fraudulent call center, whose operators defraud Russians of money and push them, among other things, leave political inscriptions on monuments.

Just two months ago, he received a similar post in another region41-year-old Maxim Kovalev was appointed vice-governor of the Samara region - he headed the department for law and order and anti-corruption, reported the regional governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev. Apparently, the appointment of Kovalev as vice-governor is part of the trend to promote war participants in Ukraine to government positions. Kovalev is a native of Sevastopol, who before the annexation of Crimea served in the special forces unit of the Ukrainian police -Berkut-. After the annexation, Berkut came under the command of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (and then the Russian National Guard), and Kovalev eventually received the post of commander of the Sevastopol Berkut-S. The soldiers of this riot police unit participated in the war in Ukraine from the very beginning, mark -Important stories.- In August 2024, Kovalev took the post of vice-governor in another region - in the Vologda region. There he was responsible for public safety and law enforcement issues. According to local media, the former riot policeman resigned from this post in September. What caused the dismissal (and whether it was completely voluntary) is unknown. In Ukraine, a criminal case has been opened against Kovalev under articles of encroachment on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, treason, and misappropriation of firearms.	https://t.me/astrapress/66336	2024-10-14T08:40:52-07:00

ASTRA: The Russian Aerospace Forces again dropped an aerial bomb on the Belgorod region According to ASTRA sources in the emergency services of the Belgorod region, on October 10 in the Shebekinsky urban district, in FAB-500 was found several kilometers from the village of Neklyudovo. There were no casualties or damage.According to ASTRA estimates, this is at least the 128th air bomb that fell on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine from March to October this year.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using the UMPC in the spring of this year. And the problem with the updated FABs was immediately revealed - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. According to ASTRA estimates, in total, from March to September, Russian planes dropped at least 128 aerial bombs on Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, during an emergency gathering, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian.ü´® Subscribe to ASTRA.

China began blockade exercises against TaiwanChinese fighter jets and warships began encircling the island of Taiwan as part of the Joint Sword exercises - 2024B. Thus, Beijing is sending a-stern warning &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; separatist forces-on the island, statedthe command of the People's Liberation Army of China. Taiwan called China's military exercises a provocation. In recent years, China intensified its military presence around Taiwan - China does not recognize the independence of the 23 million island. It is noteworthy that the island blockade exercise began shortly after October 10, the founding day of the first Chinese Republic, which is celebrated as a national holiday in Taiwan. The first republic in China replaced the last imperial dynasty, and this regime ended with civil war and the rise to power of the communists. Taiwan was founded by opponents of the communists who fled to the island - and in many ways this democratic country considers itself the successor of the first Chinese Republic. Taiwan's sovereignty is recognized by only a dozen states. The United States is not among them, which provides Taiwan with military support and acts as a guarantor of the island's independence.	https://t.me/astrapress/66314	2024-10-13T22:45:53-07:00
