🎬 A war participant who became the mayor of a city in the Kirov ...	A war participant who became the mayor of a city in the Kirov region revealed facts of corruption. Now local officials want to send him back to the front Mobilized Nikita Gorelov became mayor of the city of Sosnovka in the Kirov region just a few months ago. He was invited to participate in the elections for this post by local officials, including the Minister of Internal Policy and the vice-governor of the region. On October 10, he was elected head of the city, and therefore he was demobilized. Now he received an order to return back to the war. Gorelov connects this with the fact that he -touched the topic of corruption in our city- and possesses -information affecting the interests of influential and dishonest people-, -sufficient to at least fire these Bandera’s members for official inconsistency, and, at the most, put them in prison for many years.-The military man called this a -provocation- of regional and city officials. -I am addressing the regional governor A.V. Sokolov. To be honest, I don’t really understand the situation, since I have already been working as the head for three months. Why was I recalled from Donbass? If in order to blame everything on an honest man and a patriot of the city and then blame him himself, then we did not understand each other correctly on the shore. This won’t happen,- he wrote in his tg channel. According to him, we are talking about -money laundering during the construction of a house on Sovetskaya Street, 77 and an unfinished house on Trudovye Reservy Street,- as well as other -abscesses- that caused damage to the state in the hundreds of millions of rubles.Gorelov appealed to city residents and representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation to come to a citywide meeting next Tuesday to support him. Residents of Sosnovka have already launched petition which has collected more than one and a half thousand signatures, drewthe attention of -7x7-. 💫 Help ASTRA raise money for journalists’ salaries in December: https://t.me/astrapress/69943	https://t.me/astrapress/70865	2024-12-22T08:31:22-08:00

According to them, for 10 years they have not received drinking water in full. Over the past two years, the situation has worsened significantly - water began to be turned off for eleven hours every day. At the same time, shutdowns occur according to a certain schedule, which was not agreed upon with local residents. -There is no water day or night, every day, including holidays and weekends,- people emphasized. Local authorities are inactive and cannot explain why such a problem has arisen: one official claims that the system is worn out, another claims that this is only a seasonal water shortage. The regional governor also does not take action, although back in 2018 a specialized commission assessed the state of the water supply system. The commission found that the pipes were 100% worn out. -We cannot cook properly, swim, or do household chores. We have to stock up on water, but this is not enough. &lt;…&gt; We began to notice that our water was of poor quality: soapy, different colors, with white sediment. We are afraid to drink this water,- people say in their video message. They demand that the situation be recognized as an emergency and a new water pipeline be built for them.🫨 Subscribe to ASTRA.

Trump's team is considering the possibility of the US withdrawing from the WHO immediately after the presidential inauguration - Financial TimesEdition writes that members of his team are divided in opinion: some propose to initiate reforms in the organization, others insist on a complete cessation of interaction. Experts warn that leaving the WHO could be -catastrophic- for global health. The United States is the organization's largest donor; in recent years, Washington has provided about 16% of its funding.Back in 2020, Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the WHO, accusing the organization of excessive dependence on China, but the process was not completed . According to Trump, the Chinese authorities and the WHO leadership did not take appropriate measures in connection with the spread of coronavirus.

Kursk residents will not receive compensation because all the money is spent on the war with Ukraine, Khinshtein said at a meeting with refugees United Russia member Alexander Khinshtein, appointed by Putin as the acting head of the Kursk region, reported on his visit to the temporary accommodation center for refugees. According to him, the state will not be able to fully compensate for the property lost by the Kursk residents - the state -will not bear all the expenses-, since there are not enough budget funds for this, and it is expensive to wage a war with Ukraine.-In our country The SVO is still ongoing, and the SVO is highly technical, the land must be freed! But here, excuse me, every shell costs money!-said Khinshtein.At the same time, on his page on VKontakte, Khinshtein don't forget mention that the director of school No. 1, Sergei Aleksandrovich Kondoyanidi, who was present at the meeting, a deputy of the Representative Assembly of the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, took people out from under shelling. In the comments he was immediately reminded that this information was not true.

I have never made excuses, and I think those who are guilty are making excuses, but what is written is, to put it mildly, disgusting.

Exceptions are outstanding figures of sports and art, as well as individual humanitarian cases.Consideration of applications for citizenship from Russians over 15 years of age is suspended for those applications that have already been submitted.The bill was criticized representatives of the Russian diaspora and human rights organizations, pointing out that the conditions put forward are virtually unenforceable, since it is impossible to renounce Russian citizenship without having citizenship of another country. Also, critics of the bill called it discriminatory and pointed out that a significant number of people live in the Czech Republic who left Russia due to disagreement with the war and the power of Vladimir Putin. Now the Russians, who signed the petition about the inadmissibility of the adoption of the bill, are preparing to file a lawsuit with the intention, if necessary, to reach the ECHR.To obtain citizenship, it was necessary to live in the country for more than 10 years and fulfill a number of conditions. Now the document will be sent for consideration to the Senate. After the document is approved there, it will be sent to the President of the Czech Republic for signature. The amendment is expected to come into force in early February 2025. It was included in the Lex Ukrajina law, which provides for the extension of the temporary protection regime for Ukrainian refugees until 2026.ASTRA spoke with a girl who applied for citizenship back in April 2023 - her application has not yet been considered It is unlikely that they will even consider it now. Svetlana Bogdanova moved to Prague from Murmansk and works as a veterinarian.-It’s sad, of course, because you seem to live in the country, pay taxes, the country lives on these taxes, and then it just considers you a second person varieties and says: -No, you are not worthy to be a citizen of the Czech Republic.- It turns out that in a European country the same thing is happening as in Russia, that is, you can basically do whatever you want, and nothing will happen to you for it,- says Svetlana.She noted that she did not know what to do now. Among the options she is considering is moving to another country.	https://t.me/astrapress/70524	2024-12-18T06:45:20-08:00

In the division to the local… Parents of conscripts from Chelyabinsk demand that Putin figure out why their children sign the contract,having barely entered the military unitRelatives of conscripts serving in the Chebarkul garrison No. 93992, write mass appeals to the direct line with Putin, which will take place on December 19. They are concerned that in military units, conscripts en masse sign contracts in the very first days of service.Parents of conscripts are convinced: their children sign contracts under psychological pressure, and reports on the revocation of the document remain unheeded. In addition to the direct line, families turn to military prosecutors at various levels, human rights ombudsmen, courts and other authorities. So far, to no avail: nothing is known about examples of contract termination in Chebarkul.The initiators of the appeal say that conscripts are being encouraged to sign a contract on the way to the unit. Most recruits do not give in to persuasion, but they continue to be intensively convinced once in the military unit. In particular, threats to send them to the Belgorod or Kursk regions, from where the soldiers -will return with a load of 200.- If the serviceman continues to persist, he is offered to sign a -document- in order to remain in the Chebarkul units (in the military police, in the medical battalion, as drivers).The parents do not have the original or copies of the signed documents, but they believe that the fact of imprisonment military contract is confirmed by large amounts from 400 thousand to 2&nbsp;million rubles received in the bank accounts of their children. From the name of these payments it is clear that we are talking about one-time payments for imprisonment agreement with the Ministry of Defense. Amounts vary as the conclusion passes through different regions. Officially transfer of money explained by a technical failure.The 90th Guards Tank is based in Chebarkul division. In 2022, its fighters took part in the attack on Kyiv, where parts of the division were ambushed, suffered heavy losses and took refuge in Bogdanovka, Brovary district.

They claim that, at least in their city, only they and local Cossacks removed oil products from the beach - the Emergency Situations Ministry employees did not help them.-They bought everything themselves, brought it in cars. Someone bought, for example, just a huge number of 120-liter basins. There are many people willing, but there is no equipment, not even clothes. Because we also went and realized that we had simply gotten away with everything. People are all standing in the dark. Shoes, clothes, it won’t wash off anything,- said volunteer Ilya.According to him, there is a stench on the beach. As a result, some of the volunteers feel sick - today they did not yet know about the smell and did not stock up on masks. Ilya is preparing for the fact that tomorrow there will be even more work, as there is a strong wind that will bring new fuel oil ashore.-We collected the fuel oil in bags. No one has taken them out yet. The Ministry of Emergency Situations will most likely give some instructions on this matter, but so far there are none. That is, our task for now is simply to localize, collect, drag and cover everything with sand, because the waves are strong, the water can get it all out and take it away overnight,- explains Ilya.The volunteer says, that not only residents of Anapa, but also visitors from other regions who spent the winter here came to the beach to help.-There are still no people. Therefore, of course, we need to help. We also have our own work. Now it's dark, we stopped working. At night everyone will come to their senses a little and tomorrow we will start again, because the water will only erode further and further. The scale here is catastrophic. The state, local businesses, and people need to somehow unite,- says Ilya.&nbsp;Fuel oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which are proven carcinogens. Breathing fuel oil vapors causes irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing, shortness of breath and can lead to the development of bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Fuel oil particles entering the lungs can cause fibrosis and other chronic diseases. Direct contact with fuel oil causes dermatitis, eczema and other skin diseases. Some components of fuel oil have neurotoxic properties that affect the nervous system. This can manifest itself in headaches, dizziness, weakness and other neurological symptoms.In the morning, Governor of the Krasnodar Territory Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed, that after the tanker crash -Volgoneft 239- and Volgoneft 212 washed up oil products on the coast. oil products washed ashore.
