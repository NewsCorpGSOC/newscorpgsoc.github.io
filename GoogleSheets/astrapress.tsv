This time, several areas lined up with -HOMELESS- posters. Homeless Mariupol residents congratulated Putin on his baptism and -called out for justice on this day.- Last time they wrote down address to him for the New Year. Local -authorities- reported that no more compensatory housing will be built. According to them, they were told about law number 141, according to which they want to be given -ownerless- housing - housing of people who, for one reason or another, did not return to the city. -We believe that this is a predatory law. Let's call a spade a spade. This means taking from some and giving to others,- say residents. According to residents of the Cheryomushki district, their damaged houses were demolished without their consent and they were promised new housing. Now, on the site of the pits, they are building housing on a mortgage, which -with our income we are not able to pay.--At a new meeting with deputies, we were informed that in those the houses that have been built do not have enough space for us. Instead of new buildings, they are preparing to hand out ownerless apartments to us, which will supposedly become municipal ones. This is the housing of our Mariupol residents who left the city due to the fighting. We refuse to move into other people‚Äôs apartments, because it is impossible from the point of view of morality and law,- people say. -We have nothing. It‚Äôs hard to imagine how [the housing] will be taken away from the owners and given to us,- say residents of the Kurchatov microdistrict. Formerly ASTRA talked abouthow a large-scale mortgage construction in a destroyed The war left tens of thousands of people homeless in the city: the occupation authorities took away apartments from city residents, and expensive land in the historical center was given to Russian developers for mortgage housing.üéÅ Subscribe to ASTRA.

A Russian plane dropped an aerial bomb on an occupied village in the Zaporozhye region, ASTRA found outOn January 9, a Russian FAB fell near the village of Vishnevka in the Mikhailovsky district of Zaporozhye region areas. The air bomb did not explode; a crater formed at the site. There were no casualties. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 165 cases of falling FAB aerial bombs in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine for 2024 year, about 6 FABs and one rocket for 2025.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defense, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB aerial bombs with UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory. Previously confirmation of the use of the winged FAB-3000 in Ukraine was published. The numbers in the name of such bombs indicate the total weight of the product.The Russian army began actively using UMPC last spring. And the problem of the updated FABs immediately emerged - often the bombs simply do not reach Ukraine. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the bombs are destroyed after the fact by explosives technicians. At the beginning of July 2023, FAB-3000 fell for the first time from a Russian plane in the Belgorod region. A bomb exploded in a field near Shebekino. Since the bomb fell in a field, there were no casualties. May 4 a Russian plane dropped a FAB-500 on Belgorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities hid the reason for the bomb's fall, as well as the fact that it was Russian. November 19 last year a Russian plane dropped a 250-kilogram bomb on a school in the Belgorod region. An aerial bombThe UMPB -unexpectedly descended- on a school in the village of Bykovka in the Yakovlevsky urban district.

It is alleged that all those infected underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. The information was confirmed by the head of the regional Ministry of Health, Alexander Gashkov (on video).After the outbreak, experts from Moscow were brought in to conduct an epidemiological investigation. They found that the infection spread due to violations of sanitary standards - lack of antiseptics, improper handling of equipment and the use of multi-dose bottles of saline solution. In addition, the virus can be transmitted to patients due to the fact that staff did not clean their hands and used disposable instruments several times.There may be more people infected, since about 1,000 people had MRIs with contrast in the office. Now the work of the CT room has been suspended for a month. The Investigative Committee in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky opened a criminal case on the fact of criminal negligence of unidentified employees of the Kamchatka Regional Oncology Dispensary, which negligently resulted in the infliction of grievous harm to human health (Part 2 of Article 293 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
