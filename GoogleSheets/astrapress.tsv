They publicly expressed their anti-war point of view, which caused them problems at work. -I am a pacifist and generally do not accept any military conflicts, much less attacks on the fraternal people, because every Russian has close and distant relatives in Ukraine. After the war, we were in a very stressful state, and we decided to leave, because we can’t change anything in Russia,- Olga told ASTRA.According to her, Sweden was the only country where where they could most quickly obtain visas and enter legally. In June 2022, they crossed the border and applied for asylum. A few months later, immediately after mobilization began, they received a refusal. Olga and her husband filed an appeal, which was considered for another six months.-In fact, migration clerks do not have a document by which they should evaluate Russians who opposed the war. In fact, they rely on outdated documents, according to which there is no war,- Olga claims.Olga says that she and her husband still found a way to suspend the decision on their deportation, but after 11 months they anyway, an order was issued to leave the country.-On August 1, I was absolutely illegally put in a pre-trial detention center. I am an asylum seeker, all my documents are legal, but since then they have not released me. I lived in migration housing, came and renewed my asylum seeker card. I was where I was supposed to be. If they suspected that I would run away, they should have forced me to report to come. But they missed this point and simply arrested me, separating me from my five children,- Olga told ASTRA.A review of the decision to place her in a pre-trial detention center in early October did not yield anything. i>-I am in the leaked FSB database -Oppositionists- because I have a small journalistic job. I wrote articles about anti-war organizations that are banned in Russia. I took part in rallies and demonstrations, wrote a book, and ran a telegram channel in which I told how to get asylum. Provocateurs are writing to my husband from the FSB,- Olga shares.She says what she saw asylum seekers from Belarus were deportedagainst whom criminal proceedings were initiated. According to Olga, the son from this family was arrested immediately at the border, and his mother stopped communicating. -I am now simply afraid for my life, because the latest paper says that nothing threatens us, there is no war in Yekaterinburg, everything is fine, the FSB will not touch us. And my interview was published on YouTube, there were 1100 comments. 80 percent of them - come, we will crucify you,- says Olga.Olga has now created petition asking the Swedish authorities to prevent her deportation. Scandinavian countries have repeatedly denied political asylum to Russians. So, Russian Pavel Suetin left Severomorsk for Norway and requested asylum in the city of Vadsø, but in September 2024, the Norwegian migration department informed him that he was not entitled to asylum and must leave the Schengen zone within three weeks. Another Russian, Stanislav Brysin, was refused asylum in Sweden, despite the experience of holding protests and an open criminal case for -calls for terrorism.- ASTRA wrote that in search of refuge, Brysin boarded a boat and sailed towards Ireland. Before this Sweden has deported a family from Belarus, against whom a criminal case has been opened in their homeland. Not The situation with asylums in the USA is better.

🖼 Russia is deceitfully recruiting young girls from Africa, Asia...	Russia is deceiving young girls from Africa, Asia and Latin America to assemble Shaheds - Associated PressAbout 200 foreign women are assembling Iranian drones in the Alabuga special economic zone in Tatarstan. Girls aged 18–22 are attracted to Russia using the Alabuga Start online program: on the program’s website they are promised studies in Europe, a free plane and work in the service and catering sectors, but this turns out to be a hoax. As a result, girls face constant monitoring, broken wage promises, and dangerous work with caustic chemicals that damage their skin. -I regret and curse the day when I started doing this,- the publication quotes one of the women. Together with foreign women, 15-16-year-old Russian students of vocational schools work there, who also complain about working conditions. Analysts found that since July 29, about 95% of drones have not hit any visible targets in Ukraine. Instead, they fall into the rivers and fields of Ukraine, fly into Latvia and land on the territory of Russia or Belarus. Until July, about 14% of Shaheds hit targets in Ukraine. The publication writes that one of the reasons for the decline in the quality of drones may be unskilled labor. The special economic zone -Alabuga- was created in 2006 to attract business and investment to Tatarstan. After February 2022, it quickly grew and its parts switched to military production.	https://t.me/astrapress/66155	2024-10-10T11:37:03-07:00

The State Duma has introduced amendments according to which foreign citizenship will become an aggravating circumstance when committing a crimeDraft amendments to Part 1 of Article 63 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Circumstances- aggravating punishment-) was introduced to the State Duma by deputy Evgeniy Marchenko (non-factional parliamentarian). He proposes to consider the commission of a crime -by a person with foreign citizenship or a stateless person- as an aggravating circumstance, writes -Kommersant-. Marchenko believes that this initiative -will become an effective preventive mechanism- and will contribute to -more responsible behavior- of foreigners in the Russian Federation. He refers to TFR statistics indicating a 55% increase in the number of extremist crimes committed by migrants in the first half of 2024. Experts interviewed by Kommersant say these amendments contradict the constitutional principle of equality before the law and may contribute to the outflow of migrants. The State Duma is currently considering several bills that would tighten migration policy: illegal stay in the country as an aggravating circumstance when sentencing, and equating the organization of illegal migration to particularly serious crimes. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called tightening control over migration a priority for the State Duma this session.&nbsp; Until 2021, Marchenko was a deputy from United Russia, but was later expelled from the party because the parliamentarian, contrary to the consolidated decision of the party bodies, voted against the adoption of the federal budget in the first reading, thereby violating the norms of the charter -United Russia- and regulations on the faction.	https://t.me/astrapress/65972	2024-10-07T22:18:07-07:00

As a result, the Yemeni movement purchased $10 million worth of machine guns. Victor Bout returned to Russia two years ago - then Bout, convicted in the United States in the case of selling weapons to the Colombian group FARC, was exchanged for two-time Olympic basketball champion Brittney Greiner. Viktor Bout is currently working deputy Legislative Assembly of the Ulyanovsk Region from the Liberal Democratic Party. -If we look at the title of the article [The Wall Street Journal], and it is pointedly called 'Putin's arms dealer,' and, naturally, we understand that this stuff was specially timed on the birthday of our President Vladimir Putin,- Bout said in a commentary to RBC. CNN previously wrote that Russia planned to transfer missiles and military equipment to the Houthis - but changed her mind under pressure from Saudi Arabia. However, then journalists did not report about Bout’s participation in the negotiations. It is beneficial for Moscow to arm the Houthis because of their confrontation with the United States in Yemen and the Red Sea. So, since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas, this Shiite group routinely attacks oil tankers in the Red Sea - and sometimes even American warships.	https://t.me/astrapress/65924	2024-10-07T03:27:51-07:00

🎬🖼 A cargo ship with 20 thousand tons of saltpeter from Russia ...	A cargo ship with 20 thousand tons of saltpeter from Russia has not been able to get up for repairs in Europe for more than a month. Local authorities fear a repeat of the tragedy in Beirut The Malta-flagged cargo ship MV Ruby carrying Russian fertilizers has not been allowed into European ports for repairs since the beginning of September. European authorities are afraid of the possible detonation of 20 thousand tons of ammonium nitrate (ammonium nitrate), which Ruby was supposed to deliver to Africa from the Murmansk region. The New York Times writes about this.Ruby left the port in the city of Kandalaksha in August. Soon after the start of the journey, the ship ran aground, resulting in damage to the hull, propeller and rudder. From September 1 to September 4, the ship was in the Norwegian port of Tromso - there it was inspected, but not repaired. Since then, the ship has not been allowed to dock.Ammonium nitrate is a popular fertilizer that comes with risks. Nitrate is explosive, especially in large quantities. Heating or, for example, a significant change in air humidity can lead to an explosion. In August 2020, due to welding work in the port of Lebanese Beirut, 2,750 tons of saltpeter detonated - as a result of a powerful explosion (on video), more than 200 people were killed, and about 300,000 more were left homeless. There is about 8 times more saltpeter on board Ruby - although it is known that the ship was not damaged by the cargo. The opportunity to moor the ship with explosive cargo MV Ruby has already been denied by the authorities of Lithuania and Great Britain, off whose coast the ship has been docking for the last week. Now the UAE company that operates the vessel, Serenity Shipping, has requested permission to dock to unload fertilizer onto another vessel and carry out repairs on the Ruby. Even Malta refused to allow Ruby with explosive cargo, writes The New York Times. This is despite the fact that the ship is flying the Maltese flag. Officials said the Ruby would only be able to dock if it got rid of the saltpeter.

On the Orthodox TV channel -Spas- they urged not to have an abortion after rapeInthe program -Direct Line of Life- there was a story about psychologist Lyudmila Podolskaya, who dissuades women who become pregnant from abortion as a result of rape. The presenter's voice-over states that women who have survived rape -will definitely find help- if they decide to keep the child. -After all, despite the fact that he did not appear as a result of mutual love, the child in the womb is a living person. If an expectant mother terminates a pregnancy, then in essence she also becomes a criminal, no less than the person who committed violence,- said Maria Chugreeva.

For the second day in a row, security forces disrupt the concerts of the Russian rock band Otto Dix Yesterday the concert was supposed to take place in Yaroslavl, and today in Nizhny Novgorod.

Then they began checking the spectators' documents. -If we didn’t have a passport with us, then we were checked through government services,- Sergei told ASTRA. Another concert participant reported that the employees forbade calling or filming anything on their phones, and also thoroughly checked everyone’s bags. In addition, people were asked what their job was and the purpose of attending the concert was clarified. -But they themselves didn’t explain anything!- – she added. Some spectators were released, but several were loaded into paddy wagons. The exact number of detainees is currently unknown. -They said they would take me to the department. They said something about preventative drug testing,- said another girl. The musicians themselves have not yet commented on the news. Some fans of the group believe that the cancellation of concerts may be due to -LGBT propaganda.- According to unconfirmed rumors, Otto Dix's lead singer, Michael Drau, was formerly a woman named Marina who underwent hormone therapy. However, the fan club has not yet come to a consensus whether this is true or not.☮️ Even the most minimal, but regular donations from readers are important to continue the work of ASTRA: Patreon Boosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/65717	2024-10-03T12:54:32-07:00
