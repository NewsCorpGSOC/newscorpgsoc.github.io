At Christmas, the patriarch proclaimed an -alternative path of civilizational development- in RussiaThe head of the Russian Orthodox Church began his Christmas sermon by addressing the -lords,- after which he moved on to contrasting Jesus Christ and the gods of Olympus. The patriarch also criticized the atheistic worldview. In his opinion, faith in God requires much more strength.Cyril devoted approximately half of his sermon to exposing the -sins- of the West. At the same time, he did not directly mention the war in Ukraine. From the speech, however, it follows that in this way Russia -challenged many great and powerful-:-As I say, we are hated because we offer a different path, an alternative path of civilizational development. There is scientific and technological progress and the complete collapse of everything that has to do with human morality. ... Our country, which has gone through enormous sorrows, has shaped a strong human character. By the grace of God, today there is a revival of faith in the Lord and Savior[...] Today we especially ask the Lord to bless our fatherland, our Orthodox President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the authorities, the army and all our people.- It was the inability of the West to accept the special role of Russia that the Patriarch explained the international confrontation.-When [...] churches Christian ones, at best, are repurposed as mosques, where they at least pray to God, and often entertainment establishments*, as I said, into restaurants and so on. Here we are today showing an alternative to civilizational development, when it is possible to combine science, technology, education, the highest culture with faith in our Lord and Savior. That's why they beat us. Well, physically it’s not very successful. -The creation of certain blocs aimed at weakening Russia is slander of various kinds,- said the head of the Russian Orthodox Church.During the Christmas service, Patriarch Kirill also met with Putin. He asked to engrave his initials on chains to the crosses of SVO soldiers, which were consecrated by Patriarch Kirill.*Apparently, Patriarch I meant the UOC temple in Vinnitsa. Last November, the Spas TV channel spread a fake story that it had allegedly been converted into a nightclub.

State Duma deputy compared Anglicisms in speech with migrants Deputy Sergei Eremin, former mayor of Krasnoyarsk, supported the bill on the protection of the Russian language and spoke about the influence of Anglicisms in speech. He compared them to migrants -invading our language.- -It won’t be long for Anglicisms to wreak havoc in our speech! The State Duma will consider a bill on the protection of the Russian language in the near future. Honestly? I am in favor with both hands. Otherwise, this Anglo-Saxon husk, like illegal migrants, has filled our language, crowding out our native words. You can’t read the signs of some stores without a dictionary, the kids speak some kind of surrogate,- said Eremin.In his opinion, signs, advertising and information about products must be in Russian. -It’s important to preserve the purity of our language for future generations, so that they don’t forget who they are and where they come from,- he added.-Can we still do something really useful and leave the language alone?- -You have so much time in the State Duma that you can be distracted by all sorts of nonsense? &lt;…&gt; Your task is to improve people’s lives, and not to teach them how to live and pick new prohibitions out of their noses,- people wrote in the comments under his post.	https://t.me/astrapress/71842	2025-01-06T23:50:06-08:00

He was brought to the sixth commandant's office of Donetsk at the address: st. Ivan Tkachenko 138. There he was put in the basement, where there were eight more people accused of leaving a unit without permission (SOCH), although the cell was intended for six. Barlet spent about a week here - he was fed dry rations, he went to the toilet in a bottle, and during the day the officers took him to work. He emphasizes that he did not hide from service, despite the fact that he was not working under a contract and he regularly called the unit during his -vacation- to find out if the army needed him, so he does not understand why he was detained. After a week in the basement he was handed over to representatives of a certain 116th unit, about which he knows nothing. On the way, these people told him that he was being taken to sign a contract, but the young man asked to stop at his parents’ house to pick up his things. After going to the toilet, he was able to escape. After the escape, people in uniform came to his relatives, and unknown people in his military unit received a salary for it. Now the family of Alexander Barlet needs the help of lawyers and human rights activists. The man's former lawyers have received threats.
