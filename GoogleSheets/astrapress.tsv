A participant in the war with Ukraine tried to stab his neighbor to death because of a loud TV The Vladimir garrison military court sentenced military Andrei Akhremtsov to three years of probation, who, during a domestic conflict, stabbed his neighbor with a knife.

A measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico amid the growing popularity of the anti-vaccination movement - almost 100 cases90 cases of infection have been confirmed in Texas, nine in New Mexico. The highest number of cases is in Gaines County, where the vaccination rate is below the state average.The outbreak began in the South Plains region of Texas in late January, the state Department of Health Services said. According to the latest data, among the 90 cases, 77 are children. 16 people are hospitalized.In New Mexico, infections were reported in Lee County, which borders the epicenter of the outbreak in Texas, the local Department of Health said. Nine people fell ill there, including four children.Local services are urgently setting up additional vaccination and testing points to contain the spread of infection. Free vaccinations are available in Seminole (Gaines County, Texas) and Lee County (New Mexico). Additional testing sites have also opened in these areas.Measles is considered one of the most contagious infections, and outbreaks occur when herd immunity levels fall below 95%. In Gaines County, the rate is significantly lower: last year, only 82% of children received the two required doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.Vaccine refusal rates are on the rise in the region. In Texas, the law allows for -conscientious objection- to vaccinate a child, and in Gaines County, 13% of students exercised this right.The situation is complicated by the appointment of Robert Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health. Kennedy is known to be skeptical of vaccines and cited controversial studies about their possible side effects. He has already stated that he intends to review the childhood vaccination system.In the United States, measles was officially considered eliminated, but due to a decrease in the level of vaccination, cases of the disease are being recorded more and more often. In 2024, the country reported 285 cases of measles in more than 30 states.	https://t.me/astrapress/75108	2025-02-22T20:50:01-08:00

The verdict was handed down on January 15, 2025.The reason for the criminal prosecution was a comment published by Novoselova under a post about a serviceman who died in the war in Ukraine. -The comment contained linguistic and psychological signs of humiliation of the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces who died during a special military operation,- says the published decision of the court.Novoselova admitted her guilt and asked to consider the case in a special manner without examining the evidence. The case was opened in October 2024, after the regional department of the Investigative Committee reported the publication of a comment that, in their opinion, expressed disrespect and insult to the fallen defenders of the Fatherland. The SOVA Research Center considered the actions of law enforcement agencies unnecessary, noting that the relatives of the deceased could have filed a civil lawsuit to protect their honor and dignity, rather than resort to criminal prosecution.	https://t.me/astrapress/75071	2025-02-22T01:05:09-08:00

With the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rudneva became one of the public representatives of the anti-war movement.The Swedish Security Service considered that Rudneva's research could allegedly benefit the Russian military or related organizations. As a result, she may be banned from entering Sweden and the Schengen countries for 20 years.Rudneva denies the charges.-This is very unfair. My work is related to theoretical mathematics, which has no military application,- she said in an interview with Sveriges Radio.The girl previously worked at Skoltech, which is under US and EU sanctions and, according to the US, allegedly collaborated with the Russian military.Rudneva admits that she is defending her dissertation at the Higher School of Economics, which cooperates with Skoltech, but claims that this is necessary to complete it work.At Skoltech itself, according to the educational institution‚Äôs website, Rudneva was listed as a research intern at the Krichever Center for Advanced Study from 2018 to 2022 and worked on a dissertation on the topic -Asymmetric vertex models and stochastic integrable processes.-The Swedish Migration Service refused to discuss individual cases. The country's security service said in an interview with Sveriges Radio that -their decisions are based on a comprehensive assessment of various factors- and that their task is -to ensure the protection of valuable technologies and research.-Rudneva appealed the deportation decision.-This research does not pose a threat. This is a fundamental science that studies exotic states of matter,- said Professor Emeritus Thors Hans Hansson in an interview with Sveriges Radio.	https://t.me/astrapress/75070	2025-02-22T00:25:10-08:00

During 2.5 years of war, at least 166 thousand wounded and sick military personnel passed through military hospitals - Radio LibertyAlexey Zhilyaev, the former commander of the wounded evacuation department, told the publication database of the Main Military Medical Directorate Ministry of Defense, which contains records of 166 thousand hospitalized from January 2022 to June 2024, including in annexed Crimea. Journalists calculated that 3,205 Russian military personnel were seriously injured, 37,567 people were moderately injured, and 63,821 people were lightly injured. -In field hospitals, everything is recorded clearly. And in hospital cases, sometimes they underestimate the severity in order to quickly return the wounded to the front, [and to save on] insurance payments,- commented Zhilyaev. Also, -Radio Liberty- clarifies that the total number of those wounded in the war cannot be determined from these data, since it does not record cases when military personnel were returned to the front after treatment for minor injuries.For some military personnel who drank or took drugs, the diagnosis is -acute oral poisoning with an unknown substance,- -poisoning with unknown narcotic substances,- -acute poisoning with an alcohol-containing liquid.- -One day a lieutenant was brought to our hospital. He said he drank four shots of cognac. He developed pulmonary edema. The diagnosis is -poisoning with an unknown substance.- As I understand it, the resistance of the population [in Ukraine] is also manifested through such cases,- Zhilyaev said.Mediazona and BBC Russian Service found out that the number of dead Russian soldiers since February 24, 2022 reached 95,026.

Ukrainian authorities called him -murderer of Mariupol number one.-Putin, by his decree, promoted several dozen high-ranking military officers, employees of internal affairs bodies and a number of departments. Among them was Colonel Sergei Atroshchenko, commander of military unit 75387, 960th assault aviation regiment, who in Ukraine is called the man who gave orders to bomb the drama theater, maternity hospital, children's hospital and other objects in Mariupol. He was awarded the rank of Colonel General. In 2023, the Ukrainian project Informnapal wrote that hackers hacked Atroshchenko's email and obtained lists of his subordinates and other information. -The number one killer of Mariupol residents has been identified. The one who ordered and controlled the bombing of the Drama Theater, maternity hospital and children's hospital. From the first weeks, we established that the planes that bombed Mariupol took off from the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield,- wrote Advisor to the Mayor of Mariupol Pyotr Andryushchenko in March 2023.

In December 2022, a man volunteered to fight in Ukraine. She told ASTRA that Mashlyakevich had no problems at work until he was late for -some assignment- in October 2024. After that, they tried to force him to purchase a UAV (presumably a Mavik quadcopter) worth 200 thousand rubles for the needs of a motorized rifle unit with his own money. The serviceman refused, citing the fact that he was not part of this unit; Denis served with the tank crews. They continued to put pressure on him.It is known that Denis went to the bank together with another military unit, Azamat, who demanded money from him. There, 200 thousand rubles were withdrawn from his account, which is confirmed by a bank statement.Then the serviceman was illegally detained somewhere in the -DPR-, shot in both hands with a pneumatic weapon and his phone was taken away. One bullet got stuck in his right hand, which led to problems with his fingers - pain and limited mobility.During this period, several large debits were made from his accounts: three payments of 305,970 rubles and another in the amount of 81,592 rubles. The recipient of the payment is a certain -Azamat B.-After these events, one of Denis‚Äôs colleagues warned him that they wanted to -nullify- him‚Äîto remove him as an unnecessary witness. Fearing for his life, Mashlyakevich left military unit 91714 in November to officially contact the prosecutor's office. According to the girl, he was not hiding and was at the place of registration, awaiting official proceedings.The prosecutor's office promised that the investigation would begin on February 1, but on January 27, Denis was detained by unknown people in civilian clothes and in civilian cars: they tied him up with force right near the house, although he did not resist. After the arrest, a hematoma formed on Mashlyakevich‚Äôs face. Denis‚Äôs girlfriend claims that those who arrived pointed weapons at them, after which they took Denis to the unit.-They wanted to send him to the contact line the very next day, but on 28 we went to the prosecutor‚Äôs office, they called the unit, and Denis‚Äôs phone was returned. He was in touch. We even came to the unit and were allowed to see each other. Then messages began to arrive that Denis was being -taken away-, that he was -going there-, they wrote that he was on the front line somewhere wearing arm guards. Since then there has been no contact with Denis,- says the girlfriend of the missing serviceman.The relatives demand a fair trial and punishment for the perpetrators, but all requests are answered with replies.

Zarema Musayeva will remain in custody until March 26Today, February 20, the Sheikh-Mansurovsky District Court of Grozny extended the preventive measure for Zarema Musayeva, leaving her in custody until March 26. It was expected that by this time her term of imprisonment in the first criminal case should have expired - March 23, 2025.However, a new criminal case was opened against Musaeva. She is accused of disorganizing the activities of a colony (Part 3, Article 321 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), for which she could face up to five years in prison.Musaeva‚Äôs lawyer, Alexander Savin, said that her client continues to have health problems, including due to diabetes. She was recently prescribed treatment for a leg joint, as she has been walking on crutches for a long time due to complications.Zarema Musaeva was abducted by Chechen police in Nizhny Novgorod in January 2022. According to investigators, she scratched the face of one of them. On July 4, 2023, the Akhmatovsky District Court of Grozny sentenced Zarema Musayeva to 5.5 years in prison in a general regime colony for -using violence against a representative of the authorities,- but later it was reduced to four years and nine months.The European Court concluded that the persecution of the elderly woman is exclusively political and is explained by the opposition activities of her sons.

The exercise commander was fined two hundred thousand rubles for an explosion at the training ground that injured two cadets The Vladimir Garrison Military Court fined Captain Denis Vonotkov, commander of the military training tank regiment, two hundred thousand rubles Part 30616-7, in a case of violation of the rules for handling weapons, resulting in serious harm to health (Part 1 of Article 349 of the Criminal Code). Mediazona reports this with reference to the press service of the court. During exercises at the Sergeytsevo training ground, Vonotkov tied together imitation IM-100 cartridges in pairs, intensifying the explosion. He did not fence off the dangerous area and incorrectly calculated the distance, which is why the explosion occurred under the rear of the infantry fighting vehicle, where the cadets were located. As a result, Zemskov received a mine explosion injury with severe injuries, and Ivashchenko received fractures and hematomas. -This explosion stunned him [Ivashchenko], and he experienced a state of shock, the doors of the BMP-1 opened from the blast wave, he fell on his back from the landing compartment to the ground, after which he began to shout -really the 300th,- pointing his finger inside the landing compartment of the BMP-1, since he realized that [Zemskov] had suffered bodily harm,- the verdict says. Vonotkov admitted guilt, but refused to comment.In 2020, a junior sergeant died at the same training ground, receiving a through wound to the chest. Then the court imposed a two-year suspended sentence on the leader of the shooting.	https://t.me/astrapress/74973	2025-02-20T09:55:01-08:00

A resident of Cherepovets was denied an abortion in all medical institutions in the city A 38-year-old resident of Cherepovets, Natalya (name changed), was denied an abortion in antenatal clinics in the city, as well as in private clinics in Cherepovets and Vologda. According to the woman, medical institutions in the region actually stopped providing this service without official explanation. -I live in the Cherepovets region, I have three children, my youngest daughter is three years old. I planned to go to work, but found out I was pregnant. I contacted a doctor at my place of residence, but I was told that he was not responsible for performing abortions. In a private clinic they did an ultrasound, set the period at eight weeks and explained that medical termination of pregnancy at this stage is no longer possible,- Natalya told the Rech newspaper. After this, the woman tried to sign up for an operation at the city maternity hospital, but was refused. -Yesterday was the last day we performed abortions. From today we have no right,- they told her over the phone.She received a similar answer in other antenatal clinics in the city. During a personal visit to one of the consultations, Natalia was explained that at the regional level a decision had been made to recommend that all women under 50 years of age continue pregnancy. However, she was not provided with any official documents, and she was not given a written refusal to have an abortion. Later, the woman turned to the official community of the maternity hospital on the social network VKontakte with a request to explain the reasons for the refusal. In response, she was informed that -termination of pregnancy is carried out only for medical reasons in a 24-hour hospital- and that this issue is regulated at the level of the government of the Vologda region. The couple considered the possibility of leaving the child, but came to the conclusion that they would not be able to provide for him morally and financially. -My husband already works three jobs. I spent ten years on maternity leave, and now I wanted to return to my professional activities,- explained Natalya. As a result, the woman had to go to a private clinic in the Yaroslavl region, where they agreed to carry out the operation without restrictions. The cost of the procedure was about nine thousand rubles.	https://t.me/astrapress/74962	2025-02-20T08:14:45-08:00

A monument to Stalin will not be erected in Kaliningrad because of his repressions and terror The head of the Kaliningrad administration, Elena Dyatlova, rejected the proposal of the local branch of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation to erect a monument to Joseph Stalin, citing historical documents condemning the cult of personality and political repression. In a response published on the party‚Äôs website, Dyatlova noted that the installation of monuments should not lead to conflicts in society, and recalled the 1956 resolution of the CPSU Central Committee -On overcoming the cult of personality and its consequences,- as well as the law -On the rehabilitation of victims of political repression.- She emphasized that the period from the 1930s to the early 1950s is recognized as the time of Stalinist repressions, and many years of terror and persecution of citizens of the USSR were condemned as incompatible with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaw and justice.The Communist Party of the Russian Federation called Dyatlova‚Äôs position -a clear anti-Soviet position aimed at denigrating Soviet history and the great feat of the people.- The head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction in the Legislative Assembly of the Kaliningrad Region, Maxim Bulanov, said that, in his opinion, the mayor is trying to whitewash his incompetence and inaction, which led to the deplorable state of the city. He emphasized that the party will not allow history to be rewritten and evaded responsibility.In recent years, monuments to Stalin have been erected regularly in Russia. These include busts and full-length monuments. In November-December 2024 alone, three monuments to Stalin were erected - in the Primorsky Territory, in North Ossetia and in the Vologda region. There are more than a hundred of them in total.Elena Dyatlova has held the post of mayor of Kaliningrad since November 2020 and at the same time heads the city branch of the United Russia party.	https://t.me/astrapress/74937	2025-02-20T03:19:15-08:00

Lawyer Maria Chashchilova is deported from Latvia after the investigation of -Important Stories-Lawyer and human rights activist Maria Chashchilova is being deported from Latvia at this moment, reports SOTA with a link to a girl‚Äôs friend. According to the publication, three border service officers are in her apartment and gave her four hours to choose a country to leave. Latvian security forces called the reason for the deportation a -security threat.- Earlier that same day, Chashchilova received another decision from the Latvian authorities, according to which she had a month to challenge the deportation, but this document was declared invalid. Chaschilova worked with human rights organizations, including OVD-Info and the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives. In January 2024, Important Stories published an investigation about her, calling into question her biography, diplomas and professional activities. The material alleged that Chashchilova used a fake diploma, edited entries in the work book and a fictitious biography, and was also allegedly interested in information about the publication‚Äôs employees and their sources. The investigation was based on negative reviews from her ex-husband and acquaintances, as well as a number of unreliable facts in Chashchilova‚Äôs interview, such as her failed trip to Ukraine. -Important Stories- also tried to connect her with the unproven poisoning of the head of Free Russia, Natalia Arno. The Conscious Objector Movement, where Chashilova now works, also stated that they found no reason for mistrust. She may face persecution in Russia for her work with LGBT activists.	https://t.me/astrapress/74870	2025-02-19T08:14:24-08:00

In the Moscow region, residents of Tomilino protested against the construction of a toll backup for Yegoryevskoye HighwayAccording to the authorities‚Äô plans, the route should connect the Moscow Ring Road and the Central Ring Road. Locals are worried that the four-lane road will destroy the ecosystem and infrastructure of the village, and the government of the Moscow region assures that it will help relieve congestion on the Yegoryevskoye Highway and improve transport accessibility for more than two million people.-Who will it make life easier for? Obviously not our village,- local resident Evgeniy told RTVI. He claims that the new alternate route will -divide- Tomilino, depriving people of convenient routes and destroying important facilities such as schools and clinics.According to the project, the route will stretch 36 km through the Lyubertsy district and Ramenskoye and will cost 110 billion rubles. The authorities promise that the route will be located at a distance of 50-65 meters from the nearest houses and will be fenced with noise barriers, but locals are skeptical about these statements.-We have old houses, during construction they will simply collapse and turn into emergency ones. We will all be homeless,- a local resident added to RTVI.The project is criticized by environmentalists, saying that the decision will affect not only the ecosystem, but also people‚Äôs health.-The strategic importance of Moscow‚Äôs green shield is priceless.

ASTRA: -Not a basement, but a specially equipped bomb shelter.- An ambulant resident of the Krasnodar Territory was sent from a Donetsk basement on a combat mission Earlier ASTRA wrote about a resident of Novokubansk, Krasnodar Territory, Ilya Arnold, who from the colony went to the war with Ukraine and ended up in military unit 41698, 5th brigade of the 3rd motorized rifle battalion, company -B-. He was wounded in the battle, the hospital did not treat him, he was put in a basement, from which, as it turned out, he was again sent to the line of combat contact. The man‚Äôs mother, Olga Arnold, told ASTRA about this. She learned that her disabled son was wounded at the front from the military prosecutor of Donetsk Sergei Ivanov (whether this is his real name is unknown). At the same time, a day earlier, the employee said that he sent his assistant to check Ilya‚Äôs condition, but did not find him there. -The prosecutor told me that my son was not found at the location that my son had previously given me. He said he was sent on a combat mission. Tell me where else the mother needs to go to report that the man was wounded, he could not walk, his knee did not bend. What combat mission was he sent on?!- ‚Äî the mother of a serviceman told ASTRA. Also, in a conversation with Olga Arnold, the prosecutor said that Ilya was discharged from the hospital because he allegedly violated the conditions of treatment, namely, he got drunk. However, the victim‚Äôs mother believes that this is a falsification, and similar cases have already happened - in this way, commanders, including a certain doctor Maxim, forcibly pull unwanted soldiers out of treatment. Also two days ago, the political officer of the unit with the call sign -Ural- Vasily Lugovoy, in correspondence (screenshots are available to ASTRA) with Olga Arnold, said that her son is not in the basement, but in -a specially equipped bomb shelter, the function of which is to protect soldiers from attacks by drones and enemy artillery.- -Everything in the bomb shelter is equipped for a comfortable stay. No one sleeps on the floor, the ventilated room is warm and dry, water, tea, hot meals are fully provided, as well as medical care. He receives medical care regularly, under the supervision of medical personnel,- Lugovoy said. According to him, there are no basements in the -DPR-. Previously, ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military units 41698 and 42600). According to the editor‚Äôs interlocutors, the commanders set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was there that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured the American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine.

It's time for Europe to take more responsibility for security, - StarmerBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that European countries should be more involved in ensuring the security of the continent, since the United States expects a greater contribution from them. He said this after a meeting of European leaders organized by French President Emmanuel Macron. -We are in a new era, and it is time for us to recognize that we cannot endlessly cling to the comforts of the past. Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security,- Starmer stressed. He noted that Washington does not plan to leave NATO, but the issue of -burden sharing- is becoming more pressing. -President Trump has long said that Europe must do more. We Europeans must take these signals seriously and rise to new challenges,- the Prime Minister said. Starmer confirmed that Great Britain is ready to consider the possibility of sending its military to Ukraine if a peace agreement is concluded, but stressed that without guarantees from the United States such steps will not give the desired result.

‚Ü©Ô∏èüé¨üñº A serviceman with rotting wounds was sent into the assault...	ASTRA: A soldier with rotting wounds was sent into the assault. He disappearedThe wife of military officer Alexander Merzlyak, serving in the 5th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade named after A. Zakharchenko in military unit 41698 in the 1st rifle company of the DPR rifle battalion, appealed to Putin with a demand to punish the command of the unit. According to Sofia, on November 14, 2024, during the assault on Kurakhovo, Alexander received multiple shrapnel wounds. He had to get to the evacuation site on his own, and he was admitted to the hospital only a month later, on December 13, 2024, at Central City Hospital No. 14 in Donetsk. After an X-ray examination, he was given a medical report, but the fragments were not removed. Later he was sent to the reserve battalion in the city of Dokuchaevsk, where he submitted a report to undergo military military training, but received only a verbal response with the requirement to wait. At this time, his condition worsened - the wounds began to rot, shrapnel in his back and legs caused severe pain, he could only move on crutches, and eventually he had to see a surgeon to remove the pus. On January 31, 2025, he and other wounded were transferred from the medical unit to the assault unit and assigned to the 3rd MSB. The last time Alexander got in touch with his family was on February 2, 2025, saying that he was in Avdeevka.Since then, the command has not provided relatives with accurate information about his whereabouts, as well as the reason for the wounded soldier being in the ranks, and not in a medical center or hospital.Now Sofia is asking the highest authorities to sort out the situation with the command of military unit 41698 and provide her husband with full-fledged medical care treatment.Previously, ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military unit 41698 and 42600). According to the editor‚Äôs interlocutors, the commanders set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was there that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured the American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine. There they tortured men who refused to fight, andthen forced them to carry out deadly assaults. ü´® By supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech: PatreonBoosty Crypto BuyMeACoffee Video is too big	https://t.me/astrapress/74653	2025-02-16T12:31:43-08:00

A 15-year-old schoolgirl from Balashikha spent 10 months in a pre-trial detention center because of a firecracker: her relatives claimed that her rights were violated in the pre-trial detention centerA 15-year-old schoolgirl from Balashikha, Alisa (name changed), spent almost a year in a pre-trial detention center on charges of preparing for mass murder and terrorism because of a homemade firecracker. The situation is reported by Lenta. ru.-As Alisa‚Äôs sister said, the girl was detained in November 2023. Before this, she was called to school under the pretext of checking her grades. There, the schoolgirl was met by police officers, who confiscated her phone and conducted an interrogation without her parents or a psychologist.Later, after a search, during which utility knives and a homemade firecracker were found, Alisa was accused of terrorism. The girl's family claims that the firecracker was bought to film a video for social networks and the girl had no intention of using it as a weapon. The investigation, according to Alice's relatives, ignored the results of the examination, which confirmed that the item was not an explosive.The family accuses the authorities of numerous violations of Alice's rights during her arrest and in the pre-trial detention center. The girl did not receive educational materials to continue her studies, as well as the necessary medications. In addition, in May she was beaten by a fellow inmate, but the facts of violence, according to relatives, were ignored by the investigator. Alisa was not allowed visits from her family for several months, which made it difficult to protect her rights.The girl‚Äôs family is determined to fight for her release, arguing that the actions of law enforcement agencies were excessive and violated the rights of the teenager.	https://t.me/astrapress/74605	2025-02-16T02:59:58-08:00
