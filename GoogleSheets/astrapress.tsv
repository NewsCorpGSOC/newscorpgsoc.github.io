Social activists suspect man-made discharges from Norilsk Nickel factories and minesIn Norilsk, water has been leaking onto the road to the airport for more than a month, despite frosts down to -40‚Äì45 degrees. Social activists believe that this is not a natural phenomenon, but a discharge of technical water from Norilsk Nickel factories and mines. They contacted Rosprirodnadzor and the prosecutor's office, stating that at this temperature the water should have frozen, but this does not happen, which may indicate its man-made origin.-The continuous spill of water creates a dangerous situation on the road, the man-made nature of the water can lead to harm to the life and health of citizens, and harm the environment,- says a letter from the public organization -My Home- in Norilsk,- transmits -Siberian Express-. Norilsk Nickel explains the problem by natural processes and terrain features, due to which water flows down to the highway. The company sent equipment to remove the ice and clean the culvert, but the situation has still not been resolved. Chairman of the organization -My Home- in Norilsk Ruslan Abdullaev compared what was happening with the fuel spill in Taimyr in 2020 and believes that the authorities should introduce a state of emergency at least at the local level in order to understand in detail the causes of the leak. In the meantime, according to him, Norilsk Nickel is simply clearing the way, but not solving the problem itself.	https://t.me/astrapress/75937	2025-03-05T21:52:30-08:00

Thus, from December 1, 2024 to January 20, 2025, aircraft from the Russian fleet experienced 11 engine failures. It was previously reported that last year the number of air incidents in the Russian Federation increased by 25%. At least 90% of these were due to system failures, mainly engines and chassis. If the West does not lift sanctions, the situation will worsen this year, experts are sure, interviewed Radio Liberty. Vessels require a thorough inspection - C Check - every 18-24 months, and D Check - every 6-12 years. This cannot be done without direct cooperation with aircraft manufacturers. -I don‚Äôt have exact data on the service life of all Russian aircraft, but 2025 will be the last year of legal operation of most of them,- said a Russian aviation safety expert.Russian airlines are trying to extend the life of aircraft by smuggling certified parts from the US and Europe, as well as resorting to unofficial technical inspections and reducing the frequency of flights. Today, the Russian aircraft fleet consists of about 700 foreign and 150 Sukhoi Superjet. However, sanctions also affect the production of domestic aircraft, since they also depend on Western parts. Even though they can pass C and D Check in the Russian Federation, airlines will still have to resort to finding Western parts for modernization. -Both foreign aircraft and the Superjet will eventually be taken out of service due to parts shortages. Superjet will last only a year longer,- another flight safety expert told the publication.Russia is pinning its hopes on the new domestic MC-21 aircraft, but the Russian Federation does not have a replacement for American engines. If China can supply Russia with reliable engines, the MC-21 may have a future, but not before 2029, experts say. -As a result, China will receive a plane for rogue countries - Iran, North Korea and Russia,- one of the interlocutors concluded.	https://t.me/astrapress/75900	2025-03-05T12:05:34-08:00

If a client accesses the bank‚Äôs electronic services from abroad more than half the time over the course of six months, this may become the basis for requesting data on his tax status. Banks will be required to check with such users information about residency and transfer it to the Federal Tax Service. However, the very fact of using a mobile bank abroad will not automatically confirm a change in tax status - they do not plan to use geolocation data for these purposes. Currently, tax residents of Russia are considered to be those who spend at least 183 days in the country during the year. The loss of this status means that income received in the Russian Federation will be taxed at a rate of 30%, with the exception of remote employees of Russian companies.	https://t.me/astrapress/75865	2025-03-05T04:02:04-08:00

Today I was thinking that if not for February 24, 2022, ASTRA would probably never have appeared. In fact, I would give a lot for February 24th to never happen. But it happened the way it happened. And now we are - from March 5, 2022 to this day, March 5, 2025. We work, therefore we exist. We try to do what we can, but of course this is still not enough. We try to change the world for the better with our work - but, of course, it is not changing that actively. I don't particularly like birthdays lately, but for some reason this three-year publication milestone seems important. First of all, it‚Äôs surprising: we lasted 3 years, seriously? Secondly, this is amazing: there are already more than 260 thousand of you, you really need us. Thirdly, it makes you think: a full-scale war has been going on for 3 years, is everything okay with this world?But despite the fact that the reason for our appearance was not at all joyful, during this time we were able to change something. Something in this world, it seems to me, needs to be improved. Our holiday posts today will also be devoted to these changes. I congratulate every reader who has walked this path with us; without you it would definitely not have happened. Thank you. If you want to congratulate us, first, take care of yourself and your loved ones: rest, hug or confess your love to someone close to you once again; secondly, help those in need, there seem to be so many oppressed people in the world and they require our support. And thirdly, you can please and thank our team (all the ways are here: @astradonate) so that each of them buys a birthday cake today and drinks tea with family or friends. For you, us and this whole world, so that it someday becomes truly peaceful.‚òÆÔ∏è Happy Birthday to -Astra-, its readers and team!	https://t.me/astrapress/75839	2025-03-05T00:17:38-08:00

Vika weighed up to 30 kilograms. I helped her get up, because she was in such a state that she couldn‚Äôt even lift her head from the pillow.

Pocahontas says yes. 2 thousand people die every week. Young Russians, young Ukrainians, not Americans, but I still want it to end. At this time, it turns out that Europe is spending more money on purchasing Russian oil and gas than on supporting Ukraine. And we spent probably 350 billion dollars, and they spent about 100. Wow, the difference, but we are separated from Europe by an ocean, and Europe is next door. Biden allowed to spend more money on this war than Europe.

This is not a series of isolated incidents, but a systematic policy that violates all principles of international law,- said Amnesty International Secretary General Agn√®s Callamard.Human rights activists concluded that Russia is flagrantly violating the Geneva Conventions, which guarantee prisoners of war the right to regular correspondence, access to medical care and visits by representatives of international organizations. At the same time, tens of thousands of Ukrainians are considered -missing under special circumstances.- The organization believes that some of them may have been killed, others are in captivity.	https://t.me/astrapress/75806	2025-03-04T08:52:26-08:00

Linkov said that he returned from the war in Ukraine, and now he is going to the office with a grenade - he will come to the employees, pull out the pin and throw it into their office. He said the reason was that he had received a large water bill. After this, security forces examined the building, but did not find any explosive devices.

üñº State hospitals in Vologda began to refuse women abortions. Th...	Public hospitals in Vologda began to refuse women abortions. They have to travel to neighboring regions A local deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Alexander Morozov, wrote about this. According to him, three residents of the city contacted him after local hospitals refused to provide an abortion. -Having been refused by medical organizations in the Vologda region, women are forced to apply to health care institutions in neighboring regions on a paid basis. For example, for one of the women who contacted me, a trip to the Yaroslavl region for this purpose cost 50,000 rubles,- says the deputy‚Äôs appeal to the prosecutor.According to him, the heads of medical institutions report to the Ministry of Health of the Vologda Region that hospitals -refuse to perform abortions, except in cases of direct medical indications and situations related to the consequences of criminal acts in against women.-According to ASTRA, the heads of medical institutions were -tacitly prohibited- from performing abortions. There are no official orders in this regard. Now doctors have to arrange abortions for medical reasons, two employees told ASTRA on condition of anonymity.Earlier, regional governor Georgy Filimonov called on public hospitals and private clinics not to terminate pregnancies except for medical reasons and after rape. Morozov asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of refusals in clinics.State Duma deputy from the Vologda region Alexey Kanaev told Vedomosti that he also received two appeals from residents of the region who were denied an abortion, one of them in a state clinic.According to Morozov, abortion will not solve the problem with the birth rate. He believes that the state should help future parents with housing, work, medicine, and education. What influences demography most of all is -confidence in the future; it is its absence today that most influences the demographic situation.--Moreover, negative emotions are caused not even by the obstruction of abortion itself, but by the fact that the decision on this is made behind the scenes, without broad consultation with society. There are no fools living in the Vologda region. I believe that the executive branch needs to change its attitude towards making such important decisions for everyone,- he added.	https://t.me/astrapress/75489	2025-02-28T01:33:48-08:00

The bot is not working nowAbout a week ago, security forces came to members of the Eye of God service team, several sources said -Media zones- and journalist Andrey Zakharov.-The entire team of his bot is really being persecuted. -Whoever they can reach,- said one of the sources in the data market. According to the publication, the searches took place as part of a criminal case under Article 272.1 of the Criminal Code (illegal use of personal data obtained unlawfully). It is noted that this is the first known case of using the new article, which appeared at the end of 2024 to combat the trade in personal data and penetration services.Currently, the -Eye of God- does not work. Mediazona‚Äôs source claims that the founder of the service, programmer Evgeny Antipov, is not in Russia. At the same time, he himself stated that this was not true. -They already wrote to me about [the searches] 4 days ago. But we don't have a team. There is only [me], and I have not had any searches. I think they were talking about someone else,- Antipov told Zakharov.On Thursday, Antipov wrote that there would be -small technical changes- in the functionality of the -Eyes of God.-After the adoption of the new law, according to Zakharov, several breakout bots were closed, and one took all its employees out of Russia. The -Eye of God- limited the release of data. -And this is somewhat paradoxical: Antipov officially collaborated with the security forces and gave them unlimited access to his service. In 2023, researchers from universities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Penitentiary Service published the results of a study among current employees of their departments. The survey was conducted in several regions and showed that, for example, 41 out of 50 police officers used the -Eye of God- in their work, the rest simply knew what it was. The bot was convenient: there is no information from banks and marketplaces in government databases; you can get it upon request, which takes time. And here you have everything in one certificate, from the loudest leaks - and even with links to social networks. But what was convenient for the operas was clearly not liked by someone in other departments - for example, in the FSB or some Security Council,- the journalist notes.	https://t.me/astrapress/75488	2025-02-28T00:51:09-08:00

This was reported by the department's press service.&nbsp;The incident occurred in February 2024. The girl refused to marry by consent, after which her parents, belonging to the Yazidi community, allegedly beat her and forcibly took her to the groom's house, where she was deprived of freedom, the opportunity to study and communicate with relatives and friends.&nbsp;The marriage was concluded only according to tradition, but not in the registry office.Girl's friends toldE1 that she was under constant control in her husband's house, she was forbidden to continue her studies, her phone was monitored and she was forbidden to leave the house. Five years ago, the groom's family already a tragedy occurred: the man's younger sister committed suicide at the age of 16 when they tried to marry her off to a 50-year-old man.&nbsp;The girl's relatives claim that she was happy in her marriage, calling the accusations -slander.- The head of the public organization -Yazidis of the Urals,- Georgy Asoev, said that the couple lives in peace and harmony, and called the complaints -nonsense.- He emphasized that in the 21st century, forced marriage is impossible, and called not to interfere in family affairs.&nbsp;Nurzida Bensgier, director of the Interethnic Information Center in Yekaterinburg, also commented on the situation. She noted that in diasporas outside their country, the desire to preserve national identity, faith and traditions is especially pronounced, especially in matters of marriage and funerals.&nbsp;According to a study by the human rights organization Ad Rem published in 2024, 4,453 marriages involving underage girls were registered in the country in 2021 alone. However, official statistics do not reflect the real scale of the problem, since many such unions are not officially registered.Yazidis are an ethno-confessional group of Kurds living mainly in northwestern Iraq, northern and northeastern Syria. In Russia, according to the 2010 census, there are more than 40 thousand of them.	https://t.me/astrapress/75421	2025-02-27T01:51:34-08:00
