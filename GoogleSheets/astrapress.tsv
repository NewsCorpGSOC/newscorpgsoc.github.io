The girl could not be saved - Samira died in the hospital in May.It was a high-profile story in Ingushetia - then the authorities reported that the child was beaten by her mother and grandmother, but people immediately started talking about rape. Soon the suspect, 45-year-old Bashir Vedzizhev, was detained. He is the father of six children with an expunged criminal record for drug trafficking. Vedzizhev spent several months in a pre-trial detention center, but was released in February of this year. After that, he recorded a video in which he swore on the Koran that he did not rape Samira. Since then, there has been no news about Vedzizhev’s whereabouts or his procedural status. Now Vedzizhev has gone to war in Ukraine, writes the publication NeMoskva Speaks, citing a source in the security forces of Ingushetia. Vedzizhev, in the words of the source, went to war on a -voluntary-compulsory basis.-To confirm the information, journalists published a video in which a man similar to Vedzizhev in camouflage and a cap with the flag of Ingushetia says-We’re sitting we get high, relax, go to war. &lt;…&gt; We will conquer Ukraine.- ☮️ Subscribe to ASTRA.

In St. Petersburg, an accused of contract murder went to war instead of trialSt. -The St. Petersburg City Court suspended the criminal case of Alexander Sukharev - the judges accepted his petition to be sent to war. -This petition is motivated by the fact that the defendant entered into a contract for military service during the period of mobilization in the RF Armed Forces. He was found fit and accepted for military service under a contract,- reported the joint press service of the courts of St. Petersburg. The court also canceled Sukharev's detention in a pre-trial detention center and released him.Sukharev is accused of contract killing of the Monolit construction company Viktor Aliyev on June 5, 2023. According to investigators, early that day at the construction site, he shot Aliyev in the head, neck and torso at least 7 times with a pistol (on video). Aliyev died on the spot. Sukharev is an experienced criminal. In the 2000s, he was a member of the -Kingisepp- group, wrote 47 News. In 2007, a jury found him not guilty in the case of a series of contract killings of this organized crime group. True, on the eve of this decision, two of the jurors simply did not come to the meeting, because of this the panel had to be dissolved and re-recruited. In 2016, Sukharev was detained on suspicion of a series of robberies against jewelry stores. Then he was released on bail. In this case, already during the trial of the murder of Aliyev, the killer Sukharev was sentenced to 12 years in prison.	https://t.me/astrapress/68775	2024-11-18T07:36:24-08:00

At first, the entire team worked completely for free, simply because the opportunity to tell the truth, do what you love and not depend on anyone is more valuable than any money. Later you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations,&nbsp; throw links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without reporting it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name. This will help minimize risks and feel calmer.All donations sent from November 12th will be used to collect salaries.

Gazprom stopped supplying gas to Austria The supply of gas to the Austrian energy company OMV from Russia stopped on the morning of November 16, saidAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. The reason for this was the conflict over interrupted supplies in 2022. Austria received Russian gas through the Nord Stream gas pipeline, but in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, supply disruptions arose. Gazprom explained this by technical difficulties, in response, the Head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that -Russia is trying to blackmail Austria by stopping gas supplies.- Nehammer said the day before that the country -will not allow itself to be blackmailed.-Earlier, OMV filed a lawsuit against Gazprom and won more than €243 million in damages. OMV decided to deduct this money from the payment for the existing contract. The company claims that it will replace Russian supplies with supplies from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as from other suppliers. According to DW, the Austrian corporation could deliberately come into conflict with the Russian one in order to break the contract valid until 2040, obliging it to purchase significant volumes of gas.	https://t.me/astrapress/68614	2024-11-16T08:55:17-08:00

He asked for anonymity, but confirmed his words with documents (he himself has category -G-) and told the editors what preceded the escape of the military from military unit 57849 to Kochenevo. According to the editorial interlocutor, in the barracks of the military unit at the time the riot began there were -110-120 people, approximately no less than 100.- He himself ended up in barracks 57849 from unit 98551 in Abakan with another 45 people. -There were probably 8-10 people ready to go beyond the tape [that is, to the so-called -NWO- zone]. All the rest are sick, on crutches, inactive.- They were brought there on the night of November 8th. In the morning, sick military personnel began to write reports to the commander about the provision of medical care and military medical assistance, but these reports never went anywhere. -There was a guy [in barracks 57849], half a foot was missing on both legs. His military unit, I don’t know which one, fired him and gave him a commission. He was somehow pushed into this Kochanevskaya unit. And he was there for a month,- says ASTRA’s interlocutor. He retells the words representative of the commandant's office: -You are not being transferred here. Everyone is sent here. Bedridden, on stretchers, blind. Nobody cares what condition you are in.- According to the military man, he and his colleagues repeatedly asked for a doctor’s help: -We already realized that we couldn’t pass the Military Military Commissions, because everyone there was screaming, that you are all going to the 'SVO' zone.-For several days they asked the commandant of the Novosibirsk garrison and a representative of the military prosecutor's office to arrive. Due to inaction and refusal to even provide medical care, the military began a riot. According to the latest data, all participants in the escape from the military unit in Kochenevo on November 13 were detained, the Investigative Committee reported this evening. The editor's interlocutor especially noted one of the wounded - this is 36-lieutenant Alexander Andreev. An ASTRA source claims that Andreev lost the ability to speak after being wounded. -Lieutenant Andreev hears, but he is mute and communicates only using the telephone. He writes in notes and lets them read. You understand, he needs to learn sign language and he needs a phone now. And in this military unit, the phone is taken away - from 8 am to 8 pm. And people need help. He has one [right] hand only that works. Personally, I cut his nails. The situation is such that he constantly needs help - to open a jar, pour coffee. It might fall. Personally, I have been constantly with him since the 8th. Because of the wound, his head hurts and his eyes are watering - it feels like he has a constant fever.- Before unit 57849, Andreev was treated in neurology at the Abakan Clinical Hospital, where he was given category -G- (temporarily unfit).

As ASTRA sources in the region’s emergency services told us, it fell a few hundred meters from the village of Novostroevka-Pervaya in the Grayvoronsky urban district. There were no casualties. Another crater, presumably from the FAB, was found near the village of Sheino, Korochansky district. She was found 3 kilometers from residential buildings.November 12 ASTRA reported about the fall of a half-ton FAB bomb near a residential building in the occupied city of Almaznaya in Lugansk region November 10. As a result, about 50 people were evacuated. The resident's home suffered damage to her garage and car. Before this, it became known that on October 28, a Russian plane dropped a bomb on a village 6 km from Belgorod. Thus, the ASTRA editors became aware of at least 148 cases of FAB aerial bombs falling in Russia and Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine in 2024. FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the shells are destroyed by explosives experts after the fact. Such adjustable air bombs The Russian Armed Forces use for attacks, in particular, on Donetsk and Kharkov regions - as well as city Kharkov.🫨 Supporting ASTRA, you contribute to freedom of speech:PatreonBoostyCrypto BuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/68455	2024-11-14T04:30:52-08:00
