Barlet spent about a week here - he was fed dry rations, he went to the toilet in a bottle, and during the day the officers took him to work. After a week in the basement, he was handed over to representatives of a certain 116th unit, about which he knows nothing. On the way, these people told him that he was being taken to sign a contract, but the young man asked to stop at his parents’ house to pick up his things.

By that time, the young man had already begun to notice the special attitude of his northern neighbors towards Ukrainians: -Dad didn’t understand why I didn’t support Russian clubs in Eurocups. And I didn’t understand why he supported.- In his first large and detailed interview with a Russian publication, Karyakin - now known under the call sign -Skhidny- - spoke about how 10 years ago his hometown was overwhelmed by the Russian military and propaganda, and he delved into the history of Ukraine and became partisan.Years later, Karjakin is now himself collecting intelligence from the Ukrainians remaining under Russian occupation.

🖼 Crimea may be poisoned by fuel oil as early as New Year’s Eve ...	Crimea may be poisoned by fuel oil as early as New Year’s Eve - scientist about eco-disaster in the Black SeaGeorgy&nbsp;Kavanosyan&nbsp;is a hydrogeologist who has been working on environmental problems for 10 years. Since the beginning of the environmental disaster in the Black Sea, he, together with a group of scientists led by Doctor of Science Sergei Zatsepa working to improve a computer model that can predict the consequences of fuel oil pollution in Cherny sea.&nbsp;-Based on this model, we can roughly predict where the pollution will go several days in advance. We predicted the previous behavior of the pollution spot quite accurately. Over the past few days, a very strong northeast wind blew with gusts of more than 20-25 meters per second, and the pollution went southwest along the southern coast of Crimea. If the wind suddenly changes to the southeast, then Alushta, Feodosia, Sudak and Yalta itself will be poisoned by fuel oil on New Year’s Eve,- says the scientist.&nbsp;At the same time, Kavanosyan looks at the long term relatively optimistic about the current situation:&nbsp;-We are very lucky - if such a word can be used in relation to an environmental disaster. At the moment, the migration of the main commercial fish species has already taken place. Marine mammals also left with them. We have three species of dolphins in the Black Sea, all of them are listed in the Red Book. We are on the shore foundprobably more than 10, but less than 20 dead dolphins, but 95% of them did not die from fuel oil. They died earlier, but they were washed ashore along with the fuel oil. There are practically no cases in the literature of dolphins dying from hydrocarbons. It’s just that such populations get sick more often.-&nbsp;The same -luck-, according to the ecologist, can be called the situation with birds. Today we can assume that the number of birds caught in the area of ​​pollution is approximately 2000. If a westerly wind had blown, the fuel oil stain could have reached the Taman Bay, where the Tamano-Zaporozhye Nature Reserve is located.&nbsp;- There are 500-600 thousand birds there at this time of year. A bunch of swans. It would have been a catastrophe of a completely different nature. Everything listed in the Red Book, everything rare, everything that is valuable, it is located 50 meters from the shore. The fuel oil did not reach there,- says Kavanosyan.&nbsp;According to the scientist, in the area of ​​the southern ecosystem, where many oil-processing bacteria live, the sea will be able to cleanse itself naturally in 5-6 years.&nbsp;-I see, of course, pickled benthos. There's a lot of it. Rapana, shells, and crabs cannot escape anywhere. -Everyone who lives on two will not run away,- the scientist sums up.&nbsp;The main attention is now directed precisely to scientific developments, because in essence the methods for eliminating such a catastrophe and the capacities necessary for this no neither in Kuban, nor in neighboring regions, nor in the country as a whole.-The most important work is happening today in the scientific community. The fuel oil is stratified. The hard part fell to the bottom. The lung washed ashore. It contains more than 50% volatile hydrocarbons. That is why you should never remove fuel oil without a mask. And scientists - my native Moscow State University, Gain, Skoltech - are working to obtain suitable sorbents that would not harm the environment,- says Kavanosyan.&nbsp;At the same time, he notes also problems with the system itself. In principle, there are no protocols for eliminating such disasters, and management is always several days late. So, if not for the delay at the beginning of the tragedy, the fuel oil would not have gone deep into the sand. About what we are talking about federal level of emergency was clear to many in advance, but at the regional level the authorities were simply powerless to make a decision on recognizing the disaster as a -federal emergency.- In this regard, Kavanosyan separately emphasizes the importance of civil society:&nbsp;-That is, we are trying as a civil society to influence the situation, because the regional authorities have no experience in eliminating such disasters. And some representatives of civil society have. For example, this is the fourth such accident in my practice. And practically everything here is taken out by volunteers.-	https://t.me/astrapress/71433	2024-12-30T03:43:01-08:00

The commander ordered the military man to shoot at the legs of his fellow soldiers so that they would continue to carry out the combat mission, and personally set up minefields for them. The subordinate refused to do this and ended up in prison in Zaitsevo A contract worker from Naro-Fominsk ended up in illegal basement for -refuseniks- in Zaitsevo in -LPR- togetherwith three colleagues. The reason is to contact the prosecutor's office about the illegal actions of the commanders. Now they themselves are under threat of criminal charges for -failure to comply with orders.- Wife of a serviceman from Naro-Fominsk Dmitry [name changed - approx. ASTRA], who serves in military unit 91701 423 motorized rifle regiment of the 4th Guards Tank Division, told ASTRA that the commander of the assault detachment with the call sign -Luna- set up minefields for those who wanted to return from a combat mission. On September 12, -Luna- sent Anna’s husband to storm Stelmakhovka in the -LPR.- When he set out on a mission, he found three colleagues in the trench with shrapnel wounds and reported this to Luna. He, according to Dmitry, told him: -Let them go out as they want and without electronic warfare cover.- A day later, -Luna- himself appeared at the position. He stated that many soldiers were retreating and that Dmitry needed to open fire on them. He refused.-Then on the legs, and let them crawl out of here wounded,- -Luna- answered him. Dmitry also did not fulfill this order. Another day later, -Luna- informed all groups that were carrying out the combat mission that he personally installed a tripwire and -mined the retreat passage, even for the wounded.-On September 17, Dmitry returned to the landing , where his colleagues were beaten by the senior group with the call sign -Kizlyar-. He sent the two of them to a concrete pillbox in the middle of a field, buried in the ground to a depth of 4 meters, where a gas pipe runs. At that time, 8 military men were already sitting there. Two days later, a mortar fired in this area, but even after that the military was not released from the basement. Dmitry stayed there for 5 days. All this time, the prisoners slept on bare concrete and went to the toilet in bottles. September 22 Dmitry and junior lieutenant Alexey [name changed - approx. ASTRA] were released from the basement. They - two officers - and two privates were lined up and a report was read out about their failure to comply with orders in the presence of an -interrogator- with the call sign -Bely-. After this, they were asked if they were ready to go on the mission. They answered: -Yes.- After being in the basement, the man spent 5 days in the medical unit, while at the same time digging a dugout for the commanders, where they decided to equip themselves with a -gym.- Then he and his colleagues were sent to an illegal basement in Zaitsevo, and from there they were assigned to another military unit. On October 7, Dmitry informed the prosecutor of Starobelsk that he wanted to testify against Luna and Kizlyar, adding that he feared for his life and health. -It later turned out that the political officer of the assault detachment -Lednik- -- former judge and prosecutor n.p. Starobelsk are classmates, and my husband began to worry that this case would not be allowed to proceed and they would try to hush everything up,- says Anna. A month later, on November 7, the assistant prosecutor summoned Dmitry and his three colleagues for questioning. Afterwards they stopped communicating with their loved ones. Anna learned that her husband was being held in Zaitsevo from a military man who came out of this basement and saw her husband there. At the military unit, the woman is told that her husband is there for -failure to follow orders.- -My husband served his Motherland faithfully and honestly, he has 2 awards -For Courage- and a Zhukov medal, he did not do anything illegal, he only refused to carry out a criminal order and did not keep silent about it, he wanted to achieve justice, but instead he was handcuffed and taken to an unofficial prison,- says Anna’s numerous appeals to the departments. So far, she has only received a response from the RF Ministry of Defense - that no one sent the wounded on missions, evacuation was carried out, and her husband was called in for questioning as a witness regarding the alleged extortions from the officer - Alexei - who was sitting together with him in a concrete pit.Previously, ASTRA found evidence the existence of 20 places for holding and torturing military personnelin the occupied territories (some of them are no longer work).	https://t.me/astrapress/71417	2024-12-29T23:11:32-08:00

In response to this, Abaturov says that in 2022 he did not have his own home Internet, so he used public WiFi networks.Abaturov also replied that the similarity in the texts of Korobkova’s denunciations and his materials, as stated by Daniil Skorinkin, could be achieved by artificial intelligence. Previously, Ivan Abaturov was already involved in a scandal related to denunciations. In August 2022, the director of the Nestor-History publishing house, Sergei Erlikh, said that the police came to the office following a complaint from Abaturov, who accused their book about the Holocaust in Romania of disseminating -false information- about the actions of the USSR in World War II.It is also known that Abaturov is a historian by training. In 2021 he appealed to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office with a proposal to cancel the decision to rehabilitate Mineki. However, the military prosecutor's office said that Mineki is certainly a victim of political repression. Two years ago, Alexandra Arkhipova learned that a denunciation had been filed against her from a certain -Anna Korobkova.- The denunciation was sent to the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration under the President (RANEPA), where Arkhipova worked for many years. Since then, -Anna Korobkova- has sent dozens of denunciations and given numerous interviews, posing as a serial informer.	https://t.me/astrapress/71397	2024-12-29T09:51:29-08:00

A murderer pardoned by Putin, who fought in the Wagner PMC, kidnapped and tried to rape a resident of the Oryol region Criminal case of kidnapping (126 of the Criminal Code RF) was initiated in December against a previously convicted former fighter of the Wagner PMC, pardoned by Putin after participating in the war, 48-year-old Alexei Khokhlova, ASTRA found out. The common-law husband of the injured woman wrote a statement regarding the former fighter. Initially, the victim claimed that Khokhlov raped her, but investigators ultimately found no evidence of this and opened a case only for kidnapping. As Olga (name changed) said, a former serviceman beat her in one of the villages of the Maloarkhangelsk region back in August of this year. He then forcibly brought her to his house, where he abused her and held her all night, threatening to kill her. As ASTRA found out, Alexey Khokhlov was previously convicted of theft and murder. In 2022, the killer was recruited to the war with Ukraine as part of the Wagner PMC, and then Khokhlov was pardoned by Putin and returned to the village, where he attacked a local resident.This is already the 7th crime in December, committed by previously convicted former or current Russian military personnel, which became known to ASTRA. So, we told how in December a previously convicted serviceman who returned from the war killed an acquaintance in the Pskov region by beating him to death with a hammer. To hide traces of the murder, he set the body and house on fire. In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, a drunken serviceman who returned from the war beat up a traffic police officer after he stopped him while driving drunk. In the Kemerovo region, a previously convicted serviceman returned from the war and killed an acquaintance in front of children, and a shooter from Kursk robbed a construction site shop in Arkhangelsk. Previously convicted military man from Ryazani harassed a woman and her daughter on a train while he was going on vacation.

In occupied Lugansk, unknown persons kidnapped a volunteer - a citizen of SerbiaWe are talking about 39-year-old volunteer Dragomir Topalović. He came to Russia this year and often visited occupied Lugansk, was engaged in volunteer activities, and wrote a telegram channel -Secrets of the Lugansk Republic.- In mid-December, Topalović contacted his relatives from Serbia, but spoke to them from the basement and asked for help in his release, stating that he was being forcibly held and wanted to be sent to war. After this conversation he never contacted me again. It is known that Topalovic has been suffering from hepatitis for a long time. Later, the telegram channel -Secrets of the Lugansk Republic- deleted the news about his abduction. ASTRA tried to contact the channel administrators to find out the reasons for the deletion, but received no response. On the news drewthe attention of the Z-channel -Shakespeare-: -What, guys, are just another -puzzis-, huh? Such as in the case of my friend Russell Bentley (call sign -Texas-), who was simply taken and killed. This is much worse than crests, guys. Because scum are scolded publicly, in front of all the people. And that means, sooner or later, all this will end up in the rear. Once again: this is exactly how the Mexican cartels turned out. By the way, what about the Ernest and Goodwin case? I don’t hear an answer.-Previously ASTRA reported about how servicemen of the DPR long-range reconnaissance regiment Dmitry Lysakovsky with the call sign -Goodwin- and Sergei Gritsai with the call sign -Ernest- was thrown into a deadly assault after conflicts with commander Igor Puzik (-Evil-), where they died. In their dying video, the military advised -never serve anyone- in the Russian army and spoke about the -crimes of the leadership,- as well as how commanders -lie every day.-Also ASTRA published an investigation into the torture of Russian military personnel by the commanders of the 5th and 110th brigades (military units 41698 and 42600). According to the editor’s interlocutors, the commanders of the 5th brigade set up a real -concentration camp- on the territory of the abandoned Petrovskaya mine in Donetsk. It was in the Petrovskaya mine that before his death, soldiers from the 5th brigade tortured an American -military correspondent- Russell Bentley. ASTRA published the first and only video from the premises of this mine. Ibid tortured men who refused to fight, andthen forced them to carry out deadly assaults. In mid-December, Vladimir Putin noted -mass heroism and courage- in the 5th brigade of the -DPR- and awarded the brigade an -honorary name.- By his decree, the 5th separate motorized rifle brigade named after Zakharchenko is now called -Guards-. Previously Putin posthumously gave Hero of Russia to the organizer of torture in this brigade.🌱 Even the most minimal but regular donations from readers are important to continue ASTRA’s work : Patreon Boosty CryptoBuyMeACoffee	https://t.me/astrapress/71351	2024-12-28T13:45:16-08:00

Arseny Turbin is not a criminal. I demand immediate release from places of detention!- the poster says. Gilin was not detained. Arseniy Turbin from the Oryol region in June of this year was sentenced to 5 years in prison. According to investigators, he allegedly submitted a form to the Russian Freedom Legion, and then, on instructions from a representative of this organization, distributed leaflets criticizing Putin in mailboxes. Arseny insisted that he did not join the legion, but laid out leaflets out of personal convictions. In October, Turbin in a letter from the pre-trial detention center reported that he was being beaten: -This evening after 18:00 he punched me in the head on the bed twice. The situation is very difficult and critical. Azizbek beat me and said that I would get kicked at night (only with obscenities). The night will be very difficult. But I will hold on.- Later the cellmate was resettled. Schoolboy also sent to a punishment cell for seven days - for talking with cellmates after lights out.

They began to pay him less and every other time, and for trying to find out the reason or at least transfer to another place, Berlyakov, according to him, was sent to the assault detachment along with the fighters of the -Storm Z- unit. From there, the serviceman deserted a few months later to get to the military registration and enlistment office in Saratov and find out what was happening. It turned out that the Saratov resident was listed with the 6th Cossack Regiment as mobilized from the -LPR- and was wanted for desertion. -Who mobilized me here? -By order of the Beekeeper.- I say: -Who is the Beekeeper?- They say: -The head of the -LPR-. What difference does it make to me who the head of the -LPR- is, I am registered and live in the Saratov region, I am registered with the military registration and enlistment office, I have permanent registration, where my child is located. I am a single father. They couldn’t mobilize me there. I came here voluntarily,- Berlyakov is indignant.At the same time, Russian military commissars, police and operatives The FSB constantly emphasized in a conversation with Berlyakov their inability to influence the situation: the command of the 6th Cossack regiment simply ignored all their requests. The serviceman tried to take the requests to the command of the 6th regiment himself. Because of this, he, according to him, ended up in jail several times. pit, they threatened to kill him several times, he was sent to the front line several times, and once without weapons and uniform The last time. Berlyakov appeared at the location of the Cossack regiment, he was already being led to be shot, but the execution did not happen: he was stopped by FSB officers, whom Berlyakov had encountered earlier: -I’m sitting and thinking, damn, I wonder if the bullet hurts in the head or not. As a result, the voice is familiar, but I can’t figure out who it is. [...] He tells me his call sign. I understand that this is that [familiar] FSB officer. [...] I’m safe.--Through the personal account of a serviceman, which everyone has, according to the badge number that I have, I found out that the salary I am credited only to some unknown bank. [...] There are many such children who are supposedly in captivity of crests, but in fact the sixth Cossack army keeps them in basements and receives money for them,- says the Saratovite. Now Vladislav Berlyakov is preparing to go to the capital, because -he is tired of writing to Moscow.- He has neither a salary nor the opportunity to get a job: according to documents, he is still a wanted deserter.-I tell [the FSB officers who saved him. - Approx. ed.]: -Can I get a job?- They say: -You can’t get a job. You are a military man. You are purely a military man. Not a single security service will let you through. Even right away, they can even quietly call the police, the commandant’s office or something else from you...- I say: - I won’t go stealing. I don’t have any salary! I’ve been in captivity for so long! I can’t get a job. I have a child on my hands. they took it away from me because I don’t provide a certificate from anywhere. I can’t take a certificate that I am in service,- Berlyakov sums up his conversation with the FSB officers, who, according to him, saved him from execution at 6:00. m Cossack regiment.Berlyakov’s video message appeared in the Z-channel -Soldatskaya Pravda-.
