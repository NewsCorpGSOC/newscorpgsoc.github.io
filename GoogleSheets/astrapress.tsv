Navalny's FBK released investigation, according to which Leonid Nevzlin, a close associate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and former top manager of YUKOS, is the organizer of a series of attacks on Russian oppositionists abroad. Andrei Matus, who until recently worked for the structures of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, told FBK about this. It is alleged that Leonid Nevzlin instructed Matus to clean up the electronic traces of the attack on Volkov. He was entrusted with taking away the phones of the perpetrators of the attack, but instead of getting rid of them, he leaked data from the FBK devices (and, apparently, the propaganda TV channel Russia Today, where a week earlier the same correspondence that FBK talks about was published).Matus provided Navalny‚Äôs team with videos filmed in the first person by participants in the attacks on Zhdanov in Geneva and Mironov‚Äôs wife in Argentina, as well as correspondence in which a person recorded as Nevzlin discusses the attack on Volkov with the perpetrator. That the correspondence was real for FBK was confirmed by investigative journalists - Mikhail Maglov from the Proekt publication and Hristo Grozev, who investigated Navalny‚Äôs poisoning. According to FBK, Nevzlin is allegedly behind the attack on Navalny's associates Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, as well as attack on economist Maxim Mironov and his wife in Buenos Aires. FBK interlocutor Andrei Matus also stated that it was allegedly planned to beat Leonid Volkov -to the point of disability- or kidnap him, take him to Russia by sea and hand him over to the FSB. Perhaps the most convincing evidence that Matus showed to FBK is an audio recording in which a man with a voice similar to Nevzlin says, among other things, that he is dissatisfied with the fact that Maxim Mironov‚Äôs wife was not beaten enough. >-We call on everyone who cooperates in any capacity with the structures of Mikhail Khodorkovsky to stop doing so until the circumstances and the degree of his personal involvement and awareness of the crimes of [Leonid Nevzlin] are clarified.- , - said the FBK.	https://t.me/astrapress/64177	2024-09-12T06:45:37-07:00

Two students in Moscow were sentenced to 5 and 5.5 years because children on the street allegedly noticed them naked in the window On September 8, the Lefortovo District Court of Moscow sentenced Timur A. and Daniil R. to 5 and 5.5 years in a maximum security colony, reports MSK1.ru.

This was allegedly seen by children playing on the playground. One of the boys told his mother about what happened, and she contacted the police. According to another versions one of the students came to visit another to take a shower, because his hot water was turned off. As MK writes, an investigative experiment, which was carried out only almost a year after the arrest at the request of students, showed: from the playground it is impossible to see what is happening in the window of the 2nd floor of a house that is not even located opposite the playing area, but to the side. But after that the guys were not released. Timur and Daniil did not admit guilt. Some parents of the victims spoke out in their defense.	https://t.me/astrapress/64151	2024-09-12T00:31:05-07:00

At the same time, the United States is hinting at the same decisionAs the publication writes, citing sources in the British government, the decision to allow strikes deep into Russia by British missiles has already been made, but there are no plans to publicly announce it yet. The Guardian also writes that today in Kyiv, at a meeting between British Foreign Secretary David Lemmy, Ukrainian President Zelensky and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the latter made -his boldest hint yet- on that the White House also plans to lift the restriction for Ukraine on the use of long-range missiles on Russian territory. It is noted that the meeting between Lammy, Zelensky and Blinken allegedly would not have taken place at all -if a positive decision had not already been made on Storm Shadow.- A day earlier, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov, in a conversation with reporters, said that -it can be assumed with a high degree of probability- that the United States has already lifted restrictions for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for strikes deep into Russia. At a meeting in Kyiv, Blinken promised to convey to Joe Biden Ukraine's wishes regarding the use of American long-range missiles to strike deep into Russia. Blinken also hinted that supplies of Iranian missilesto Russia, about which became known last week - and became the reason for a change in the strategic vector of Great Britain and the United States. -The escalator here is Putin. -Putin aggravated the situation with the supply of missiles from Iran,- he said.TelegramASTRAA photograph of a ship that allegedly delivered ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia has been published.

Apti Alaudinov stood up for those who started the fight, hinting that the injured girls were themselves to blame - they called the Chechens -Tiktokers.-On the evening of September 3, near a cafe in Anapa, a fight broke out between several Chechens and young people of Slavic appearance, who were in company with girls. Russian public pages stated that the Chechens tried to meet the girls, despite the fact that they were already busy, and in response to the refusal, the Caucasians beat the women and their companions. As a result, a criminal case was opened for hooliganism (Part 2 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), Zelimkhan Zaurbekov and another person who started the fight, whose name was not named, were detained, the Investigative Committee reported. The commander of the Chechen special forces -Akhmat- Apti Alaudinov spoke out in defense of the Chechens, recording a 20-minute video. According to him, the Chechens were detained because of their nationality, and the fight in Anapa was provoked by the girl herself, since she -rudely refused to meet the Chechens.- He also claims that Russian communities have appeared in Russia that supervise the Russian special services to allegedly stir up the situation.The answer to Alaudinov was given by one of the Russian officers, Ivan Otrakovsky, who recorded a 12-minute video. On it, Otrakovsky says that -the law should work for everyone, which does not exist under the current system,- and Chechens use double standards, since they allow themselves to meet girls of other nationalities, but prohibit young people from other republics from doing this when they want to meet with Chechen women.

Previously, that Matkheev is going to war as a cook reported the human rights project -First Department- with reference to Matheev‚Äôs letter to volunteers. -Tomorrow I will be taken to the Northern Military District to serve as a cook, and then, from there, home to my relatives, to my mother, to my cats, to my sister,- Matkheev wrote in a letter from the pre-trial detention center. -It‚Äôs hard to communicate with Alexander. He speaks in fragments. You have to think of complete answers for him and ask again. After which he agrees with my version of the answer. So it‚Äôs not clear where is his answer, and where is my version of his answer,- lawyer Astakhov explained in a conversation with ASTRA.Matheev‚Äôs diagnosis means that he has development at the level of a child. As ASTRA previously wrote - Matkheev was arrested as a result of a possible provocation by the FSB. He spent a long time communicating on the Internet with strangers, with whom he discussed serving as part of the -Freedom of Russia- Legion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. FSB operatives detained Matkheev at a train station in the Kemerovo region - from there, at the suggestion of an anonymous interlocutor in a telegram, he wanted to use money from his credit card to travel to Kazakhstan in order to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine through the Ukrainian Embassy there. Mattheev was given 10 years in prison in April 2024. Certificates about his diagnosis were not considered at the trial. And after the verdict, lawyer Astakhov found out that in exchange for confessions, FSB officers promised to send the guy to war. Matheev has a limited and peculiar understanding of politics. He is passionate about military uniforms and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgoing to the front - but on which side to serve, he doesn‚Äôt care.-I understand that he thinks , that he was accused under the -Ukrainian article,- so -the military may not take him.- I confirmed more categorically thatsince he was convicted under Article 275 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation [treason], the contract with him cannot be signed. Tears welled up in his eyes and he was ready to burst into tears, but he restrained himself, especially since I tried to calm him down. As I understand it, this is his usual behavior - to cry in any difficult situation,- lawyer Astakhov told ASTRA. According to the lawyer, Matkheev wrote at least one statement to the Ministry of Defense. Whether he received an answer and, if so, what it was, is not known for certain. The main thing that the defender managed to find out is that Matkheev did not sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense. Sasha Matkheev was convicted under three articles of the Criminal Code - treason, propaganda of terrorism and participation in a terrorist organization - the Ukrainian Legion -Freedom of Russia- is recognized in Russia.	https://t.me/astrapress/63919	2024-09-09T09:01:23-07:00

After that, Kozlov began kicking Daria and jumping on her stomach, shouting that she was unworthy to be the mother of his child, then stepped on her neck and began to squeeze. Daria's body, according to experts, was -one continuous bruise.- The victim was found to have a traumatic brain injury, a broken nose, a brain contusion, a liver rupture, and a closed abdominal injury. In total, Kozlov inflicted 138 different injuries on the girl. Kozlov partially admitted his guilt during the investigation.

Since 2022 Lvova-Belova has been engaged in the export of Ukrainian orphans to Russia - for this the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the official (in the same case the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin). Malofeev and Lvova-Belova have 12 children from their previous marriages (Lvova-Belova has 5 native and 5 adopted children). Malofeev's divorce from his ex-wife became known in 2023.

ASTRA publishes the names and stories of the soldiers who disappeared under the command of the hero of Russia - Tiger-Ksenofontov. Their relatives contacted the editorial office after the broadcast of the propagandist Solovyov, in which he tried to whitewash Tiger and accused the wife of the deceased of working for the CIPSO - Terekhov Evgeny Pavlovich. According to a fellow soldier, he died on his first combat mission. Of the two hundred people who were sent there, seven survived. All the rest died on the first day of the combat mission. They were in Sinkovka, in the forest belt. Until May 5, the military unit hid the losses and brazenly lied. Later I wrote to another fellow soldier, he said the same thing. That almost everyone was killed. They sent 7 people at a time. They kill them - the next 7 are sent. And so on until everyone is gone. Except for the 300 who managed to be sent to the hospital. As far as I understand, there is no evacuation in Sinkovka. I would very much like to look into the eyes of those commanders who hid the losses for so long. For what ‚Äî for orders? For medals? You can‚Äôt bring people back. I would at least like to understand ‚Äî who will answer for all this? ‚Äî his wife said. Mikhail Ivanovich Gorshkov. He was under the command of Tiger and, as far as I know, also fell under his ‚Äî DRUNK ORDER ‚Äî his relatives reported. Mobilized Pavel Vorobyov [name changed at the request of relatives]. When my husband saw what was happening in Sinkovka, he refused to go. His colleague ‚Äî Orlu ‚Äî reported on the radio that he was a refuser. Orlu‚Äôs order ‚Äî to tie him to a tree in handcuffs and beat him until he agreed. Because he could not stand the pain, he agreed. When they ‚Äî 8 people ‚Äî were entering the base, a drone, Baba Yaga, immediately flew at them, his wife said. Valery Valerievich Golovachev. On the night of March 12, Baba Yaga dropped a shell on his dugout, the dugout collapsed, he and his comrade were seriously injured. His legs were broken. He immediately started calling for help on the radio, shouting that they were both seriously injured. The dugout was covered with earth. He shouted: -Help!-. On March 13, a miner group passed by. They dug him out, gave him first aid, carried him to another dugout, and left him water. The second comrade, Maloy, died from his wounds. All this time he was in that dugout and waiting for the evacuation group. On March 16, he asked for water and medicine, they dropped a package to him from the bird, but because of the wind they said that it flew a little further than the dugout. He started crawling towards the package. But somehow an enemy bird appeared nearby and dropped a shell on him again. My husband never contacted me by radio again. I am still looking for him. I am writing to all the authorities, but the answer is the same: that he is a BP, his wife reported. Denis Gennadievich Zhukov. He died on December 3, 2023. He blew himself up to avoid being captured, having been left with three comrades in a position without ammunition. Daniil Aleksandrovich Tretyakov. He last contacted me on January 21. On February 4, a colleague called and said that my brother had died. On March 22, they called me from the military unit and said that my brother was listed as a BP as of March 22. Ksenofontov was awarded the Hero of Russia. He is alive and well, and my brother is still missing in action, his sister said. Mobilized Kirill Sergeyevich Velichko. He last contacted on January 18, 2024, and said he was being taken to storm the area. According to his fellow soldiers, he died on January 19 near Sinkovka as a result of a drone strike. Andrey Ivanovich Syrotyuk (Orel), when I asked where our soldier was, replied that he had no idea and that he was allegedly in the hospital in January, and then, without continuing the dialogue, blocked me, his wife said. Relatives of the military have repeatedly contacted the Russian Ministry of Defense, the prosecutor's office, and the Investigative Committee demanding that an investigation be conducted into Ksenofontov, but to no avail. Solovyov, you justify him, say that he is a hero of Russia, but you do not want to hear us, ordinary people, wives and mothers, ordinary relatives. He [Ksenofontov] is a terrible person. Why are thousands looking for their relatives, why are there so many missing? - the mother of three children and wife of the deceased serviceman Golovachev answered the propagandist.	https://t.me/astrapress/63827	2024-09-08T00:55:17-07:00
‚Ü©Ô∏èüé¨üñº -I want to address Solovyov. To say, here I am. I am not a fairy...	ASTRA: ASTRA journalists should be jailed, said Solovyov. This is how the propagandist responded to the publication about the commander of the 25th brigade, who got drunk and sent dozens of soldiers on a deadly assault Vladimir Solovyov responded to the ASTRA publication about Colonel Alexey... - I want to address Solovyov. To say, here I am. I am not a fake, I am a citizen of the Russian Federation, I am proud of my homeland and I am not some kind of CIPSO. Everything that I told -Astra-, I wrote in an appeal to Commander-in-Chief Putin, and this is the truth. I am not going to retract a single word I said - Relatives of those missing and killed under the leadership of the hero of Russia Colonel Ksenofontov responded to the propagandist Solovyov. Relatives of the dead and missing soldiers from the 25th brigade contacted the ASTRA editorial board after the publication about how Colonel Alexey Ksenofontov, call sign -Tiger-, while intoxicated, sent dozens of men on a deadly assault. Let us recall that Vladimir Solovyov responded to the post, stating that this was a lie, and that the Ukrainian CIPSO, through -Astra-, was allegedly throwing in fake materials with the aim of -distracting our brilliant commanders from the work of destroying the Nazi vermin-. Therefore, he claims, the journalists of the publication should be put in prison, and an explanation should be taken from -the citizen [Bolvinova, the wife of the dead soldier, - ed.], who told all this-. -Citizen Solovyov, interview all of us. Look how many women curse your Ksenofontov. Talk to the women who wish death to -Tiger- under your broadcasts. Why are you trying to whitewash this man? Why don't you tell us that Ksenofontov has a criminal record for abuse of office? - Alina Bolvinova, who told -Astra- about that very drunken assault, asked the propagandist. According to relatives who contacted the editorial office, Alexey Ksenofontov -Tiger- and Andrey Syrotyuk -Orel-, by sending soldiers into deadly assaults and receiving state awards for it, understate the losses of their -death brigade- (that's the name the 25th brigade received among relatives) by tens of times thanks to the so-called -seconded- soldiers - from other military units. ASTRA knows the names of at least two soldiers who came under their command from an illegal basement in Zaitsevo (-LNR-) - these are Stefan Viktorovich Glazer and Vladimir Viktorovich Volodin. Both disappeared after they were sent from the basement to the assault squad. According to Glazer's mother, -Orel- went to Zaitsevo for -reinforcements- every week. - A huge number of those assigned thus disappeared in the 25th Brigade - virtually without names - because their movements were not reflected in the combat logs... In this way, the 25th Brigade managed to significantly reduce irrecoverable losses... So many assigned men died under the leadership of -Tiger-, and at the time of their death - unknown guys... Let Ksenofontov answer me: where is my son!!! Whom I have been looking for for 8 months!!! Where is my child? What did he and Orel do with him? - The husband of another ASTRA interlocutor also disappeared after he was assigned to military unit 29760 under the leadership of -Orel- after being in Zaitsevo and sent on a combat mission at the end of January. - I really want someone to answer for my husband-, - says his wife. The wife of Denis Valerievich Chernyshov is part of a group of wives and mothers of 43 other missing persons under the leadership of Ksenofontov. - All our soldiers contacted each other for the last time on February 24. And no one can tell us where they are. There are also no payroll accruals. &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; In this unit, they don‚Äôt even know what an assault kilometer is. Because the guys don‚Äôt pass this assault kilometer, they can‚Äôt even walk 100 meters. They die leaving the dugout. And when someone says that the command there is great, then go beyond the tape, at least a kilometer, and talk to the guys who are cold, hungry, sitting without water, food and clothes. They are told that you either go forward or back. And there is no way back, because they are immediately zeroed out. Because they are inconvenient for them-, - says Chernyshov‚Äôs wife. The women wrote a collective appeal to Bastrykin (in the photo). ASTRA has previously written about what is happening in the 25th Brigade, where soldiers are disappearing in droves at the front, and the command is sending people without eyes, on crutches and with hepatitis into battle.

ASTRA: Russian soldiers robbed another store in the Kursk region In August, Russian soldiers robbed the Kapitosha children's clothing store in Kornevo (less than 20 km from the border). The corresponding video from the store's surveillance cameras was published by blogger Michael Naki. Into the lens... -Quadric, drive the fuck back! What the hell are you doing anyway? We, bitch, have been helping you from the first fucking days. What the fuck are you doing, huh? Aren‚Äôt you fucking ashamed, bitch?-,- in the Russian border, local residents caught the military who were robbing their houseIn the video, a woman accuses the military of they stole an ATV and took the residents' personal belongings, including stew, out of the house. The channel that published the video is -Ashes- writes that the place and time of the video is unknown. Journalists assume that it was filmed in the Belgorod region - since on one of the cars in the video you can see the corresponding license plate with region 31. Against the backdrop of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive on the Kursk region, several videos appeared on the Internet in which Russian military rob locals communication shops and shops. A resident of the border region, in a conversation with ASTRA, complained that in Kursk Kornevo-according to rumorsthe military opened up almost all the retail outlets.-.
