There was no evacuation from Bykovskaya Secondary School. Police and territorial defense officers arrived at the scene.As before told ASTRA, to counter Ukrainian air defenses, the Russian army began to equip Soviet FAB air bombs UMPC complexes. After this update, FABs now have wings and satellite guidance, allowing them to launch bombs directly from Russian territory.

At the same time, lists of prohibited professions for foreign workers. At the same time, migrants in Russia are required to register for military service - which the police remind them about during raids on markets and other places where migrants gather.	https://t.me/astrapress/69015	2024-11-22T00:50:08-08:00

Roskomnadzor announced a ban on scientific information about VPNAccording to the new order of the department, scientific, technical and statistical information about VPN services for bypassing blocking will be recognized as prohibited in Russia, reports Interfax. If found, links to such information will be entered into the blocking register. It is reported that an exception will be made only -for those VPN services that are used for secure remote access-—virtual private networks in Russia are also used by law enforcement agencies for this purpose. The order was published on November 20 and will come into force 10 days from the date of publication and will be valid until September 1, 2029.In the middle of last month, Roskomnadzor made access to information from the blocking register more difficult — now you can find out whether a site is blocked only by having an exact link to the blocked page. Before this, it became known that Roskomnadzor is going to spend almost 60 billion rubles on the fight against VPN.	https://t.me/astrapress/68979	2024-11-21T06:01:53-08:00

FAB-250 and FAB-500 fall most often. Usually, in case of emergency, they do not explode - the shells are destroyed by explosives experts after the fact.

At the trial, he stated that he wanted to sign a new contract with the Ministry of Defense. This could be the reason for suspending the consideration of his criminal case.Nevertheless, representatives of the military registration and enlistment office replied that they could not do this, since they had received from law enforcement agencies some -compromising information- regarding the defendant. Shvarev's defense does not agree with this.According to the investigation and the state prosecution, Shvarev received 500 thousand rubles from the relatives of one of the convicts, as well as a Swiss Tissot watch. For this, he allegedly promised to create favorable conditions for the prisoner to serve his sentence. In addition, he brought a mobile phone with a SIM card into the colony territory and handed it to the convict.

Later you started buying advertising from us, sending us donations,&nbsp; throw links to competitions to support independent media, and we got salaries. Recently, Astra was recognized as a -foreign agent- for the fact that we tell the truth about the war and how it affects Ukraine, Russia and the whole world every day and around the clock. This status has deprived us of advertising in the Russian Federation, so now you can help us continue to work. Donations to -foreign agents- are not prohibited by the laws of the Russian Federation. Also, there are no cases yet where donations to -foreign agents- would lead to someone being included in the register. However, if you are in the Russian Federation, still make donations non-publicly, without reporting it on social networks. Make donations with a foreign card, if possible, or use anonymous Proton mail and, if possible, do not indicate your real name.

Gazprom stopped supplying gas to Austria The supply of gas to the Austrian energy company OMV from Russia stopped on the morning of November 16, saidAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. The reason for this was the conflict over interrupted supplies in 2022. Austria received Russian gas through the Nord Stream gas pipeline, but in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, supply disruptions arose. Gazprom explained this by technical difficulties, in response, the Head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that -Russia is trying to blackmail Austria by stopping gas supplies.- Nehammer said the day before that the country -will not allow itself to be blackmailed.-Earlier, OMV filed a lawsuit against Gazprom and won more than €243 million in damages. OMV decided to deduct this money from the payment for the existing contract. The company claims that it will replace Russian supplies with supplies from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as from other suppliers. According to DW, the Austrian corporation could deliberately come into conflict with the Russian one in order to break the contract valid until 2040, obliging it to purchase significant volumes of gas.	https://t.me/astrapress/68614	2024-11-16T08:55:17-08:00
