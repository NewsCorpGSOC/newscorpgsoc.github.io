Russia began actively using updated FABs in 2024. The FAB is equipped with UMPC complexes - wings and satellite guidance, which make the bomb adjustable and increase its range. As ASTRA previously wrote, such aerial bombs fell in the Russian Federation and the occupied territoriesof Ukraine more than a hundred times. Usually, such bombs do not explode when falling on Russian territory, however, on May 4, a FAB-500 fell on a house in Begorod, as a result of which 7 people were injured, 31 households and 10 cars were damaged. The authorities chose to remain silent about the reason for the bomb's fall and its affiliation.	https://t.me/astrapress/64935	2024-09-22T13:56:14-07:00

There, the man suggested that relatives of conscripts who returned from captivity, who complain about the lack of information, contact the ASTRA editorial office. After that, her husband received a call from the administrator of the chat - from which he was then deleted. Victoria suggests that the chat administrator could have reported this to the military unit.&nbsp;-I don‚Äôt know what they want. Maybe some stars earn themselves this &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; Why don‚Äôt you interrogate those who abandoned the boys [conscripts], simply abandoned them for slaughter and ticked away [after the Ukrainian Armed Forces‚Äô breakthrough in the Kursk region]? Why didn‚Äôt the unit commander come to us then?

Detonation of Hezbollah pagers and radios in Lebanon occurred last Tuesday and Wednesday. As a result of the large-scale sabotage, at least 32 people were killed, including two children, and thousands more were injured. Previously American media, citing Israeli sources, wrote that to blow up Hezbollah pagers, Israeli intelligence created a fake company, which received an order from a Shiite organization and -mined- the pagers for several years. Israeli intelligence knew that Hezbollah was afraid of surveillance through smartphones, so the head of the organization demanded that all its members use pagers and walkie-talkies.Against the backdrop of another escalation in Israel, the country's authorities closed the office of the Qatari media holding early this morning Al Jazeera in Palestine. An Israeli military raid on a TV channel's office in the Palestinian city of Ramallah on the West Bank was broadcast live.

It is reported that the military -found a walkie-talkie at an abandoned Ukrainian position and from radio conversations learned about an armored group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that was moving forward to pick up the wounded. The group was met and destroyed.- Ukrainian and Russian media repeatedly wrote about the heavy losses of the 155th brigade in the war in Ukraine. The publications claim that the brigade suffered its first big losses back in March 2022, when the -black berets- fought in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian authorities and media called soldiers of the 155th brigade responsible for the killings of civilians in Bucha. And during the Ukrainian occupation of the Kursk region this summer, soldiers of the 155th brigade published a video with the head of a Ukrainian military man impaled on a pike.	https://t.me/astrapress/64911	2024-09-22T06:25:11-07:00

A court in the Volgograd region found Ukrainian citizen Alexander Gongadze Free Ross guilty of violating the legislation on rallies and migration legislation.‚Ä¶ A Ukrainian citizen has been held in the Volgograd migrant detention center for more than two months. They cannot deport him to Ukraine because of the war and refuse to send him to Georgia to live with his relatives. In Russia, a man has a small child Alexander Ross is a native of Ukraine who has been living in Russia for the last 7 years. There, according to his common-law wife Lyudmila Burlakova, he was engaged in activism and social entrepreneurship, including helping the Russian military with his own money. -Sasha positions himself as Russian. I moved to Russia from Ukraine because persecution for pro-Russian views had already begun there,- Lyudmila Burlakova told ASTRA. The marriage of Lyudmila and Alexander is not officially registered, but they have a child together - two-year-old Fedor, born in the spring of 2022. Alexander Ross is listed as the father on the boy‚Äôs birth certificate (this and other documents mentioned in the news are at the disposal of the editors). They moved to the Volgograd region from Yekaterinburg during Lyudmila‚Äôs maternity leave: -My parents live here. Warm, sunny and lots of fruits and vegetables. The best choice for a child,- she explains. Ross has been in custody since the end of June. He wanted to draw attention to the state of pedestrian streets in the city of Kamyshin, by organizing a wheelchair race. The race was not allowed to take place - Ross was arrested for 9 days for organizing a public event without filing a notification (clause 2 of Article 20.2 of the Administrative Code).As ASTRA Lyudmila reported, Alexander Ross has been in custody since then. On July 6, police discovered that Ross had violated immigration laws. A year earlier, he and his wife flew to Egypt, and upon their return, Ross did not appear at the Ministry of Internal Affairs to provide his fingerprints and register. The couple did not know that upon leaving Russia, the man‚Äôs temporary registration was canceled. On September 20, the period of stay in the temporary detention center for migrants in Volgograd was once again extended by 90 days. They cannot deport him to Ukraine because of the war. The man also has relatives in Georgia, but the court refused to expel him to this country. -The conditions of detention are terrible, he sits in a solitary cell, without cellular communication. Sasha‚Äôs gums are swollen, he should go to the hospital, they don‚Äôt provide medical services, just pull out a tooth. Why pull out a healthy tooth if your gums swell due to a cold?-said Lyudmila in a conversation with ASTRA. In July, Lyudmila was fined for providing her common-law husband - and the father of her child - Alexander Ross with temporary registration for 2,000 rubles. -Where is the common sense of what is happening?-, asks the woman. According to her, Alexander has very low hemoglobin, she adds, after almost three months in prison he has become very weak and is already thinking about the subsequent rehabilitation of his common-law husband.-In fact, he is being held for nothing . Well, just think that he didn‚Äôt roll his fingers and take a photo. According to this article [part 1 of article 18.11. Code of Administrative Offenses] there is another punishment - a fine. No, in order to replenish the treasury with this fine, we take and imprison a person. And not only is the damage caused to everyone, including the individual, but it is also at the expense of the state. How much does each day cost at the migration center?-says Lyudmila.	https://t.me/astrapress/64909	2024-09-22T05:40:52-07:00

Serial killer and organizer of an ultra-right group Artur Ryno kidnapped his daughter from kindergartenIn the 2000s, he killed 20 people of Caucasian and Asian appearance - and served only ten years for this, since he was a minor at the time of the trial The Ryno-Skachevsky gang operated in Moscow in 2006 - 2007 The neo-Nazis have 24 proven murders, although Artur Ryno himself claimed that he killed 37 people. Ryno committed the murders on the basis of racial hatred; his victims were people of Caucasian and Asian appearance. In 2017, Ryno was released. After this, the former student icon painter opened a right-wing tattoo parlor in the center of Moscow. He got tattoos, including runes and other symbols favored by nationalists, but his personality and past remained a secret for a long time. 27-year-old piercer Valentina Atman met Ryno in 2020 when she got a job at his tattoo parlor. She did not immediately find out about her future husband‚Äôs past, but eventually accepted him. The couple got married, but the young people broke up two years later. Valentina told reporters that their marriage collapsed because Ryno raised his hand against her. The daughter remained to live with her mother. -We were walking late at night, and he suddenly asked if I was afraid of him. I didn‚Äôt understand the question, the next time he asked how intestines fall out of a person. He depicted this sound to me. Mutual acquaintances in personal conversations said that Arthur‚Äôs gang comrades loved to pick out people‚Äôs eyes and let out their guts,- - told by Valentina Atman. Valentina recently came to pick up her four-year-old daughter from kindergarten, but, as the teacher was told, the girl had already been taken away by her father. Ryno's ex-wife was able to find her daughter only after 4 days - she was in Pavlovsky Posad with her mother-in-law, writes the Shot tg channel. Lyudmila took her daughter with the help of the police. According to Valentina, her ex-husband and mother-in-law asked their daughter a question: -Anya, tell me, do you want to live with your mother?-. Valentina states that -Arthur Ryno‚Äôs mother still considers him a hero.- Lyudmila told the media that she had to move because Arthur Ryno was watching her at the entrance. She and her daughter have not left the house for two weeks out of fear of running into Ryno. The ex-spouses have been suing over custody of their daughter for a year and a half, but the court has not yet made a decision as to who the girl will stay with.	https://t.me/astrapress/64877	2024-09-21T13:17:08-07:00

In Ukraine, since the beginning of the year, 266 military and volunteer vehicles have been burnedAs a representative of the Prosecutor General‚Äôs office, Nadezhda Maksimets, said, Russian special services are behind the arson. According to her, 169 people have been charged with arson, most of them under 35 years old. They set fire to military vehicles for -easy money.- According to Maksimets, on average they promise from 700 to 3 thousand dollars for arson. According to the prosecutor's office, this money is not paid later.An earlier edition of -Important Stories- discovered that unknown persons are looking for perpetrators of arson attacks on Ukrainian military vehicles, including through the Russian-language drug forum RuTor. For similar acts of sabotage in Europe, Russian special services are looking for perpetrators, including through telegram chats for drug sales.Russian state media associate the arson of Ukrainian military vehicles with -ongoing forced mobilization.- In advertisements for the search for arson perpetrators, which ASTRA reviewed, the motive of supposedly fighting mobilization also often appears. At the same time, during the year in Ukraine, cars were set on fire not only by military registration and enlistment offices, but also directly by the military, and, as Maksimets reported today, by volunteers. The video shows the arson of a TCC car, allegedly. The video was taken from a channel offering to commit arson for money.	https://t.me/astrapress/64852	2024-09-21T08:35:28-07:00

Providers complained to Roskomnadzor to the FAS due to the uneven slowdown of YouTube and noted that the agency does not have the right to independently restrict access to information Rosteleset Association, which unites more than 200 regional telecom operators, demands to initiate proceedings on grounds of violation of the Law -On Protection of Competition- due to the creation of -discriminatory conditions for telecom operators by unevenly slowing down the operation of the YouTube video platform, the Google search engine and its services-, writesRBC. Over the past few weeks, operators have noticed a -strong and uneven- slowdown in the work of YouTube, Google and its services, -which has provoked a multiple increase in the number of user complaints to providers.- It is the uneven decline in quality, according to Rosteleset, that -violates the rules of the -free market-. The complaint notes that operators are -massively losing their subscriber base,- and subscribers are increasingly switching to the services of cellular operators -only because of the quality of the YouTube Internet resources.--...telecom operators believe that that the slowdown of YouTube is due to external influence using the -slowdown- method, which could only be carried out through TSPU, which are under the jurisdiction of the Main Radio Frequency Center. Since the legislation does not provide for such a measure of influence on Internet resources as -slowing down- in the current regulations, the resource itself, like the youtube domain name. com, at the beginning of August is not included in the list of prohibited or restricted access, authorized bodies and courts did not make a decision to restrict access to the platform, GRCHTS and Roskomnadzor do not have the right, on their own initiative, to take actions to restrict access to information-,&nbsp;- Rosteleset insists.	https://t.me/astrapress/64720	2024-09-20T02:01:16-07:00

The Ministry of Defense persuaded Putin to carry out a new mobilization this year, -WSJOfficials Several months before Putin's inauguration, the Ministry of Defense tried to convince him to carry out a new mobilization, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing an interlocutor familiar with these discussions.At a meeting held at the beginning of the year, the Russian Ministry of Defense asked Putin to use the inauguration and -increasing support- among the population in order to explain the need for a new mobilization. Putin allegedly refused to do this and said that for now he would only use contract soldiers.According to Western experts, Russia is losing more soldiers on the battlefield than it manages to recruit. In addition, the operation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region forced the leadership of the Ministry of Defense to again begin insisting on mobilization. In the Kremlin, as the newspaper writes, they remember the protests that arose during the -partial mobilization- in 2022, and are afraid that a new mobilization could upset the balance in the public‚Äôs perception of the war as a distant conflict.In the State Duma, the WSJ article was called -throwing in-. -The West is trying to create some kind of panic in the brains of the citizens of the Russian Federation with such stuffing, to sow some kind of discord.

Including women. To access the data, you need to know the unique user ID on Gosuslugi and make the appropriate request to the subpoena registry server. In response, the site will provide the full name, date of birth, passport numbers, SNILS, INN and other personal data of the Russian. About the vulnerability of the summons registry last night toldthe Novaya Gazeta Europe publication with reference to an anonymous IT expert. At night, the Ministry of Digital Development and Rostelecom announced the absence of vulnerabilities on the site.The website of the Unified Register of Summons went live yesterday in three regions of Russia - Mari El, Sakhalin and Ryazan regions. While the site is operating in test mode, it should be fully operational from November 1.Reestrpovestok.rf intrusively invites users to install a domestic SSL security certificate from the Ministry of Digital Development. Such certificates encrypt the connection to sites (from the user‚Äôs side it looks like this: -http- in the link is replaced by -https- - where -s- means -secure- or secure connection). Most traffic on the Internet is encrypted using https - this is how Russian providers store it at the request of the FSB. Whether Russian intelligence services can effectively decrypt such traffic is not known for certain. The Summons Registry claims that it is possible to -ensure a secure connection- with it only with the help of a domestic certificate - but this is outright manipulation. The site is already protected by an international certificate from the Belgian company GlobalSign. The security certificate of the Ministry of Digital Development allegedly has a backdoor that will allow Russian intelligence services to decrypt traffic. Not only from the electronic subpoenas website, but also from other resources. About this said an anonymous expert from the Roskomsvoboda organization in a conversation with the publication -Verstka-. -If a Ministry of Digital Development certificate is added to mobile operating systems, it is possible to -listen- to the traffic of not only browsers, but also those instant messengers that did not bother to protect against this,- said the IT expert.	https://t.me/astrapress/64628	2024-09-18T22:28:25-07:00
