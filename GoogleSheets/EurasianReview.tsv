North Korea Joins Russia In Ukraine War – Analysis	Russia’s recent mutual defence treaty with North Korea and subsequent ratification by Russia’s State Duma, the lower House of the country’s parliament, has injected a new dimension to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. This Russia-North Korea bonhomie has drawn Ukraine as a proxy battlefield for Korean Peninsula tensions. Those stakeholders working for peace are alarmed by this development as the fault-lines are showing bigger cracks. The larger implications are on issues of disruptive security, governance, and technological risks that threaten peace, growth, and opportunity in the Indo-Pacific region, with added focus on Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. The 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty signed in June in Pyongyang during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit includes a clause committing the two states to providing military support 'without delay' if either is attacked. The ratification of the security treaty by the Russian Parliament has led the Ukraine crisis into a hazardous new phase. Recent intelligence reports from the US revealed that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid fight against Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. As reported in the New York Times, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said North Korea had sent at least 3,000 soldiers into training sites in eastern Russia between early- to mid-October 2024. These soldiers believed to have travelled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. The soldiers then travelled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in Eastern Russia, where they are currently believed to be undergoing training. Though there is no information as of now if these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. The participation of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s war in Ukraine, though a dramatic move, also could mean a sign of Russia’s weakness, not strength, as Russia that boasts of a mighty military power had to depend on a tiny new allay for its war in Ukraine. Viewed differently, this unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is indeed a matter of worry as the security implications in Europe and the Indo-Pacific could be huge. Being concerned about this new twist as the Korean Peninsula and Inter-Korean issue has escalated further following the Russia-North Korea bonhomie, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador and urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean soldiers from Russia. Interestingly, the Kremlin has denied the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia despite satellite pictures testify to the contrary. Since the security environment centring on inter-Korean relations in the Korean Peninsula is already fragile and volatile, the deployment of third-party ground forces risks transforming the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into even more of a global security crisis. The military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is scaled up dramatically after Vladimir Putin visited North Korea and signed a comprehensive defense treaty in June 2024. After North Korea started supplying ammunition to Russia, bilateral ties between the two developed into a more sustained partnership. South Korea’s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that dozens of North Korean officers and one prominent missile development expert, Kim Jong-sik, travelled to Russian frontline positions providing direct guidance on using Pyongyang’s weaponry to Moscow’s forces. The presence of these officers marks North Korea’s significant shift from arms supplier to active participant. This collaboration offers mutual benefits. Due to the prolonged war, Russia badly needed munitions and potential manpower from North Korea. In the three-year conflict, Russia has the casualty of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers and therefore it is expected that Russia would induct around 10,000 troops from North Korea by December 2024. Putin is aware that North Korea has a massive conventional military, with 1.3 million active soldiers and an additional 7.6 million on reserve, almost a third of its population. North Korean soldiers are experienced and serving a mandatory eight to ten years but their actual capabilities is less known since the country remains isolated. It is also believed despite bold claims, North Korea possess outdated weapons systems. This is because an estimated half of the KN-23 missiles used by Russia believed to have exploded midair. This offers crucial insights to how sophisticated are North Korea’s military technological capabilities. Pyongyang’s adversaries such as the US and South Korea are obviously aware of this. There are other adverse consequences that Kim Jong-un need to factor in. The distressed member of troops deployed to the frontlines would be more miserable now, though they continue to stay under domestic control and have no option than to suffer. Also, if some North Korean troops decide to use this opportunity to defect or claim exceptional considerations if captured as prisons of war, human rights issue can make international highlights. The world knows that the Kim regime takes defection as a serious affront and issues strict punishments, including imprisonment of family members or even execution for some returned defectors. Obviously South Korea is alarmed as it would have reason to feel that North Korea’s military involvement in Ukraine could both legitimise Pyongyang’s weapons program and provide combat experience that could threaten South Korean security. Seoul also contends that North Korean troops in Ukraine violate UN precedents, including recent UN General Assembly resolutions condemning military cooperation with Russia. There is indeed a danger that the participation of a third nation in Ukraine conflict risks triggering a global war, given the complex web of security alliances and the potential for escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia however counters that the current cooperation between Russia and North Korea does not run counter to the security interests of South Korea and that such cooperation is being realized within the framework of international law. The US considers the involvement of North Korean troops in the Ukraine conflict on Russia’s behalf as a major escalation and shall have serious impact not only in Europe but in the Indo-Pacific as well. The Russia-North Korea defence deal signals a fundamental shift in global power dynamics. Japan too is concerned about the deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia as worrying, given its impact on the security of the region surrounding Japan. So, the situation is more complicated and risk threshold is feared to be breached any time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAtOquzvuSidQ	2024-11-06T09:27:22-08:00	
Trump’s Victory Seen Through India’s Eyes – OpEd	Trump's electoral politics matches Modi's in India Republican party candidate Donald Trump's decisive victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election looks remarkably like Narendra Modi's sweeping victories in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections in India. Both Trump and Modi won against candidates or parties which were clueless about the mood and aspirations of the people at the grassroots level, while they were clued into them. In the US, the earlier Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, was aged and infirm. His midstream replacement, Kamala Harris, was younger and fit. She also performed creditably in the debate with Trump. But her campaign lacked clear messages to the voters about her plan to tackle America's problems, other than Trump's fascistic predilections. But fighting fascism was an issue only among a section of the elite, the Left liberals, not the hoi polloi. The common man whether White, Latino, Brown or Black, was facing real life issues like unemployment and illegal immigration. On these, Harris did not have a clear or original line. In foreign policy, there was no indication that the US under Harris would not bumble as it had been bumbling under Biden. In the case of the Indian leader in 2014, Narendra Modi, he was a beacon of hope for the youth wanting India to come out the psychological rut that it had got into under the 10-year rule of the Congress party. Modi came on to the scene as a gust of fresh air. Though subsequently, his economic performance only enriched the rich, he whipped up Hindu nationalism especially after a terror act just before the 2019 elections. He reaped a good harvest of votes as a result. In the 2024 elections Modi was mauled, but not eliminated as he was able to remain in power with the help of two allies. In the 2024 elections, the Congress had exploited some of the grievances of the people, but it had not cultivated the Hindu constituency, the biggest in the country. The Congress' support base was widespread but it had no large core constituency. In the US, Trump had popular issues to exploit other than the broader issue of the Biden Administration's lacklustre performance both at home and abroad. Biden's effort to restore peace in the Middle East was insincere and ineffective. So were its efforts to help Ukraine stop the Russian war machine. Sanctions against Russia and Iran had failed to deliver results. In Asia, China could not be contained. And on top of all that, Democratic candidate Harris did not have a fresh approach to any of these issues. Trump's campaign rode on the resentment of disenchanted voters. It capitalized on the cultural fractures and tribal politics that Trump has long exploited, TIME magazine wrote after Trump's victory. His support base, which was thought to be confined to the White poor majority, had expanded to included Latinos despite his threats of mass detention and deportation of migrants. Erika Lee in her book 'America for Americans,' argues that Trump's immigration policies and statements are part of a long tradition of xenophobia-against Southern Europeans, against newcomers from Asia, Latin America and the Middle East-a tradition that has lived alongside America's self-perception as a nation of immigrants. The Whites were not put off with Trump's threat to unleash revenge against political enemies through the justice system or to use the military against US citizens. Surveys showed that men, particularly young men, were turning away from Biden the most, especially over the economy. They appreciated Trump's brashness and habit of smashing norms, TIME said. Trump's announcement of 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate helped counter Harris on the age issue. The female vote was posing a challenge because of his no abortion policy. Finally, on October1, he issued a statement that he would not have a federal policy on abortion but leave the matter to the States. This helped him get female votes. TIME pointed out that in the final weeks of the campaign, billionaire Elon Musk poured more than US$ 100 million to help Trump in swing states. 'Musk hired staffers and incentivized them with pay outs to reach voters. He personally camped out in Pennsylvania, seen by both sides as the pivotal battleground state, and handed out US$ 1 million checks in sweepstakes for registered voters who signed a petition.' In the election's final weeks, Musk used Far-Right's conspiracy theory that Democrats were 'importing' undocumented immigrants to swing states to irrevocably tilt the electoral map in their favour, TIME pointed out. 'If Trump doesn't win,' Musk warned, 'this is the last election.' Trump told TIME that he plans to use executive power to begin mass deportations of undocumented migrants. There will be a massive purge of the federal bureaucracy to weed out elements opposed to him using his control over the judiciary, the magazine further said. According to Al Jazeera, Trump will revive his 'America First' foreign policy, indicating a turn towards isolationism and less international collaboration. But he will continue to be pro-Israel. While in office, Trump had moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move that was widely denounced. He also recognised Israel's claim to the occupied Golan Heights in Syria. But he did some good too. He brokered the 'Abraham Accords' between Israel and the Arab States. When he was President earlier, he unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 agreement that saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions against it. He heaped crippling sanctions on Iran and authorised the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Trump wants to stop the war in Ukraine but he may not negotiate a settlement but could stop funding NATO which will impact on Ukraine's ability to fight Russia. Trump has said that he will withdraw from NATO because its European members are not contributing enough. Trump places the US's economic relationship with China above other issues, such as human rights. He may go for a trade and tariff war with China as he did in 2018. He slapped tariffs on more than US$250 billion on Chinese imports. Nevertheless, Trump has expressed an affinity for China's strongman leader, President Xi Jinping as he said about Russia's Putin and India's Modi. Trump may also put stiff tariff barriers on imports from India, if India continues its protectionist policies. Likewise, he may not let India off the hook in the case of the attempted assassination of an American citizen of Indian origin, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, allegedly by India's agents. It is a question of America's sovereignty. The case is in a New York court. Although Trump seemed to be sympathetic to the Hindus' plight in Bangladesh, he is unlikely to please India on strategic and economic issues just as a matter of goodwill. Trump is quintessentially a transactional politician. For every favour he does to India, he would expect a reciprocal gesture. There will be no free lunches under his watch.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAggsbnJ6wvLl	2024-11-06T09:25:54-08:00	
Trump Wins US Presidential Election	Former U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to earn a new four-year term as the country’s leader. In a tightly contested race, Trump secured at least 277 of the 538 available electoral votes in Tuesday’s election, giving him the necessary majority to become the first U.S. leader to win non-consecutive terms since the 1890s. Harris, the Democratic candidate who joined the race late after President Joe Biden dropped out in July, was trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency. Trump claimed victory early Wednesday as he thanked his supporters at a rally in Florida. 'This was a movement like nobody's ever seen before, and, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,' Trump said. He pledged to 'fix our borders' and 'fix everything in our country.' Trump also said he would work to deliver a 'strong, safe and prosperous America.' A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in Washington that she would not address the gathering overnight but would speak later Wednesday. In the U.S. system, where the presidential election is tallied in a series of state-by-state contests, both Harris and Trump were quickly declared winners in states where their parties enjoy clear majority support, while the nation focused on roughly seven so-called battleground states that were expected to tip the balance in the direction of the winner. Ultimately it was Trump’s victories in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin that gave him the advantage. Republican success Tuesday extended to Congress, where the party won back a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats. Control of the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet decided early Wednesday. Trump served from 2017-2021 but left office after losing to Biden in an election that Trump continued to falsely assert that he won. That denial helped fuel the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters who disrupted the official tallying of the 2020 election results. Trump and his allies also launched numerous legal challenges after the 2020 vote, with state and federal judges eventually dismissing more than 50 lawsuits. Since leaving office, Trump was convicted of 34 charges linked to hush money payments he made to an adult film actress in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for November 26. Trump was also indicted in three other cases, including two accusing him of trying to illegally overturn the 2020 election and another alleging he took hundreds of highly secret national security documents to his Florida home. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated for a new term on January 20. A key foreign policy focus in a new Trump administration will be relations between the United States and China, including subjects such as trade, Taiwan and China’s actions in the South China Sea. Trump instituted a series of tariffs against Chinese imports amid a trade war with China during his previous administration. Vincent Wang, dean of the college of arts and sciences at Adelphi University, told VOA Mandarin that China would be less likely to take an aggressive stance than it would have been if Harris won. 'If Trump is elected, I think China may not dare, because he doesn't go through drafts, he has already said harsh words. If he wakes up today, he might say he's going to raise tariffs by 200 percent. If he wakes up tomorrow, he might want to bomb Beijing. So I think this so-called this Trump-type deterrent, on the contrary, will make them a little bit more restrained,' Wang said Tuesday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAtxN6At-sKBb	2024-11-06T09:21:00-08:00	
Central Asian Economies Are Booming As Region Builds On Energy, I...	As the war in Ukraine continues to reshape global trade routes, Central Asia’s economies are showing impressive growth, according to a recent report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD projects the region’s GDP will expand by 5.1 percent in 2024 and accelerate to 5.9 percent in 2025, fueled by rising revenues from commodities, increased infrastructure spending, and market-oriented reforms. With remittance flows surging, wages on the rise, and a boom in tourism, especially in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, Central Asia’s economies are seizing new opportunities while navigating increased scrutiny from the West. Governments across the region are ramping up investment in vital infrastructure sectors like transport, logistics, and energy to sustain growth. The EBRD also noted that 'intermediated trade' with Russia - once a major growth driver - has hit a ceiling following last year’s rapid expansion. In Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s largest economy, the EBRD forecasts 4.0 percent growth in 2024, rising to 5.5 percent in 2025 as the country pursues infrastructure projects and expands its Tengiz oil field. The country’s strategic position and energy exports make it a pivotal player in the region’s economic landscape, as it continues to balance its international trade commitments. As nuclear energy gains renewed attention globally, Kazakhstan's substantial uranium reserves - over 10 percent of the world's total – will enhance its significance as a key global supplier. Kyrgyzstan, a fast-growing hub for regional tourism, is expected to see GDP growth of 9 percent in 2024, moderating to 7 percent in 2025. While this growth is supported by hospitality and transport, some analysts argue that Kyrgyzstan’s accelerated rise stems from its possible role in helping Russia evade sanctions. Since 2022, trade with the EU has increased more than tenfold, with some reports citing 'false invoicing' practices allowing goods to be rerouted to Russia without physically entering Kyrgyzstan. In response, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned several Kyrgyz companies last year, also warning banks against facilitating trade with sanctioned Russian entities. Under mounting international pressure, Kyrgyz authorities imposed a one-year ban in September on banking transactions for import-export deals where goods do not physically enter the country. They also established the 'Trading Company of the Kyrgyz Republic,' a state-owned entity exempt from this ban and tasked with managing such trade - a move some critics have already labeled as 'nationalizing' financial flows associated with sanctions evasion. The new trading company is expected to collaborate with state-owned RSC Bank and Aiyl Bank, along with the recently registered private Asman Bank, which has ties to Russia, to facilitate transactions in alternative currencies, including cryptocurrencies, potentially circumventing Western financial restrictions. In Tajikistan, the EBRD projects 8 percent growth in 2024, driven by higher wages, a focus on infrastructure, and precious metals exports, though the country faces volatility in remittances from Russia. Tajikistan has several massive investment projects in hydropower and mining underway. Meanwhile, Turkmenistan is expected to maintain steady 6.3 percent growth through 2025, backed by public investments and streamlined customs procedures. While improved trade efficiency supports the country’s transportation sector, Turkmenistan remains highly dependent on gas exports to China, leaving it exposed to shifts in Chinese demand. Uzbekistan is also seeing strong economic momentum, with 6.0 percent growth anticipated in both 2024 and 2025, bolstered by remittances, tourism, and industrial expansion. However, a persistent energy deficit threatens to cap growth in the coming years. While Central Asia’s per capita GDP has tripled since 2000, the region still lags behind global standards of living. Nikolai Podguzov, chairman of the Eurasian Development Bank, emphasized that sustained economic progress will require more industrialization. 'If we want fast and sustainable growth, industry is essential,' he said, highlighting the need for Central Asian economies to generate high-value jobs and raise incomes to improve overall living standards.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrfGulsZuxtn_	2024-11-06T09:14:45-08:00	
Can Trump Make America Great Again? – OpEd	Allies and supporters of the United States who praise it as the champion of democracy, freedom and human rights will now be rushing to join the media queue to congratulate the incoming president. In their public messaging, they are likely to extol the outcome as yet another example of American exceptionalism and a role model for the countries of the world they regard as autocratic and necessary to bring down to uphold their definition of democracy and the western rule of law. Privately though, they will be feeling and reacting differently. They are also likely to be very afraid of what will now follow. The explanation is not far to find. Though portrayed in Western media as offering vastly different visions of the US for the next four years as well as being diametrically opposed in their foreign policy objectives, both Harris and Trump concur in adherence to the slogan made famous by Trump: that is to 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). It is a slogan which Democrat party leaders embrace just as strongly but would rather not let the rest of the world be aware of or knowledgeable about. How Will MAGA impact US Foreign Policy? Post election, Trump can be expected to push the MAGA foreign policy agenda hard and at the expense of the interests and concerns of the rest of the world. MAGAs foreign policy impact will be felt not only by countries which the US sees as rivals and enemies - China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Serbia, Venezuela, Belarus and others. It will also inflict costs on allies including Canada, European Union nations, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and a few others such as the Philippines previously provided with generous financial and military support by a moneyed and powerful benefactor which is now relatively impoverished and less influential. Countries not hitched to the American ideological bandwagon that see themselves as independent such as Mexico, India and Vietnam will find that sitting on the fence in the next four years will be much less comfortable as the new US president will not shield or spare them from the looming policy changes in trade, economy, finance, immigration, security, climate change and wherever else he sees as important and necessary to uplift the US and stem its decline. Earlier in July, the Economist drew up a table ranking the vulnerability of various countries likely to be impacted by a new Trump presidency’s core policies. The table, The Trump Risk Index, assessed the exposure and vulnerability of America’s 70 largest trading partners to potential policy changes. No similar table was drawn up for a Harris presidency indicating that the newspaper had doubts on her possible victory. Source: Increasingly, we find that liberal and conservative American analysts - both now recognizing that the US is in an existential crisis - are converging in support of MAGA to be the focus of US foreign policy. The crisis, a long developing one, exposes not only the deep divisions within American society with equal numbers on Republican and Democrat sides of the political fence in disagreement on the domestic policy reforms that the country badly needs. It also brings to attention the current status of the US described by Trump as 'a failing country'. It is a description that some Americans have taken umbrage with but which many Democrat supporters agree on too whilst denouncing the Republican and Trumpian rhetoric and record on failing to improve the state of the nation. What is perhaps most unsettling is that the disorder and instability in the US may see the new President become more reliant on US military superiority to ensure American dominance in global geopolitics. The US military might again be called upon to underpin the foreign policy actions needed to make America great again. Is a last hurrah coming to ensure that the US continues its defence of the unipolar world that it has shaped and imposed on the rest of the world and which the western military-industrial-media complex is fixated on preserving? Leaders around the world will be hoping that President Trump will work to ensure that the US plays a key role in upholding and championing the much impaired and endangered cause of peaceful coexistence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrcQprKvkyXGe	2024-11-06T09:12:52-08:00	
Wings Of Unity: Indus Shield 2024 Military Exercise – OpEd	A landmark multilateral military exercise Indus Shield 2024 conducted by Pakistan, serves as a testament to the nation's commitment to regional stability and its growing role in international defense cooperation. This exercise, which brings together a diverse range of military forces and strategic partners, demonstrates Pakistan's evolving security posture, its commitment to peace in the South Asian region, and its expanding role in global defense networks. Indus Shield 2024 is not just a routine military exercise; it is an emblem of Pakistan's strategic vision for defense diplomacy and international collaboration. It underscores the country’s position as a significant player in the South Asian security complex and highlights its growing influence in global defense forums. Pakistan’s military is regarded as one of the most capable and experienced in the region, and exercises like Indus Shield allow the country to showcase its operational readiness, interoperability with allied forces, and commitment to maintaining peace in a region marked by volatility. The name 'Indus Shield' is symbolic of Pakistan's deep historical roots and its geographical and cultural importance. The Indus River, one of the world’s oldest civilizations' cradle, is not only a vital natural resource for the country but also a metaphor for the defense of peace and stability. By invoking this name, the exercise emphasizes the nation's resilience, as well as its role as a regional stabilizer, much like the river itself which sustains life across Pakistan’s vast plains. Pakistan’s geostrategic position in South Asia places it at the nexus of multiple security concerns. To the west lies Afghanistan, which has faced decades of conflict, and to the east is India, with whom Pakistan has had a complex and often adversarial relationship. The region also grapples with other security challenges, including terrorism, insurgency, and the broader challenge of great-power competition between global powers like the United States, China, and Russia. Given these factors, Pakistan has had to continuously adapt its defense strategy to ensure both internal stability and regional peace. This has meant not only strengthening its own military capabilities but also fostering closer defense ties with international partners who share an interest in maintaining peace and security in South Asia. The Indus Shield exercise is a key element of this broader strategic effort, emphasizing joint military training, counterterrorism collaboration, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, and interoperability with allied forces. By hosting and participating in exercises like Indus Shield 2024, Pakistan sends a clear message about its commitment to countering the growing security challenges in the region. Whether it's the threat of cross-border terrorism, the need for peacekeeping missions, or the need for stability in the Indian Ocean region, these multinational defense collaborations demonstrate that Pakistan is not only a passive observer of regional events but an active participant in shaping the security landscape. One of the key goals of the Indus Shield exercise is to enhance the interoperability of military forces. Modern warfare increasingly requires coordination and seamless communication between forces from different countries and backgrounds, a necessity underscored by Pakistan’s strategic partnerships with various regional and global powers. The ability to work effectively with allied forces is crucial, particularly in the event of multinational peacekeeping operations or humanitarian crises. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise brings together a wide range of military forces from various countries, with Pakistan at the helm. These exercises involve comprehensive training in counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, urban warfare, border security, and disaster management. Such joint training programs ensure that the participating nations' forces can operate in unison during crises or conflict situations. Military interoperability is particularly important for Pakistan, as the country is an active member of a range of international security organizations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the Pakistan-China military cooperation. As these alliances grow stronger, exercises like Indus Shield allow participating countries to harmonize their tactics, techniques, and procedures, ensuring swift, effective responses in the face of evolving security challenges. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise reflects Pakistan's proactive stance in expanding its defense cooperation beyond its immediate neighborhood. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to broaden its military relationships with countries across Asia, Europe, and even the Middle East, recognizing that defense cooperation is not only about countering traditional military threats but also about addressing non-traditional security concerns like climate change, cyber threats, and the rise of non-state actors. In addition to its traditional military partnerships with China and the United States, Pakistan has strengthened its defense ties with Russia, Turkey, and the Middle Eastern states. These collaborations are integral to Pakistan's broader vision of a multi-dimensional security strategy that addresses both traditional military threats and non-traditional security challenges. As a result, exercises like Indus Shield provide a platform for these countries to share intelligence, exchange best practices, and develop joint solutions to common security concerns. The growing role of Pakistan in regional and global defense cooperation is also facilitated by its increasing participation in multinational peacekeeping and disaster relief operations. The Pakistan Army, recognized for its expertise in peacekeeping, has consistently contributed to United Nations missions around the world. By hosting multinational exercises such as Indus Shield, Pakistan strengthens its position as a reliable partner for peace and stability in both regional and international forums. One of the focal points of Indus Shield 2024 is counterterrorism and counterinsurgency training. Pakistan has been at the frontline of the global war on terror, facing both internal and external security threats from various militant groups. The country has invested heavily in counterterrorism operations in its border regions, particularly in areas bordering Afghanistan and India. These operations have ranged from eliminating militant groups operating in the region to enhancing border security and intelligence sharing. By focusing on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, Indus Shield contributes to enhancing the capabilities of participating countries to deal with asymmetrical threats. These threats, including those posed by insurgent groups and terrorist organizations, require a unique set of skills that blend traditional military expertise with intelligence gathering, technology, and cooperation across borders. In this context, Pakistan’s experience in these domains serves as an invaluable resource for allied nations. The exercise also enables participants to build joint strategies for dealing with the root causes of terrorism, including economic instability, political marginalization, and sectarian violence. In addition to its military objectives, the Indus Shield exercise also emphasizes humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Pakistan is located in a region prone to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones, and the Pakistan Army has developed a reputation for its swift and effective response to such crises. These operations often involve not just the military, but also civilian agencies and international partners. In this regard, Indus Shield 2024 also focuses on improving the capabilities of participating forces in disaster response and management. The participation of international partners in humanitarian missions further strengthens Pakistan’s international standing. By demonstrating its capacity to coordinate and collaborate with global forces in disaster relief, Pakistan not only showcases its military proficiency but also its commitment to the welfare of humanity. Indus Shield 2024 represents a significant step forward for Pakistan in its quest to reinforce regional stability, deepen its international defense cooperation, and expand its role on the global stage. The exercise serves as a powerful reminder that security in South Asia cannot be ensured in isolation. It is a collective responsibility that demands active collaboration, trust-building, and the ability to work together in the face of common threats. As the world becomes more interconnected and security challenges grow increasingly complex, Pakistan’s role as a key player in international defense cooperation will continue to grow. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise is a clear indication that the country is committed to being a central force for peace and stability in the region and beyond, marking a new chapter in its defense diplomacy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrYL5m2tuYvIU	2024-11-06T09:11:20-08:00	
The Case For New Provinces In Pakistan: Enhancing Governance And ...	Pakistan’s administrative landscape, divided into 38 divisions across its four provinces—Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Balochistan—along with two autonomous territories, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), is a complex tapestry reflecting the country’s vast geographic and demographic diversity. As a nation of over 220 million people, Pakistan’s current administrative structure struggles to balance governance, development, and representation across varied regions and ethnicities. The creation of new provinces, proposed by many as a means of enhancing these aspects, deserves serious consideration. This shift could be transformative, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources, effective governance, and greater political representation. Proponents of new provinces argue that provincial autonomy could unlock numerous benefits, including streamlined administration, enhanced political representation, and localized economic development. At present, the allocation of resources and development funds is heavily centralized. For instance, areas like South Punjab and Hazara often feel marginalized within their respective provinces, with resources disproportionately directed toward provincial capitals and economic hubs like Lahore and Karachi. New provinces could bring local governments closer to the people they serve, fostering greater accountability and empowering residents with improved access to funds and services. Pakistan’s challenges are not unique, and there are global precedents for devolution and provincial restructuring that offer valuable insights. Kenya’s shift to 47 counties in 2013 was driven by similar goals of localized governance and resource allocation, allowing more equitable development across the country. India’s decision to carve out the state of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh in 2014 similarly aimed at empowering a region that had long felt neglected under the larger state structure. The benefits of such models are clear: decentralization can mitigate ethnic, linguistic, and political tensions while enabling smaller administrative units to address local issues more effectively. More recently, Indonesia’s plans to create additional provinces in the Papua region underscore a growing recognition of the need to accommodate regional aspirations within a framework that promotes national unity. In Pakistan’s case, the creation of provinces such as South Punjab, Hazara, and FATA could address longstanding grievances and foster a sense of inclusion among historically marginalized populations. Potential Provinces and Their Unique Needs Several proposed provinces are frequently mentioned in discussions of administrative restructuring in Pakistan, each with its own unique case: South Punjab Province: This region, which forms a significant part of Punjab, has long felt marginalized due to a perceived lack of resources and infrastructure development. A new province here would allow for a more focused approach to development in southern Punjab, enabling policies tailored to local economic needs, which are often agricultural. Hazara Province: Located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hazara is home to distinct linguistic and cultural groups who have advocated for provincial status for years. Establishing Hazara as a separate province could improve governance by catering to its specific cultural and social needs, which are often overshadowed within KP’s broader Pashtun-majority landscape. FATA Province: Formerly a federally administered tribal area, FATA was merged into KP in 2018. However, the integration process has faced challenges, and many argue that FATA would benefit from provincial status to better address its unique development needs and longstanding socioeconomic challenges. Seraiki Province: Similar to South Punjab, the Seraiki-speaking region of Punjab has its distinct linguistic and cultural identity. A Seraiki province could empower the people of this region by giving them control over their own administrative and economic priorities, fostering a sense of cultural pride and representation. Karachi Province: Karachi, Pakistan’s economic heart, presents a unique case. Its diverse population, massive economic output, and urban challenges necessitate a governance model that can address urban planning, law enforcement, and infrastructure issues more effectively. Provincial status could enable Karachi to better manage its resources and cater to its complex demographics. Gilgit-Baltistan Province: Although GB has a certain degree of autonomy, it is yet to be granted full provincial status. This change could give its residents greater political rights and improve federal investments in critical areas like infrastructure and tourism, boosting the region’s potential for sustainable development. Establishing new provinces is a complex process that requires careful planning, particularly in a diverse and politically dynamic country like Pakistan. A gradual, phase-wise approach could help manage this transition smoothly. Rather than attempting to overhaul the administrative landscape in one stroke, the government could prioritize certain areas where the demand for provincial status is most pressing and where the potential benefits are clearly identifiable. For instance, South Punjab and Hazara could serve as pilot projects, allowing Pakistan to assess the impacts of provincial restructuring and make adjustments as necessary. The phase-wise model would also enable local governments to gradually assume control over finances and administrative responsibilities, reducing the risk of political and bureaucratic resistance. While the creation of new provinces has potential benefits, it is not without challenges. The financial cost of establishing new provincial governments, administrative bodies, and infrastructure would be significant. Additionally, the redistribution of resources and political power could provoke opposition from existing provincial administrations. Pakistan’s federal government would need to ensure that this restructuring does not exacerbate existing political tensions or encourage separatist sentiments. Moreover, the process must prioritize inclusivity and local participation. The federal and provincial governments should engage with local communities, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to build consensus and address concerns about the administrative, economic, and political implications of new provinces. The creation of new provinces in Pakistan is an idea whose time has come. With an increasingly diverse population and mounting governance challenges, Pakistan must consider administrative reforms that promote equitable development, representation, and political stability. Learning from international models, Pakistan can navigate this transition through a measured, inclusive approach that empowers its regions while strengthening national unity. By taking steps toward restructuring its administrative landscape, Pakistan can lay the foundation for a future marked by stronger governance, enhanced political representation, and sustainable economic growth	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrfZ4JDQt8owx	2024-11-06T09:09:59-08:00	
Atmanirbhar Narishakti: Concept, Components And Challenges – OpEd	The concept of Atmanirbhar Narishakti (self-reliant women’s empowerment) has evolved from India’s historical movements for women’s rights and empowerment, but it gained focused momentum under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and its origin, evolution, and development rooted within India's social, political, and economic contexts. Now, it is a key initiative in India that emphasizes empowering women to become self-reliant, independent, and active contributors to the economy and society. This concept aligns with the broader goals of the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) mission initiated by the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Its key components and focus areas include: a. Economic Empowerment: Promoting women's participation in entrepreneurship through loans and financial incentives under schemes like PM Mudra Yojana and Stand-Up India. Encouraging self-help groups (SHGs) by linking them with markets and financial institutions. b. Skill Development: Initiatives to enhance women's skills through Skill India programs. Training in digital and traditional skills, such as handicrafts, agriculture, and IT. c. Health and Well-being: Focus on Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao to improve education and healthcare opportunities for girls. Promotion of menstrual hygiene and maternal health programs. d. Social Security and Support: Programs like Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and National Creche Scheme to support working mothers. Insurance schemes such as PM Jan Dhan Yojana and PM Suraksha Bima Yojana for women's financial security. e. Legal and Policy Support: Steps to enhance safety through women's helplines, One-Stop Centers, and stricter laws against domestic violence and harassment. Amendments to encourage more women in leadership and decision-making positions, such as reservation in government roles and education. The Atmanirbhar Narishakti Yojana, often announced as part of national budget measures, aims to foster inclusivity by ensuring women's active participation in achieving India's economic self-reliance. By integrating empowerment with economic policies, the movement intends to unlock the untapped potential of millions of Indian women, promoting their development alongside national growth. Origin and development In ancient India, women enjoyed considerable respect and agency in certain spheres. However, in the medieval period, women's status declined due to societal restrictions, practices like purdah, and limited education and its larger aspects include: a. Colonial Era (19th-20th Century): Social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Savitribai Phule began campaigns against practices like sati, child marriage, and promoted women's education. The Indian National Movement also saw active female participation, with leaders like Sarojini Naidu and Aruna Asaf Ali, who advocated for women's rights along with political independence. b. Post-Independence Development: The Indian Constitution (1950) recognized gender equality and prohibited discrimination based on sex (Article 15). Over the years, the government initiated several welfare and empowerment programs. Key Policy Interventions: 1955: The Hindu Marriage Act outlawed polygamy and introduced divorce rights for women. 1975: India celebrated International Women’s Year, reflecting global awareness of gender issues. In the 1990s, liberalization led to greater focus on women’s economic inclusion. Self-help groups (SHGs) gained importance, especially in rural areas, promoting financial independence for women. c. Emergence of the Concept: Atmanirbhar Bharat and Atmanirbhar Narishakti (Post-2020): The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan was launched in 2020 to promote self-reliance and economic resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This larger mission emphasized local production, entrepreneurship, and sustainability across sectors. Atmanirbhar Narishakti emerged as an integral part of this initiative, reflecting the recognition that achieving self-reliance for India requires empowering women as economic contributors. d. Recent Development and Focus Area: Since 2021, the Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative has grown through targeted programs and policies. These developments highlight the evolving priorities: Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Support: Expansion of self-help groups (SHGs) to promote women-led micro-businesses. Programs like the Mudra Yojana providing loans to women entrepreneurs. Skill Development Programs: Special training under Skill India focusing on both traditional crafts and modern technologies. Promotion of digital literacy through PM Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA). Social Reforms and Welfare: Mission Shakti introduced to address safety and protection for women. Focus on menstrual health and well-being under various health programs. Legislative Changes: Enhanced reservation policies to promote women's participation in governance and politics. Reforms addressing domestic violence and workplace harassment to ensure a safer environment for working women. Atmanirbhar Narishakti reflects a modern evolution of India’s women’s empowerment agenda, moving beyond welfare to active economic participation. Rooted in historical movements and refined by modern socio-economic needs, this initiative aligns with the vision of a self-reliant India where women's contributions are pivotal to national growth. This concept's strength lies in integrating economic independence with social equality, empowering women not just as beneficiaries but as drivers of change and development. Potential challenges The Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative, despite being ambitious, faces several challenges in achieving its goals of women’s empowerment and economic self-reliance. These challenges are rooted in economic, social, cultural, and structural issues that have persisted in India for decades. a. Economic Challenges: Limited Access to Finance: Despite schemes likeMudra Yojana, many women still face difficulties in accessing formal credit due to lack of collateral, limited financial literacy, and dependence on male family members. Women-led enterprises are often small-scale and struggle to access markets and value chains, limiting their growth. b. Structural and Institutional: Inadequate Infrastructure and Support Systems: Lack of access to childcare services, safe transportation, and healthcare facilitieslimits women's ability to participate in the workforce, particularly in rural and urban slum areas. Many women entrepreneurs struggle with the digital divide—limited access to technology and internet connectivity hampers efforts toward digital literacy and entrepreneurship. c. Safety and Legal Issues: Workplace Harassment and Violence: Women often face harassment and discrimination at workplaces, especially in the informal sector where labour laws are weak or poorly enforced. Fear of gender-based violence in public spaces limits women’s mobility and participation in economic activities. Ineffective Grievance Redressal Mechanisms: Despite the introduction of One-Stop Centers and women's helplines, many women do not report harassment due to social stigma or distrust in the legal system. d. Digital Divide and Technological Exclusion: Limited Digital Literacy: A significant digital divide exists between men and women, with women having less access to mobile phones, the internet, and digital skills. As digital platforms become central to financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, this gap puts women at a disadvantage in accessing government schemes, markets, and e-commerce opportunities. Challenges in Remote Learning and Work: Women often face difficulties balancing remote work or learning with household responsibilities, highlighting the gendered nature of time poverty. Policy and Governance Gaps: Lack of Awareness about Government Programs: Many women, especially in rural areas, are unaware of existing schemes and benefits available under Atmanirbhar Bharat and related initiatives. Bureaucratic processes and corruption further complicate access to these programs. While efforts have been made toward women-centric policies, there is a lack of gender-responsive budgeting to ensure adequate allocation of resources for women’s empowerment programs. The Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative offers a promising vision of empowering women and promoting self-reliance. However, its success hinges on addressing the multi-faceted challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrZ6-Qp0PgOG3	2024-11-06T09:08:34-08:00	
Trump’s Return: Navigating Peace In The Israeli-Palestinian Confl...	With Donald Trump’s return, the White House is set to undergo significant shifts in both domestic and foreign policy. Donald Trump’s return to the presidency re-opens a complex chapter in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the recent intensification of violence in Gaza. The conflict, marked by devastating casualties and destruction, has brought international attention back to the underlying tensions between Israel and Palestinians, with Gaza as a flashpoint. Trump, who campaigned on promises to end 'Endless Wars' and prioritize American disengagement from foreign entanglements, now faces the challenge of addressing this crisis. In a region where diplomatic peace efforts have historically struggled, Trump’s approach to the conflict will need to evolve to reflect both his commitment to reducing U.S. involvement in wars and his strong alliance with Israel. In Trump’s first term, he brokered the 'Abraham Accords', which established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. While these agreements marked a shift toward regional cooperation and economic growth, they bypassed Palestinian leaders, leaving unresolved core issues such as Palestinian sovereignty, the future of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. While the accords generated economic opportunities, particularly in tourism and trade, they also underscored a new regional alignment focused more on countering Iran than addressing Palestinian grievances. As an armed conflict between Israel and Palestine has been taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7th 2023, Trump’s new administration may face pressure to revisit these unresolved issues. His previous strategy prioritized economic initiatives for Palestinians through a 'Peace to Prosperity' plan, which proposed billions in foreign investment in Palestinian territories. This approach, however, was criticized for offering economic incentives in place of addressing Palestinians’ aspirations for sovereignty and self-determination. For a sustainable solution, Trump’s administration might need to shift from purely economic strategies to a more comprehensive diplomatic engagement that includes Palestinian leadership, as economic development alone has proven insufficient in achieving lasting peace. The geopolitical landscape in the Middle East has also shifted since Trump’s last term. At the same time, recent normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran indicate a thaw in relations that could reshape regional dynamics. Trump’s potential continuation of the Abraham Accords could include attempts to bring Saudi Arabia into formal normalization with Israel, but Saudi Arabia has maintained that resolving the Palestinian issue is crucial before it formalizes relations. Trump’s re-engagement in the region may require a delicate balance advancing the accords without sidelining Palestinian aspirations, particularly with Gaza’s instability affecting regional stability. One of Trump’s most controversial decisions during his previous term was his 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This move was celebrated by Israelis but deeply alienated Palestinian leadership, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The decision significantly strained U.S.-Palestinian relations, with Palestinian leaders subsequently disengaging from U.S.-led peace efforts. If Trump hopes to foster a more balanced approach, he might consider symbolic gestures to Palestinians, such as re-opening the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem – a move President Biden had suggested but did not fully execute. This gesture could signal a willingness to recognize Palestinian interests without retracting support for Israel, thereby re-establishing diplomatic channels with Palestinian authorities. The recent Gaza war has highlighted the urgency of addressing Palestinian grievances within any U.S.-backed peace framework. To this end, Trump’s strategy could involve pairing economic support for Palestinian communities with meaningful diplomatic engagements. Working closely with moderate Arab allies like Jordan and Egypt, his administration could create a more credible peace process, bridging economic development with political dialogue. However, Trump’s 'America First' policy and promises to end foreign conflicts mean that his administration would likely aim to facilitate peace efforts without entangling the U.S. in direct military interventions. If he is to uphold his commitment to avoid 'Endless Wars', Trump may prefer diplomatic support to military involvement in any escalation related to Gaza. Building trust with Palestinians, who have long viewed the U.S. as heavily pro-Israel, remains another critical challenge. Issues such as settlement expansion, the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state, and refugee rights remain central to any viable peace plan. The Gaza crisis illustrates how unresolved grievances can quickly destabilize efforts for broader peace in the region. For Trump to make progress, his administration may need to address these political issues alongside economic ones, acknowledging the importance of sovereignty and security for Palestinians to reduce the risk of future escalations. Trump’s second term offers him a chance to shape a new path forward in the Middle East. With the Abraham Accords as a foundation, his new administration can build on regional normalization while also considering the realities on the ground in Gaza. However, balancing his campaign promises to avoid U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts with the need for active diplomacy will be challenging. Should Trump succeed in crafting a strategy that brings together both economic and political dimensions, he could create a lasting legacy in the region. As he takes office, the international community is watching closely to see if his administration can navigate this complex terrain and achieve stability in a conflict that has resisted resolution for decades. For Trump, this may be a defining moment; a chance to leave a lasting legacy by shaping a new and more stable Middle East.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-11-06T09:07:00-08:00	
Next Up—New Supreme Court Justices – OpEd	According to the Washington Post, Donald Trump won the Catholic vote 56 percent to 41 percent. That’s a great triumph for religious liberty. As we previously documented, there were far more victories for religious liberty under the Trump administration than under Biden-Harris. He is poised to enhance his record. To do that he needs to lock in a religious-friendly Supreme Court for decades to come. Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch; the first two are Catholic and Gorsuch, who was raised Catholic, is Protestant. All are good on religious liberty. Chief Justice John Roberts, another Catholic, is mostly reliable on this issue. Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both staunch Catholics, are rock solid on this First Amendment right. Thomas is 76. Alito is 74. Both have served with distinction. They are bright and courageous and have been subjected to incredible vitriol. Indeed, they have survived attempts to destroy them by the masters of personal destruction: those who work in the media, left-wing advocacy organizations, the entertainment industry, and education have worked overtime to smear them. The Left failed to bring them down. Halleluiah. But early next year it will be time for them to step down. If Trump can appoint two more just like them—he can’t do any better—he will secure a religious-friendly court for decades. There is nothing the Catholic bashers would like less.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrZ7XZWGWhlJv	2024-11-06T09:05:33-08:00	
Orban And European Meetings In Budapest: ‘It’s My Party And I’ll ...	By Alexander Faludy Hungarian PM Viktor Orban will host two key meetings of European bodies in Budapest this week. Isolated among EU partners, Orban will be looking to a Trump US election win to bolster his position. On Thursday and Friday, Budapest’s Puskas Arena will play host to two important European fixtures — with much at stake for the home side. Unusually, these will be political not sporting events: the 4th meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) followed by an informal session of the European Council the next day. The EPC was founded in 2022 in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It’s an intergovernmental format for fostering European-wide cooperation beyond EU borders. The EPC comprises all European countries except for Belarus, Russia and the Vatican, but also includes Turkey and the states of the South Caucasus. The European Council is the EU’s meeting of heads of state and government. While lacking legislative power (which belongs to the EU Parliament and Council of Ministers), it is vital for guiding the bloc’s policy agenda. Regardless of the outcomes of these events, their mere occurrence in Budapest is remarkable. Hungary’s six-month stint as president of the Council of the EU, which ends on December 31, has so far faced a symbolic boycott, with many member states as well as the European Commission choosing to be represented at meetings by officials and not at minister/commissioner level. Technical legislative work has continued while the Hungarian presidency itself has been robbed of symbolic capital. To boycott or not to boycott? Orban’s government has long experienced a strained relationship with the various EU institutions and member countries, on account of a deteriorating rule-of-law situation at home and his government’s close ties to Russia. The presidency boycott, however, arose principally 'because of Orban’s unauthorised and provocative ‘peace mission’ to Russia and China in early July,' says Peter Balazs, a former EU commissioner and Hungarian foreign minister. That trip breached protocol with Orban erroneously purporting to represent the EU, not just Hungary, and occasioned a backlash from Brussels and member states. Yet in relation to this week’s Budapest summits. Balazs thinks there’s a degree of hesitation about whether to maintain the boycott. National leaders, Balazs believes, will have been 'wondering what’s better for the EU?': either to boycott and 'thereby give Orban another chance to play the victim vis-à-vis the liberal mainstream'; or to attend and 'use this important gathering to make sharp criticisms of Orban’s ‘illiberal regime’ in his own country and before a wide international audience'. Counting in favour of continuing the boycott is Orban’s trip to Georgia on October 28, where he endorsed the ruling Georgian Dream party’s victory following disputed elections, raising issues akin to July’s ‘peace mission’. EU leaders may also have reservations about attending the Budapest meetings given Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto’s appearance last Thursday at the Russia-led Minsk International Conference on Eurasian Security in Belarus. Szijjarto‘s presence undermined the EU policy of isolating Belarus because of its close ties to Russia. He was photographed enjoying notably cordial interaction with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, with whom he also met privately. Afterwards, the Hungarian foreign minister attempted to deflect criticism, telling journalists: 'We have a sovereign right to negotiate with whomever we want.' Szijjarto’s trip was preceded by a Wednesday meeting at Budapest’s US embassy of ambassadors and defence attaches from NATO countries. A US embassy statement said the meeting was convened 'to discuss the security aspects of the Government of Hungary’s recently announced policy of economic ‘neutrality’.' US Ambassador David Pressman said Hungary’s 'growing dependencies on Moscow and Beijing have security implications for the US and Euro-Atlantic interests'. Indeed, 'that a discussion about an Ally’s ‘neutrality’ policy was necessary speaks for itself', he added. Yet, as Balazs argues, fellow European prime ministers may use the Budapest meetings as an opportunity to challenge Orban over his policies and behaviour. The chance that colleagues will deploy their presence, not absence, to embarrass the Hungarian premier are raised by the recent example set by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. When Orban addressed the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on October 9 to outline Hungary’s EU presidency program, von der Leyen didn’t boycott the event, rather she used a response statement to deliver a blistering critique of Orban, accusing him of undermining Europe’s shared response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and EU solidarity. 'There are still some who blame this war not on the invader but on the invaded; not on Putin’s lust for power but on Ukraine’s thirst for freedom,' Von der Leyen said, before castigating an uncomfortable-looking Orban, seated nearby, for weakening EU security. 'How can it be that the Hungarian government invites Russian nationals into our Union without additional security checks? And how can it be that the Hungarian government would allow Chinese police to operate within its territory?' she asked rhetorically. Balazs thinks it likely that not only von der Leyen but also other European leaders will repeat this strategy in Budapest. Geza Jeszenszky, a fellow former foreign minister who has also served at different times as ambassador in Washington in Washington and Oslo, agrees. 'Orban, with his vociferous hostility to the EU – which he simply calls ‘Brussels’ – has become most unpopular among his colleagues… At the upcoming EU summit Hungary’s policies will be severely criticised,' Jeszenszky tells BIRN. Playing the Trump card As of late Monday afternoon, no draft agenda had been released for either meeting – despite such documents typically being available seven to ten days in advance. The lack of information may have reflected either, the Hungarian government’s generally restrictive approach to communication or, uncertainty for the hosts’ regarding how to populate the program. But then on Monday evening, Zoltan Kovacs, the government’s spokesperson, posted on X more details about the EPC meeting, which will begin with a plenary session, followed by discussions on two major issues: migration and economic security. 'In the migration session, we’ll address all aspects of illegal immigration, while the economic panel will examine the interconnectedness of energy, transport, IT, and global trade – key pillars of European security and prosperity,' Kovacs posted. Orban’s ultimate approach to both meetings will depend significantly on the outcome of the US election on Tuesday. As previously reported by BIRN, Orban is understood to have extended an invitation to Donald Trump (still only a candidate) to address EU leaders either online or in person. Hungary’s prime minister has also made no attempt to disguise his support for the Republican nominee. 'We will open several bottles of champagne if Trump comes back,' he told journalists in Strasbourg following his bruising encounter with von der Leyen on October 9. Orban can be expected to steer the meetings in one of two possible directions, depending on the outcome of the US vote. If Trump is victorious, he’s likely to initiate a ‘grand strategy’ discussion regarding Europe’s positioning vis-à-vis the US and the Russia-Ukraine war. In case of a Kamala Harris win, however, he’ll likely keep discussion more narrowly focused on the priorities of Hungary’s presidency like 'stemming illegal immigration' and 'promoting a farmer-oriented EU agricultural policy'. In theory, Orban could expect some support from other leaders on such issues given that attitudes both to migration and the implications of the Green New Deal have hardened considerably of late. Other governments, including those of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, advocate tougher border controls. Yet for these governments Hungary is unlikely to be regarded as an honest broker. 'No EU member state favours illegal migration, but Hungary pretends as if that were the case, causing irritation. Actual progress at the meeting is highly unlikely,' predicts Jeszenszky. Betting on the US election is a high stakes gamble given it’s on a knife-edge. The latest polls put Trump and Harris neck and neck, both nationally and in the crucial swing states that will determine which candidate gains a majority in the electoral college. According to Garvan Walshe, formerly a foreign policy advisor to the UK’s Conservative Party and now a visiting fellow at the CEU Democracy Institute in Budapest, 'If Trump wins, Orban will use it as a moment of triumph to position himself as the one European who can command Trump’s ear'. Conversely, in the event of a Harris victory, Walshe thinks that Orban 'will struggle not to be alone at his own party'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQxR8ou-W2fwnFCzTaAsyb	2024-11-05T16:17:07-08:00	
The Fourth Branch Of US Government Faces A Reckoning – OpEd	By Kimberlee Josephson Jeff Bezos recently released an op-ed on why the Washington Post will be refraining from endorsing political candidates and why he believes faith needs to be restored in journalism. At the start of the article, he gives an analogy to illustrate the media’s present problem: Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first. Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. These statements are easy to understand, but the matters involved are complex. A voting machine can be made to work properly, and newspapers can go to great lengths to verify sources and situations, but as for the second part of Bezos’s statements about believing it to be true, well, that’s tricky. How deeply one believes, how long one has believed, how one came to be a believer, and what constitutes the core elements of what one believes are important factors. Moreover, understanding why some choose not to believe is just as important as understanding why some do. Boomers may claim that the news used to be a believable source, while Zoomers, having been raised in the noisy digital age, may never feel like legacy media can be trusted. It is also worth noting that conflicted feelings about what one believes can emerge at any time and can be influenced by circumstance. For instance, with the holidays drawing near, many children are questioning their belief in Santa and are adjusting their behavior after having not thought about the jolly gift-giver since last December. Similarly, as this election season comes to a close, many adults are questioning their confidence in a two-party system and are re-evaluating the role politics plays in their everyday life. When it comes to making tough decisions, or understanding that which is hard to believe, we tend to take cues from others and seek to validate our viewpoints, just like children who question their parents after hearing from friends that Santa is not real. And, with this presidential election, many are having a hard time believing the choices we’ve been given and are looking for guidance as well as reassurance. According to a poll conducted by the American Psychiatric Association, 73 percent of U.S. adults are anxious about the election. People have tuned in in high numbers for Ezra Klein’s talk with Vivek Ramaswamy, Bari Weiss’s moderated debate between Ben Shapiro and Sam Harris regarding 'Trump or Kamala?,' and Joe Rogan’s long sit-down with none other than Donald Trump. People are hungry for information and desperate to justify casting their ballot, which brings us back to Bezos’s last-minute decision to do an about-face on the Washington Post’s decades-long practice of endorsing presidential candidates. Bezos is right about the fact that a newspaper endorsement is unlikely to swing someone’s vote choice; however, many people were likely relying on it as a reference point. In fact, Bezos’s judgment call resulted in roughly 250,000 readers, about 10 percent of the Washington Post’s audience, canceling their subscriptions. And while some news outlets followed suit and others helped pave the way (L.A. Times and USA Today), other outlets have chosen to double down on their political positions. The Atlantic gave their endorsement of Kamala Harris earlier this month and re-released that endorsement in an email blast after Bezos’s announcement. News outlets have long helped to inform the populace as well as politicians of hot topics and changes in culture and public opinion—and they do so in one of two ways. A media outlet can be impartial and functional with what it covers (which is easier said than done), or it can take a stance and be transparent about it. Most outlets like to think they do the first when reporting, but in reality they’re doing some form of the second method with muddled transparency. When news outlets endorse a candidate, it serves as a spotlight for where interests and allegiances lie. For those looking to consume information from outlets on opposite ends of the spectrum, these signals help. Media bias is real, and while reporting should always be based on facts, readers should always be aware of how perspectives and preferences can vary greatly in relation to what gets reported and by whom. Thomas Sowell aptly advises that 'If people in the media cannot decide whether they are in the business of reporting news or manufacturing propaganda, it is all the more important that the public understand that difference, and choose their news sources accordingly.' The Washington Post’s readers had an expectation for an endorsement but instead found themselves facing cognitive dissonance over the paper’s position, and some subscribers as well as employees made their jaded feelings known. Even if one argues that Bezos made the right move, it undoubtedly should have been done further out from Election Day. Indeed, the rapport a newspaper has with its readers relies on communication being both timely and relevant, in addition to being true. And the timing and tone of Bezos’s op-ed clearly rattled the relationship status it had with many who will no longer refer to the Washington Post as a trusted source. Overall, the news sector must come to terms with the fact that confidence in the media is at an all-time low and while regaining trust will be an uphill battle, it is one that must be fought. Americans have access to more information than ever before, but it seems we are far from being truly informed. In his book Who Governs?, Robert Dahl notes that an informed and engaged electorate is ideal, but reality often reveals constituents to be a far cry from policy experts and apathy to be commonplace. It is for these reasons that the media matters—the media can (and should) help to educate and energize the electorate. The press has an instrumental role to play in the political realm; it is referred to as the fourth branch of government for a reason. If the fourth branch fails to live up to its role, we will all be worse off for it. As Oscar Wilde quipped, 'In America, the president reigns for four years, and journalism governs forever and ever.' The American media mustn’t shirk from its role, and the American people are right in wanting more from it. We may not trust the news, but my God, do we need it.

To Reduce Violent Conflict, Support Non-Violent Resistance Moveme...	By Dr Bryan Sims It is unsurprising that as the world entered its 18th consecutive year of democratic decline, it was also experiencing a record number of conflicts, with 2023 being among the most violent years since the end of the cold war. This year’s Stockholm Forum on Peace and Development successfully unpacked the complex intersectionality among factors driving instability and violence throughout the globe. Yet while the topic of authoritarianism was raised over and over again during the Forum, it was treated primarily as a governance problem. In fact, authoritarianism is a cross-cutting and fundamental threat to peace and security. The authoritarianism–kleptocracy–conflict nexus Addressing authoritarianism is integral to addressing peace and security challenges. A recent policy paper by the Atlantic Council and the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict reminds us that a more authoritarian world is likely to lead to more interstate warfare. In contrast, research finds that the more democratic states are, the less likely they are to wage wars against each other. But that is not the only security risk of rising authoritarianism; autocratic governments are also more likely to harbour violent extremists than are democracies. Among the drivers of the authoritarian resurgence is the growth of kleptocracy, where networks of ruling elites use public institutions to steal public funds for their own private gain. Together, authoritarian governance and kleptocracy feed vicious cycles, undermining the rule of law and delegitimizing authority, which in turn reinforces a myriad of conflict drivers, which in turn reinforces authoritarian governance and kleptocracy. As we contemplate how to resolve violent conflicts in a rapidly evolving security landscape, we need to recognize that the drivers of violence today are not just local but are driven and sustained by kleptocratic networks of autocrats and violent non-state actors who profit from illicitly gained resources. As the historian Anne Applebaum notes, these networks: control state-owned companies, across multiple countries, that are making investment decisions worth billions of dollars; are purchasing security cameras from China, bots from Russia, and spyware from Israeli companies and their subsidiaries throughout the European Union; are laundering illicit financial gains through vast networks in the United Kingdom and the United States (especially in the states of Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Wyoming); and laundering their own reputations to make them appear to be good global citizens. These actions have weakened the domestic and international institutions responsible for maintaining peace and security. The wealth and power generated by kleptocratic networks help to put actors who drive conflict beyond the reach of these institutions. That is exactly why engaging non-violent resistance movements and the non-traditional institutions they create is critical to building sustainable peace and security. Non-violent resistance movements defend democracy and strengthen security Non-violent civil resistance movements have great, and underutilized, potential to help to secure sustainable peace by addressing the key drivers of conflict in their local and regional contexts. They are rooted in communities and led by and for people facing injustices. They use non-violent direct-action tactics to shift power. And they are twice as effective as armed struggles in advancing democratic aims. Non-violent collective action inspires dignity, agency and three ‘collectives’: collective responsibility, collective ownership and collective identity. Leveraged together, these enable non-violent resistance movements to demonstrate effective tactics that can be scaled and replicated both locally and transnationally. Change rarely happens without meeting fierce–and violent–opposition, as has been seen recently in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Iran, Myanmar, Sudan and Syria. However, while not always successful, non-violent resistance movements do in fact incentivize non-violent pathways to peace. And they can also reduce the risk of atrocities; research shows that armed uprisings are subject to mass killings nearly three times as often as non-violent campaigns. Where to go from here Since the Stockholm Forum, I have had the opportunity to connect with many Forum participants from non-violent resistance movements, civil society, government agencies and donors across geographies and sectors. Three things are clear. First, all recognize the underlying role that authoritarianism and kleptocracy play in driving insecurity and violence in both fragile and stable countries around the globe. Second, all recognize the urgent need to think strategically and collectively to tackle this set of problems. Finally—and unsurprisingly—there is no agreement on a path forward. In my current role as a donor, I believe inclusive strategies are needed that transcend sectors, geographies and levels—from grassroots up to powerholders. Donors should try to build or support cross-sectoral and transnational relationships capable of leveraging diverse knowledge, skills, networks and proximity to power. Such partnerships enable actors with shared goals to simultaneously challenge multiple policies, processes, relationships and power structures that enable insecurity and violence. We know what these partnerships look like: they were the global anti-colonial and anti-Apartheid non-violent resistance movements, and include today’s demands for climate action and justice. Developing and implementing comprehensive strategies to support relationships linking non-violent resistance movements to one another and with other sectors is not just a possibility: collaboration among governments and philanthropic organizations is making these strategies a reality. One example is Powered by the People, a public–private partnership between the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and private foundations that is upskilling and connecting activists around the world, and building partnerships between non-violent resistance movements and key actors in areas such as transparency, anti-corruption, banking and regulation, advocacy, strategic litigation and human rights—to name just a few. Leveraging governmental and philanthropic funds allows donors to better coordinate, collaborate and exploit each other’s strengths. Access to external funding has been a key demand among non-violent resistance movements globally. As donors in the peace and security field, if we are serious about building sustainable peace in an increasingly violent world, we need to meet this demand.

No Matter Who Wins, Half The Country Won’t Believe In The Electio...	By Tho Bishop Today, in theory, will conclude the 2024 presidential election, one of the most bizarre in American political history. From inner-party coups to assassination attempts, Kamala’s Brat summer social media trend to Trump’s courting of comedian podcasts, the campaign cycle has been saturated with the unconventional. It has, of course, also seen its expected share of shallow, political, rhetorical rhetoric and general economic illiteracy, which are the cornerstones of modern democracy. The general superficial nature of mainstream political discourse, though, should not distract us from recognizing foundational truths about the state of modern American politics. No matter the outcome, the legitimacy of American democracy is broken. In 2020, this was in full display, as was the response from Donald Trump and his supporters. Fueled by the unprecedented changes to the election under the shadow of covid, President Trump refused to concede the election. Polls showed the majority of his supporters agreed with him, and from that seed of distrust grew renewed concerns over illegal voters, manipulable voting machines, and rising awareness over the security of vote-by-mail ballots. To this day, large portions of the country continue to believe the Biden administration was illegitimate. How would Democrats have reacted in the face of a similarly close race resulting in a Trump victory last election? While the counterfactual is impossible to consider in practice, hints were already publicly available before election day 2020. In Biden campaign war games, John Podesta, a long-time Democrat operative, outlined a strategy quite similar to the one Trump embarked on. As reported at the time, this included Democrat-swing state governors being pressured into promoting friendly alternative electors to vote in the electoral college under the guise of reversing Republican 'voter suppression' efforts. Unlike the Republican response in 2020, this appeal would have been strengthened by blue-state secession threats should Trump have been inaugurated. Would Joe Biden have followed through with this strategy if this alternative timeline had played out? We will never know. Nor can we know the potential effectiveness of this strategy, though it is likely such efforts would have been treated quite differently than Trump’s response. Still, as we look forward, what is clear here is that the willingness for either side to accept, without question, the basic machinery of American politics has broken down significantly. The centralization of power within Washington, which consistently elevates the stakes of national politics, coupled with significant ideological shifts (particularly on the left), and the perceived danger Trump represents to American political institutions, regardless of his demonstrated ability to follow through after 2016, has created a dynamic where the incentives to concede power for the alleged 'national good' have all but broken down. Each side is motivated by a spirit of self-preservation, not politics. This explains the response from the professional political class to Trump’s election. The intelligence agencies immediately worked to undermine his credibility with the promotion of a false narrative of Trump-Russia collusion. Selected members of Trump’s team saw themselves caught up in investigations. Military and foreign policy leadership would deliberately conceal information and ignore orders handed down from the elected Commander-in-Chief. The result is a unique era of political chaos and hysteria. But from this disruption of political norms becomes the exposure of the underlying unsustainability of the American regime. Bipartisan recklessness on spending, amplified with covid-era fiscal insanity, has manifested itself in ways that political propaganda is proving increasingly difficult to conceal. America’s interest rate payments have passed a trillion dollars, becoming one of the major line items for any future budget. The Fed’s recent significant interest rate cut actually resulted in higher treasury yields, in large part due to growing concerns about America’s long-term fiscal viability. Internationally, America’s explicit weaponization of money and banking has created new challenges as well. The Biden administration’s over-reliance on financial warfare towards Russia has elevated international interest in the BRICs and other non-US-controlled financial networks. The cracking of American global dominance will create additional stresses to traditional Washington foreign policy, particularly if a Harris-led administration doubles down on neoliberal and neoconservative figures in key strategic positions, such as her flirting with the idea of a Liz Cheney cabinet position. These hard realities create new challenges beyond the traditional calculations of political will, and partisan legislative makeup is inevitable, no matter the election’s outcome. The greater challenge to the regime will be domestic. A Trump victory will be a severe refutation of the regime’s reliable public opinion-molding institutions of the corporate press and traditional court intellectuals. A Kamala victory could represent the last gasp of these same forces, as public faith in the media and academia has slipped down to near Congressional-distrust. Replacing traditional media outlets is the rise of podcasts, social media, and other alternative forms of communication, all of which have become key aspects of political campaigns. With this decentralization of news consumption comes greater polarization in national narratives, making it harder for the regime to construct its own preferred lines. This further stresses any of the traditional means by which Washington has consolidated public support behind its leadership. Will Trump supporters accept the governance of an administration that has, over the course of the past four years, accused them of supporting a modern form of Nazism? Will Harris voters accept a president that they view as a domestic fascist threat? We know the answer because we’ve seen the reality play out over the past eight years. Only those who reside in the isolated corridors of Washington or New York can still cling to the delusional fantasy that a defeat of Trump will return the Republican Party to the control of the Bushes and the Romneys. If we accept that traditional Washington politics is mortally wounded, what can replace it? Covid provided a look at what extremely polarized state responses to a national crisis can look like. Hopefully growing distrust of the federal government will lead to more of these outcomes. Trump’s first term was dotted with significant pushback from blue states on a number of issues. Who takes the White House is likely to have a significant impact on the federal response. Democrats have already signaled that their response to the fracturing political environment will likely be an escalation in censorship efforts on alternative platforms, particularly Elon Musk’s X. Similar attacks have already been ongoing with leftwing regimes in Europe and Brazil. Additionally, methods like the de-banking of opposing political interests, and various forms of legal persecution can be expected, based on the last two Democrat administrations. No matter the specifics, it is likely a Harris victory will see escalation from DC in trying to tighten their control over fraying political trust. The direction a Trump administration takes opens other possibilities. Trump has signaled increased willingness to marshal federal forces for matters such as immigration enforcement and political unrest. What is more interesting is whether or not a broader administrative strategy will be dedicated to pushing power away from the deep state and into the hands of state and local government, such as the campaign rhetoric over abolishing the Department of Education. Alternatively, there are some on the right who cling to the hope of transforming federal control into making the Washington bureaucracy an active tool for their own preferred brands of intervention. That strategy will only fuel the very problems that have created the political environment that has allowed for populist politics to thrive. In any case, the 2024 election will provide few solutions to the underlying pressures eroding American political norms. Regardless of the outcome, half the country will feel like they live under an occupational government. In doing so, the public is becoming more aware of the true nature of the state.

Iranian Regime Experts Highlight Tehran’s Strategic Impasse – OpE...	Tehran now faces a choice. Individuals, organizations, and governments often encounter complexities when making decisions; at times, they must choose between bad and worse. In the current context… continuing the war means further blows to Iran, potentially extending beyond military strikes to harm Iran’s political standing and create fundamental issues for us.' These statements are from an analysis by a government-affiliated analyst published in Ham-Mihan newspaper on November 2, portraying the regime’s impasse. For a long time, terms such as 'deadlock,' 'stalemate,' 'quagmire,' and 'no way forward, no way back' have been frequently used in state-affiliated newspapers and media to describe the current situation of the regime. On September 11, Shargh newspaper published an article titled 'We are Checkmated,' written by Mostafa Hashemi-Taba, a former presidential candidate close to regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei. He wrote: 'All signs, both external and internal, show that we are in a deadlock. This is not related to this government or that one, and everyone knows we are stuck, but they pretend otherwise, saying ‘hopefully, it’s just a minor issue’… This deadlock is not only because of U.S. sanctions and related European and East Asian measures; even if we woo the U.S., accept the FATF, and face no trouble with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the deadlock will still continue.' A significant point in the current situation is that regime experts and officials clearly link the regime’s impasse to the consequences of its warmongering policies. They write: 'The events of the past year have shown that Iran’s power strategy is weaker and more unstable than expected… When the prolonged conflict escalated into a full-scale confrontation and parts of Hezbollah were paralyzed, it became evident that Iran’s perception of its power was overestimated' (Ham-Mihan newspaper, October 1). In this situation, Khamenei has confronted the reality that the same warmongering policy he adopted a year ago to shield the regime from uprisings and the threat of social protests has now become so entrenched that it has transferred the crisis into the regime itself. It is worth noting that after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Massoud Ali, a cleric in Khamenei’s circle, said in a speech aired on state TV on October 24: 'After Ismail Haniyeh’s martyrdom, for two months we did not respond adequately. During those two months, the media and social networks were filled with questions! Commanders of the IRGC, General Bagheri, General Salami, General Hajizadeh were accused of political impotence. The term ‘political impotence’ was widespread, with questions like why are you hesitating, why don’t you retaliate? Severe mistrust had set in!' Another significant point from the admissions of regime theorists and officials is what a government analyst in Ham-Mihan newspaper on November 3 called an 'existential problem.' He emphasized that at the end of the warmongering policy, the regime is not choosing between 'bad and worse,' but 'worse and the worst.' He explained, 'It may go beyond military strikes, affecting Iran’s political standing and even leading to an existential problem for us.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQxR8ou-W2f-HkcjPNb2VG	2024-11-05T16:10:27-08:00	
Complex Systems And The US Election – OpEd	With the US presidential election mere days away, American citizens first and foremost – but also people in other countries, given what is at stake – need to reflect on the gravitas of the situation. It is no exaggeration to say that the outcome of this election will determine further developments, not only in the US but in the world at large. The choice facing American voters is reminiscent of Robert Frost’s famous poem: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. -- The Road Not Taken What is the upshot of Frost’s poetic reflection on choosing a path between two beckoning to him? That choices are sometimes difficult because one cannot, with certainty, tell where one’s chosen ‘path’ will lead to; not even if indications suggest that one of the options facing one has been decided on more often than the other one. In fact, most people are likely to select the one that more people appear to have chosen than the other. The final stanza of Frost’s poem suggests, however, that having decided on the less popular alternative turned out to have been the better choice; it ‘has made all the difference.’ Analogous to the poem, it appears that, if the ‘popularity’ of the alternatives facing the American people were to be determined by the sheer media space occupied by memes, discussions, articles, surveys, and reports favouring one candidate over the other, Kamala Harris would be the favoured contender. If media exposure were the deciding factor, and people – like Frost facing the two paths – had to judge which candidate seemed the more popular, Harris would be it. But, again judged by media popularity, choosing in favour of the ostensibly less attractive (because less conspicuous in the legacy media) candidate may indeed ‘make all the difference’ because, like the path ‘less travelled by,’ this person may have as-yet hidden (or deliberately covered-up) qualities or potential only discoverable if one chooses in his favour. This is partly the case because, as many people would agree, the prominence enjoyed by Harris in mainstream media space is misleading, to say the least. It does not factor in the comparative prominence of Donald Trump in alternative media, which, although largely invisible to those Americans still dependent on the likes of CNN, Fox, ABC, CBS, and so on, may actually outweigh that of Harris. Like Frost’s path ‘less travelled by,’ Trump may have qualities that belie the signs of its lesser ‘prominence’ in the space of media power (or powerful media). Moreover, if the sheer complexity of the situation is taken into account, it would appear that Donald Trump actually has a huge advantage over Kamala Harris. It may well be that he features ‘less prominently’ in mainstream media than Harris as far as the explicit statement of her preferability as future president is concerned, but when prominence is measured in terms of mainstream demonisation of Trump, his mainstream media presence probably exceeds hers. Why is this significant? In a word, because of the complexity involved. Consider this: Trump is one man, and on reflection, it would appear highly unlikely that one man could hold the destiny of the world in his hands, as it were, even if there are probably millions of his supporters who would claim just that. The point is that we have not yet learned to ‘cut off the head of the king,’ as Michel Foucaultfamously argued about power. As he demonstrated in his philosophical history of modes of punishment, Discipline and Punish (Vintage books, 1977), the modern age is characterised by a dispersion of power throughout society, with no centre of power, such as the king. Instead, we witness a network of ‘micro-centres’ of power, which are interconnected in a complex, non-teleological (non-purposive) manner. This contrasts with the pre-modern world of centralised hierarchies of power, emanating from the king or queen’s court, and connected with relatively few institutional positions occupied by individuals in service to the royal apex of power, such as the general of the king’s army. Hence, even if one might be tempted to perceive in someone like Donald Trump the equivalent of the pre-modern king, the comparison does not hold, which is easy to demonstrate by focusing on the complex network of constantly changing relations in which Trump (like every other person who wields power today) is inscribed. It is only because of such a person’s position in the network of forces that they can exercise power. We live as individuals whose lives cannot be isolated from these complexly evolving relationships, and what we are is determined, not by some essential centre of identity, but this ‘identity’ results from configuring and constantly reconfiguring relationships. As Keith Morrison reminds us (in Complexity Theory and the Philosophy of Education, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell 2008: 16): Change is ubiquitous, and stability and certainty are rare. Complexity theory is a theory of change, evolution, adaptation and development for survival. It breaks with simple successionist cause-and-effect models, linear predictability, and a reductionist approach to understanding phenomena, replacing them with organic, non-linear and holistic approaches respectively…in which relations within interconnected networks are the order of the day… By ‘complexity’ one should not only understand something numerical, such as a world with a total population of about 8 billion people, although this adds to its complexity. Rather, the total (and constantly changing) number of living beings in the world (including humans) are all interconnected in almost incomprehensibly complex, systemic ways, including economically and biologically, and these are interconnected, in turn, with inorganic natural elements such as air, soil, and water. The consequences of complex interconnections amount to continuing changes taking place all the time, as different elements and actors continually affect one another. For example, human industrial-economic activities affect the quality and composition of the soil, water, and air on the planet, which affect all living beings in turn, in an ongoing reciprocal process. In total, all these mutually connected subsets of elements and living entities comprise the planetary ecosystem, which is an overarching, complex system. What does this have to do with Donald Trump as candidate in the imminent US presidential election? To answer this question one has to remember that what makes complex systems so special is not only that they normally comprise a large number of components, but that they are ‘open’ in a double sense: they are open to the ‘influence’ of their environment, but in addition, every one of their constituent parts is open to changes in the system; that is, it is affected by such changes (even if no component has access to the behaviour of the system as a whole). So, for example, a social-ecological subsystem such as a family is embedded in broader subsystems such as schools, urban, suburban, or rural areas, which are (in turn) situated in certain socioeconomic contexts and specific kinds of culture. An individual in a family will unavoidably be affected by all the differences and changes in the broader subsystems in which they live. Urie Bronfenbrenner’s well-known ecological theory for human development (so-called ‘develecology’), which focuses on the kind of relations involved in social systems and subsystems like the ones referred to above, enables one to comprehend the intricate interrelations involved. Bronfenbrenner’s theory shows how everything in (and ‘surrounding’) an individual’s life codetermines his or her relative well-being in complex ways. The complexity of a person’s insertedness in these overlapping subsystems can be gauged from Shelton’s succinct account of Bronfenbrenner’s schema for understanding it (Shelton, L.G., The Bronfenbrenner Primer – A Guide to Develecology, New York: Routledge, 2019: 10): Bronfenbrenner’s scheme is a system of concepts: the person exists in a system of relationships, roles, activities, and settings, all interconnected. Individual development takes place as the developing person ages, constructs an understanding of his or her experience, and learns to act effectively within the system in which she or he is participating. Simultaneously, the development of the person changes the system. The system changes because as a person develops, his or her actions change, and other people in the system therefore respond differently to the developing person. At the same time, the settings the person participates in are interrelated with each other and with other settings. As well, the settings are part of the culture in which the whole system of settings and the roles, relationships, and activities within them are embedded. It is not difficult to grasp the concept of the virtually untraceable, constantly changing and increasing, number of interactions (and their effects) among people and settings that this involves. Bronfenbrenner’s account of complex social conditions implies that every individual action in a social context has an effect on the actions of others, which, in turn, changes the social context, and the latter, again, influences the future actions of people involved. In the case of Donald Trump it is no different. I wrote earlier about the manner in which mainstream media demonise Trump, and suggested that this enhances his media presence, and therefore his conspicuousness in America’s social and political space. Furthermore, given the unavoidably complex relations involved, such negative portrayals of Trump are not necessarily bad for the latter. Take President Biden’s recent remark that Trump supporters are ‘garbage.’ Fed into the complex web of communication, and interpersonal relations in the US, one might expect that this would only serve to reinforce the polarisation that already exists in the American political field. But it is not that simple: sure, it would make dyed-in-the-wool Democrats snigger with delight, and confirmed Trump supporters foam at the mouth, but – as might have been expected – when Kamala Harris responded to Biden’s thoughtless remark by saying that she would ‘strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,’ another twist was registered in the grid of consequential linguistic utterances – one that might cause some Democrats to feel a twinge of shame at Joe Biden’s folly, and correspondingly, warm to Kamala Harris’s show of political ‘decency,’ as well as to Donald Trump as a target of such an unfair comment. It is not beyond the realm of the possible that some people might even change political allegiance, prompted by Biden’s comment, given that, in an already complex set of interrelations, few things are as complex as the human psyche. This is why human beings are not conclusively predictable. With great perspicacity, Brent Hamacheck casts more light on the reasons for Trump’s candidacy for the presidency being so complex – something that some would claim makes it impossible to predict the outcome of the election, but others (including myself) would understand as being in Trump’s favour. Hamacheck comments on ‘the three reasons people hate Trump,’ and divides Trump haters into three groups – Silly, Subconscious, and Sinister – the first two of which, he claims, are susceptible to being rationally persuaded about the error of their feelings, while the last group should be regarded with justified suspicion and disapproval. The ‘sillies’ hate Trump because of his brash, sometimes vulgar personality, which, Hamacheck avers, has nothing to do with his capacity to govern well and formulate sensible policies. This is why they could be convinced that they should change their attitude towards Trump as potential president. Those who hate the ‘orange man’ at a subliminal level, on the other hand, do so – according to Hamacheck – because of the inner conflict he causes in them through his unapologetic love for America. The conflict, explains Hamacheck, obtains between guilt (for living in a prosperous country like America), shame (brought about by Trump telling them America is great), and altruism (linked to the virtue of self-sacrifice, which is undermined by Trump advocating precisely the opposite). Both of these groups can, according to Hamacheck, be cured of their redundant hatred for Trump. In fact, there are already people like this who have stated their intention of voting for the Republican. The last group – the ‘sinisters’ – however, are not conflicted over what Trump represents, but are ‘vehemently opposed to it,’ says Hamacheck. They are the globalists for whom the valorisation of a country’s unique spirit and value is totally anathema because they want to dissolve all national boundaries and dilute all sense of national identity, both of which stand in the way of their globalist ambitions. It should be clear why Hamacheck’s analysis is pertinent to what I have written above about complexity. It reveals just how difficult it is to predict with certainty where and how the sentiments of individuals concerning a prominent personality like Trump would take them when it comes to voting.

All That Glitters May Not Be Gold For Japan’s Semiconductor Reviv...	By Joseph Negrine In the new age of industrial policy, advanced economies are driving public–private partnerships and abandoning notions of laissez-faire competition. As of September 2024, the Japanese government has spent over US$25 billion on subsidising semiconductors, the ‘new oil’ integral to civilian and military technologies. While the potential economic gains from Japan’s semiconductor manufacturing revival are colossal, Japan must not overlook the potential negative economic and security externalities. Semiconductor dominance is a crucial aspect of geopolitical and economic superiority in the US–China ‘technological cold war’. Global disruptions like the Russia–Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the need for resilient supply chains. In 2021, chip shortages that increased semiconductor lead times cost the global automotive industry over US$200 million. The United States is attempting to stifle China’s semiconductor industry through coordinated export controls with the Netherlands and Japan. Both countries are crucial because they specialise in producing lithography equipment and associated materials that are chokepoints in China’s chip supply chain. Japan, which dominated semiconductor markets in the 1980s, seeks to regain strategic autonomy. Its subsidies between 2021–23 accounted for 0.71 per cent of GDP — a higher proportion than all other countries. The potential gains, much like the subsidies, are not insubstantial. The semiconductor market is projected to be worth US$1 trillion by 2030. Japan can capture significant parts of industry revenue by providing superior products. A successful semiconductor strategy could be very good for Japan. Japan’s Economic Security Promotion Act, passed in May 2022, recognised a stable semiconductor supply and domestic industry as urgent national tasks. This is being achieved by coordinated onshoring and offshoring efforts that promote public–private collaboration. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Domestic Investment Promotion Project subsidises companies to domestically relocate, while its Overseas Supply Chain Diversification Project is expanding production facilities across Southeast Asia. But the economic gains from subsidising semiconductors are far from a done deal. Successful industrial policy at the frontier, where Japan’s Rapidus intends to produce, is fundamentally different to the historic use of industrial policy for ‘catch-up growth’ in developing countries. Subsidies that fail to ignite breakthrough technologies sacrifice government resources without providing a long-term benefit. Industrial policy is economically justifiable where interventions in international oligopolies lead competitors to retrench production. But Japan’s competitors show no signs of scaling back their semiconductor ambitions at the frontier. Despite having the largest semiconductor subsidy to GDP ratio, Japan’s investments pale in comparison to the US$52.7 billion in subsidies over five years under the 2022 US CHIPS and Science Act. China’s state-led semiconductor subsidies, while hard to calculate due to a lack of public data, are estimated to exceed US$150 billion. A compounding issue is that, in a constantly evolving environment, companies may demand further government support to maintain technological leadership. Given its dreams of fiscal consolidation, Japan must clarify whether its subsidies will be timely and temporary in this dynamic area. Game theory indicates that retaliatory policies that further distort economic efficiencies lead to worse collective outcomes. International Monetary Fund analysis points to a ‘tit-for-tat dynamic’ in the new era of industrial policies. Whether a subsidy arms race will avoid a ‘race to the bottom’ then becomes a question of whether these industrial policies have positive cross-border effects. The OECD suggests that tit-for-tat policies could magnify negative international spillovers and undermine the rules-based trading system. Due to the billions of dollars being invested into semiconductor manufacturing, major countries are at risk of a deepening talent shortage. Though Japan’s labour markets are beginning to mobilise, its semiconductor strategy will be buffeted by an expected shortage of 40,000 semiconductor engineers. Whether the United States can successfully disable China’s advances in AI may be neither possible nor desirable for Japan. Even with significant cooperation, there are criticisms that these efforts ‘can only slow China, not stop it’. Attempts to alienate China may intensify its commitment to developing semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, as it leads to stronger commercial partnerships within China. It is also doubtful that Japan desires to stop China’s AI developments. The government has emphasised the importance of diversifying supply chains beyond China. But this does not mean a complete decoupling from the nation’s largest trading partner and the world’s largest semiconductor consumer. In May 2024, then Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida made a joint declaration with China and South Korea at the Ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting, reaffirming a commitment to ‘strengthening supply chain cooperation and avoiding supply chain disruption’. Japan’s position in the US–China conflict is somewhat paradoxical. Its incoherent engagement with China is also seen in discussions concerning regional economic integration. The relative positions of the three nations in this economic security dilemma may fluctuate amid the election build-up in Japan in late October 2024 and the United States in November 2024. Japan’s semiconductor strategy is just one part of an interdependent system. Beyond questions of economic efficiency, the subsidies raise concerns about backsliding free markets, US–China tensions and regional stability. In this setting of considerable uncertainty, Japan must take a serious look before it leaps into further investments in its semiconductor revival.

Thailand: Ruling Party Has Lost Credibility After Reneging On Lès...	By Nontarat Phaicharoen Thailand’s ruling Pheu Thai Party has lost its trust with citizens by breaking with an electoral promise of including royal defamation cases in a proposed amnesty bill for political prisoners, analysts said. In late October, the party reversed course by announcing it would now exclude so-called lèse-majesté cases in its version of the bill. During the 2023 campaign, Pheu Thai, then a party in the opposition, had pledged that it would appeal to the courts to show leniency in the cases of people imprisoned for or charged under the draconian royal insult law, saying its use had been politicized. Pheu Thai’s decision to exclude such cases in the proposed amnesty legislation shows the party’s true character, political analyst Olarn Thinbangtiao told BenarNews. 'Pheu Thai has now gone bankrupt in terms of credibility,' said Olarn, a political science associate professor at Burapha University. 'They have repeatedly broken their promises, exposing that their democratic ideals and justice are merely fictional narratives.' For instance, Pheu Thai reneged on its promise to join forces with the now-disbanded Move Forward Party to form the government. The lèse-majesté law, framed under Article 112 of the country’s criminal code, carries a maximum jail term of 15 years for each conviction. At least 27 people are currently imprisoned under the lèse-majesté law, according to the group, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. And 274 people face 307 royal defamation cases from 2020 until September this year. Pheu Thai probably took a lesson from the Move Forward Party, which was disbanded in August for 10 years for promising to abolish the royal defamation law, said Sunai Phasuk, a Thai advisor to Human Rights Watch. Pheu Thai itself faces the specter of disbandment, with the election commission announcing on Oct. 21 that the party was being investigated for an alleged political violation. 'Pheu Thai has chosen to break its promises, possibly calculating that this reduces political risk, especially after seeing the Move Forward Party dissolved for proposing Article 112 reforms,' Sunai told BenarNews. View from the street Among Thai citizens, there appears to be an age divide on how Pheu Thai’s turnaround on the amnesty bill is being viewed. Peerawat Veeraviriyapitak, a student in Bangkok, said that the party had gone back on its promise. 'Right now, it seems like Pheu Thai is going back on what they previously said,' Peerawat told BenarNews. 'If some people didn’t actually commit a crime, they should be granted amnesty too.' But retiree Teerasak Kambannarak agreed with Pheu Thai’s decision. 'Article 112 should not be included in the amnesty bill, as the monarchy is an institution we should protect and uphold,' Teerasak told BenarNews. While campaigning before last year’s general election, Pheu Thai said that Article 112 cases ought to be included in an Amnesty Act. Then-party leader and now-Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra had said that royal defamation cases were problematic because anyone could file charges – a fact that has allowed the law to be used as a political weapon. Paetongtarn’s father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, also faces Article 112 charges. He was charged in May for comments about the monarchy he made during a 2015 interview in South Korea. Parliament is considering four amnesty bill drafts, which include pardoning actions seen as provoking periods of political unrest in the Southeast Asian nation since 2006. All four target politically motivated offenses. These include violations of articles 114, 116, 117 and 118. They are related to sedition, actions aimed at changing laws, incitement to strike for political change and activities against national symbols. Two of the four drafts – one by the main opposition party People’s Party (formerly known as Move Forward) and a public initiative – called for the draft law to include Article 112 cases. Parliament is set to review the amnesty bills next month. Historical precedent Article 112 has fundamentally become political, said Kitpatchara Somanawat, an assistant professor at Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Law. 'Over the past 5-10 years, questions have arisen about the monarchy’s political involvement,' Kitpatchara told BenarNews. 'Academic works have suggested connections, leading some to view political expression about the monarchy as an active citizen’s duty. Therefore, Article 112 violations are inherently political crimes, not ordinary ones.' Thailand has a historical precedent for such an amnesty measure. In 1978, the government granted amnesty to those arrested after the October 1976 protests in which 40 people were killed and 3,000 others thrown behind bars. Ironically, several of those former students given amnesty now hold positions in Paetongtarn’s government. They include Phumtham Wechayachai, deputy prime minister; Prommin Lertsuridej, the prime minister’s secretary-general and Pheu Thai MPs Adisorn Piengkes and Chaturon Chaisang. Thailand’s political divisions will never end if the government decides to exclude Article 112 cases under the proposed amnesty law, political analyst Olarn of Burapha University warned. 'Pheu Thai’s decision may affect future democratic discourse and reform efforts in Thailand,' he said. 'These political issues will remain dormant until the next development because we’re just hiding problems under the carpet.'

Decoding Africa’s Interest In BRICS – Analysis	By Samir Bhattacharya From 22 to 24 October, Russia hosted the 16th annual BRICS Summit in Kazan under the theme 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.' Attended by 36 country leaders along with the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, the event’s success underscored a growing interest in multilateralism led by Global South. This success is also evident in the increasing number of developing countries from Africa queuing up to join the group. So far, South Africa has been the only African member of BRICS. However, following the latest expansion in 2023, Egypt and Ethiopia have participated as members for the first time in the recent BRICS summit. During the summit, the BRICS alliance officially announced the addition of 13 new nations as partner countries, including three African nations: Algeria, Nigeria, and Uganda. The continent’s increasing interest in joining BRICS underscores the emergence of new global powers and multipolar world order, creating significant opportunities for African nations to lessen their traditional reliance on Western powers while forging stronger alliances with emerging economies. This shift also allows African countries to redefine their global engagement. As the 2024 BRICS summit concludes, this article examines the motivations that African states have to join the organisation. Economic implications: BRICS as Africa’s economic ally Recognising their current low levels of development, African leaders have been strengthening ties with external powers while expressing their frustrations with economic exploitation by their traditional partner countries, stringent conditions set by Western-led financial institutions, and overall Western dominance in the global order. Instead of depending solely on lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, many African nations have started prioritising economic cooperation with BRICS. For instance, several Junta-led governments in Africa, who came to power unconstitutionally by coup, are banned from accessing the IMF and the World Bank. New financial alternatives such as the New Development Bank (NDB) present a viable alternative for these countries to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and lessen their vicious burden of debt and sanctions. While African states are working to create alternative economic and governance structures to challenge the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and the IMF still have a significant presence in Africa. For instance, BRICS members Egypt and Ethiopia rely on IMF funding. Egypt recently secured a US$8 billion bailout amid economic challenges, and Ethiopia has received a US$3.4 billion extended credit facility (ECF),to help with financial pressures. This indicates that moving away from dollar reliance and existing financial institutions remains a distant goal. Nevertheless, African nations are optimistic about securing concessionary loans and funding through the BRICS NDB. The NDB aims to strengthen economic partnerships within BRICS Plus and improve access to diverse markets, enhancing trade and investment opportunities in emerging economies. At its ninth annual board meeting in South Africa from 29-31 August 2024, the NDB emphasised its commitment to a more inclusive and flexible financing approach better aligned with the long-term development goals of BRICS members and other developing countries. Additionally, BRICS’ initiatives to introduce new financial payment systems that work towards de-dollarisation are garnering admiration from many developing countries in the Global South. While having a common currency anytime soon seems premature, countries like India and China have started promoting trading in local currencies. This will help Africa dodge the uncertainties related to dollar fluctuations, giving them more choices and unlocking their full potential. BRICS and Africa's security landscape Although African countries pursue a multi-alignment strategy, engaging with both the US and other major powers has inherent challenges. With shifting geopolitical dynamics, the African Union (AU) and other individual African countries seek to realign with BRICS to help tackle peace and security challenges. BRICS’ support for the AU in promoting the peace process in South Sudan and for regional organisations like the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in counteracting the security threats faced by the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mozambique emphasises BRICS’ endorsement of a collective African approach to shared challenges. This endorsement of homegrown solutions that highlight Africa’s role in promoting regional stability may result in increased resources for the continent. Furthermore, BRICS’ backing for African peace initiatives could foster greater collaboration among BRICS nations, ultimately providing Africa with enhanced resources for peacebuilding and security. BRICS and Africa’s quest for leadership Africa seeks a new brand of leadership, requiring statesmen who understand the fundamentals for future global collaboration, particularly in economic matters. Many African countries aim to emulate the leadership of India, China, and other BRICS members as champions for the Global South who promote political equality, respect for sovereignty, and fairness in cooperation. However, Ethiopia and Egypt’s status as rival countries has raised concerns about internal cohesion among African members of BRICS. This was evident when BRICS foreign ministers abruptly ended a meeting in New York on 26 September 2024, due to disputes between Egypt and Ethiopia over a UN Security Council reform. BRICS and Africa’s Grain Exchange Amid climate change, fragmented markets, and food insecurity, the BRICS Grain Exchange could be a game changer for much-required agricultural investment in Africa. Creating a grain exchange could revolutionise Africa’s agricultural landscape by stabilising grain prices. With BRICS facilitating a more structured market, price volatility for producers and consumers would be significantly reduced. A BRICS-backed exchange market would help Africa diversify its export portfolio, boosting foreign exchange earnings. The way forward For Africa, BRICS underscores a significant opportunity to enhance its role in global governance and development. The BRICS Youth Summit and the establishment of a BRICS Youth Council present crucial avenues for African youth engagement. The BRICS project of inter-parliamentary cooperation provides a platform for African countries to connect with emerging economies on issues of governance, political stability, and policymaking. This exchange of ideas has the potential to ultimately strengthen Africa’s political institutions and promote improved governance practices. However, before joining BRICS, African countries must address their internal instability and set their policy priorities. In parallel, the current group members should focus on reviewing their foundational instruments rather than rushing to expand. Undoubtedly, the diverging political, economic, and cultural interests among its members would hinder the group from reaching its objectives. Clearly, despite the growing interest in BRICS, practical challenges exist. The way AU collectively addresses these challenges will ultimately determine its success.

Moscow Likely To Trigger Outrage If It Forces Protesters To Fight...	Moscow has used a variety of measures to fill the ever-depleting ranks of its army in Ukraine to avoid the declaration of a new mobilization (see EDM, July 30, August 7, October 10). Many in Russia fear that a new mobilization could spark massive protests and even threaten the current regime, given what happened after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization in September 2022. These measures range from paying enormous bonuses to pardoning violent prisoners and even releasing those charged but not yet convicted of crimes (see EDM, September 18, 2023; Verstka, July 24). Now, it appears set to take another step in this direction by forcing protesters into the Russian military, regardless of the issues animating their demonstrations. The Kremlin has compelling reasons to send protesters to fight. While protests against the war have been small and scattered, protests regarding other issues have been growing despite the rising tide of repression, especially in non-Russian republics. The risks, however, of taking such a step are significant, including a dramatic increase in anti-war attitudes and larger and more impassioned demonstrations. Most importantly for the Kremlin, it could also lead to a decline in support for Putin himself, potentially prompting a move against him and his regime (see EDM, March 8, 2021, April 13, 2023, July 30;TRTRussian, February 10). The first indication that the Kremlin may soon draft protesters comes from Dagestan, one of the poorest, most Islamic, and most restive regions in the Russian Federation. Dagestan, however, also has the potential to be the region where such a change in policy is most likely. The North Caucasian republic was the site of some of the most dramatic protests against Putin’s partial mobilization two years ago and has often been considered a bellwether for policies Moscow frequently goes on to extend to the Russian Federation as a whole (Vedomosti; RBC, February 8, 2018; see EDM, September 29, 2022). Recently, a group of Dagestani veterans of Putin’s war in Ukraine called on the republic’s leadership to send those protesting land transfers to veterans to fight in Ukraine (Kavkaz Realii, November 4). This issue could easily intertwine with complaints about the war, especially where regional leaders have been forced to use more forceful means to meet the state-imposed recruitment quotas because they lack the funds to pay the bonuses other, better-off regions can afford (Sibir Realii, April 27; Window on Eurasia, April 29). As the war continues, this fundamental reality is likely to intensify in Dagestan and spread to other poorer republics and predominantly non-ethnic Russian regions as well—precisely the places where Putin has drawn for the soldiers to fight in Ukraine (Window On Eurasia, September 29, 2022). Despite this, two other issues Dagestan faces attract more attention and obscure this reality even as they exacerbate it. These include the growing land shortages due to the republic’s burgeoning population and unresolved conflicts arising from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s deportation of nationalities and their return. Both of these problems are behind the call by Dagestani and ethnic Avar veterans of Putin’s war in Ukraine for the impressment of ethnic Chechens resisting the transfer of land to said Avars. The Chechens are opposed to this because they believe—with support from Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov—that the territory is theirs and should become the nucleus of a restored Chechen district in Dagestan or even transferred en bloc from Dagestan to Chechnya. (On this complicated history and its current manifestations, see EDM, February 27, 2020; Window on Eurasia, March 8, March 13). The Avar veterans are outraged by this Chechen resistance, which has taken the form of challenges to the deeds given to the Avar veterans last summer and the removal of border markers between the two republics. The former forced the Dagestani authorities in Makhachkala to meet with the Avars at the end of October to reassure the veterans that their rights will be respected (RIA Dagaestan, August 6; Administration of the Municipality of Kazbekovsky Region, October 31). The ethnic Chechens in Dagestan, for their part, show no signs of backing down and insist that the land transfers to the Avar veterans are a violation of Makhachkala’s program to restore the Chechen Aukh district in Dagestan by 2025, claiming that they will continue to engage in protests against any moves by the Avars or anyone else that threatens that goal (Kavkaz Realii, March 4; VK.com/che_fighters, August 15; Window on Eurasia, October 20). The Avars, however, insist that the land Moscow and Makhachkala have given them is beyond the borders of the promised Chechen district (Kavkaz Realii, April 27). Neither the Chechens in Dagestan nor the Chechens in Grozny accept this, and more protests are likely in the coming weeks and months. Given Moscow’s concerns about an explosion in the most Islamic republic of the Russian Federation, as well as about Chechnya’s increasing support for ethnic Chechens in Dagestan, the Kremlin has been drawn into the disagreement. Most commentators have focused on the ethnic and religious aspects of the situation, but as important as these are, Moscow is more focused on the needs of the army for Putin’s war in Ukraine. Any question of dragooning protesters into the Russian army, even from a single republic, is likely to cast a far larger shadow in the short term. Forcing protesters in Dagestan to serve in the army will raise the specter that something similar will soon happen elsewhere, intimidating many and outraging others, creating new problems for Moscow. Kremlin officials understand that, but they also know that if Moscow fails to compel demonstrators to serve, it will not be able to maintain, let alone grow, the size of its military force in Ukraine. Putin certainly believes that he can keep things quiet by increasing repression to focus on his immediate goal. That likely means he will give the green light to drafting protesters first in Dagestan and then elsewhere. This may be a good bet in the short term, but it looks to be a losing one in the longer term. Consequently, what appears to be on the verge of taking place in Dagestan now could soon cast a large, dark, and fateful shadow on the Putin regime.

Iran Sentences 3 To Death Over Assassination Of Nuclear Scientist	(RFE/RL) -- Iran's judiciary says three people have been sentenced to death by a lower court over the killing in 2020 of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in what Tehran says was an Israeli-orchestrated operation. 'The sentencing of these three people was carried out in the Revolutionary Court of Urmia, and they were sentenced to death in the initial stage, and the case is currently in the appeal stage,' Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for Iran's judiciary, said at a news conference in Tehran.Urmia is a town In Iran's northwestern province of West Azerbaijan close to the border with Turkey.The sentencing of the three, who have not been named, comes at a time of rising tensions between Iran and Israel amid the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel has been blamed for the assassination of at least four other Iranian nuclear scientists suspected of working on Tehran's military nuclear program. Fakhrizadeh, known as the father of the Islamic republic's nuclear program, had been under U.S. sanctions for his role in Iran's nuclear research and Israel accused him in 2018 of being the architect of Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.'After some investigations, three out of eight people arrested in West Azerbaijan province were accused of spying for the occupying regime of Israel,' Jahangir said, adding that the case is now in the 'appeal stage.'The three were also accused of bringing unspecified equipment from abroad into Iran for the attack 'under the guise of smuggling alcoholic drinks.'Jahangir said the case against the other defendants is still ongoing.Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in a brazen ambush of his vehicle in the town of Absard, near Tehran on November 27, 2020, which Iran at the time blamed on Israel while suggesting the United States also had an indirect or direct role.The circumstances of the attack remain unclear. Initial reports immediately after the killing suggested Fakhrizadeh was targeted by a truckful of explosives, several gunmen, and a suicide attacker.Just days later, the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) offered a different account, saying a machine gun equipped with a 'satellite-controlled smart system' that employed 'artificial intelligence' was used in the pinpointed killing of the scientist that left his wife, who was traveling with him, unharmed. Israel has not commented on Fakhrizadeh's killing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc1Olt81YM2ZidY27SclBTg	2024-11-05T15:39:18-08:00	
Cambodia: Former Adviser To Hun Sen Jailed Following Bribery Conf...	A former adviser to Senate President Hun Sen who was accused last month of soliciting bribes has been arrested after confessing in a six-minute video that he defrauded millions of dollars from people who sought favors and government positions. Ly Sameth said in the video, which was posted on Hun Sen’s Facebook page on Monday, that he had 'made the most serious mistake that affects the honor and dignity' of Hun Sen, who served as prime minister for more than three decades before stepping down last year. Hun Sen retains power as Senate president and as head of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party, or CPP. As party president, Hun Sen appointed Ly Sameth as his personal adviser on Feb. 22, 2022. 'Yes, I used the Samdech’s name to get other people’s money,' an emotional Ly Sameth said in the clip, using an honorific to refer to Hun Sen. 'This is true and this is not the first time, and not only that, I even said that all the money was handed over to Samdech.' Authorities arrested Ly Sameth in Sihanoukville on Monday. A detention order from the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s investigating judge described him as 'a businessman with no education or illiteracy.' He was transferred to Prey Sar prison on the outskirts of Phnom Penh on Tuesday. Hun Sen wrote on Facebook last month that Ly Sameth had defrauded several Cambodians over the last two years, including one incident in which US$10 million was paid. That post was apparently prompted by a video message he received from Kan Sok Kay, the recently appointed governor of Kandal province’s Lvea Em district, which is located across the Mekong River from Phnom Penh. Kan Sok Kay said he gave US$30,000 to Ly Sameth to get the appointment, according to Hun Sen. 'I have signed, appointed and promoted tens of thousands of civil servants and members of the Armed Forces,' Hun Sen wrote. 'I never accepted intervention from anyone, no matter what request or bribe.' Ly Sameth’s assets should be frozen, and Phnom Penh court officials should issue an order to return money he accepted from people, Hun Sen wrote at the time. He assigned his lawyer, Ky Tech, to investigate the various complaints. Other apology videos RFA was unable to reach National Police Commissioner Sar Thet and Phnom Penh Municipal Court spokesman Ey Rin to ask about the timing of Ly Sameth’s arrest. Ly Sameth’s confession video, which was posted before his arrest, was similar to various public apologies and in-person appeals for forgiveness made to Hun Sen in recent years. Last month, a prominent overseas opposition activist announced in a video that he was switching his allegiance to the CPP, two months after his brother was arrested on incitement charges while trying to flee the country. Journalist Mech Dara also posted an apology video last month, several weeks after he was jailed and charged with incitement related to social media posts he made in September. Lawyer Kong Sam Onn, who has represented defendants in many high-profile criminal cases, told Radio Free Asia that authorities should further investigate to see who else was involved in the bribery solicitations. 'The person who bribes, and the person who takes the bribe, are both equally guilty and have the same penalty under Criminal Code and Anti-Corruption Law,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWez1Vr8dDjXG569GrtU_Ua2	2024-11-05T15:36:15-08:00	
Officials: Bomb Threats Against US Voting Locations Coming From R...	By Jeff Seldin A series of Election Day bomb threats sent to polling locations across the United States appears to be coming from Russia, according to new assessments from federal and state officials. The initial bomb threats early Tuesday put a temporary stop to voting at some locations in parts of the southeastern state of Georgia. State officials quickly determined the threats were not credible. 'We identified the source, and it was from Russia,' Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters. 'They're up to mischief, and it seems they don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election,' Raffensperger said. 'They think if they can get us to fight amongst ourselves, they can count that as a victory.' Only the effort to disrupt the U.S. election appears to be much broader. The FBI Tuesday said it is 'aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states,' adding that many of the threats 'appear to originate from Russian email domains.' A U.S. official confirmed to VOA that in addition to Georgia, bomb threats were sent to polling locations in the Midwestern swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin. 'None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,' the FBI said. 'We will continue to work closely with our state and local law enforcement partners to respond to any threats to our elections and to protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote.' The suspected Russian ploy builds on other last-minute attempts to disrupt the U.S. election. Earlier Tuesday, as many U.S. voters prepared to cast their ballots, the FBI warned voters of at least two efforts to use the bureau's name and likeness to promote false narratives. In one case, FBI officials pointed to faked news clips urging Americans to 'vote remotely' because of the increased threats of a terror attack. In the other, the FBI cautioned that social media accounts were spreading video of a fabricated news release about five prisons across the country involved in a vote-rigging scheme. The bureau said both videos are 'not authentic.' The FBI did not say who was responsible for creating the videos, which began to circulate just three days after two other fraudulent videos purporting to be from the FBI began circulating on social media. The earlier videos falsely stated the bureau had apprehended three linked groups for ballot fraud and made false claims about the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. In recent days, U.S. intelligence officials have assigned responsibility for other videos, not referencing the FBI but claiming to show voting irregularities to Russian influence actors. Russia has denied any involvement. The latest incidents are part of what some U.S. officials have described as a 'firehose of disinformation' and follow a warning from U.S. intelligence agencies late Monday that Russia, and to a lesser extent Iran, were likely to intensify their influence operations on Election Day and in the days and weeks that follow. 'Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences,' according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close,' the CISA statement said. 'These efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials.' But CISA, which helps oversee the security of U.S. election infrastructure, said Tuesday the election was running as smoothly as could be expected. 'At this point, we are not currently tracking any national level significant incidents impacting security of our election infrastructure,' CISA Senior Adviser Cait Conley said during a briefing with reporters. Conley said earlier that CISA has been tracking some disruptions related to weather and other issues such as equipment failures, describing them as 'really routine and, honestly, expected types of disruptions.' CISA officials have warned that informational websites and infrastructure related to the election could be targeted by ransomware or distributed denial-of-service attacks. But they have emphasized that while inconvenient, such attacks would have little impact on the ability of Americans to cast ballots, since none of the country's election systems are connected to the internet and because 97% of voting precincts have paper backups. Still, there are concerns U.S. adversaries may try to seize upon any disruptions to incite panic and even violence. 'We know our foreign adversaries see this window of time, both Election Day and the days immediately following, as an opportunity to stoke further division and undermine American confidence in our democratic institutions,' Conley said. 'And that is regardless of who wins.' Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and advocacy organization that has election observers stationed across the country, said Monday there has been tension at some polling places. 'We're seeing instances of folks being yelled out at the polls,' Suzanne Almeida, the group's director of state operations, said during a call with reporters.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWez1Vr8dDjXGy8uCzcBC_y3	2024-11-05T15:34:22-08:00	
2024 Presidential Election In The US And Its Implication For Myan...	We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.' As quoted by Thomas Jefferson, U.S. citizens are participating in a historic turnout in the 60th quadrennial presidential election to choose between two contrasting candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. This significant election highlights stark policy differences that could impact both domestic and foreign affairs. While the economy is the top issue among voters, a large majority (69%) cite at least five of the ten issues surveyed by the Pew Research Center as very important to their vote. Among Trump supporters, the leading issues are the economy (93%), immigration (82%), violent crime (76%), foreign policy (74%), and healthcare (55%). For Harris supporters, issues such as healthcare (76%), Supreme Court appointments (73%), the economy (68%), abortion (67%), and foreign policy (54%) are of top importance. While current foreign policy has focused heavily on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East, and China, strategic competition with China—now one of the world’s two largest economies, alongside the United States—will be one of the most consequential foreign policy challenges confronting the next presidential administration. It will face an increasingly contentious relationship with Beijing on both trade and security issues. Focusing solely on Taiwan and overlooking Myanmar would be a missed opportunity in crafting a strategic policy on China. Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are essential components in diverse industrial and high-tech applications. China, the world’s largest producer of REEs, accounts for 70% of global annual mine production, while the United States (14%), Australia (6%), Myanmar (4%), and Thailand (2%) make up the rest. China sourced 72% of the U.S.'s rare earth imports in 2022, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Ironically, China imports REEs from Myanmar, with a 52.1% year-over-year increase in imports, reaching the highest level in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence's Global Trade Analytics Suite. A shortage of REEs would be considered a significant national security threat for the United States, which heavily relies on imports, primarily from China. This dependence could be used as leverage to disrupt vital military and technological applications, such as advanced weaponry, aircraft, and renewable energy systems—essentially creating a potential chokepoint for U.S. national security. On February 1, 2021, Min Aung Hlaing and the military ousted the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government in a coup. The coup was met with strong resistance through widespread, peaceful demonstrations and the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM). The brutal crackdown by the military led to the formation of armed resistance across the country, marking the beginning of a violent new chapter known as the Spring Revolution. This involved genuine nationwide resistance by all ethnic groups, brought together into a unified front with aligned political objectives and military cooperation. The Myanmar crisis was the first foreign policy challenge for the Biden administration. The U.S. immediately condemned the coup and the violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations, as well as the atrocities committed by the military. However, the administration became passive in dealing with the crisis. Unlike the United States, which has been largely sidelined, China has played an important role as the most influential foreign actor in Myanmar. China is the largest investor in Myanmar, which is also strategically important for China’s access to the Indian Ocean, providing a critical alternative route from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca. Additionally, the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor is a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative. China seeks to use its influence in Myanmar to encourage a stable environment that can boost Chinese investments and secure perpetual stability along its 1,250-mile border. Despite Beijing’s preference for state-centric diplomacy, China initially conducted backdoor diplomacy through various groups and special envoys, as long as U.S. involvement remained minimal. As Myanmar’s junta loses its grip on power, China still seeks to maximize its influence with all parties in the civil war. However, China opposes the collapse of the junta. China is also concerned about the rise of rebel groups that have built an alliance with the National Unity Government, which Beijing fears could be influenced by the West due to their engagement in humanitarian assistance and advocacy for democracy. The passage of the Burma Act in December 2022, which provides a framework for U.S. engagement and support for democracy in Myanmar, has further complicated China's position. Shortly after the collapse of the Northeast military command center in Lashio, China became more proactive, shifting its posture by pressuring rebel forces for a ceasefire, blocking imports, and tightening border controls. Myanmar remains a diplomatic and security headache for China: the same situation as before the coup, where different actors will listen to China only to an extent and act according to their own interests, sometimes surprising China. The ongoing civil conflict and the rise of anti-junta forces have complicated China’s approach. Additionally, Beijing is uncomfortable with the junta’s close military ties to Russia. The next U.S. administration, regardless of which candidate wins, will face several critical considerations. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces could serve as a counterbalance to China’s regional dominance. If Kamala Harris wins, the Harris administration should address the shortcomings of the current administration’s symbolic support, which has inadvertently led to paradoxical effects, particularly regarding China’s influence over the resistance forces fighting against the military dictatorship—the perpetrators of regional instability. If Donald Trump prevails, the national security-focused Trump administration must adopt a fresh outlook on Myanmar, which might seem like an unimportant spot in Southeast Asia, but is, in fact, a potential source of essential resources for national security, particularly rare earth elements. The Myanmar situation presents an opportunity for the next U.S. administration to demonstrate leadership in promoting democracy while addressing strategic interests in Southeast Asia. By engaging more actively with Myanmar’s pro-democracy forces and working with regional allies to articulate clear, strategic policies on Myanmar that align with broader U.S. interests in Asia-Pacific stability, human rights, and economic security, the U.S. can potentially influence the balance of power in this critical region. For the citizens of the U.S., 'the ballot is stronger than the bullet,' as quoted by Abraham Lincoln.

In Middle East, EU Is An Economic Giant But A Political Dwarf – O...	By Osama Al-Sharif The EU has seen its geopolitical influence decline throughout the world in recent years, but no more so than in the Middle East, a region historically, economically and culturally closer to it than the US. The Europeans have been losing political influence for decades, especially after endorsing the US-sponsored peace accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. Exclusive US oversight of the Oslo process sidelined the EU as a block, as well as the UN and Russia, although these three entities remain members of the Quartet — in addition to the US. But Washington has made it clear that it will neutralize any meaningful role of the Quartet to avoid laying any serious pressure on its ally and proxy, Israel. But the EU’s political influence on parties to the Israel-Palestine conflict has also declined in recent years. In this case, it suffered a fatal blow following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing brutal Israeli war on Gaza, which is ongoing and has now stretched to Lebanon. The Europeans, including the British after leaving the union, are divided when it comes to exerting meaningful pressure on Israel to cease its assault on Gaza. Following the Oct. 7 attacks, European leaders flocked to embrace Benjamin Netanyahu and to declare that Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against the aggressor, meaning Hamas and Islamic Jihad. But they soon realized that Netanyahu had unleashed an indiscriminate blitz whose aim was not to decapitate Hamas, as he has claimed, but to kill civilians, destroy infrastructure and eventually drive more than 2.2 million Palestinians toward death, either by direct bombing or by starvation and disease. It became clear that Netanyahu had other plans as he waged what nongovernmental organizations, UN rapporteurs and even the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court have described as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Still the EU has vacillated, as members like Hungary and Austria have rejected calls to bring collective punitive measures against Israel. The leading critical voice of Israeli atrocities in Gaza is foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who has been banned from entering Israel, Gaza and the West Bank by the far-right Israeli government because of his bold statements. Europe exhibited such divisiveness and lack of a coherent foreign policy when three European states — Spain, Ireland and Slovenia — decided to recognize a Palestinian state in May. The UK, which is widely recognized as triggering the decades-long conflict and causing the Palestinians’ historic injustice, has made no such move. France sat on the fence on this issue as it battled the rise of the pro-Israel far right at home and the decline of its economic influence within the EU. Germany, the EU’s economic and political powerhouse, remained loyal to its blind support of Israel and denial of its war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank. Italy and France took the step of stopping all military shipments to Israel. But at no point was the EU able to initiate a dialogue with the Biden administration about reining in Netanyahu and preventing his doubling down on what is now clearly a crime of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza. The EU has become dependent on Washington’s support of its policy on Ukraine, the most crucial geopolitical challenge to the bloc since its inception. Yes, the EU and its members remain the biggest donor to UNRWA and other UN agencies working for the welfare of the Palestinians. Brussels is also the biggest financial supporter of the Palestinian Authority. However, such financial support is undercut by its inability to produce a decisive political stand that would influence the trajectory of events in the Occupied Territories. The EU and individual member states have imposed sanctions on Jewish settler groups in the West Bank, as has the US. But that has not prevented Netanyahu’s far-right government from unleashing a settler-led wave of terror and mayhem against West Bank Palestinians. And when South Africa brought what has become a seminal charge of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice, Germany and, at one point, the UK moved in to defend Israel and attempt to throw out the case, despite the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have so far been killed. Historically, the EU has been a progressive entity when it comes to addressing the plight of the Palestinians and how the conflict should be resolved. In 1980, it issued the famous Venice Declaration, which recognized the Palestinian right to self-determination and the concept of the two-state solution based on UN Security Council resolutions. Aside from the US’ dominant role in managing peace talks between Israel and the PA, which have been nonexistent for almost 15 years now, the EU has gone through significant internal transformations that have eroded its role in the international arena, especially the Middle East. While the EU remains the third-largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product, its economies have been suffering from slow or negative growth, rising inflation, immigration, both legal and illegal, too many regulations, Donald Trump’s first-term tariffs policy and pressure to increase defense spending, NATO challenges and, finally, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The last of these has depleted the EU’s resources and, together with the immigration issue, allowed the far right to make historic gains in local, national and EU-wide elections. Euroskeptics like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni now want to 'change' the EU from within, extracting benefits while hollowing out its real spirit of unification. The UK’s influence in the Middle East is also waning. The Gaza war has singled out the US as the only player that is capable of stopping the massacre of Palestinians and preventing a regional spillover. But it is Israel’s pivot to becoming a rogue state — its parliament last week voted to abolish all agreements with UNRWA­­ — that is putting the EU and its fundamental value system under pressure. The group does not influence Israel, while several state members continue to defend Netanyahu’s genocidal war. Its economic support of the Palestinians does little to change the needle as far as a political settlement is concerned. Moreover, the rise of other global and regional powers, such as China, Russia and the Gulf states, has created new diplomatic channels and alliances, reducing Europe’s relative importance. One should add that Europe’s responses to various other Middle Eastern crises, including the Syrian civil war and the so-called Arab Spring, have been criticized as slow and ineffective, damaging its credibility. And unlike the US, the Europeans have a modest military presence in the Middle East, thus limiting their diplomatic options when it comes to intervening in the Israel-Palestine conflict. While the EU as a group is still an influential economic power, it has proven to be a political dwarf when it comes to addressing geopolitical challenges, not only in the Middle East but in the Southern Mediterranean as a whole. This has been most evident in France’s failure to intervene in the Israel-Lebanon showdown, despite Paris seeing itself as a guarantor of its former colony’s stability.

The Search For Happiness – OpEd	By Jonathan Power Want to be happy? Even if Trump wins? Read on! Sigmund Freud, the great psychiatrist, said that people can never be fully happy. But most people are reasonably happy, according to numerous surveys. Even in the slums of Calcutta a majority are. Read 'The City of Joy' by Dominique Lapierre. According to one survey Nigerians are the happiest. (But other surveys say it is Denmark, a country with a cradle to the grave welfare system where one doesn’t have to worry so much about one’s health or old—falling in love, doing well in an exam, having a child born, being rescued at sea and so on. These are called by psychologists 'peak experiences'. They don’t last long. Georgio Armani, the fashion designer, who seems to have everything—a job he loves and is very successful at, a couple of beautiful houses, a nice car and a gorgeous looking wife—says you can’t get hold of happiness. It is there and then it’s gone. For most people happiness declines from the time of their youth until they are around 40 and then turns a corner and increases until they are 70 and over. Presumably it takes that long to get on top of life, answer or accommodate to its demands and find a measure of peace. Divorce or separation from a partner one has loved immensely can wreak havoc with happiness. The death of a child even more so. Indeed, people say that in many cases parents never recover from that. A survey According to a survey in Switzerland comparing cantons, the more democratic cantons have a happier population. But no one knows if this applies to countries. But we do know that democracies don’t go to war with each other, creating untold misery and broken families. A strong religious belief also works as a boost (even if non-believers are content that they are more rational). Acts of charity and joining a club of like-minded people also bring happiness. In Aldous Huxley’s novel 'Brave New World' the following conversation takes place between a young man, nicknamed 'the Savage', and an official. 'Don’t you want to be comfortable?', enquires the official. 'I don’t want comfort', the Savage replies. 'I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want goodness, I want sin.' 'In fact', the official observes, 'you’re claiming the right to be unhappy' 'All right then,' says the Savage, 'I’m claiming the right to be unhappy.' A small minority of us are like that, but not many. In the middle class Most of us in the middle class seeking more happiness and a more comfortable life by buying a car, a new computer, a set of furniture or going on a luxury holiday will be disappointed to find that after the initial pleasure happiness wears off. But if we didn’t seek these things national income would go downhill – the hospitals and schools would decline as taxation revenues from sales taxes fell. Then, of course, unhappiness would set in. It seems in capitalism we do need the majority of us to be selfish and acquisitive (even if we make some room for those who reject materialism as long as they are a small minority). John Stuart Mill was wrong when he wrote that he looked forward to a stationary state 'where economic growth and ceaseless economic striving would end with the realization of abundance'. The greatest economist of them all, John Maynard Keynes, wrote: 'The time is not far off when economic problems will take a back seat where they belong and the heart will be occupied by the real problems, the problems of life and human relations, of creation and behaviour and religion.' But this goes against what we know: society at large has to stay on the economic treadmill, or it will fall apart. (But that is no excuse for bankers’ salaries or a debilitating distribution of income.) All of us will lose happiness if we become unemployed, retire on too modest a pension, get depressed, are discriminated against or suffer ill health. Extreme pain is probably the worst thing imaginable. With the right medicines 90% can be helped, but many hospitals won’t give pain priority and some pain-relieving drugs are banned, such as in the US morphine-based drugs because they are subject to abuse by drug addicts. Doctors are under-trained in medical schools to deal with pain. The American constitution talks about the right to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'. We have some way to go. For 17 years, Jonathan Power was a foreign affairs columnist for the International Herald Tribune.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-o83ZgXm-4UF	2024-11-05T15:29:22-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Region’s Prospects – OpEd	A little over a century ago, the region was always a net exporter o f goods and services to the outside world. Today, it is a net importer of most of what it consumes. This should pose an important question mark for the leaders of the region. How has the region changed from a net exporter of goods and services to a net importer in just over a century? It is not an easy issue to address in a short article such as this represents but one should note that the Horn of Africa States region needs to work hard. The trend we see is not comfortable and especially when we know that the region could do much better than it currently does. This is a severe drain of the meagre resources it receives through its exports and from its migrant populations outside the region. The aid and grants which is received from some helping hands cannot and will not sustain the growing population of the region. They usually take them back, these helping hands, whatever they provided through different channels including employment of their own personnel at the expense of local qualified people. As Macrotrends, a premier research platform for long term investors reports, the region continues to import more than it exports. As of 2023, the region imported some US$ 40 billion (2022: US$ 38 billion) while it exported only half of that at about US$ 20 billion (2022: US$ 18 billion). The following are compilation tables by the author of the data Macrotrends has given on the exports and imports of the Horn of Africa States. The institution does not have any information on Eritrea, but which in any way is small and would not change the trends of the region as a whole. The exports of goods and services, according to Macrotrends, 'represent the value of all goods and other market services provided to the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services. They exclude compensation of employees and investment income (formerly called factor services) and transfer payments.'

They include according to Macrotrends, 'the value of all goods and other market services received from the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services. They exclude compensation of employees and investment income (formerly called factor services) and transfer payments.'

The run into BRICS as seems to be the case on the part of Ethiopia is not the answer to the dilemma of the growing negative differential between exports and imports and should this trend continue, the region will remain to be always, as is presently the case, at the mercy of others. The region is required to correct this growing negative trade balance. Most of the imports include food imports when the region can produce more than it needs and can even export, as it used to do in the past. The region can re-initiate the old manufacturing industries and in particular, its clothing industry, its gold industry, its leather industry, and its implements industries at least to reduce the import content of these commodities and more. Energy is a substantial bill which adds to the deficit and the region is substantially endowed with local energy sources such as wind, geothermal, solar and hydropower, which it can deploy to reduce the energy import bill. Although it is easily said than done, the oil and gas reserves also offer another opportunity, which the region should emphasize on despite the trend to do away with fossil fuels. This would, however, stay with us over the next hundred some years and the region should not wait long to explore all the possibilities in this regard. Somalia already seems to be working in this respect and the other countries of the region should do the same. A positive change can only occur when there is the right attitude and the right environment. Currently the continuing civil wars and the instabilities they entail, the drifting apart of the countries of the region, and the continuing interference of foreigners in the affairs of the region are not helpful. The interference of some countries of the region in other’s internal affairs of the same region are not helping either. The Red Sea and Gulf States dynamics have also negatively impacted the region, and it is where the necessity for the region to collaborate and cooperate is needed. Apparently most foreign parties deal with each country separately and hence play on the weaknesses of each country against the other which weakens the region. A common approach of the region would have done better for the region and would have lessened the issues upon which the foreign interfering parties play. It is where an economically integrated platform for the region would have helped most, allowing for the movement of labor, capital, goods, and services to move easily between the countries of the region. Could this ever happen – an economically integrated Horn of Africa States region? It is a million Dollar question but the prospect we see, nevertheless, and it is our hope the regional leaders would revisit their books and work towards that goal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-ry51QE7HLhO	2024-11-05T15:27:09-08:00	
India On The Edge: Fractures And Fragile Relations – OpEd	As India approaches its centenary of independence in 2047, it faces a landscape fraught with both external challenges and internal discontent, revealing unsettling fractures in national unity. The inauguration of the high-altitude Sela Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh, opposed vehemently by Beijing, exemplifies the increasingly strained ties with China, as well as the precariousness of India’s regional diplomacy. This infrastructure project, intended to solidify India’s presence in a strategically sensitive zone, has intensified China’s unease. Chinese officials have openly criticized the development, viewing it as New Delhi’s attempt to assert military advantage in disputed territory (CNN, 2024; Business Today, 2024). According to South China Morning Post (2024), the Chinese response highlights Beijing’s perception of India’s border policy as overtly aggressive, a stance that could escalate beyond diplomatic protests. Such infrastructure-driven displays of strength suggest that India’s actions are not solely aimed at national security but also reveal its aspiration to dominate the region. This approach is not limited to the Sela Tunnel. India’s maneuvers on the Doklam plateau, where New Delhi stepped in to counter Chinese infrastructure projects on Bhutanese soil, underscore a growing willingness to confront China and assert its sphere of influence (The New York Times, 2024). By involving itself in Bhutan’s affairs, India not only drew China’s ire but also sent a message to smaller states that it remains a dominant power in South Asia. However, this assertive posture risks alienating its neighbors. Scholars have suggested that such a dominance-based approach aligns with the theory of hegemonic power, which posits that a state often masks its control as stability-seeking behavior but in reality undermines the sovereignty of its smaller neighbors (The Diplomat, 2019). In India’s case, Bhutan, Nepal, and even Bangladesh may perceive these moves as less about regional security and more about consolidating New Delhi’s influence at their expense. India’s strained relations with Nepal and Bangladesh further illustrate the ramifications of this hegemonic stance. With Nepal, a long-standing border dispute has fostered diplomatic friction and anti-India sentiment within Nepalese borders, reflecting broader concerns over sovereignty. In Bangladesh, relations have fluctuated, with recent tensions questioning India’s commitment to regional cooperation (BBC, 2024). For a country striving for leadership in South Asia, such rifts undermine India’s claims of being a unifying force, leaving a troubling void that could destabilize the regional order. As South China Morning Post (2024) notes, these issues exemplify the paradox of India’s regional ambition: the more it seeks to assert control, the more it risks creating a zone of instability. While these international issues challenge India’s image as a stabilizing power, internal fractures hint at an even more profound threat to its unity. Societal divisions have grown more pronounced, reflecting deep-seated grievances among various communities across the nation. As tensions rise between different groups, the potential for conflict increases, exacerbating the fragility of India’s social fabric. The central government’s focus on a majoritarian agenda, coupled with inadequate attention to the needs and rights of minority communities, has led to growing disillusionment. The result is a country where the promise of unity in diversity is increasingly called into question. The push for regional autonomy and recognition of diverse identities must be understood within the broader context of India’s federal structure, which has historically accommodated diversity through linguistic and cultural recognition. Yet, as The Diplomat (2019) observes, the increasing centralization of power under the current administration threatens to erode this delicate balance. A governance model that prioritizes regional identities over centralized control could offer a path to cohesion. But if the central government continues to dismiss these concerns, it risks widening the fault lines across different regions. India’s approach to its internal divisions must therefore become as nuanced as its diplomacy, or the calls for autonomy may evolve into a full-blown crisis of identity. Looking toward 2047, the sum of these challenges paints a picture of a country at a crossroads. India has the option to pursue a more cooperative approach, both internally and externally, that respects the aspirations of its citizens and neighbors. Externally, India would benefit from recalibrating its approach to regional disputes—pursuing dialogue and trust-building with Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh rather than asserting dominance. Domestically, it must engage constructively with all communities, acknowledging their cultural and economic needs. Through proactive measures that uphold unity within diversity, India could indeed achieve a stable and unified statehood in its centennial year. However, if these challenges are met with rigidity and indifference, India’s future may indeed hold a disquieting turn. The implications are profound: failing to mend these fractures risks a future where 2047 marks not a century of unity but the unraveling of India’s fragile cohesion—a somber reflection on a path that could have been one of resilience and unity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-tZq1YHa6Gi2	2024-11-05T15:25:34-08:00	
King Salman Invites Najib Mikati To Attend Arab-Islamic Summit Ai...	By Najia Houssari The caretaker prime minister of Lebanon, Najib Mikati, received an invitation on Tuesday from King Salman bin Abdulaziz to participate in the extraordinary joint Arab-Islamic summit scheduled for Nov. 11 in Riyadh. The summit will address Israeli assaults on the Palestinian people and Lebanese territories, coinciding with an increase in Israeli drone strikes in Beirut, southern Lebanon and Bekaa, resulting in further civilian casualties. Mikati received the invitation from Waleed Bukhari, the Saudi ambassador to Lebanon. The invitation stated that participation in the summit is a 'reaffirmation of Arab and Islamic solidarity in efforts to halt Israeli aggression and to promote the pursuit of a just resolution to the Palestinian issue, ensuring the rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.' Israel’s ground war in has completed its 44th day, and the toll since Hezbollah opened the southern front 13 months ago exceeds 3,000 dead and more than 13,000 wounded. As the assaults diminished in the southern suburbs of Beirut, residents had the chance to inspect their homes and retrieve whatever belongings they could. However, the confrontations remained intense in the southern regions, and airstrikes continued in the south and in the Bekaa region. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted the Jiyeh area, 28 km south of Beirut, killing a woman and wounding seven people — who were taken to Sibline Governmental Hospital. Airstrikes hit a building near Sheikh Ragheb Harb Hospital in Toul, and a shop in Jwaya. An airstrike on the outskirts of Bazouriyeh caused injuries, while four people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the town of Baflieh in the Tyre district. An elderly woman, Ghadia Al-Suwaid, who had insisted on staying in her home in the border town of Al-Dhayra Al-Fawqa, was suspected to have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers. The woman’s relatives told the National News Agency that 'they entered the town in the morning and did not find her.' Meanwhile, a Red Cross convoy, in coordination with UNIFIL, headed to Wata Khiam, also on the border, to complete the recovery of 15 bodies from rubble after airstrikes hit their home eight days ago. The Red Cross retrieved five bodies two days ago, but larger machinery was needed to continue clearing the rubble. An airstrike on the town of Deir Kifa killed two people and wounded several others. Israeli military vehicles were seen advancing at the Shebaa Farms toward Al-Sadana heights and Shebaa Gate, where clashes were reported between Israeli forces and Hezbollah members. On Tuesday morning, Israeli forces tried to infiltrate Rmeish but were forced to retreat after clashes with Hezbollah fighters, while in Haris an unknown motorcyclist was killed in an Israeli airstrike. In Bekaa, an Israeli drone targeted a car on the road between Hortaala and Talia, carrying a displaced family from Baalbek. The raid killed three siblings, Nathalie, Raed and Mohammed Naji Dandash, and wounded their mother, Iman Fawzat Habib, who was transferred to Dar Al Amal University Hospital. Hezbollah claimed to have struck 'a gathering of Israeli soldiers in Doviv and Ma’ale Golani barracks, and another … in the hills of Kfar Shuba. We bombed an explosives factory in Hadera, south of Haifa, with a salvo of qualitative missiles.' Israeli army spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, meanwhile, claimed that Israeli forces had destroyed 'an underground infrastructure of about 70 meters long and confiscating weapons and rocket launchers in rugged and underground areas in southern Lebanon.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLRFpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-05T15:23:39-08:00	
Iran’s First Privately Developed Satellites Launched Into Orbit O...	In a milestone for Iran’s private space sector, satellites 'Kowsar' and 'Hodhod' were successfully launched into orbit aboard a Russian Soyuz launcher, marking the country’s initial private effort in satellite production and space deployment. Iranian satellites Kowsar and Hodhod were sent into space as part of a payload carried by the Russian Soyuz launcher, which delivered 53 satellites to orbit. This launch represents a significant advancement for Iran, highlighting the first satellite manufacturing and launching attempt from its private space sector. The Kowsar satellite, weighing 30 kilograms, is a high-resolution sensing satellite designed for applications in agriculture, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. With a resolution capability of 3.45 meters, Kowsar surpasses Iran's goal of producing satellites with 10-meter ground sample distance (GSD) cameras by 2025. Kowsar has a lifespan of 3.5 years in orbit, positioned at an altitude of 500 kilometers, and is capable of capturing six frames per second over a 15-kilometer range. Its imaging is achieved using an RGB camera with 3.45-meter resolution and an NIR camera with 5.5-meter resolution, supported by a maximum platform weight of 35 kilograms. The satellite’s orbital period is 5,677 seconds, with pointing and stability accuracies of 1 degree and 0.05 degrees per second, respectively. Power is sustained by its 44 watt-hour production capacity, and it consumes 29 watt-hours to operate its payloads. Meanwhile, Hodhod serves as a small communications satellite intended to create satellite-based communication networks and enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. Targeted at regions with limited terrestrial communication access, Hodhod offers communication solutions in remote and inaccessible areas. Built to the CubeSat standard, the satellite operates in a 500-kilometer orbit and supports precision agriculture, transportation, logistics, and environmental monitoring. Its primary mission focuses on expanding IoT capabilities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLREAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-05T15:21:00-08:00	
Haiti: Convent Founded By Mother Teresa Burned Down In Continued ...	By Madalaine Elhabbal In an escalation of violence, an armed Haitian gang has looted and burned down a Missionaries of Charity convent, which had been founded by Mother Teresa herself in 1979. According to a report by Zenit news, the devastating attack took place on the night of Oct. 26. The group of attackers was led by one of Haiti’s most infamous gang leaders — ex-police officer Jimmy Chérizier, also known as 'Barbeque.' Chérizier heads up the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, a coalition of nine gangs based in the capital city, Port-au-Prince. He has been a principal agitator in efforts to topple the remnants of Haiti’s government. Chérizier and his men looted the convent and its adjacent aid dispensary before leaving the property in flames. None of the nuns were injured, as police had asked them to vacate the property a month before the attack, according to a Vatican report. The Missionaries of Charity has provided free medical care to vulnerable members of the surrounding community since its establishment, serving approximately 1,500 inpatients and 30,000 outpatients per year, according to the report. 'Stolen items are now openly sold in the market near the San José school,' Sister Paësie, founder of the Kizito Family — a religious community located in the largest slum in Port-au-Prince — told Zenit.

At the beginning of the year, six nuns belonging to the St. Anne’s congregation were abducted by gang members. Widespread chaos and violence from gangs have been rampant throughout the country since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse by a group of mostly foreign mercenaries in July 2021. Moïse had refused to vacate office after his term ended in February 2021 and had faced calls from opposition parties to step down on account of his alleged corruption and incompetence. Then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry assumed office, which provoked further aggression. Chérizier has threatened civil war if Henry does not resign. 'The situation in Port-au-Prince is unacceptable, intolerable, and inconceivable,' Father Baudelaire Martial, CSC, of the Congregation of Holy Cross told CNA in August.

Dance Of Electrons Measured In The Glow From Exploding Neutron-St...	The temperature of elementary particles has been observed in the radioactive glow following the collision of two neutron stars and the birth of a black hole. This has, for the first time, made it possible to measure the microscopic, physical properties in these cosmic events. Simultaneously, it reveals how snapshot observations made in an instant represents an object stretched out across time. The discovery was made by astrophysicists from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and is published in the international scientific journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. New method of observation shows the creation of heavy elements The collision of two neutron stars has created the smallest black hole yet observed. The dramatic, cosmic collision resulted in, apart from the birth of a black hole, a ball of fire, expanding with nearly the speed of light. In the following days it shone with a luminosity comparable to hundreds of millions of Suns. This luminous object, aka a kilonova, shines this bright because of the emission of large amounts of radiation from the decay of the heavy, radioactive elements created in the explosion. By combining the measurements of the kilonova light, made with telescopes across the Globe, an international team of researchers, led by The Cosmic DAWN Center at the Niels Bohr Institute, have closed in on the enigmatic nature of the explosion and come closer to the answer of an old, astrophysical question: Where do the elements, heavier than iron, come from? Observatories all over the Globe took part in the observations 'This astrophysical explosion develops dramatically hour by hour, so no single telescope can follow its entire story. The viewing angle of the individual telescopes to the event are blocked by the rotation of the Earth. But by combining the existing measurements from Australia, South Africa and The Hubble Space Telescope we can follow its development in great detail. We show that the whole shows more than the sum of the individual sets of data' says Albert Sneppen, PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute and leader of the new study. The explosion resembles The Universe shortly after the Big Bang Just after the collision the fragmented star-matter has a temperature of many billion degrees. A thousand times hotter than even the center of the Sun and comparable to the temperature of the Universe just one second after the Big Bang. Temperatures this extreme results in electrons not being attached to atomic nuclei, but instead floating around in a so-called ionized plasma. The electrons 'dance' around. But in the ensuing moments, minutes, hours and days, the star-matter cools, just like the entire Universe after the Big Bang. The fingerprint of Strontium is evidence of the creation of heavy elements 370,000 years after the Big Bang the Universe had cooled sufficiently for the electrons to attach to atomic nuclei and make the first atoms. Light could now travel freely in the Universe because it was no longer blocked by the free electrons. This means that the earliest light we can see in the history of the Universe is this so-called 'cosmic background radiation' – a patchwork of light, constituting the remote background of the night sky. A similar process of the unification of electrons with atomic nuclei can now be observed in the star-matter of the explosion. One of the concrete results is the observation of heavy elements like Strontium and Yttrium. They are easy to detect, but it is likely that many other heavy elements which we were unsure of the origin of, were also created in the explosion. 'We can now see the moment where atomic nuclei and electrons are uniting in the afterglow. For the first time we see the creation of atoms, we can measure the temperature of the matter and see the micro physics in this remote explosion. It is like admiring three cosmic background radiation surrounding us from all sides, but here, we get to see everything from the outside. We see before, during and after the moment of birth of the atoms', says Rasmus Damgaard, PhD student at Cosmic DAWN Center and co-author of the study. Kasper Heintz, co-author and assistant professor at the Niels Bohr Institute continues: 'The matter expands so fast and gains in size so raidly, to the extent where it takes hours for the light to travel across the explosion. This is why, just by observing the remote end of the fire ball, we can see further back in the history of the explosion. Closer to us the electrons have hooked on to atomic nuclei, but on the other side, on the far side of the newborn black hole, the 'present' is still just future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID7bxGkpaS-gs	2024-11-05T15:16:55-08:00	
Small Reductions To Meat Production In Wealthier Countries May He...	Scientists and environmental activists have consistently called for drastic reductions in meat production as a way to reduce emissions and, in doing so, combat climate change. However, a new analysis concludes that a smaller reduction, borne by wealthier nations, could remove 125 billion tons of carbon dioxide—exceeding the total number of global fossil fuel emissions over the past three years—from the atmosphere. Small cutbacks in higher-income countries—approximately 13% of total production—would reduce the amount of land needed for cattle grazing, the researchers note, allowing forests to naturally regrow on current pastureland. The return of trees—long known to effectively absorb, or sequester, carbon dioxide (CO2)—would drive significant declines in fossil fuel emissions, which the study’s authors estimate would roughly equal three years’ worth of global emissions. 'We can achieve enormous climate benefits with modest changes to the total global beef production,' says Matthew N. Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies and the lead author of the analysis, which appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). 'By focusing on regions with potentially high carbon sequestration in forests, some restoration strategies could maximize climate benefits while minimizing changes to food supplies.' The analysis found that pasturelands, especially in areas that were once forests, hold immense promise for mitigating climate change. When livestock are removed from these 'potential native forest' areas, ecosystems can revert to their natural forested state, capturing carbon in trees and soil. The paper’s authors see high- and upper-middle-income countries as viable candidates for reduction in beef production because they have some current pasture areas that do not produce very much grass per acre, exist where grass grows only during a short growing season, and are in areas that could, instead, grow vast, lush forests with deep soils that work to sequester carbon. This differs significantly from other regions, including sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where much more pasture can grow year-round, producing more feed for animals per acre than northern countries. In addition, the research team sees ways lower-income regions could increase the efficiency at which cattle are fed and raised on grass as a way to offset the minor loss in production from higher-income countries. 'This isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution,' Hayek emphasizes. 'Our findings show that strategic improvements in the efficiency of cattle herds in some areas, coupled with decreased production in others, could lead to a win-win scenario for climate and food production.' The study reveals an even more dramatic potential for climate mitigation if the scope of restoration was expanded. The researchers found that removing cattle, sheep, and other grazing livestock from all potentially natively forested areas globally could sequester a staggering 445 gigatons of CO2 by the end of this century—the equivalent to more than a decade of current global fossil fuel emissions. 'Importantly, this approach would still allow livestock grazing to remain on native grasslands and dry rangelands, which are places where crops or forests cannot easily grow,' says Hayek. 'These areas support more than half of global pasture production, meaning that this ambitious forest restoration scenario would require cutting global cattle, sheep, and other livestock herds by less than half. These findings underscore the immense potential of natural forest restoration as a climate solution.' The PNAS study used remote sensing technology to track pasture productivity—the amount of grass produced annually that livestock can consume—in order to estimate the climate benefits that reductions would yield. 'Even if two different areas can regrow the same amount of carbon in trees, we can now know how much pasture, hence beef production, we would have to lose in each area to grow those trees back,' explains Johannes Piipponen, a doctoral candidate at Finland’s Aalto University and coauthor of the study, who led this technical advance. 'For many consumers in high-income regions, like Europe and North America, reducing excessive meat consumption benefits both their health and the environment. However, until now, it has remained rather unclear where the required decreases in production could begin.' Maps produced by the team’s research can identify areas where policies could be prioritized for reducing beef production and hastening forest recovery—for instance, by offering forest land conservation incentives or buyouts to beef producers. The authors acknowledge that ecosystem regrowth is not a substitute for efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions. But, it can serve as a powerful complement to combat climate change. 'In many places, this regrowth could occur by seeds naturally dispersing and trees regrowing without any human involvement,' says Hayek. 'However, in some places, with especially degraded environments or soils, native and diverse tree-planting could accelerate forest restoration, giving regrowth a helping hand. This long-term regrowth would benefit the climate for decades to come, with significant regrowth and carbon capture beginning within just a few years in many areas, and lasting for 75 years or more until forests nearly mature.' The authors also emphasize that while the findings do not call for extreme changes to global food production and trade patterns, swift action is necessary in order to meet climate goals. 'Within the next two decades, countries are aiming to meet critical climate mitigation targets under international agreements, and ecosystem restoration on converted pasturelands can be a critical part of that,' observes Hayek. 'Our study’s findings could offer paths forward for policymakers aiming to address both climate mitigation and food security concerns. As countries worldwide commit to ambitious reforestation targets, we hope that this research can help identify and prioritize the most effective areas for carbon sequestration efforts while considering global food needs.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID3FkfDZIGQ90	2024-11-05T15:14:39-08:00	
Limited Political Choices In Capitalist Democracies – OpEd	The advanced capitalist countries—including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several Western European nations—have failed to offer their citizens a genuine range of choices in terms of availability and accessibility of multiple political parties, different ideologies, alternative policies options, and visions for the future. Despite relative prosperity and established democratic frameworks within these countries often present limited, binary options within their political systems. These dominant options based on two party system shape political discourse with policies and ideologies that are often indistinguishable. This lack of choice is not accidental; it is a deliberate design to protect the economic interests of both ruling and non-ruling elites within a capitalist framework. Although multiple political parties officially exist and registered in these advanced capitalist countries, they often exist in name only or work as interest groups. These smaller parties are frequently marginalised within mainstream political discourse, particularly in the media and in electoral democracy as elections are too expensive in a market led society. As a result, they struggle to gain visibility, which limits public awareness of diverse perspectives and reduces the influence of alternative ideas on issues crucial to both citizens and the country. This media emphasis on dominant parties narrows the spectrum of political choices available to citizens, reinforcing the status quo and restricting meaningful ideological and policy choices which are confined within two party system. This bipolarisation of politics hinders the deepening of a democracy that serves both people and the planet. The advocates of capitalism have long argued that capitalism is not only necessary condition for freedom but also essential for democracy. Such ahistorical arguments frame capitalism as the foundation upon which democracy and freedom rest. It suggests that economic liberty under capitalism naturally leads to political and social freedoms. The idea is to reinforce capitalism as central to every democratic decision-making processes, political institutions and structures of governance. Such an ideological foundation gives capitalism upper hand and weakens the foundations and functioning of democracy. The primacy of capitalism as an ideological project weakens diversities of decision-making processes within a democratic set up. Therefore, the single window systems of decision making emerged to facilitate interests of capitalism. Work and starve is not freedom, it is another form of slavery. Developed economy with deprived people in an alienated society is not ideal for human lives. The democratic systems within capitalist societies neither provide genuine freedom nor uphold true democratic values. Instead, they restrict political choices, limiting the availability of alternative political perspectives, as it is easier to manage a few elite classes than to address the needs of the working masses. Subsequently, capitalist democracy shapes society and promotes policies that align with the interests of a select few dominant elites. The dominance of two-party systems—such as the Democrats and Republicans in the USA, Labour and Conservatives in the UK, and similar polarising duality of political trends in France, Australia, and Japan—illuminates how capitalist democracies offer only limited, binary options in their electoral processes. These two dominant parties ultimately represent two different facets of capitalist interests, offering minimal choice to citizens while maintaining the status quo. Capitalism and its political cultures are incompatible with democratic diversities. It stands in opposition to fundamental democratic values, particularly freedom of political choice, which is essential for a thriving democratic society. Capitalism inherently creates cultures of democratic deficit, making true political diversity nearly impossible to realise. By streamlining political processes and consolidating decision-making, capitalism safeguards its own interests, which are threatened by democratic decentralisation. Capitalism often forms alliances with authoritarian, reactionary, feudal and religious forces and ensures their electoral victory with the help of mass media and propaganda. Therefore, capitalism often undermines robust democracies with multi-party systems, advocating for 'efficiency' as a justification for limiting political plurality and centralising power. The two leading capitalist democracies, the UK and the US, exemplify how democracy can be undermined by the bipolarisation of politics, where two dominant parties offer only two different versions of capitalist interests. This system effectively erases alternatives, even within existing democratic frameworks. Leaders like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Bernie Sanders in the United States encountered significant obstacles, as the entrenched capitalist political structures suppressed even minimal progressive, liberal, and democratic ideals. Capitalism, at its core, is fundamentally opposed to the values of democracy, prioritising the protection of property, property owners, and their interests under the guise of democratic principles. Bipolarisation of politics with two dominant political parties are concomitant with requirements of capitalism. Radical democracy can only be achieved through the political mobilisation of working people, whose struggles have the potential to deepen democracy and embrace a diversity of ideals, policies, and visions for an egalitarian society free from inequality and exploitation. It is impossible to uphold the interests of working people without continuous struggle for radical democracy. In essence, working class struggle is not only merely a fight to preserve democracy itself but also a movement to protect people from the exploitative nature of capitalism. Working class struggles are inherently struggles for democracy. It is time to embrace and celebrate the ideals of working-class struggles ensure the democratic politics and policies of peace and prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID2SGgqUU2Ifs	2024-11-05T15:12:06-08:00	
Bio-Based Fibers Could Pose Greater Threat To The Environment Tha...	Bio-based materials may pose a greater health risk to some of the planet’s most important species than the conventional plastics they are designed to replace, a new study has shown. Such materials are increasingly being advocated as environmentally friendly alternatives to plastics, and used in textiles and products including clothing, wet wipes and period products. However, microfibres of the materials are emitted into the environment through the laundry cycle, the application of sewage sludge as fertilisers, or the simple wear and tear of textile products. Despite increasing quantities of bio-based products being produced and sold all over the world, there has been little research to assess their potential impact on species and ecosystems. To address that, a new study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology tested the effects of conventional polyester fibres and two bio-based fibres –viscose and lyocell – on earthworms, a species critical to the health of soils globally. The study found that in high concentrations of fibres, 30% of earthworms died after 72 hours when exposed to polyester, while those exposed to the bio-based fibres experienced much higher mortality of up to 60% in the case of lyocell and 80% for viscose. A second experiment, using environmentally relevant concentrations of the fibres, indicated that earthworms housed in soils containing viscose fibres exhibited reduced reproduction compared to those exposed to polyester fibres. Earthworms in the soils containing lyocell fibres showed reduced growth and also higher rates of burrowing within the soil compared to exposure to the other types of fibre. The researchers say the study highlights the complex nature of global efforts to reduce the threat of microplastic pollution, and the importance of testing new materials being advocated as alternatives to plastics before they are released on the open market. The study was carried out as part of the BIO-PLASTIC-RISK project, led by researchers at the University of Plymouth and the University of Bath, and supported with £2.6million funding by the Natural Environmental Research Council. Dr Winnie Courtene-Jones, lead author on the new study and now a Lecturer in Marine Pollution at Bangor University, said: 'Over 320,000 tonnes of bio-based and biodegradable fibres were produced globally in 2022 and research shows that substantial quantities of that will end up in the environment. However, evidence of their ecological impacts has been lacking. Our study has shown that bio-based fibres have a range of adverse effects on earthworms – animals which are critical to the functioning of the environment. It highlights the importance of gathering further evidence before alternatives to conventional plastics are made available even more widely.' The new study follows research published earlier in 2024 which highlighted that being exposed to the materials used in biodegradable teabags can result in earthworm populations experiencing up to 15% greater mortality, and have a detrimental effect on earthworm reproduction. It has been published just a few weeks before the United Nations gathers world leaders meet in Busan, South Korea, for the final round of negotiations regarding a possible Global Plastics Treaty. Professor Richard Thompson OBE FRS, senior author on the new study and Head of the University of Plymouth’s International Marine Litter Research Unit, will be at those discussions along with policy makers, scientists and other delegates from across the world. He added: 'It is clear that along with recycling and re-use, tackling plastic pollution will require a reduction in the quantities of plastics used and produced. There is increasing interest in alternative materials that could be used as substitutes for plastic, but this publication further emphasises the importance of testing new innovations in relevant environmental settings prior to widescale adoption. I firmly believe it is possible to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, but independent scientific evidence will be critical in helping us avoid unintended consequences as we look for solutions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID9aJOktci3qz	2024-11-05T15:10:44-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Hails Italy’s Contributions To Euro-Atlant...	Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Italy today (5 November 2024), where he met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and President Sergio Mattarella. He underscored the importance of continuing to strengthen deterrence and defence, and step up support to Ukraine. 'Keeping our one billion people safe is NATO’s most sacred duty, and that is why we are ramping up our defence industrial capacity,' the Secretary General said, adding that 'we need to go further and faster, for our own deterrence and to support Ukraine.' The Secretary General underlined that Italy is 'a staunch and reliable Ally, contributing in many ways to Euro-Atlantic security.' He highlighted Italy’s lead of NATO’s new battlegroup in Bulgaria, its contributions to NATO’s deployments in Hungary and Latvia, and the deployment of Italy’s jets to protect Allied airspace and ships to keep crucial seaways open. 'Italy is once again leading our peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, KFOR, helping to foster stability in the Western Balkans,' he added. The Secretary General thanked Prime Minister Meloni 'for being such a strong supporter of Ukraine.' He underscored that Allies and partners 'will continue to stand by Ukraine, because Ukraine’s fight is our fight,' and welcomed Italy’s strong support for the action plan adopted at the Washington Summit for a stronger, more strategic and results-oriented approach towards NATO’s southern neighbourhood. During his visit, Secretary General Rutte also visited the Italian facilities of the defence manufacturing group Rheinmetall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYtyM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-05T09:24:23-08:00	
Beyond Russia-Africa Summits: Unlimited Opportunities And Unprece...	Under the aegis of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Roscongress, the Russia–Africa Partnership Forum will host its highly anticipated first Ministerial Conference from 9th–10th November 2024 at the Sirius Federal Territory in the southern coastal city of Sochi. According official reports, this two-day conference will be under the patronage of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the programme includes a plenary session to be attended by officials, and also round tables and discussions focusing on aspects of declarations from the first and second summits respectively held in 2019 (Sochi) and in 2023 (St. Petersburg). The programme architecture released for the first Ministerial Conference would enhance building on the strategic decisions taken both at the first and second Russia–Africa summits and bring together the heads of ministries of foreign affairs of Russia and African countries, the African Union Commission (AUC), as well as the executive bodies of regional integration associations from Africa. The heads of African regional organizations as well as representatives of government agencies, financial institutions, Russian and African businesses, public and scientific communities, and the media are part of the conference. It would be an opportunity to review the culmination, within the context of geopolitical shift at a critical stage, the evolving relations between Russia and African countries, which is high level of cooperation in several areas: from the collaboration and implementation of economic projects, energy and food security dimensions, the development of bilateral trade and investment partnerships, and scientific-technical, healthcare, tourism and education. These would broadly be discussed with special attention to cooperation between countries of the African continent and the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition, the business programme includes a presentation of the English-language version of the Africa 2025. Prospects and Challenges policy brief prepared by a team of experts at the HSE Centre for African Studies with the support of Uralchem Group, which aims to provide guidance for African experts, scientists, and decision-makers. Reviewing Sochi Summit (2019) Russia has a long time-tested relationship with Africa. After the symbolic Russia-Africa summit in the Black Sea city of Sochi in October 2019, both Russia and Africa adopted a joint declaration, a comprehensive document that outlined the key objectives and necessary tasks that seek to raise assertively the entire relations to a new qualitative level. That official document shows there has been a great interest in the further development of relations between Africa and Russia. Until the 2023 summit, priority areas of economic cooperation in which concrete results could be achieved. Documents showed 92 agreements, contracts and memoranda of understanding were signed at that first Russia-Africa summit. The agreements signed there worth a total of $12.5 billion. Reviewing St. Petersburg Summit (July 2023) The socond summit renewed the commitment to support the struggle for the eradication of colonialism and the establishment of independence of African States, and strengthening their national sovereignty. The 74 point-declaration pointed out explicitly the growing sustainable collaboration in mechanism for dialogue partnership, political and legal cooperation, strengthen cooperation between States to counter new challenges and threats, strengthen trade and economic cooperation, as well as engage Africa in comprehensive spheres including scientific and technical, humanitarian, educational, cultural, sports, health, youth and information cooperation. Joint inter-governmental Commissions Long before holding the two historic summits, there are joint commissions handling matters on trade and economic between Russia and a number of African countries. According to the official documents of Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 28 of such joint commissions were created and have been functioning admirably these several years. The primary responsibility is to coordinate projects and oversee its implementations in Africa. Until today, none has reported any completed infrastructure projects undertaken, completed and handed over to any African country since Soviet's collapse in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have never, throughout the post-Soviet history of relations between Russia and Africa, cut white ribbons marking the completion of any projects in Africa. Provision of Nuclear Energy In the nuclear power sector, here are a few developments. Russia pledged to thrash out energy deficiency which has affected more 800 million of Africa's 1.4 billion people. Energy shortage negatively affects both domestic and industrial use, and has made provision of nuclear energy its policy priority across Africa. Under an official authorized license from the Egyptian regulator and under the signed intergovernmental agreement, Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation has started the construction of the planned four power units at the El Dabaa nuclear power plant in Egypt. The bilateral agreement was signed as far back in November 2015. Research shows that Russia granted a loan $25 billion for the construction of the nuclear power plants which covers 85% of the work. The remaining expenses be covered by the Egyptian side by attracting private investors. The NPP design envisages four 1200-MW power units with VVER-1200 reactors. Construction is expected to be completed by 2028-2029. Late February 2020, Chairperson of the Federation Council (the Upper House or the Senate), Valentina Matviyenko, headed a Russian delegation on a three-day working visit aimed at strengthening parliamentary diplomacy with Namibia and Zambia. According to an official release from the Federation Council, the visit was within the broad framework mechanism of parliamentary consultations between Russia and African countries. The key focus were on political dialogue, economic partnership and humanitarian spheres with Namibia and Zambia. The delegation held talks with President Edgar Lungu at the State House in Lusaka, Zambia. Matviyenko said: 'Now the start of the construction of a center for nuclear science and technology has been suspended due to financial issues.' According to her that request was submitted to the Russian president and was being carefully considered by the ministries and departments. And it was expected to jointly find options for funding to roll out the construction of a center for nuclear science and technology. More than thirty years, Russia has been pushing for post-Soviet relations. Russia and South Africa are BRICS members. South Africa has also had nuclear contract signed with Russia back from 2015 under Jacob Zuma, at the time of his presidency. According to research sources, main reason why the 2015 nuclear power agreement thrown out by the South Africa's parliament, it attributed to the fact that the agreement was an opaque unilateral deal with Moscow. South Africa's parliament did not discuss and approve the mega-project for the country. According to analytical reports, African countries which signed agreements for such construction of nuclear plants by Russia as follows: Algeria (2014), Ghana (2015), Ethiopia (2019), Republic of Congo (2019), Nigeria (2012, 2016), Rwanda (2018), South Africa (2004), Sudan (2017), Tunisia (2016), Uganda (2019) and Zambia (2016). Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed with Kenya in 2016 and Morocco in 2017. A simple 'memorandum of understanding' on nuclear with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali in July 2023 in St. Petersburg went viral world-wide as part of Russia's information propaganda, to show its preparedness to support their development initiatives of these French-controlled African states. Sustainable Food Security Russia also has a full-fledged ambitious interest to guarantee sustainable food security by supplying grains across Africa. Russia is a leading producer as well-known. But a critical examination of this corporate deal reveals that Russia's grain supply would still remain as a soft bait (i) to reinforce the existing time-tested relationships with Africa and (ii) to earn revenue from exports to Africa. Notwithstanding that Africa is blessed with huge expanse of land and climate for agricultural production to feed its population. Some experts and international organizations have also expressed the fact that African leaders have to adopt import substitution mechanisms and use their financial resources on strengthening agricultural production systems. Establishing food security is important for millions of people facing hunger in Africa and is crucial for sustainable economic development and long-term prosperity of the continent. A few African countries have adopted import substitution, agricultural policy and strategically working towards self-sufficiency. Interfax reports indicated that Russia expected to export up to 70 million metric tonnes of grain in the 2023-2024 agricultural year. In the previous season, Russia shipped 66 million tonnes worth almost $16.5 billion. Besides that, Russia plans to earn estimated revenue amounting to $33 billion by exporting food to African countries. Military-Technical Cooperation Russia has an indivisible security relationship with many African countries. Notably, Russia's military influence has been increasing in Saharan-Sahel region, an elongated landlocked territory located between North Africa (Maghreb) and West Africa, and also stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Quite recently, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and, more significantly have also created their own military bloc, the Alliance des États du Sahel (translates in English as the Alliance of Sahel States), citing reasons as fighting frequent militant attacks and against indiscriminate manipulation by foreign governments. For better or for worse, by creating their own Alliance of Sahel States (AES), it exposes ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) powerlessness, weaknesses and its long-term inability and incompetency to deal with regional problems, particularly rising insecurity in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned this security issues during his opening and closing speeches at St. Petersburg summit and even previously, indicating its importance on Russia's agenda with Africa. At the end, both Russian and African leaders reaffirmed their collective stance to deal with the persistent ethnic conflicts and militant threats among the magnitude of wide range of priorities. In fact, there were five key documents and one of them focuses on ‘Strengthening Cooperation to Combat Terrorism’ which neatly relates to this theme under discussion. Often said that Russia has rich experiences as in developing an effective set of measures to counter terrorism, curtail illegal activity, and provide dependable protection for citizens. Therefore, Russia's Ministry of Defense together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs express profound readiness to coordinate in sharing their experiences with African partners, particularly in the Saharan-Sahel. Revisiting the first summit declaration which says in part, 'firm intention to fully contribute to achieving peace and security' points to the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity on these countries in the region. The first primary step is implementing joint programmes to build the necessary capacity of the requesting African States and train African peace-keeping personnel at specialized educational institutions of the Russian Federation and inside African States. It has to be noted clearly that Russia works for its revenue from increased exports. Therefore, several agreements signed would allow Russia a full access to exploring natural resources in exchange for its military assistance. Updatedly, Russia has signed bilateral military-technical cooperation agreements with more than 20 African countries. Notable Quotes – Federation Council Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachev told a roundtable on Russia's strategic interests in Africa at Valdai Discussion Club, that Russia's Western opponents are trying to prevent African states from taking part in Russia-Africa summits. In Senator Kosachev's opinion, several meetings, conferences and summits have been successful, 'but, in many respects, its results remained within the dimension of politics' and were not translated into additional projects in trade, economic, scientific or humanitarian cooperation. 'Trade turnover speaks for itself. Roughly, the European Union’s trade with Africa stands at around $300 billion, China's – at around $150 billion, and the United States – approximately $50-60 billion. Despite the tendency to grow, our current turnover is around $20 billion,' Senator Kosachev added, quoting trade figures to illustrate his argument. – Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Jacob Mudenda, during the conference on Russia-Africa, organized within the framework of International Development on Parliamentarism forum in March 2023 said: 'participation in the conference is another opportunity to discuss many issues, compare positions, develop solutions and give impetus to further cooperation, but it is important to turn words into concrete actions.' He further argued that it was distinctively evident from the large number of African delegations that had been invited, so far, to Moscow over the past few years, and that marked a new chapter to re-activate relations with Africa. But, Russia's influence might not take roots anytime soon if the conference declarations are not vigorously and promptly implemented. Russia-African Interactive Symbolism The history of Russia–Africa Summit is the highest-profile and largest-scale event in Russian–African relations, aimed at bringing about a fundamentally new level of mutually beneficial partnership to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The goal of the event is to promote efforts to strengthen comprehensive and equal cooperation between Russia and African nations across all areas of society including politics, security, economic relations, science and technology, and the cultural and humanitarian spheres. The first Russia–Africa Summit took place on 23–24 October 2019 in Sochi under the motto of ‘For Peace, Security and Development’. This was the first time such a large-scale event had been held in the history of modern Russia, and was unprecedented in Russian–African relations. The second Russia–Africa Summit was held in July 2023 in St. Petersburg under the the same motto of ‘For Peace, Security and Development’. This was the second time such a large-scale with participation of high-level government delegations from both sides, and was described as unprecedented in bilateral relations. At both Summits the participants identified priority areas of economic cooperation where concrete results could be achieved in subsequent years. At the closing in Sochi and St. Petersburg, declarations were adopted outlining the approval of goals and objectives for the future development of Russian–African cooperation across politics, security, economics, science and technology, culture and the humanitarian sphere. Logical and Final Words Much time has elapsed, but meetings, conferences and summits are consistenly organized to review the past and current stage of relations. Russia and Africa are the new centers of the emerging multipolar world. But more admittedly, Africa has become competitive but still continues attracting external players to significant sectors. In this context, Russia undoubtedly needs to adopt its approaches and mechanisms necessary for driving effective cooperation in order to take the relations to the next level in this new changing conditions of global politics and economics. Basic questions, often and simultaneously asked are: what steps are needed to give a new impetus to bilateral economic relations? What are the key initiatives and competencies that can create a deeper strategic partnership between Russia and Africa? Regardless of the fact that the continent has enormous reources both natural and human, Africa's development issues are still very lamentable, and leaders are excited at Africa being described as poorest in the world. In a nutshell, African leaders pay lip service in pursuit of working towards attaining their own economic sovereignty. In fact 80% of Africa's population still live in abject poverty. The Global Development Index shows that African governments continue to pursue trivial development questions, poor governance and deep-seated corruption. In practical terms, Africa has rather exposed the collective weaknesses, inability to sharpen development priorities, gross mismanagement and incompetencies of Africa leaders. It is shameful and incredible for characterizing being used as pawns in geopolitical reconfiguration, but instead African leaders essentially have to take cognizance of the key necessity and acknowledge the popular hyperbolic saying ‘African problems, African solutions’ and/or alternatively the ‘Africa We Want’ within the framework of the Agenda 2063 as widely propagated by the continental organization - the African Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYtzK9wBhb35rc	2024-11-05T09:22:28-08:00	
One Person, One Vote, One Joke…On Democracy – OpEd	As Americans, we hold dear several core democratic values, none more basic than 'one person, one vote.' But our contemporary economic realities have essentially obliterated this core value’s essence. 'One person, one vote,' we’re relearning this year, simply cannot exist in an America where a single individual can hold 1.4 million times more wealth than the typical American household. That particular single individual, Elon Musk, currently holds a personal fortune worth over $260 billion. The net worth of America’s median family, according to the latest Federal Reserve data? Less than $200,000. How much of Musk’s fortune — and the fortunes of his fellow super rich — is going into the 2024 presidential and congressional elections? A just-released report from Americans for Tax Fairness has found that 150 of America’s wealthiest have already contributed $1.9 billion to the candidates they find most friendly to how our richest see the world. That $1.9-billion total, Americans for Tax Fairness points out, will most likely run well over $2 billion by the time this year’s election dust has settled. But that same $1.9 billion has already surpassed, by a stunningly wide margin, the $1.2 billion that over 600 billionaires spent on electing presidential and congressional candidates in 2020. Who’s benefiting from all this billionaire loot? Nearly three-quarters of this $1.9 billion — 72 percent — is going to support Republican candidates. The Democratic Party candidate share: 22 percent. And how much wealth will the 150 billionaires that Americans for Tax Fairness has been tracking have left in their personal fortunes after subtracting their hundreds of millions in 2024 political contributions? Plenty. The $1.9 billion these super rich have laid out so far amounts to a mere 0.07 percent of their collective $2.67 trillion in wealth. Musk himself had at last count poured at least $133 million into electing his favorite candidates, with Donald Trump by far and away the biggest beneficiary. That sum almost certainly understates what Musk is actually spending on campaign 2024. Billionaires like Musk, analysts at Open Secrets note, can also contribute anonymously to political campaigns through 'dark money' groups that need not reveal their donors. Let’s assume for a moment that Musk’s overall outlay for Trump’s election ends up in the vicinity of $200 million, less than 1 percent of his personal net worth. In backing Trump, he could hardly be making a more profitable investment. With Trump once again in the White House, Musk could look forward to lower tax bills, better access to lucrative federal contracts for his SpaceX, and fewer regulations on the rest of his sprawling business empire. He would be richer than ever. And so would the rest of his super-rich peers. Should we fear for our democracy at that prospect? We most certainly should, as the New Yorker’s Charles Duhigg makes frighteningly clear in his just-published analysis of Silicon Valley’s enormous new political power. Back in 1982, the year Forbes began annually publishing a list of America’s 400 richest, Big Oil dominated the upper ranks of America’s richest. Nine of our wealthiest 15 on that initial top 400 list owed their good fortune to the oil industry. High-tech now dominates the Forbes 400. On the 2024 Forbes 400, billionaires who owe their fortunes to high-tech occupy 10 of the top 15 slots. Like their Big Oil predecessors, today’s high-tech rich haven’t just accumulated great wealth. They have gained enough of a political punch to make elected leaders think twice before getting in the way of anything Big Tech wants to see happen. The most brazen of today’s Big Tech punchers now come from the highly speculative cryptocurrency sector. Silicon Valley venture capital firms have invested billions into crypto. These same investors have invested mega-millions in super PACs, with the prime goal, the New Yorker’s Duhigg details, 'of convincing politicians that the political consequences of being anti-crypto would be intensely painful.' The crypto crowd chose the California U.S. Senate primary this past March as a high-profile opportunity to get that message across. That primary drew a host of candidates, all seeking to become one of the top two finishers who would square off against each other in the November election. This broad field included Rep. Katie Porter, a nationally known consumer champion. Crypto’s movers and shakers decided to go all-out in the primary against her. Porter, for her part, had never devoted much attention to crypto. But that didn’t matter. For the crypto crowd, getting into the California Senate race against Porter, a popular member of Congress, would be an ideal opportunity to intimidate other politicians, 'to warn anyone running for office,' as an industry insider told the New Yorker, 'that, if you are anti-crypto, the industry will come after you.' Crypto’s top super PAC would go on to deluge California’s airwaves with ad spots that blasted Porter as a 'bully' and a 'liar,' never mentioning anything about crypto at all. Porter ended up finishing third with a mere 15 percent of the primary vote. Message delivered. 'Candidates in New York, Arizona, Maryland, and Michigan,' notes the New Yorker’s Duhigg, soon 'began releasing crypto-friendly public statements and voting for pro-crypto bills.' Crypto-related super PACs have so far spent over $100 million on 2024 political races. Donald Trump, predictably, has now emerged as an exuberant crypto champion, and crypto dollars have played key roles in the primary defeats of two high-profile congressional progressives, New York’s Jamaal Bowman and Missouri’s Cori Bush. The sort of billionaire muscle-flexing that Big Oil and now Big Tech have inflicted upon American politics, we need to keep in mind, has an impact that goes beyond the political fates of individual politicians. That muscle-flexing serves to keep off the table any serious discussion of America’s fiercely unequal distribution of income and wealth. Ever notice one of those pre-election polls that ask the American public to rate the importance they give to the 'issues' facing the nation. The Pew Research Center, for instance, this past spring did extensive polling on what the Center deemed 16 'top problems' facing the United States, everything from inflation and illegal immigration to domestic terrorism and the affordability of health care. Nothing on that Pew list directly highlighted any aspect of our deep-seated economic inequality. The Pew 'issues' list made no reference whatsoever to concerns ranging from billionaire political influence to the vast gap between CEO and worker pay. And that should not surprise us. Inequality-avoiding 'issue' lists reflect the logical consequence of what happens in modern societies where wealth sits explosively concentrated. That wealth funds the think tank reports that shape the nation’s ongoing dialogue over what issues matter. That same wealth owns our nation’s most influential mass media and can strike fear, as the crypto political saga demonstrates, in lawmakers who don’t toe the plutocratic line. In the 2024 election cycle, that concentrated wealth has, by and large, gone unchallenged. We can’t afford to let that happen again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYt9YhHtUTRrHG	2024-11-05T09:20:06-08:00	
The Jerusalem Temple And Its Older Brother: The Ka’ba – OpEd	Narrated Abu Dhar: I said, 'O Allah's Messenger, which mosque was first built on the surface of the earth?' He said, 'Al- Masjid-ul-,Haram (in Mecca).' I said, 'Which was built next?' He replied 'The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in Jerusalem) .' I said, 'What was the period of construction between the two?' He said, 'Forty years.' (Sahih al-Bukhari 3366 In-book reference : Book 60, Hadith 45 USC-MSA web (English) reference : Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 585) The Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) and the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca are the two most well-known sites for monotheistic pilgrimage in the world. The Islamic Hajj to the Ka'ba in Makkah, and the Jewish Hajj to the Temple in Jerusalem, have been alternate swings of a single sacred pendulum connecting earthly humans to one monotheistic Divine source in the heavens. The Ka'ba was the original site of the Islamic Hajj. Destroyed in the days of Noah, it was later rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. After several centuries it was desecrated by later generations of idol worshipers. During the centuries while the Ka'ba was desecrated, Prophet Solomon built a Temple in Jerusalem for Jewish Haj on the site where Abraham bound his son Isaac as an offering to God. Four centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed in 587 BCE by the Babylonians. Then the Temple was rebuilt with the support of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, and lasted for almost six centuries. As Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE) states; Jewish pilgrims came to Jerusalem from the ends of the earth, and from all the compass points. But with the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, the pilgrimage Hajj aspect of the week-long harvest festival of Hag Sukkot, began a gradual decline in the spiritual consciousness of the Jewish People. The first time Hag/Hajj is mentioned in the Torah is in that famous scene when Prophets: 'Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go into the wilderness, that they may hold a feast (Hag) for me.'' [Exodus 5:1]or better: 'And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a Hajj/pilgrimage feast for me in the wilderness.'' But that one-time Hajj never occurred because Pharaoh refused to free the Jewish People thus incurring Divine wrath. The normative annual two Jewish Hajj week-long pilgrimages was the liberation celebration of Haj Passover; and especially the gratitude celebration of the harvest festival of Haj Sukkot. The Torah declares: 'Celebrate Hajj Sukkot for seven days after you have harvested the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns...Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Hajj of Matzah (Passover), the Hajj of Weeks, and the Hajj of Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 16:13-16) Hajj Sukkot was so important during the centuries when Solomon's Temple stood that the holy week of Sukkot was often called simply 'the Hajj' because of the very large numbers of Jews who came up to the Temple in Jerusalem. Hajj Passover is also celebrated as a weeklong pilgrimage. The third Hajj of Weeks is similar to Islamic Umrah, the non-mandatory lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, which may be performed at any time of the year. Although they share common rites, Umrah can be performed in less than a few hours; while Hajj is more time-consuming and involves many more rituals. The third Jewish Hajj of Weeks, like Umrah, is much simpler than Hajj Passover and can be performed in less than a few hours; on any one day during the seven weeks following Hajj Passover. The Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is the largest mosque in the world and it surrounds one of Islam's holiest places, the Ka-ba. Unlike other mosques which are gender segregated, men and women can worship at the Al-Masjid Al-Haram together. The Holy Temple (Beit ha-Mikdash) of Jerusalem had two successive Temples on the Temple Mount where there now stands the Dome of the Rock. The Jerusalem Temple complex was separated into different areas where male priests, men, women and non-Jews could all come to worship the one God. Why is the Ka'ba the older brother of the Jerusalem Temple? Prophet Abraham is connected to both sacred sites. Prophets Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the destroyed Ka'ba; and 40 years later, Prophets Abraham and Isaac were tested on the hill where the Jerusalem Temple would someday be built by Prophet Solomon. Since Islam is the last of the Abrahamic religions it is the most universal of them. Since Judaism is the first, and for over twelve centuries the only ongoing monotheistic religion, it is the least universal and the most pluralistic and tribal of the three Abrahamic religions. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for more than a dozen centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Prophet Abraham, the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) was the first, and only prophet, to successfully establish, through the descendants of his own two sons, three ongoing monotheistic religions, that have lasted into the 21st century: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; that now make up about half of the world's population. Judaism discourages people who are interested in converting to Judaism because Judaism is the only true religion. Indeed, most non-Jews who become Jewish do it to unify a marriage or because they have a Jewish ancestor even if they do not yet know it. Judaism is not a missionary faith and so doesn't actively try to convert non-Jewish people (in many countries anti-Jewish laws prohibited converting to Judaism for centuries). However, the modern Jewish community increasingly welcomes would-be converts. A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism. As Prophet Micah (4:5) states: 'For all the (other) peoples walk each in the name of its god; and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.' Five hundred years before the birth of Prophet Muhammad Rabbi Yishmael, one of Judaism's most important rabbis was recorded as saying: 'In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel ... They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple, and construct a building (the Dome of the Rock) on the site of the (ruined by the Romans) sanctuary'. Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) There is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. Just as the Ka'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). When all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Prophet Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Prophet Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBpWgqOMKUrZz	2024-11-05T09:18:38-08:00	
The Rise Of Political Extremism In Pakistan: A Test For Democrati...	As Christophe Jaffrelot observed, 'Pakistan has been branded by scholars as, among other things, an ideological state (like Israel) because of the political interpretation of Islam by its founding father.' Quaid-e-Azam promoted Islamic ideology not to stir up extremism, but to bring about unity and progress. However, the scenario at that time turned out to be quite different. He was firm in his beliefs until his death in 1948. His ideology never gave way to extremism. Today, the legacy of religious symbolism has shifted, often taken advantage of for political gains, and is now chipping away at the democratic foundations of Pakistan. The Political Utility of Religion Successive Pakistani leaders have learned to wield religious sentiment for political advantages. For example, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (1971-77) jumped on the bandwagon of Islamic socialism. General Zia-ul-Haq (1977-88) laid down strict Sharia law. Benazir Bhutto (1988-1990, 1993-1996) was not as overt as Zia, but she played the religious card to curry favor with conservatives. The Sharif family (1990-1993, 1997-1999, 2013-2017, 2024-present) kept up the tradition of using the religious card to win over public support. Imran Khan, the so-called Oxford graduate, went even further to win hearts and minds locally. In this regard, the U.S. president Ronal Reagan once said, 'If we ever forget that we are One Nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.' He stressed the connotation of recognizing the role of a higher power in guiding and unifying a nation. His objectives were to bring together the nation. However, the religious misinterpretation has widened the gap among Pakistanis. Addressing these issues requires us to look into the roots of the problem, stand up to extremist ideologies, reach out to different communities, break down barriers, and set aside differences to build a more inclusive society. Extremism’s Challenges to Democracy Religious radicalism has taken a firm hold in Pakistan's political mainstream. Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which entered the political mainstream in 2015, has garnered massive public support. They have staged massive sit-ins in Punjab until their demands were met. They wield strong public support and can bring the whole of Punjab to a standstill. If this issue is not nipped in the bud, it could spiral out of control. The empowerment of religious extremism tarnishes Pakistan's international standing. Evidence of this is Pakistan's placement on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list due to terror financing concerns. Economic Hardship as Fertile Ground for Extremism On the economic front, Pakistan is weathering the storm of the toughest period in its history. The lack of employment is adding fuel to the fire of misery. With a population of 220 million, more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. Inflation is on the rise with each passing day. In early 2023, inflation skyrocketed to nearly 38%, placing immense strain on lower- and middle-class households. As Aristotle said in this regard, 'Poverty Is the Parent of Revolution and Crime.' Poverty is the mother of crimes. Indeed, it can even lure in the educated class, who are like navigating a storm without hope of return. The lack of economic opportunities and high unemployment rates open the door for the youth to fall under the spell of extremist leaders, who are wandering like lost falcons. This creates fertile ground for the young population to soak up extremist ideas because they have too much time on their hands. It's essential for the government to step up and address these issues to turn the tide and curb the spread of extremism. The Role of Political Polarization The democratic history of Pakistan is rife with ups and downs. Political instability has become the norm. Leaders put their vested interests first, leaving the common people to bear the brunt of the consequences. Recently, the political rivalry between Imran Khan and the Democratic alliances has reached a boiling point, where it does not seem likely to return to normal. This widening gap further erodes the common will and their belief in democracy. Regional Security Implications The rise of extremism threatens the very fabric of South Asia's socio-economic stability. The resurgence of the Afghan Taliban in 2021, can embolden extremist organizations. The long, porous border cannot be properly monitored and sealed as it requires extensive resources, time, and effort. The government should keep a close watch on extremist ideology before it creates fertile ground for terrorism, like the TTP, to sink deeper roots in Pakistan. If this issue is not addressed promptly, it could snowball into an unmanageable crisis. In this scenario, the Kashmir issue paints a unique picture. For decades, Pakistan has been playing the religious card to rally massive support for the cause of Kashmir. Tension over the Kashmir issue creates a space for ultra-religious groups to push their narrative and gain traction. Pakistan leverages extremist ideology to drum up support and generate freedom fighters against India. In this regard, when the state nurtures extremism, there should be a proper cost-benefit analysis. Does this extremism provide short-term gains, or does it pose more challenges to the democracy upon which Pakistan was founded? Policymakers should tread carefully to ensure this does not pose a threat to the democratic values that are the bedrock of Pakistan's foundation. Strengthening Democratic Institutions as a Path Forward Countering extremism requires a multi-pronged approach, putting political differences aside and recognizing the urgency of the moment. Before the nation faces another wave of terrorism, it’s crucial to take action. Extremism plants the seeds of ideologies, which later morph into terrorism. First and foremost, economic reforms are the need of the hour. Poverty initiative programs like the Ehsaas program need to be ramped up and get to the bottom of the real causes of poverty. With a population of 220 million, more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. This sows the seeds of threats to democratic norms and values. When democratic societies are built on extractive politics, it shakes the very foundations of peace at the grassroots level. Unfortunately, Pakistan's education expenditure is in a miserable state. The outdated curriculum churns out degrees instead of skills. According to the World Bank report in 2022, Pakistan spends only 1.97 per cent of its GDP on education, whereas the tiny island of Maldives forks out4.58 per cent, Bhutan pumps in 4.7 per cent, and Nepal allocates 3.2 percent of their GDP. The meager investment in education means more illiterates will come out of a population of over 220 million. The more illiterate people there are, the more prone to extremism the nation becomes. Education can lay the groundwork for tolerance. Conclusion Political extremism is one of the biggest threats Pakistan is grappling with today. If it remains unchecked, it will not only threaten peace and stability at the domestic level, but also tarnish the nation's reputation on the international stage. It is high time for leaders to get to the root of the issue before the curse of extremism takes deeper root. Leaders should ramp up investment in education and bolster democratic institutions. By eradicating the curse of high illiteracy rates and tackling the root causes of extremism, the nation can secure its democratic future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBiCPTXDW2KOw	2024-11-05T09:16:48-08:00	
The ICC Case Against Hasina Wajid – OpEd	The recent downfall of Sheikh Hasina's regime in Bangladesh has opened a Pandora's Box of allegations against her government. As the dust settles, international attention has turned to the darker side of her 15-year rule, marked by widespread human rights abuses, political oppression, and a systematic dismantling of democratic norms. A plea filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) accuses Hasina Wajid of crimes against humanity, reigniting a debate on her government's brutal tactics to suppress dissent and consolidate power. The ICC plea against Hasina Wajid revives longstanding grievances about her alleged involvement in suppressing dissent, which her opponents claim echoes her father’s controversial legacy. Sheikh Hasina, during her back-to-back 15-year rule, had decimated the opposition and shut all safety valves, resulting in a volcanic eruption of public anger. Her opponents claimed her government had indulged in corruption, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. In addition, the administration, along with supporters of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, had fought pitched battles with demonstrators. At least 300 people were reportedly killed. This was the build-up to her eventual departure, which was followed by the Bangladesh army chief announcing an interim set-up. The unceremonious departure of the 'Iron Lady' marked the end of a governing paradigm that is best characterised as a competitive authoritarian regime, which, without the protests, may have transitioned into a one-party autocracy. While the immediate cause of her toppling stems from protests against the quota system, Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies and sense of invincibility had been creating structural conditions for eventual reckoning. Bangladeshi voices have consistently accused Hasina of targeting Islamic scholars and opposition figures, highlighting a deep-rooted concern over freedom and democracy under her rule. The recent deaths of students during protest intensify fears about human rights violations, fueling speculation that this violence stems from political motives backed by influential foreign allies. Since 2009, Hasina had ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist. Systematically, she clamped down all political opponents. Her main political rival, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who served twice as prime minister, was caught in a web of legal cases and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2018. The leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami also faced brutal persecution; many of them were convicted and executed by a so-called international crimes tribunal. In the final days before her unceremonious end, Hasina had exhorted Awami League supporters to fight the demonstrators, which brought the country to the brink of a civil war. Indian intelligence agency RAW’s support of Hasina raises concerns among Bangladeshis who fear that foreign interference is destabilizing their nation’s sovereignty. Allegations of Hasina’s involvement in the genocide of Bengali Muslims in prior decades have resurfaced, with many citing these claims as part of a larger pattern of state-led repression. The global community has turned a blind eye to Hasina’s government actions, calling for international accountability to prevent further bloodshed. The current charges bring an unprecedented spotlight on Bangladesh’s history of authoritarianism, raising questions about democratic erosion in South Asia. Hasina’s crackdowns on Islamic scholars were attempts to consolidate power by marginalizing voices she perceives as threats to her political ideology. The ICC plea serves as a critical test for Bangladesh’s judicial independence, as many question whether local courts would have pursued these charges under political pressure. Calls for justice are echoing beyond Bangladesh, with rights organizations urging the ICC to address these alleged crimes and set a precedent for protecting human rights in the region. India provided covert support to Hasina, enabling her to create a parallel military force within Bangladesh, which some claim has roots in the Mukti Bahini—an alliance viewed as an extension of India’s influence within the country. Hasina’s close ties with India have enabled her to control Bangladesh’s security forces, allegedly using a network reminiscent of the Mukti Bahini to silence dissent and enforce pro-India policies under the guise of national security. India’s backing allowed Hasina to cultivate a 'shadow army' that operates with little accountability, reviving fears of a Mukti Bahini-like entity acting as a tool of intimidation against political opponents and Islamic groups. As South Asia’s longest-ruling authoritarian leader, Hasina spent her entire politics controlling all the unknowns through authoritarian approaches. Ironically, it was these very approaches that ultimately cemented her downfall. Only time will tell if justice will prevail in Bangladesh. The ICC case against Hasina Wajid marks a pivotal moment in the nation's history, raising hopes for accountability and a brighter future. As the world watches, the outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications for the region and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBmLfZrvquG-s	2024-11-05T09:15:17-08:00	
Kamala Would Be A Great President, One Of the Best, And Trump Doe...	The name of the president of the most powerful countries in the world will soon be known. I hope that Kamala will be named president of the US, a country that, contrary to what is not recognized by ungenerous critics, has led a unique cultural leadership in the history of the planet. And this is the fact to be celebrated while waiting for the appointment of the next president. And this is one of the greatest contributions that we could expect from a Kamala victory. Knowledge is democracy. Knowledge is the highroad to the end of discrimination, the real virus of life’s desease. Respect of law is democracy. We should remember that in the contest between Kamala and Donald. With America we have entered the democracy of knowledge era, departing from a time of unlimited masses of individuals historically ignored by the development of knowledge and kept at levels of total and perennial inferiority. Never in the cultural history of humanity has there been anything comparable to the democracy of knowledge in terms of numbers, produced by the Internet and now by AI. Thank you America! We owe you gratitude for this unparalled democratic achievement in all parts of the world. Again, knowledge is democracy. The passage of writing from symbols and ideograms to letters made it possible to transcribe possible knowledge. This was a great step in democracy. The introduction of movable type made knowledge available to all who could read. An even higher step in the democracy process. Certainly the institution of the Justinian code was a incredible cultural revolution because for the first time the public power was considered as a citizen and obliged to respect the laws, and this was made available in writing to the courts. Again a giant step forward for democracy. The persistence of common law instead of codified law is a cultural legal delay that opens the way to discrimination and arbitrariness. In substance, all great cultural achievements made with regard to democracy were linked to knowledge. That is why the Internet and AI revolutions are one of the largest planetary democratic revolutions for the masses to have ever occurred. America has made it possible. Today all of us, in the Western and Eastern worlds, North and South, are indebted to the USA for this spectacular democratic revolution of knowledge, a revolution that is improving production, the quality of health and above all favors access to knowledge without national or caste limits to billions of individuals of any nation, ethnicity: this is the most phenomenal gift of the democracy of knowledge produced by America. Let’s not forget this, and it should be remembered for whatever one might say about say about politicians, including Trump, that this gigantic step forward for democracy is the result of private initiative, of the market, of business, not of the government. The merit of the American government is that it has not conditioned private initiative, but even promoted it for security reasons, That is a matter of fact. Of course, there are downsides to American politics that should not be ignored in terms of democracy in foreign states. Often it protects leaders who aren't democratic, say for instance in South America, but as the old American saying goes, 'there is no such thing as a free lunch.' But what does this introduction on knowledge and democracy have to do with the electoral outcome that is expected? It has everthing to do with it because the United States is, and remains, the driving force of modern progress in the entire world -- and those who benefit from this in the rest of the world must recognize this beyond the differences between the two candidates. For me, Kamala is a fantastic candidate who would bring back the role of law to American society. She would do it, because she is an intelligent woman in her own right, she is not the result of media manipulations. She would certainly make possible a phenomenal cultural leap in gender equality that Obama was unable to produce due to racaial discrimination. We would have expected Obama to take a historic step in this fight against discrimination - an area in which instead he failed. Obama as the first black president should have eradicated racism from America, betraying just expectations. Just as we would expect from a Jewish American president a definitive eradication of religious reasons from political discrimination, as did Kennedy as a Catholic president. Today, or rather yesterday in 2020, no one cared that Biden was Catholic, just as nobody should care if XY president were jewish. There are cultural political expectations that non-Americans expect from America. Those same reasons that lead us to condemn in no uncertain terms the racist and disriminatory policy of Benjamin Netanyahu who is succeeding in the epic enterprise of alienating Israel from the favor of those who consider the Holocaust a heinous tragedy to be remembered continuously. Kamala is a special person. If she wins the election, I believe she will be an exceptionally good president. However, Kamala has also failed to understand that there are two elements in the Trump campaign of enormous significance for the United States and for the world. That is in the area domestic politics and the other in international politics. With respect to domestic politics, we must condemn the tax exemption of the super-rich that Trump will promote, whether they are individuals or companies. But we must not forget that they constitute the most powerful engine of American development and that as such must be protected and safeguarded. The American dynamo is one of innovation and entrepreneurial culture, small and large. Trump defends this, but he is does so in the wrong way. On the international level, the fact that the Ukraine war was heavily funded against Russia with NATO aggression through the increasingly stringent encirclement of that country is a resounding diplomatic error. There is a historian of economics of great value who teaches at my alma mater, Columbia University, Jeffrey Sachs who makes this magnificently clear. Ukraine is a sharp thorn in Russia's side that NATO, ignoring Secretary of State Baker's commitments to Gorbachev, and violates a total absence of historical sense and diplomatic vision. The Ukrainian war, certainly fostered even if not justified, by efforts to bring NATO a stone's throw from Moscow, has caused a strengthening of Russia and China relations, which a diplomat like Zbigniew Brzezinski would have judged to be one of the greatest possible diplomatic mistakes in American history. Trump says he will correct this situation and that is a very good thing. As I said above, I believe Kamala will be a phenomenal president if she is elected. But if the next president is Trump, with all his blatant flaws, he has good points in the vast area of things we don’t like. Let's expect from him two great policies worthy of the best cause that must be respected in the best interest of Europe itself. Pushing for entrepreneurship in America is good, very good, and solving peacefully Ukraine’s war is even better. Both goals are worth pursuing not only in the interest of America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBpkqqfhnNjbd	2024-11-05T09:12:34-08:00	
Beyond The Revolution: Building A New Bangladesh – Analysis	By Rimon Tanvir Hossain (FPRI) -- Once touted as the 'Iron Lady' of Asia, Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was both the longest-serving Bangladeshi head of state and the world’s longest-serving female. However, on August 5, 2024, her reign came to an unceremonious end as a student-led revolution, which started after the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstated a quota system for government jobs on June 5, 2024, forced her to flee to India and resign from office. Today, 'July 36' refers to the date of Hasina’s resignation and subsequent collapse of her Awami League government, which has also been heralded in pop culture as Bangladesh’s 'Second Independence.' According to a report by the Human Rights Support Society, more than 30,000 people were injured and more than 875 were killed in the collective unrest, 77 percent of whom died from gunshot wounds. While Nobel laureate and social entrepreneur, Dr. Muhammad Yunus’s appointment to lead the fifty-three-year-old nation—born after a revolution celebrated and strongly supported by Western capitals to provide Bangladesh a fresh start—was positively received at home and abroad, his task of assuring that the country’s institutions regain public trust, once captured by Hasina’s fifteen-year electoral autocracy, is daunting. The growing challenges ranging from Islamist parties, communal tensions, surging inflation, and inability to hold perpetrators of the revolution’s victims accountable seem distant from reaching the solutions the Yunus-led interim government promised: establishing reforms in the election commission, civil administration, and implementing judiciary and security forces in time for the upcoming elections. The Roots of Unrest: The Quota Reform Movement The student-led protests, initially known as the Quota Reform Movement, sought to change the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) quota which was done away with in 2018 but brought back with the June 5, 2024, High Court decision. The BCS Quotas have a deeper connection to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, due to the fact that 30 percent of the 56 percent of reserved civil service positions were reserved for descendants of Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters ('Muktijuddhos'). The Muktijuddhos fought against the Pakistan Army and helped win independence in the nine-month war with Indian and Soviet support. Over the years, the fact that the biggest quota—relative to the 10 percent of positions reserved for women, 10 percent reserved for people from underdeveloped districts, 5 percent for indigenous people, and 1 percent for people with disabilities—went to families strongly associated with the Awami League for their role in winning the 1970 Pakistan General Elections (which led to full-scale war) became increasingly perceived as a base forconsolidating the Awami League through entrenchment in the state bureaucracy. The BCS positions offered stable, lifelong employment with government-provided cars, housing, and other benefits, which the students leading the protests argued was designed to favor Awami League supporters. Rising youth unemployment, which has gone from 8 percent when Hasina came to power in 2008 to 16 percent, coupled with bias in the state bureaucracy to provide loans and other benefits to private-sector leaders associated with the Awami League, further added to the intensity of this Quota Reform Movement. Behind the quota was the even larger electoral autocracy operated by Hasina and her Awami League party, who after winning her electoral mandate in 2008, continually crushed the opposition and repeated this every five years through ballot stuffing, strong-arming the media, and voter intimidation. The US State Department issued stern warnings ahead of both the 2018 election and prior to the most recent January 2024 election. Deputy Assistant Secretary of South and Central Asian Affairs Afreen Akhter offered Hasina an ultimatum to allow for a caretaker-run election in October 2023, which the Awami League abolished in 2011. In the lead-up to the most recent January 2024 election, the Awami League also faced US and E.U. scrutiny and even sanctions with regard to their domestic security forces—namely, their elite paramilitary force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). On December 10, 2021, the US Treasury Department placed sanctions on RAB as well as its former and current leaders for human rights abuses. Sweden-based investigative and public interest journalism platform founded in 2019 by exiled Bangladeshi journalist Tasneem Khalil, Netra News, also reported how RAB ran a secret prison for dissidents and other opponents to the Hasina regime called 'Aynaghor' (House of Mirrors). This was followed by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s May 24, 2023, announcement of visa restrictions on former and current pro-Awami League and opposition officials for undermining democracy ahead of the January 2024 elections. A statement issued by the US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller mentioned 'these individuals include members of law enforcement, the ruling party, and the political opposition' and that 'their immediate family may be found ineligible for entry into the United States.' Ultimately, Hasina evaded all these carrots and sticks to allow a free and fair election on January 2024, while the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the election. This timeline of sanctions and other disciplinary measures made by the United States was put into perspective within the Biden administration’s wider democracy promotion campaign, of which Bangladesh was a clear target for its strong people-to-people ties, business and trade interests, and diaspora-lobbying with respect to human rights. The Quota Reform Movement in the perspective of this wider US democracy promotion agenda proves that the Hasina regime was unwise not to heed warnings and shot itself in the foot by relentlessly capturing institutions and leveraging their resources to crush any sign of opposition. A Slow Start to a Quick Fix: Yunus’s Interim Government Yunus received much fanfare after being sworn in as Chief Advisor to the Bangladesh interim government on August 8, 2024, only three days after Hasina’s resignation and flight for refuge in India. The eighty-four-year-old Nobel Laureate was invited to lead the new transitional government after the student advisory board picked him as their leader, but received the more requisite support of Bangladesh’s only surviving institution—the Bangladesh Army. Immediately upon Yunus’s swearing-in, lawlessness, communal tensions, difficulty for the country’s rapidly growing economy, and accountability for revolution victims were all on the agenda. Hasina and the Awami League were notorious for summoning all arms of the state’s security apparatus on protestors and civilians alike. These forces included not only the RAB but also the Bangladesh Border Guard forces as well as the student wing of the Awami League, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). The Chhatra League in particular has earned much notoriety, as their coordination with government security forces since their 2019 murder of Abrar Fahad—a dissenter whose Facebook post expressing concern over a water deal with India led to him being killed in a Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) dorm—was on full display during the Quota Reform Movement. While the country underwent internet shutdowns during the Quota Reform Movement and protestors were subject to 'shoot-on-sight' orders by Hasina, the Chhatra League was provided arms, ammunition, and access to the internet to better coordinate their efforts in stopping the protests. Following Hasina’s ousting, the estimated 100,000 members of the Chhatra League have been abandoned as targets for retribution after the Yunus-led interim government declared BCL a 'terrorist organization' under the 2009 Anti-Terrorism Act and banned it on Wednesday, October 23, 2024, for their serious misconduct during the July unrest. Even though the Yunus-led interim government has overseen Dhaka University banning the activities of political party student wings on September 19, 2024, which also includes the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami student branches, Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dol and Bangladeshi Chhatra Shibir, clashes between these groups continue. Additionally, Washington has expressed much concern over the need to contain the Islamist elements operating within Bangladesh, which Hasina’s Awami League and successive Indian governments were keen on clamping down on. On August 28, 2024, still within the month of Hasina’s ousting, the Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s main Islamist party which has never earned more than eighteen out of the Bangladeshi Parliament’s three hundred seats, had their 2008-imposed ban lifted on them. Additionally, the day before on August 27, 2024, the leader of the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) leader, Jashimuddin Rahmaani, was freed by the Yunus-led interim government. Rahmaani was originally jailed on August 2, 2013, for his role in murdering an atheist blogger and since his release has requested Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of the neighboring West Bengal state of India, to 'declare independence from India,' further suggesting to hoist 'Islamist flags in their capital of Kolkata.' These recent developments have led to a perception in New Delhi and Western capitals that Yunus is allowing free reign to the most dangerous elements of Bangladesh’s Islamist cadres, who are actively preparing for the upcoming elections which have yet to be given a date. Of immense concern to both India and its transnational diaspora has been the extent of communal violencethat has rocked Bangladesh after Hasina’s ousting. According to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist ChristianUnity Council, there have been over 2,010 attacks on Hindus or their properties in fifty-two districts out of the country’s sixty-four districts, and five Hindus have been killed in these attacks, two of which were confirmed as Awami League members. Due to the Awami League’s close ties to India, performative commitment to secularism, and an iron-fist policy towards Islamists, the Hindu minority in Bangladesh votes in majority for the Awami League and is also perceived by Islamists as a key constituency that lobbies for pro-India policies. Many Bangladeshi, Indian, and Western analysts, journalists, and commentators alike have argued that the Yunus government has done a generally decent job in addressing the communal tensions, with visits to temples and urging students and the common citizen to protect minorities themselves. On August 6, 2024, Congressmen Raja Krishnamoorthi and Shri Thanedar wrote separate letters to Blinken, advocating on behalf of the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. On the same day, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, US Senator Ben Cardin, released a statement urging Bangladesh to form a responsible caretaker government 'that will promptly organize inclusive democratic elections. The people of Bangladesh deserve a government that honors their voices, respects their will, and upholds the dignity of their nation.' On September 20, 2024, US Senators Cardin, Murphy, Van Hollen, and Merkley issued a letter to Yunus directly, urging reforms and accountability in Bangladesh. The letter stated: 'While many celebrate this new chapter in Bangladesh, a concerning volume of those celebrations have turned violent, with documented reports of reprisals targeting police as well as minority Hindu communities and those perceived to be supporters of Hasina’s government. As a result, the country has witnessed gaps in law enforcement and a lack of protections for those facing violent attacks, including members of the Hindu community and Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazaar.' Four days later, Yunus met with US President Joe Biden at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), where Biden congratulated Yunus and affirmed a close partnership between the United States and Bangladesh rooted in democratic values and strong people-to-people ties. Yunus gifted Blinken, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Italian Prime Minister GiorgiaMeloni with a book of paintings known as the 'Art of Triumph,' capturing scenes from the July 36 student-led revolution. The gesture of gifting these Western heads of state photo books was in line with trade and education diplomacy interests as roughly 10,000 Bangladeshi students study in Canadian universities, making Canada a 'study destination of choice' among Bangladeshi students, and the European Union’s role as Bangladesh’s largest trading partner, accounting for 20.7% of Bangladesh’s trade. At the General Assembly, Yunus also met with Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines, where they reaffirmed their commitment to expanding the two countries’ bilateral cooperation. The long-held demand by the Awami League government for the Pakistani government to apologize for its genocideduring the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and Pakistan’s unwillingness to do so has held back bilateral ties according to Foreign Policy columnist and South Asia Brief writer Michael Kugelman. However, while steps were made in regard to this longstanding issue in 2021 with an exchange of letters between former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Hasina, Yunus’s willingness to engage Pakistan without mention of the 1971 chapter suggests this grievance in bilateral relations may not be as much of a constraint in Bangladesh-Pakistan relations post-Hasina. While some of the Awami League ministers were detained—some on their way out of the country—many fled during the month of the student-led revolution. Bangladeshi news sources like the Daily Star and Prothom Alo have documented how a total of thirty current and former Awami League ministers weredetained and are currently being subject to proceedings. Meanwhile, Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, who served as an advisor on Information and Communications Technology affairs to Hasina, has hired a former Trump lobbyist and actively operates as the de facto leaderof the Awami League in an attempt to make a comeback for the upcoming election. On the day of Diwali, Thursday, October 31, 2024, US presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted that he 'strongly condemned the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh,' further stating that it would have 'never happened on my watch,' before tying these developments to Ukraine and the Southern border. In the same tweet, he promised to 'also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left' and 'also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Narendra Modi.' This timely statement by Donald Trump signals both a nod to the Indian American vote as well as Hindu Nationalist and Awami League lobbies, attempting to undercut Kamala Harris’s appeal to Indian Americans by explicitly claiming that she 'ignored Hindus,' while also signaling a preference for the Awami League. Viewed within the backdrop of US electoral politics, Bangladesh is a partisan issue, and given Yunus’s former criticism of Trump back in 2016, the interim government can expect a less supportive White House if Trump returns to the White House after the 2024 US general elections. In Between Rising Powers: Bangladesh in the Eyes of New Delhi and Beijing The collapse of Hasina’s regime was a strategic failure for the Awami League’s long-time and premier supporter—India. Since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, where India played a leading role through covert support to the guerilla war, India has sustained a favorable trade imbalance, security cooperation, political alignment, and common cause over the containment of Islamist elements within Bangladesh. However, recent developments and the trajectory set for the next Bangladeshi election seem to swayagainst New Delhi’s favor, as anti-Indian sentiments have reached all-time highs and the Awami League has very little legroom to launch a comeback, given their reputation from their bloody crackdown on the Quota Reform Movement. Another key supporter of Hasina’s regime was the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Bangladesh is the second-biggest destination of Chinese military imports according to the Stockholm Peace International Research Institute (SIPRI). Between 2016 and 2020, Bangladesh bought 17 percent of all Chinese military exports and two-thirds of the Bangladesh Air Force weapon arsenal is currently made up of Chinese weapons. In line with the 2002 Defense Cooperation Agreement signed between China and Bangladesh, making China the only country with a broad defense agreement with Bangladesh, Dhaka has also inaugurated a Chinese-built naval base for the Bangladesh Navy at Pekua in Cox’s Bazar in 2023, BNS Sheikh Hasina, where two Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) officers were in attendance. According to a CSIS report entitled 'Submarine Diplomacy,' published in November 2023, commercial satellite imagery revealed significant progress on this naval base, which both signaled Beijing deepening its influence in the Bay of Bengal while also attempting to strengthen ties between Bangladesh and Myanmar, aimed at undercutting New Delhi’s influence in its neighborhood. Since 2010, half of Myanmar’s and two-thirds of Bangladesh’s arms imports have come from China. However, Bangladesh’s military still conducts annual bilateral exercises with the Indian military, most recently in October 2023, showing how Dhaka balances India and China even as it actively courts Beijing. Over a fourth of world trade passes through the Bay of Bengal each year, with ports located in the bay that handle 33 percent of global trade and half of the world’s container traffic. Additionally, the Bay of Bengal is located at a strategic chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. This chokepoint is vital because it controls maritime access to the Far East and is used by a large amount of international shipping. Upon Hasina’s ousting, in one of her first statements from her refuge in a military base in India, she stated that she could have remained in power had she acquiesced to a US demand for a military base in Bangladeshi territory — St. Martin’s Island. The Padma Bridge, inaugurated in February 2022, is Bangladesh’s largest bridge, standing at 3.88 miles in length and 60 feet wide, able to carry 10,000 tons, and projected to boost the country’s GDP by 1.2 percent. Proposed in 1998, the bridge had many setbacks in construction due to the withdrawal of support by the World Bank in 2015 after allegations of corruption. A Chinese engineering firm, China Major Bridge Co., hadtaken over construction of the bridge following the World Bank exit. The Padma Bridge is the largest bridge built by a Chinese company outside of China and was dubbed the 'dream bridge,' by the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen. Ambassador Wen further stated that not only will the bridge 'contribute to the connectivity in South Asia,' but also that whenever China’s President Xi Jinping 'mentions Bangladesh, he will mention the Padma Bridge.' Additionally, a much-needed $12.65 billion dollar nuclear power plant in Rooppur is pledged to be 90 percent financed by Russia as of 2023. Putin has also made inroads in Dhaka, helping the country shift away from energy dependence on India, while also benefitting from Bangladesh abstaining from a recent 2023 UN vote to cease the war in Ukraine. Washington’s Approach for Bangladesh’s Role in the Indo-Pacific Bangladesh plays a tough balancing act in the Indo-Pacific due to its immense population, resource endowments, and strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. This was played to Hasina’s hand, who sought to balance neighboring Beijing and New Delhi while maintaining Bangladesh’s role as an important trading partner to the United States and European Union. Her capture of state institutions, momentum for turning the country into a one-party state, and ability to navigate the trail of Western sanctions, all while maintaining consistent economic growth at a 7 percent annual rate, attests to this small-state-leverage playing larger powers off one another. Ultimately, mass rebellion and inability to provide effective governance and economic opportunity succeeded where coercive US measures could not. With Yunus at the helm, Bangladesh is under a transitory governance scheme where Washington has a more receptive head of state. However, commitment to free and fair elections that releases far-right Islamist elements, while committing to deepening Western and Indian interests, presents a conflict of interest. More pressing, the Chinese inroads made in Bangladesh with BNS Sheikh Hasina, military imports, and the Padma Bridge have distanced Washington as a strategic competitor in the region. The steps Washington takes next with Bangladesh must account for the need to assure an effective democratic framework for elections, state security and law and order for the regime that assumes power after the interim government holds its election. The announcement that Yunus would not run himself and the momentum gained by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Islamist parties has raised alarms in New Delhi and Western capitals, with Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh recommending at the Indian Air Force Commanders’ Conference to be ready for 'new challenges' in response to the changing posture of the incumbent and coming regime in Dhaka. In response, the former Bangladesh Army Chief of Staff, Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, has led the Bangladesh military to assess putting the country on war footing under a model of the French levée en masse—referring to the French Revolution’s policy of requiring all able-bodied men to serve the military to defend the nation. Washington is uniquely poised to help Dhaka deter any confrontation with New Delhi, while also reeling the strategically-located country from China’s embrace ahead of the 2027 projected Chinese invasion ofTaiwan. Diplomatic overtures and economic cooperation can collectively aid in preventing Bangladesh from becoming another autocratic regime, as well as from becoming a vassal for Beijing’s interests in the Indo-Pacific neighboring its regional rival, India. However, Yunus must hold the line against Islamists, as Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen, recently praised Jamaat-e-Islami as a 'well-organized party.' Yunus must also continually court the United States and European Union in order to reel Bangladesh from the crosshairs of China’s grand strategy in South Asia. While the Yunus-led interim government’s decision to lift the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami was rooted in ending the Awami League’s one-party governance, Beijing’s open embrace of Islamist forces who have historically antagonized Washington, New Delhi, and European capitals has raised alarms for the country’s trade, people-to-people ties, and defense posture. A Bangladesh where institutions are captured by the anti-Awami League axis of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami will allow Beijing unprecedented leverage in Bangladesh, given both their anti-Indian and anti-Western track record, ongoing rhetoric, and overall platforms. The Yunus-led interim government is Washington’s last window ofopportunity to chart a prosperous and democratic Bangladesh for decades to come, or it can serve as a missed opportunity that offered China and Russia an indefinite foothold.

Iran And Russia Seek To Reshape Global Hegemony With New Bilatera...	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met in Kazan, Russia, during the latest BRICS (a loose political economic grouping originally consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) summit, held on October 22–24 (Kremlin.ru, October 23; see EDM, October 28). This follows an earlier meeting between the two leaders on bilateral ties in Ashgabat on October 11 (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, October 11). Given that Iran has recently inaugurated a new president who seeks to improve foreign relations, the bilateral agenda was quite expansive, accounting for both countries’ interest in developing closer ties in light of their respective conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Both sides have found themselves in a similar position—isolated by the West, targeted by sanctions, and eager for new allies—and look to establish closer political and military cooperation. Moscow and Tehran are motivated to introduce an agreement that would reflect their changing preferences and underline their shared opposition to the collective West. Cooperation between the two countries has seen incremental improvement across various fronts since 2022 despite mutual distrust. This trend is expected to culminate in the signing of a comprehensive agreement that promises to redefine the scope of their strategic partnership (Amwaj, September 19). Although an exact date for such a signing has not yet been established, both Moscow and Tehran will likely look to ratify some sort of treaty by the end of the year, as both sides are eager to quickly sign an agreement, demonstrated by their ambitious designs in bilateral ties (see EDM, September 18). The exact contents of what would be in this agreement are unknown. Compared with a previous treaty signed by the two countries more than twenty years ago, the expected agreements will likely involve much more extensive political, economic, and cultural ties (Russian Council, July 22, 2021). A heavy emphasis will likely be placed on military and security cooperation, as this is the cornerstone of their expanding relationship (see EDM, July 22, December 12, 2022, March 6, 2023, February 22). More precisely, drone and missile production is sure to top Moscow and Tehran’s agendas, given that their respective conflicts with Ukraine and Israel have proven to both the importance of such weapon systems (see Terrorism Monitor, November 4, 2022; see EDM, July 22, 2022, September 14, 2023, October 16). The two sides are also likely to double down on greater training assistance and Iran’s purchase of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and potentially S-400 missile systems (Euronews, October 25; Kyiv Post, October 27). Outside of defense, the new agreement is also set to extend collaboration into areas such as trade, media, education, space exploration, cultural exchange, and a common payment system (see EDM, December 13, 2021, May 1; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, August 10, 2022; Iran International, December 15, 2023; The Moscow Times, November 4). Moscow and Tehran will also be eager to resolve disagreements impeding the construction of major gas pipelines in Iran, implementing liquified natural gas projects, and undertaking swap operations involving natural gas and oil products (Iran International, October 14, 2023; The Moscow Times, October 1). Infrastructure will be a critical topic of discussion. Moscow and Tehran have tried to improve and expand the vital International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) (see EDM, June 7, 2023, March 6; Tehran Times, September 17). Running along the Caspian Sea and connecting Russia with Iran’s southern ports, creating access to the Indian Ocean and South Asian markets, this corridor has been a historic trading route between Russia and Iran since the sixteenth century, used by both to bypass Ottoman influence and access distant markets across the region. While Iran and Russia have been historical adversaries more often than not—having vied for influence in the Caucasus and Middle East throughout the imperial era—their cooperation does have historical roots. In the late sixteenth century, Safavid Iran and the Russian Tsardom joined forces to counter Ottoman expansion. Similarly, in today’s context, Russia and Iran’s warming relationship is driven by shared grievances against the West and their common desire to challenge the world order. Tehran’s support for proxy regimes throughout the Middle East and Moscow’s support for the Syrian regime have both been viewed as examples of their efforts to counter Western influence in the region (see EDM, July 31, 2017, February 5, July 29, October 7; Anadolu, September 28). For Iran, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and its subsequent isolation from Western diplomatic institutions acted as a defining moment that pushed Russia into closer relations with the Islamic Republic. Isolated from Western trade and facing heavy sanctions, Russia’s pivot to the Middle East and Asia has made Iran an indispensable partner. Iran has supported Russia with advanced weaponry, and these budding ties even extended to proxy conflicts, such as Moscow’s alleged support for the Houthis in Yemen, even at the risk of damaging Russia’s relationships with other regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have traditionally opposed the Houthis (see EDM, August 8, October 7). Moscow’s shift to a more pro-Iran stance has become much more pronounced in recent years. Even so, direct military support in Iran’s conflicts, particularly with Israel—which harbors a large Russian population— remains unlikely. Nevertheless, leaders in Iran and Russia envision a multipolar world premised on challenging Western geopolitical and economic hegemony. This fits into a more comprehensive continuum of countries, China being the principal actor, looking to create alternative alliance networks and key geopolitical leaders globally. The rise of transnational organizations such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization marks a new era in global geopolitics, with Russia and Iran positioning themselves as ascending powers (see EDM, July 15, October 16; see China Brief, July 12).

China’s Expanding Role In The Middle East – Analysis	By Mauricio D. Aceves Extensive discourse is taking place regarding the power vacuum in the Middle East following the waning presence of the U.S. In this frame, regional actors have increased their influence over the specific issue of stability. Hence, it is crucial for all countries to diversify their ties when seeking a new balance, beyond their familiar stakes of economic interest and energy security. In this scenario, China offers an alternative, furthering its early strategic engagement around investments, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and geopolitical calibrations, to fit smoothly alongside a new, multipolar order narrative. The echoes of this strategy are also heard in other latitudes. In parallel, China has also increased its presence in Latin America, primarily through investments in communications, technology, and infrastructure for connectivity. The role of China in the Middle East can be categorized into a troika of domains—the economic and geopolitical scope includes the supply chain, financial systems, investments, technology and technical knowledge transfers, trade and energy security. The second refers to bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, including the convergence inside organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), BRICS, and the many displays of diplomacy, from the cultural to the military. The third reflects the political approach with non-state actors and the open communications channels through the political labyrinth of the region. China does not aim to control regional dynamics or guarantee security. China’s policy is to be the master of economic dialogue and the use of incentives while avoiding direct involvement in conflicts and creating adversaries. Economic development is the sword, and pragmatism the road. The Middle East has historically stood at the crossroads of geopolitics, even for China’s vision. The Persian Gulf provides China with over a third of the oil it imports;[1] Qatar is China’s most significant source of imported gas, and Turkmenistan is the second.[2] Nowadays, China is the largest trade partner of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia.[3] The region became an essential destination for Chinese exports and services linked with infrastructure, communications and information technologies. More than 60% of maritime trade between Europe and China[4] crosses the many seas of the region: the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Oman, the Bab al-Mandeb and Hormuz Straits. Beijing has invested in Oman’s Duqm Port and has built oil pipelines to the Port of Fujairah and facilities at Khalifa Port in the UAE. It holds stakes in at least 20 port projects in the Middle East and North Africa. Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen remain potential sites for further Chinese port development. This intensifying web of possibilities and realities is the first step of a growing China presence in the Middle Eastern supply chain and mirrors the world’s geopolitical priorities. However, conflicts compromise the transit through these chokepoints between the Indo-Pacific and the Mediterranean waters. The Houthis’ reactivity in the Gulf of Aden, the instability in the Horn of Africa or even the chapter of the stuck Evergreencontainer ship in the Suez, show how vulnerable these areas are. Avoiding exposure has been China’s central policy, but in the foreign domain, China has certainly been active and visible. The Chinese military base in Djibouti at the entrance of the Red Sea and the naval presence close to Hormuz, ostensibly aims to deter piracy and more easily participate in joint military exercises. So far, these cards have not been used to interfere in ongoing conflicts, but only to protect Chinese assets and guard commercial routes. Military engagement is for Beijing, the last option when threats to overseas national interests are imminent. Nor does China perceive military non-state actors or ongoing regional conflicts as direct threats. This fact conditioned its approach to relying on diplomacy rather than military engagement. But this strategy has limits. Scalations and the spread of conflict might involve different approaches. Providing technology and components for dual purposes, civil and military, or supporting the development of the military industry[5] [6] have been small but significant steps toward military involvement through business means. The SCO, BRICS, the Digital Silk Road and the Global Security Initiative show that China’s presence deep inside the arteries of the Middle East have entered a new stage of engagement. The comprehensive strategic partnerships with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE demonstrate the accurate calibration of diplomacy, navigating the political differences. Even considering the long-lasting support to Palestine and the condemnations of military actions of Israel in Palestine and Lebanon, China has developed economic ties with Israel and simultaneously reinforced relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran. China is the top trading partner for Iran and Israel.[7] China’s 25-year cooperation agreement with Iran signed in 2021, and the mediatory role played by Beijing in the Joint Trilateral Statement with Iran and Saudi Arabia, gives China legitimacy and reduces the perception of China as a rival. Earlier this year, Chinese envoys met Hamas’ political leaders in Doha; concurrently, China attended talks with top Israeli diplomats and the Palestinian Authority, and later in July, China hosted a summit with representatives of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in Beijing. These interactions seek to maintain communication with all actors, even when political and warfare conditions make mediation efforts an unviable task. However, diplomatic inertia over the Middle East appears to be taking root, especially with the devastating situation in Palestine and the multiple fronts opened by this Pandora’s box. Other actions could be analyzed if the conflict spreads and harms global stability. China’s ties with the Middle East are traversing into uncharted seas. The weight of China has grown in the Middle East. Nowadays, it’s easy to find banks with China’s flag in the region’s leading cities. China’s embassies in Riyadh, Cairo, and Tehran are more influential than ever. China’s ability to understand partners’ motivations has resulted in a foreign policy that is a mix of incentives and defined consequences; it is aware of the importance of establishing a transparent set of geopolitical priorities in a long-term frame. A new version of the 'Great Game'[8] has started in the Middle East, and its inner powers are in the leading roles, but China will be that player always on the chessboard with more pieces and moves in hand, than ever.

Government Efficiency Is A Tall Order For Musk – OpEd	Former president Donald Trump says Elon Musk may serve as the 'Secretary of Cost-Cutting,' and Musk foresees a Department of Government Efficiency under his command. The SpaceX boss might dial it back to a previous attempt during the Carter Era. The victor over Gerald Ford in 1976, Carter tackled inefficiency in the federal bureaucracy with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. According to Office of Personnel Management, the 'keystone' of the Act was the Senior Executive Service, (SES) established to 'ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality.' SES leaders 'possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective on government and a public service commitment that is grounded in the Constitution.' The SES bosses also 'serve in the key positions just below the top Presidential appointees. SES members are the major link between these appointees and the rest of the Federal workforce. They operate and oversee nearly every government activity in approximately 75 Federal agencies.' Taxpayers had a right to wonder how it worked out. 'When Jimmy Carter set up the Senior Executive Service nearly three years ago, it was touted as the ideal place for the government’s top managers, an elite niche where Uncle Sam’s best and brightest would toil at greater risk but with the promise of greater rewards,' wrote Karlyn Barker of the Washington Post in October, 1981, 'but it hasn’t worked out that way.' Many SES members complained about pay, promotions, and the bonus system. On the other hand, Barker provided little assessment of SES job performance that would merit higher pay. The SES represented less than one percent of the federal workforce but between 2008 and 2011 SES bosses received more than $340 million in bonuses, on top of annual salaries that ranged from $119,000 to $179,000. The bonuses were not subject to budget cuts and SES influence continued to surge. According to a 2015 report, the SES boasted 217 members in the army, 318 in the Navy, 179 in the Air Force, 473 in the Department of Defense, 594 at Homeland Security, and a full 786 at the Department of Justice. 'All other' federal agencies accounted for 1,785 SES members, with a grand total of 7,791. In his 2015 executive order, 'Strengthening the Senior Executive Service,' President Obama set out to 'facilitate career executive continuity between administrations.' By May 31, 2016, agencies with 20 or more SES positions were to develop a plan 'to increase the number of SES members who are rotating to improve talent development, mission delivery, and collaboration.' And so on, all without any long-term assessment of job performance. For all but the willfully blind, the SES had become another bureaucracy, but hardly the only evidence of government waste, fraud, and abuse. John C. Beale, once the highest-paid employee at the Environmental Protection Agency, told his bosses he was a CIA spy working in London, India, and Pakistan when he was actually holed up at his vacation home. Beale pulled off this ruse for 20 years, performing little if any work. The fraudster continued to draw his government paycheck and retention bonuses even after he retired. SES Employees Are Still Government Workers Like government employees in general, SES bosses enjoy an array of special protections against dismissal. Elon Musk would have a hard time firing them, but the SpaceX mogul may not get the chance. Donald Trump would have to win the election, hardly a done deal, and there’s more to consider. The SES operates in 75 government departments including the Department of Homeland Security, which now controls the United States Secret Service, before 2003 part of the Treasury Department. As it turns out, the SES also deploys personnel in the Secret Service, responsible for protection of the president, and since the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, presidential candidates as well. At a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to prevent a 20-year-old with no tactical experience from scaling a rooftop and unleashing eight shots, one wounding former president Trump, and other shots killing one attendee and wounding two others. Not much SES efficiency was on display, but government agencies have succeeded in making the election season more exciting.

US Nuclear Defense Should Not Be So Costly – OpEd	After a decades-long post-Cold War halt to designing, manufacturing, and testing new nuclear arms, the United States is implementing a three-decade-long, $1.7 trillion program to modernize and increase its already sizable arsenal of nuclear weapons, according to a recent New York Times report by W. J. Hennigan. This program, which is already over budget and behind schedule (as most weapons programs tend to be in the Pentagon’s uncompetitive procurement environment), is also an overreaction to other nuclear weapons powers. It should be pared back significantly. During the nuclear insanity of the Cold War, during the late 1980s, the world had around 70,000 nuclear warheads, up from roughly 3,000 in 1955. As a result of arms control and the end of the Cold War, the number now stands at about 12,000 globally. The United States currently has about 5,748 warheads in its nuclear arsenal compared to Russia’s 5,580. Together, both arsenals contain more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads. When New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which limits long-range nuclear warheads and delivery systems, expires in early 2026, the United States is considering adding warheads to its arsenal. China currently possesses 500 warheads, is on schedule to double that number by the turn of the decade, and may build up its force further by 2035. Russia has also overhauled its nuclear arsenal. Hennigan seems to accept that nuclear and conventional military activities by Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran should govern the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nonetheless, he laments that the 'future of arms control appears bleak' after forty years of progress in reducing the number of nuclear warheads; appears to blanch at the staggering cost of U.S. nuclear modernization; and argues that although Congress decided the United States needed to modernize its nuclear arsenal more than a decade ago, the American public is still woefully uninformed about the nature of a program slated to cost nearly double each year ($57 billion) what the entire World War II-era Manhattan Project did. However, Hennigan comes up with few solutions to what seems to be an incipient nuclear arms race. He is correct in three of his four assumptions, but the solution can be found by correcting the erroneous remaining one. Hennigan is correct that the program's cost is already astonishing and growing, that most of the American populace is entirely ignorant of it, and that the prospect for bilateral or multilateral arms control is gloomy. That gloom stems from the impression that China plans to break out of its previously astute posture of maintaining only a nuclear force for minimum deterrence. With China unconstrained in its nuclear modernization, the United States (and maybe Russia, too) is leery of continuing the constraints of the New START Treaty. Yet even if other countries continue their nuclear refurbishment or buildups, is it smart for the United States, which has a debt held by the public of $26.3 Trillion(about 98 percent of the GDP), to do so on such a grand scale? Currently, the United States is modernizing (and maybe augmenting) all three legs of its Cold War-era nuclear triad. The triad consists of land-based long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) based in silos in the Western states, long-range bomber aircraft that can deliver nuclear weapons, and stealthy, and therefore invulnerable, ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) that can now deliver nearly 1,000 powerful warheads. During the Cold War, the United States could afford such overkill in its massive destruction capability. The American people should now ask whether the United States could adopt a less costly but adequate minimum deterrent strategy, such as China did in the past, to use the savings to help facilitate an economic miracle. Two legs of the triad are vulnerable to an adversary’s nuclear first strike. New ICBM (Sentinel) missiles deployed into stationary and easily targeted land-based silos are not likely to get any less vulnerable to an enemy first strike than the existing Minuteman III missiles. New long-range, nuclear-capable U.S. bombers (the B-21 Raider) would be vulnerable to a surprise attack on the ground before takeoff or, if they do get airborne, vulnerable when trying to penetrate very capable Russian or Chinese air defenses. The United States (and other great powers) really only need a nuclear force surviving an enemy’s first strike that can hit all major targets in the attacking country to deter other great powers from launching nuclear attacks on it in the first place. If there are 500 major targets in Russia or China and two warheads are needed to destroy each target, the United States could take out those targets by creating a survivable but powerful, minimum nuclear deterrent with about 1,000 warheads placed aboard twelve invulnerable undersea Columbia-class SSBNs. (Any small nuclear arsenals of North Korea and Iran are lesser included cases). Thus, the ICBM and bomber modernization programs could be scrapped. Building only those twelve submarines would cost $130 billion instead of the $1.7 Trillion to modernize the entire triad force, according to the Times report. Critics will label this nuclear 'monad' unilateral disarmament, but it is really just eliminating the costly and wasteful massive overkill in our current nuclear forces. The foolish nuclear arms race among the great powers may continue, but the United States safely can unilaterally choose to opt out of it.

Markets Made Of Glass: How The Fed Destroyed Economic Resilience ...	By Artis Shepherd Central to any good investor’s decision-making process is determining the degree to which the target of investment is 'robust to the downside.' Can the investment maintain its value—or even continue to provide sufficient return on capital—in the event of a pullback in the broader economy or a specific sector? Warren Buffett has aptly referred to this feature as 'margin of safety.' While critical to rational decision-makers, margin of safety seems quaint in today’s era of speculation and central bank front-running. Rather, in place of acquiring expertise and performing rational due diligence, speculators in capital markets rely on perpetually loose monetary policy and periodic bailouts. Markets worldwide, but particularly in the US, now exhibit a profound lack of robustness. Central banks—the Federal Reserve foremost among them—have become enablers of the political and crony classes, responding to any material drop in asset prices with swift jawboning, followed by enactment of loose monetary policy until speculators’ nerves are settled. The problem is that easy money entails a constant behind-the-scenes destruction of what’s truly important to an economy—sound money, low time preference, personal productivity, and quality of life—while emphasizing the frivolous and absurd. The Greenspan-Fed Put A put option or 'put' is a contract that allows the holder to sell a security or asset at a specific price ('strike price'), regardless of the current price ('spot price') of the underlying security or asset. Put options are actionable when spot prices decline below the strike price, allowing holders to exercise their put at the higher strike price, thus limiting their downside. While the Federal Reserve had been acting as a backstop to capital markets for decades prior, the genesis of the Greenspan Put was 1987. October 19 of that year, now known as 'Black Monday,' saw a single-day 20 percent drop in the US stock market. Invoking the familiar rationale of 'systemic concerns,' newly-appointed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan swiftly opened the monetary floodgates and lowered interest rates, reversing the prior trend of rate hikes. Perhaps more importantly, Greenspan issued a statement the day following Black Monday in which he expressed the Fed’s 'readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.' Despite the 'systemic concerns' canard, the stock market crash was the only noteworthy event on Black Monday. Credit markets did not seize up and the US Main Street economy was unimpacted. Greenspan’s Fed reacted exclusively to the drop in the stock market. Actions taken by Greenspan’s Fed led to an immediate rebound in stock prices, and all-time highs were reached soon after. Similar actions were taken by Greenspan multiple times during his tenure, including the absurd Fed-supervised bailout of Long Term Capital Management—a hedge fund comprising too-clever-by-half bond traders, academics, and other Wall Streeters who attempted to leverage and arbitrage their way into financial stardom but ended up losing billions. Over the years, the Greenspan Put has morphed into the Fed Put, with successive Fed chairmen employing the same techniques as Greenspan in propping up stock prices, namely, loosening monetary policy at any hint of a downturn by injecting liquidity and lowering interest rates while jawboning the markets so as to settle nerves and allow institutional speculators to front-run such policy. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is of course guilty of this, even before the hyperbolic actions taken during the covid panic of 2020. In 2018, shortly after his appointment, Powell suggested he would raise interest rates and embark on a path of quantitative tightening—taking liquidity out of the banking system by selling off the Fed’s treasury portfolio. The stock market responded with a 20 percent decline, at which point Powell immediately reversed his position. Sensing the continuation of the Fed Put indefinitely, stock markets soon reached valuations not seen since the dot-com bubble of 1999 and capital markets across the board bid up valuations to all-time highs. A study published in 2020 determined that not only does the Fed respond directly to stock market declines—particularly since Greenspan’s tenure in the 1990s—but such concerns are explicitly discussed in FOMC meetings. The authors of the study state: We show that since the mid-1990s the Fed has engaged in a sequence of policy easings following large stock market declines in the intermeeting period.… The structure of the Fed documents allows us to measure how frequently actual decision makers at the FOMC…mention the stock market…these mentions are strongly predictive of future policy and do so in an asymmetric way: mentions of stock market declines predict monetary easing, whereas there is no relationship between mentions of stock market gains and tightening. We verify the robustness of these findings using the FOMC transcripts. The authors note further: The statistical fact is that, since the mid-1990s, the Fed has tended to lower rates by an average of about 1.2 percentage points in the year after a 10 percent stock market decline… Fed actions since the publication of this study in 2020—including the massive liquidity dumps of the covid panic era—only confirm these conclusions. Zombie Companies One result of permanently loose monetary policy is a profusion of 'zombie companies'—those that can only survive in an environment where interest rates are artificially lowered. As evidence, consider the share of Russell 2000 companies (publicly-traded small-caps) with negative earnings, and notice how the percentage peaks shortly after each bubble burst, when interest rates are temporarily increasing. Despite decades of loose monetary policy, nearly half of these companies have negative earnings today. This phenomenon is not isolated to publicly-traded small-cap stocks. Myriad types and sizes of companies that shouldn’t exist—because they can’t provide sufficient value to compete in the free market—are propped up by cheap debt and other forms of subsidy. The existence of zombie companies is one concrete reminder of the profound weakness prevalent in our markets. Higher rates and a cessation of easy money policies would kill them all. Contents are Fragile Recently, the Japanese stock market index experienced a one-day drop of 12.4 percent, marking its worst day since Black Monday in 1987. The reason? A few days earlier, Japan’s central bank raised benchmark rates from 0.10 percent to 0.25 percent! Soon after this stock market tantrum, bashful and shamed Japanese bureaucrats reversed course and pledged to nervous investors that no more big, bad rate hikes would be forthcoming. The index recovered immediately. If Japan is a dysfunctional and fragile zombie economy, the US is hardly better. After decades of coddling stock market speculators, crony bankers, and politicians greedy for asset bubbles to appease their voter base, the Fed is now stuck with an economy that lacks durability, to put it mildly. Real earnings and productivity growth through the free market have been sacrificed for increasing asset prices measured in a dollar that is rapidly and constantly losing value. Combined with record amounts of leverage in the system, this state of affairs can only devolve into chaos. There is no politically viable way out, only the hard road back to sound money and fiscal discipline where interest rates are set by the market, not a central bank—a likelihood on par with pigs flying. Unlike bubbly asset prices propped up by a continually inflated dollar, robustness to the downside is a sign of genuine economic well-being. The ability of a market to tolerate downturns with resilience is what underlies its true strength. By that standard, the US economy is made of glass.

In Fencing China Out, Is Washington Fencing Itself In? – OpEd	As Washington doubles down on its semiconductor embargoes, a troubling paradox emerges: in trying to stymie China’s technological advances, the United States might just be fencing itself in. Each successive restriction aims to choke off China’s progress, specifically in artificial intelligence and high-performance chips. Yet these measures risk isolating the United States from global tech supply chains, harming its own industry and allies. Take the new U.S. Treasury rule, effective January 2025, which tightens restrictions on American investments in Chinese semiconductors and quantum computing. Although the Biden administration’s objective is clear—to kneecap China’s semiconductor ascent—this gambit is not likely to work. The complexity of today’s tech landscape, with its entangled supply lines and 'gray channels' of unofficial trade, underscores the futility of isolating China. Chinese firms continue advancing, with the support of both local innovation and resilient demand for tech alternatives. Despite escalating sanctions designed to strangle China’s chip industry, the true costs of these measures ripple far beyond Beijing. American allies find themselves isolated, and domestic companies feel the sting of lost revenues. Take Nvidia, for instance. The American AI chip giant introduced its groundbreaking Blackwell architecture in March but offered a downgraded version to maintain ties with the Chinese market, a reluctant acknowledgment of a complex interdependence that persists despite Washington’s aspirations. These efforts to stem China’s progress are as much a commentary on America’s anxiety over competition as they are on Beijing’s resilience in pushing forward, innovating, and navigating the geopolitical minefield. Even American firms like Semianalysis, which advocates for the strictest sanctions, concede that China is now advancing past the United States in achieving intelligent computing capabilities. The 'wall' designed to keep China out is riddled with gaps. China’s resourcefulness exploits these gaps. With substantial clean energy reserves to power vast computing clusters, where the United States often struggles with shortages, China is less beholden to America’s chip arsenal. Although its H20 chips fall short of Nvidia’s H200, innovative local firms are rapidly narrowing the gap. Meanwhile, U.S. attempts to regulate global trade through restricted entity lists has proven little more than a game of 'whack-a-mole,' where new avenues emerge faster than they can be closed. Perhaps the most significant gap in Washington’s strategy is China’s capacity to manufacture advanced chips domestically. Semiconductor giants SMIC and TSMC illustrate this shrinking technological divide, with China trailing the United States by an estimated five years. By 2024, as Huawei and local giants like Changxin Storage join forces, China’s investments in wafer equipment will propel it to the world’s second-largest buyer, outpacing all American firms. The United States can tighten its grip, but innovation continues to slip through its fingers. Calls are growing within the United States not just to restrict the export of advanced equipment but to clamp down on components that enable the manufacturing of these technologies. This, however, demands that allies join the United States in constructing an even taller wall. But such a strategy would ultimately require Washington to compensate its allies, effectively paying a steep diplomatic toll for a policy that isolates more than it secures. While the U.S. may dominate advanced semiconductor technologies, China holds critical leverage in other parts of the supply chain, particularly in rare earth elements essential to chip production. China supplies 60 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals and controls over 85 percent of their processing. In response to American export controls, China has restricted exports of gallium and germanium—key materials in chipmaking—and has hinted at further action if pressures persist. While these controls aim to hinder China’s tech ambitions, they could have substantial repercussions for the United States too. American chip companies, deeply reliant on the Chinese market, face looming financial losses. U.S. firms could lose up to $83 billion in annual sales and 124,000 jobs, with semiconductor equipment companies especially exposed since 30–40 percent of their sales depend on China. Meanwhile, Chinese firms like SMIC have pivoted sharply, now producing 80 percent for domestic use compared to just 40 percent five years ago. A prolonged restriction may curtail U.S. R&D, weakening its competitiveness in a market shaped by shifting alliances and growing interdependence. There’s increasing talk of an emerging 'American island,' a scenario where the United States, in its quest for dominance, finds itself hemmed in as other nations gravitate towards the Chinese supply chain. This trend, already visible in connected cars, is making inroads into the semiconductor sector. Since 2018, China has skillfully maneuvered around these restrictions, using strategies like 'design-out' (substituting U.S. technologies with Chinese or third-country alternatives) and 'design-around' (innovating to bypass controlled technologies entirely). The U.S. strategy to contain China’s tech industry has spurred an unexpected transformation. Chinese companies, supported by the government, are choosing local suppliers more assertively, aiming to reduce reliance on an unstable supply chain. This shift is creating a robust local market and a fortified tech ecosystem within China. Meanwhile, foreign companies, fearing the loss of access to China’s vast market, are moving away from American technology and components. Third-party nations and their companies, unburdened by these geopolitical tensions, are stepping in to fill gaps left by restricted American firms. With revenues and R&D investments shifting to non-American firms, U.S. leadership is in jeopardy. American firms may face diminished market share as they are overtaken by agile competitors less constrained by Washington’s restrictive policies. Once focused on replication, Chinese companies are now emphasizing original technological advancements. With expertise in packaging technology and close integration into the global supply chain, China has boosted its investments in hybrid bonding and advanced substrates, fields where U.S. companies are lagging. Data from the first half of this year highlight China’s impressive strides. While global semiconductor equipment revenues held steady, China’s top equipment manufacturers achieved a 50 percent year-over-year revenue increase, reducing their gap with global giants from 24 to 15 times. As the contest between China and the United States deepens, third-party players will continue to leverage this shifting dynamic, optimizing their own interests amid the rivalry.

Will America Elect The Unknown Or The Unpredictable? – OpEd	By Alistair Burt The world this week awaits the verdict of its most important democracy. This US presidential campaign, astonishing in so many ways, reaches polling day on Tuesday with the outcome still uncertain, a contest between the unknown and the unpredictable. It is not an enviable situation either for the US or for the UK, EU, Middle East and others, which will be watching with perhaps greater anxiety than ever before. It could still be the case that the most consequential decision in the campaign remains that of those who persuaded President Joe Biden to opt for a very early TV debate with Donald Trump. Shrewdly but secretly gambling that exposing the president’s frailty would allow for a replacement candidate, it immediately shifted what had been gathering momentum toward Trump. It refocused the issues of age and capacity squarely on the man who was now the oldest candidate. While that gamble to replace Biden may have worked, it remains to be seen if it has swayed the election itself. Whatever the real or imagined preferences of foreign countries as to the outcome, the truth is that they will respect the decision of the American people and get to work with the new incumbent in the White House. They will deal with the specific differences in policy about which they already know, while recognizing there are generic issues that either can bring to the table. Kamala Harris is still largely an enigma. If she were to win, we all assume there would be a degree of continuity in foreign policy, such as clear support for NATO and Ukraine, but probably also keeping with a rather more ill-defined approach to the Middle East. The Israel/Gaza/Lebanon policy of the Democratic incumbent seems to please no one. Whoever you talk to feels abandoned. Benjamin Netanyahu feels he is not being supported strongly and unquestioningly enough, while Palestinians and the Arab street are outraged at the degree of catastrophe being inflicted on innocent civilians and which remains unimpeded, even actively supported, by the US. Regional powers will probably be assuming that the US under Harris will continue to prioritize the Far East and they will be left on their own to deal with long-unresolved issues, such as the future of the Palestinian question and what to do with Iran. Trump brings a whole new suite of baggage — much of it terrifying. Europe and the world worry about climate change commitments, while Trump is a climate change denier, calling it a 'hoax.' International consensus and agreements would either fall or need drastically reworking. Europe and the free world are engaged in confronting the first invasion of a sovereign country on the European continent since 1945 (allowing some license for Soviet actions against client states in the past) and the loss of US support in terms of aid or arms, as hinted at by Trump, would likely be decisive in Russia’s favor, opening up the question of 'where next?' Trump has already threatened not to assist NATO states if they have not paid what he considers appropriate amounts to the alliance’s funds. He said in February that he would encourage Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' toward 'delinquent' NATO members, though in the current atmosphere of defense uncertainty both candidates will want to ensure greater defense commitments from Europe. Europe will fear being caught up in a Republican trade war, with tariffs imposed on itself and further pressure on China. And while some in the Middle East may prefer Trump to the Obama years and the mixed messages from the Democrats, the region will not know quite what it is getting from a new Trump presidency. Israel may or may not get unqualified support, even to the point of annexation of the West Bank. A deal with Saudi Arabia may be seen as the answer to everything, but the terms of such a deal in relation to Palestine are now very different. Will renewed 'maximum pressure' on Iran — the policy that tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal and gave the region more and better quality enriched Iranian uranium — be accompanied by actions? Or will the opposite be the case to deliver on Trump’s promise to the US people not to become militarily engaged in the Middle East again? Apart from these specifics, there are deeper worries. What damage has the election already done to a polarized American people and political system? What is this fear of malevolent retribution, which has stopped major US newspapers from endorsing Harris? Will the result be contested, as seems certain if Trump is not declared the winner, and what may ensue? Authoritarians the world over would get a renewed boost. Can a united US emerge, with clarity in its foreign policy, if still divided by the election? And how will the international order, creaking with a dysfunctional UN, be affected by a US that might turn in upon itself, consumed by domestic bitterness? None of us can affect the outcome, but most would settle for a clear winner, an absence of bitterness, signs of reconciliation among the American people and a renewed commitment to their place in the world.

Violence In America: When Ballot Boxes Burn And Poll Workers Face...	Historical patterns of electoral intimidation have reemerged in contemporary American democracy with troubling institutional implications. During Reconstruction, systematic campaigns targeted election officials who protected universal suffrage; today's data from the Brennan Center for Justice reveals an analogous institutional vulnerability, with 38% of local election officials reporting threats, harassment, or abuse in their official capacity. Institutional analysis of this 8 percentage point increase from previous year's findings suggests a coordinated pattern of democratic destabilization. The Department of Justice's Election Threat Task Force data reinforces this institutional pattern, documenting over 1,000 incidents of harassment targeting election workers, with 58% concentrated in contested jurisdictions. Mounting pressure has begun to crack the foundations of election office stability. Survey data indicates that 27% of election officials now report knowing colleagues who have departed their positions due to safety concerns, a significant increase from 18% in the previous year. Perhaps most concerning for electoral stability, 25% of local election officials will be working their first presidential election in 2024, indicating an unprecedented loss of experienced personnel at a critical juncture. This mass exodus of experienced election workers threatens to destabilize voting operations across the country, particularly in areas already struggling with resource limitations. The departure of seasoned officials creates a dangerous void in institutional knowledge, increasing the likelihood of administrative errors and potentially undermining public confidence in electoral processes. The intensity of threats against election workers has escalated from intimidation to physical confrontation and infrastructure attacks. In Orangeburg County, South Carolina, a poll worker faced physical assault during early voting when enforcing basic election laws prohibiting campaign apparel at voting sites. The worker was struck on the head after asking a voter to remove a political cap, demonstrating how routine enforcement of election rules now puts workers at risk of violence. Meanwhile, in the Pacific Northwest, authorities are investigating a series of coordinated attacks on ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington state, where an experienced metalworker systematically targeted multiple jurisdictions with incendiary devices, destroying hundreds of ballots and forcing election workers to implement emergency protocols. Within the legal system, courts have begun to recognize the urgent need for stronger protections. The recent $148 million judgment against Rudy Giuliani, requiring the surrender of his Manhattan residence to Georgia election workers, demonstrates the judiciary's recognition of institutional harm. However, these remedies address only the most prominent cases among thousands of documented incidents nationwide. The October 2024 attacks—from direct physical confrontations in South Carolina to the destruction of ballot boxes in the Pacific Northwest—reveal how quickly threats can escalate from intimidation to violence. These incidents demonstrate the urgent need for enhanced security measures to protect both election workers and the physical components of our voting system they maintain. Across the country, state legislatures have begun responding through increasingly robust action, recognizing the urgent need to protect election workers. Washington state has taken the lead by classifying harassment of election workers as a felony carrying up to five years' imprisonment, while Maine and Vermont have introduced similar protective measures to safeguard their election personnel. At the federal level, a bipartisan initiative led by Senators Susan Collins and Joe Manchin proposes doubling penalties for threatening election officials, demonstrating growing recognition of the need for coordinated national response. These legislative efforts represent necessary first steps, but their effectiveness will depend on consistent enforcement and coordination between state and federal authorities. Behind the statistics lies a cascade of challenges that threaten the integrity of future elections. The Orangeburg County assault illustrates how even routine election administration now carries risks of physical violence, while the Portland-Vancouver ballot box attacks demonstrate the sophisticated nature of coordinated threats against electoral infrastructure. The erosion of institutional knowledge in election administration creates vulnerabilities in procedural integrity and operational capacity. Analysis of staffing patterns indicates that consolidation of polling locations disproportionately impacts historically marginalized communities, replicating patterns of institutional discrimination. These operational disruptions compound existing structural weaknesses in electoral administration. Moving forward requires treating election worker protection with the same gravity we afford other threats to national security. The institutional framework must expand to include National Guard activation and enhanced law enforcement presence, particularly in jurisdictions facing acute threats. Recent violent confrontations and infrastructure attacks demonstrate why enhanced security isn't merely precautionary—it's essential for protecting both physical infrastructure and the election workers who face direct threats while performing their duties. Comprehensive security protocols, enhanced worker privacy protections, and systematic training programs represent essential components of institutional resilience. Just as we deploy resources to protect critical infrastructure and respond to natural disasters, defending our electoral system from organized intimidation demands a similar commitment of security personnel and resources. With the 2024 presidential election, the stability of our electoral system hangs in the balance. The protection of election workers has become inseparable from the preservation of democratic processes themselves, requiring immediate and sustained attention from policymakers at all levels of government. This crisis demands a unified, bipartisan response that recognizes the essential role of election workers in maintaining democratic stability. The future of American democracy depends on our ability to protect those who safeguard our most fundamental democratic processes, ensuring they can perform their duties free from intimidation and harassment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqCiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-11-04T15:48:27-08:00	
Ruthless Settlements: BHP, Brazil And The Samarco Fundão Dam Clas...	The BHP Group, as with other mining giants, has much explaining to do in the way it has approached the environment. It has become a master of the greenwashing experiment, an adept promoter of sham environmental responsibility (take, for instance, its practice of merely selling its oil and gas business to Woodside Petroleum in 2021 rather than retiring them); and, it transpired recently, a ruthless negotiator and litigant over contentious claims. After nine years of negotiations and attritive legal proceedings, BHP has reached a settlement with Brazilian authorities regarding its role in the Fundão tailings dam collapse in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Taking place on November 5, 2015, the results were catastrophic to human life and nature, leaving 19 people dead and spilling toxic sludge over some 700 kilometres of land. The Samarco-owned facility, which held something like 26,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth of tailings (50 million cubic metres), was a joint venture between BHP and Vale. In addition to killing 14 company employees and five residents, the released tailings rapidly reached Bento Rodrigues, and part of the communities of Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira and, for good measure, flooded the centre of the town of Barra Longa. The catastrophe merely compounded, turning the Rio Doce Basin a filthy brown and affecting dozens of municipalities and hundreds of communities reliant on the Rio Doce for drinking water. The pollution also destroyed wildlife, fishing stocks, farmland and churches, and affected various Indigenous communities, including the Krenak, Tupiniquim, Guaranis and Quilombola. In response to the collapse, BHP, Vale and Samarco established the Renova Foundation, intended to compensate individuals and small businesses for losses and ostensibly ameliorating environmental impacts. This was hardly a concession on BHP’s part of guilt. 'Conveniently,' write the authors caustically in a Nature Conservation study on the disaster in August, 'the company creates its foundation to repair its own damages. Through the dense patchwork of multiple lawsuits filed in Brazil, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, BHP has repeatedly denied any central culpability in the collapse. Compensation payments to victims from the fund, to date, have also been scandalously tardy. The BHP 2024 annual report notes that R$17.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) had been paid to 430,000 people as of June 30 this year, with R$12.2 billion (US$2.5 billion) forked out to 110,000 people under the Novel system, or 'court mandated simplified indemnity system'. The company praises this arrangement as one that enabled 'informal workers' (cart drivers, sand miners, artisanal miners and street vendors) to receive compensation despite having 'difficulty proving the damages they suffered'. What BHP fails to underscore is that those under the Novel system had to wait for seven years after the dam collapse to receive any cash, with 40% of those only paid in the last two years. Of the 430,000, some 290,000 received a pitiful R$1050 each for a disruption to their water supply for seven to 10 days following the dam collapse. And just to add to the nastiness of it all, the replacement housing for victims has been of questionable quality. Little wonder that Thatiele Monic, president of the Vila Santa Efigênia and Adjacências Quilombola Association, is suspicious of the efforts of the Renova Foundation. The UK leg of proceedings, commenced in November 2018, is positively Dickensian in legal gyrations. It began as a High Court lawsuit against BHP involving 240,000 plaintiffs, including Brazilian municipalities and Krenak indigenous communities. In November 2020, the court dismissed the lawsuit, with Justice Turner making a memorable remark: 'The task facing the managing judge in England would, I predict, be akin to trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.' Various impediments, not least the size and scale of the claims, including 'jurisdictional cross-contamination' and an abuse of process, were cited. In March 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision, arguing that the plaintiffs were already seeking legal redress in Brazil. In July, the London court of appeal reversed the decision, granting permission to appeal on grounds that the case had a 'real prospect of success'. To not do so would risk real injustice. In July 2022, a Court of Appeal ruled that English courts could hear the case, noting that, 'The vast majority of claimants who have recovered damages have only received very modest sums in respect of moral damages for interruption to their water supply'. An April 2024 date was set for the commencement of trial proceedings. In March 2023, the scale of the class action burgeoned further, with the addition of 500,000 claimants. Attempts by BHP to delay the lawsuit till mid-2025 were rejected by a London court in May 2023. On October 21 this year, the trial finally commenced. It would last all but a few days. The settlement agreement signed on October 25 includes BHP, Vale, Samarco and some half a dozen Brazilian authorities. Of the 42 civil claims against BHP, the October 25 agreement covers the most monumental and contentious. Its value – R$170 billion (US$31.5 billion) – is deceptive. Brazilian authorities can have reason to cheer the result, as it comes close to the R$175 billion sought in civil claims in 2016. BHP’s Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry, also seemed suspiciously satisfied, claiming that the agreement would deliver a laundry list of benefits including 'expanded and additional programs for the environment and for the people, including designated funding for the health system, economic recovery, improved infrastructure and extensive compensation and income support measures, including for farmers, fisher people and Indigenous and Traditional communities.' A sharp analysis from Tony Boyd of the Australian Financial Review, hardly a forum known for its humanitarians and bleeding hearts, offers a rather different reading of Brazilian efforts and the tactics employed by the mining giants. It was evident to Boyd 'that over the past decade, BHP and Vale have outplayed the Brazilian federal government, and statements of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo as well as the federal and state Public Prosecutors’ and Public Defenders’ Offices.' Much of this has to do, as Boyd remarks, on the time value of money. Some 60% of the final R$100 billion settlement is payable over 20 years. Taking that time frame into account, the nominal amount comes to a net present value of R$48 billion. Using the net present value analysis also means that the R$32 billion commitment to cover the cost of removing tailings from the Rio Doce and R$30,000 compensation awards to individuals and small businesses who opt into the arrangement, is R$25 billion. The financial burden arising from BHP’s compensatory undertakings has also been lessened by the near decade process of dispute resolution, allowing the reopening of the Samarco iron ore mine to take place in the meantime with healthy annual returns of US$750 million. Even now, BHP’s mild description of the catastrophe is given a coolly confident assessment. The company’s website notes that since the dam breach, Samarco operates 'with a strong focus on safety and sustainability.' Alleviating the use of dams has been possible because of the implementation of a 'new filtration system', while 80% of the tailings arising from the operations 'are now dry stacked, with the rest deposited in a confined rocky pit.' Feeble assurance to those hundreds of thousands affected that fateful November in 2015.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqNvZ7qDHkLeF	2024-11-04T15:45:22-08:00	
How Do Asia’s Authoritarian States Pick Leaders? – Analysis	By Paul Eckert In a world bracing for a close U.S. presidential election result this week, a large swathe of Asia picks its leaders without suspense -- and mostly with little popular participation. Chinese leader Xi Jinping was confirmed by the National People’s Congress in March 2013 with 2,952 votes for, one against, and three abstentions. Last year the rubber stamp parliament voted unanimously to give him a third term, putting him on track to stay in power for life. North Korea’s leaders have inherited their power from father to son for three generations. They are technically 'elected' – but there is no choice. In 2014, Kim Jong Un was elected to the Supreme People’s Assembly without a dissenting vote with 100% turnout. A leadership succession that played out in Vietnam this year saw a serial purge of political rivals and the death of an ailing top leader propel To Lam, a wily career security policeman to the top of the Communist Party, where he is maneuvering for a key intra-party vote in early 2026. In U.S. elections, the president and vice president are not elected directly in a popular vote by citizens. Instead, they are chosen through the Electoral College process, in which electors equal to the total number of representatives and senators a state has in Congress cast that state’s votes. These electors vote according to the majority of residents in that state. Members of Congress – 100 in the Senate and 435 in the House of the Representatives – are elected directly by residents of each of the 50 states. How do the Communist-ruled countries in Asia choose their leaders? Of the six countries covered by Radio Free Asia, whose mission is to provide independent media to territories that lack it, four – China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam – were founded and organized on the Marxist-Leninist party-state model copied from the Soviet Union. Some countries call themselves 'democratic,' but in practice the people have little or no say in choosing their leaders or governments. NORTH KOREA The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was founded in 1948 by Kim Il Sung, who had been cultivated by Moscow as a Cold War ally in the northern half of Korea. North Korea describes itself as an 'independent socialist state' with universal and compulsory suffrage at 17, and holds elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly, the national legislature every four-to-five years, and for local People’s Assemblies every four years. In practice, each candidate is pre-selected by the North Korean government and voters are allowed to vote either 'yes' or 'no' in ballots that are not private. Nearly all elections report 100% support for the government. CHINA The People’s Republic of China, founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong, describes itself as a 'socialist democracy and a people’s democratic dictatorship.' Xi-era slogans describe it as 'socialist consultative democracy' and 'whole-process people’s democracy.' China has universal suffrage from age 18, with voting at five levels of People’s Congresses, from local townships to cities and provinces, to the parliamentary National People’s Congress. Higher-level Congresses are indirectly elected by delegates of lower-level Congresses. Technically not a one-party state, China has eight non-communist parties, including the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association and the China Association for Promoting Democracy. However, as the U.S.-based Freedom House notes, 'the CCP effectively monopolizes all political activity and does not permit meaningful political competition.' The noncommunist parties serve in an advisory role, 'but their activities are tightly circumscribed, and they must accept the CCP’s leadership as a condition for their existence.' VIETNAM The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, founded in 1975 after Ho Chi Minh’s Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) overthrew the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), likewise followed the Soviet template of one-party politics. Suffrage is universal at age 18, and direct elections are held for local People’s Councils and the National Assembly -- but all candidates are pre-approved by the ruling party. 'Vietnam is a one-party state, dominated for decades by the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam,' says Freedom House. 'Although some independent candidates are technically allowed to run in legislative elections, most are banned in practice.' In the May 2021 elections for 500 National Assembly seats, the Communist Party of Vietnam took 97.2% of the vote, while non-party candidates got 2.8%. The next election is in early 2026. LAOS In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, a Communist protégé of Vietnam also founded in 1975, 'is a one-party state in which the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party dominates all aspects of politics and harshly restricts civil liberties,' says Freedom House. Laos has universal suffrage, and its president, vice president, and prime minister are elected by the National Assembly. These elections, however, have been deemed not free or fair, and in the most recent 2021 poll, the ruling party took 158 of the body’s 164 seats, with the rest going to pre-approved independents. 'The electoral laws and framework are designed to ensure that the LPRP, the only legal party, dominates every election and controls the political system,' says Freedom House. CAMBODIA Radio Free Asia’s other target countries are Cambodia and Myanmar, more pluralistic states that have held competitive, if flawed elections. Cambodia has been holding elections since 1993, as mandated by the 1991 Paris Agreements, which ended the country’s civil war and mandated democratic elections under a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. In practice, however, Cambodia’s political system has been dominated by the Cambodian People’s Party and its leader Hun Sen. A strongman who violently refused to share power with coalition partners in the 1990s, Hun Sen ruled the country for more than three decades until handing power last year to his son, Hun Manet, but still wields great influence. 'While the country conducted semi-competitive elections in the past, polls are now held in a severely repressive environment,' says Freedom House, noting Hun Sen’s penchant for banning popular opposition parties. The July 2023 National Assembly elections, held just a month before Hun Manet took over from his father, were condemned by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations as neither free nor fair. MYANMAR In November 2020, the country formerly known as Burma emerged from only its third semi-competitive election since its independence in 1948, a vote that delivered a strong majority to the National League for Democracy, or NLD, of de facto national leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The multi-party election, which observers widely deemed credible despite flaws with conflict zone voting cancellations and registration, delivered 86 percent of the seats in the Assembly of the Union to Suu Kyi’s NLD, routing the army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. On Feb. 1, 2021, Myanmar’s military, citing baseless claims of election fraud, deposed State Counsellor Suu Kyi and President Win Myint in a coup d’etat, later jailing them. The junta annulled the results of the 2020 vote, and pledged to hold elections in 2023 – but has repeatedly delayed this and extended its emergency rule as the nation became more deeply embroiled in a civil war that has killed thousands and destroyed wide swathes of the country. The military regime has committed to holding a general election late next year, with voting to be staggered because of security concerns, but has continued to extend a state of emergency across the country and brought in tough new registration laws that disqualify many parties from standing. TIBET Chinese-run 'autonomous' regions such as Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang largely follow mainland practices. But Tibetans who followed the Dalai Lama when the spiritual leader fled into exile in India and other countries around the world in 1959, and their descendants, have been choosing their leaders. In 2021, Tibetans living outside of their China-ruled homeland held their third election since 2011, to seat a new political leader, or sikyong, for their India-based government-in-exile called the Central Tibetan Administration. Penpa Tsering won the CTA’s leadership in a vote among the Tibetan diaspora, a community of about 150,000 people living in 40 countries, mainly India, Nepal, Europe and North America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqGBvg9t5Ng9W	2024-11-04T15:41:41-08:00	
At UN, US Confronts Russia Over North Korean Troops For Ukraine	By Margaret Besheer Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine, during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N. Security Council. 'I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in Russia,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name. 'And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation will answer that simple question,' he said. Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming days. 'We're not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,' said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva. U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations. 'The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in front line operations,' he said. South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a 'more desperate and dangerous' way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links between the two neighbors. 'And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own people by dispatching troops to Russia,' said Ambassador JoonKook Hwang. William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North Korean troops are. 'And we don't know how they will react when faced in combat positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,' he said. 'So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.' Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to economic or other support. 'North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,' Naoko Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. 'And this is a little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development, for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.' She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula. On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions that Russia previously voted for. Ballistic missile launch The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30 missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 'The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,' Japan’s ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. 'This ICBM launch is more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000 kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched to date.' He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from North Korea. North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as 'unlawful' and interference in its domestic affairs. 'Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard security of our state as well peace of the region involved,' said Ambassador Kim Song. Russia sides with North Korea 'The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet another step towards demonizing the DPRK,' said Ambassador Evstigneeva. She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula because of its recent military exercises with South Korea. South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch and strongly condemned it. 'Its intention could be to distract the world's attention from its troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,' said Ambassador Hwang. 'Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,' he said. VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqN2XSO3H3KkE	2024-11-04T15:38:03-08:00	
Early Peace Plan Shows Russia’s Intent To Neutralize Ukraine – An...	By Yelizaveta Surnacheva and Systema (RFE/RL) -- Early in peace talks that began days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow proposed a treaty whose one-sided conditions amounted to Kyiv's surrender, according to a draft obtained by Systema, RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit. Acceptance of the proposal would have left Ukraine a neutral nation with a tiny, toothless army, no recourse to protection by NATO states, and no chance of regaining control over Crimea or the Donbas, where it would have had to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in their entirety, including the large portions still under Kyiv's control at the time. The proposed pact sheds light on Russian President Vladimir Putin's goals in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, none of which he has publicly renounced, and which he has repeatedly asserted will be achieved. It comes as the all-out war heads toward its fourth year with no clear sign of an end in sight but amid indications that peace talks could potentially be in the cards in 2025 or later. The draft -- titled Treaty On The Resolution Of The Situation In Ukraine And The Neutrality Of Ukraine -- is dated March 7, 2022, 11 days after Russia launched the invasion and a week after talks between Ukraine and Russia began.Composed in Moscow and handed to the Ukrainian delegation that day, at the third round of talks, in a town in the Belavezha forest in Belarus, it is the first known document laying out Russia's conditions for a peace deal after the start of the full-scale invasion. Systema obtained the draft from a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiations, and a Russian source close to the talks confirmed its authenticity. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The talks began on February 28, 2022, at a time when Russian forces had seized swaths of territory in the south, east, and north of Ukraine, where they had advanced close to Kyiv after pouring across the border from Russia and Belarus. Some sessions were held in person, others online. The process petered out in late April of the same year, as the sides wrangled over major points of dispute and following revelations of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha, a city outside Kyiv that the invading forces had abandoned as they withdrew from northern Ukraine after failing to capture the capital or force Ukraine's capitulation. 'Not Neutrality, But Neutralization' The Russian proposal sets out terms for Ukraine's neutrality, a status Kyiv appeared ready to accept at the time. But Eric Ciaramella, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that Putin seems to have been seeking 'something more radical -- not neutrality, but the neutralization of Ukraine as an independent state. Russia's goal from the very beginning was to destroy Ukraine's ability to defend itself.' A country 'can be neutral and have a very strong army and be capable of self-defense…. But that's not what Russia had in mind here,' he said. 'The document was structured as if Ukraine were the aggressor defeated on the battlefield, which, of course, did not reflect reality,' Ciaramella said of the Russian draft dated March 7, 2022, which he read at Systema's request. 'It's hard to say whether this was a genuine attempt to negotiate, as such terms would be unacceptable to any Ukrainian. They would have neutralized Ukraine to the point of making it defenseless.' The draft called for Ukraine to shrink its army to no more than 50,000 personnel, about five times fewer than it had in 2022, and would have barred Ukraine from developing or deploying missiles with a range of over 250 kilometers. Moscow would have been able to prohibit other types of weapons in the future. It also called for the removal of all sanctions imposed on Russia by Ukraine or the West since 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and fomented war in the Donbas. Ukraine would have been forced to formally recognize Crimea as Russian and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent. Kyiv would have had to pay for reconstruction in the Donbas. 'Deeply Erroneous Logic' The pact would have left a truncated Ukraine highly vulnerable, with Russian forces remaining in place and no way for Kyiv to defend itself or seek Western security support. Documents from later stages of the talks, including treaty drafts from March 17 and April 15 that were published by The New York Times earlier this year, show that the sides drew closer on some issues as the talks progressed -- and as Ukraine beat back Moscow's forces in the north. Crimea's status would have been left for future negotiations, for example, and Russian demands for changes in legislation involving languages and thorny historical disputes faded into the background. Crucially, the sides were discussing security guarantees for Ukraine that would include Western nations, though how they would work was a major bone of contention. However, Ciaramella suggested that in fundamental ways, little had changed. 'The versions discussed a few weeks later in Istanbul and at virtual sessions were still based on the deeply erroneous Russian logic that permeated the initial text,' he told Systema. 'Had the treaty been signed, its final form in April would have been merely a softer version of Ukrainian capitulation.' The subsequent drafts still included some of Russia's key demands, such as a permanent bar on NATO membership for Ukraine, something that neither Kyiv nor the Western alliance is prepared to accept. NATO has repeatedly said that Ukraine will eventually join, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been seeking a swift invitation as part of a 'victory plan' he has presented to Ukrainians and the country's backers abroad in recent weeks. In at least one way, meanwhile, Russia's stated conditions for peace have grown more aggressive than they were on March 7, 2022. In September of that year, Putin claimed that five Ukrainian regions – Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson -- were now inalienable parts of Russia. The baseless claim included the portions of those regions that remained, and still remain, in Kyiv's hands, and Putin has said that Russian control over those territories is a requirement for any peace negotiations.

India: Reviving Islamist Threat In Assam – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum Assam which for long had been threatened by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-backed Islamist extremist groups, is once again facing renewed threats from such groupings – both operating out of Pakistani and Bangladeshi soil. Global Islamist terrorist formations also create security challenges. A majority of the Islamist militant groups in Assam were founded between 1990 and 1996 with the prime objective of safeguarding the ‘overall interests’ of the minority Muslim communities in the region. On October 5, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 10 operatives of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) from the Goalpara and Hojai Districts of Assam, during a massive crackdown in the JeM conspiracy case. The arrests included Sheikh Sultan Salah Uddin Ayubi aka Ayubi, from Krishnai in Goalpara District. He was arrested for his role in conspiracy case RC-13/2024/NIA/DLI. During the operation, NIA seized several incriminating documents, electronic devices, pamphlets and magazines, and is examining further leads. The Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, explained that the arrests 'bring home' the reality that Islamist extremist groups are becoming a bigger menace in Assam, and that the state's indigenous population could face difficulties in the years to come if the extremist Islamist doctrine persists in Assam. According to partial data compiled by the South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 14 operatives of different Islamist terrorist groups – JeM, 10; and Ansar-al-Islam (AaI)/Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and Islamic State (IS), two each – have been arrested in 2024 (data till November 2, 2024). In the corresponding period of 2023, at least 11 such operatives – Popular Front of India (PFI) and ABT, five each; and one (group not identified) – were arrested. Details of the remaining arrests in 2024, apart from the incident of October 5, are given below: May 13: Assam Police arrested two operatives of the AaI – Bahar Mia (30) and Rasel Mia (40), both residents of Bangladesh – from Guwahati in the Kamrup (Metro) District of Assam. The duo was illegally staying in India without passports, had obtained Indian documents through fraudulent means, and was working to spread a terrorist network in Assam and India. March 20: The Assam Police’s Special Task Force (STF) arrested two high-ranking leaders of IS, Haris Farooqi aka Harish Ajmal Farukhi and Anurag Singh aka Rehan, in an operation in the Dharmasala area of Dhubri District in Assam. They were arrested after they entered Assam from Bangladesh. Farooqi, identified as the ‘head’ of IS in India, and Singh, his associate, were planning sabotage activities after entering India. Both were involved in recruitment, terrorist funding, and plotting attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and face charges from NIA, Delhi and Lucknow Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), and other agencies. Over the past several years, transborder Islamist terrorist groups, mainly based in Bangladesh, including Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and AaI, have been trying to establish their bases in Assam. On March 4, 2022, the Special Branch of the Assam Police arrested five people, including a Bangladesh national, Saiful Islam aka Haroon Rashid aka Mohammed Suman, for their alleged links with AaI. They were arrested from Barpeta, Howly and Kalgachia, all in Barpeta District. Saiful Islam had illegally entered India and was working as a teacher in the Dhakalipara masjid. Saiful Islam had successfully indoctrinated and motivated the four others to join the module, with a view to developing the Barpeta District of Assam as a base for jihadi activities of Al-Qaeda and its related organisations. Chief Minister Sarma had then disclosed that the militants of AaI modules arrested in the state in 2022 were using sophisticated peer-to-peer encrypted chat apps for communication. Further, he had also disclosed that during the Coronovairus-19 (Covid-19) years the AaI modules were training cadres in bomb making in Barpeta District. He had added that Assam had become a 'hotbed for jihadi activities'. Similarly, NIA arrested two operatives of the AaI module in Barpeta District, Akbar Ali and Abul Kalam Azad, on April 5, 2023, and filed a charge sheet against them on August 29, 2023, for conspiring and plotting to execute terrorist activities. NIA said that the radicalisation and mobilisation of Muslims were done through the module’s Bangladeshi handlers – Zakir and Mehboor Rahman. Islamist radical group PFI, which the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) pronounced an 'unlawful association' on September 28, 2022 for conspiring to establish Islamic rule in India by 2047, with its main roots in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, has also paved its way into Assam. However, there were no PFI-linked arrests in 2024, though three incidents of arrest linked to the group were recorded in 2023: May 17: Assam Police arrested one PFI operative, Abdul Razzaq Ali, from the Nagarbera area of Kamrup District. April 23: Two PFI operatives, Saiful Islam and Shafiqul Islam, were arrested from the Dhubri District of Assam. The arrested operatives taught in a madrasa(Islamic Seminary), Al-Jamiatul Asia Lil Banat Panbari, of Dhubri. April 8: Two PFI operatives, Zakir Hussain and Samad Ahmed, were arrested along with one operative of the group’s student wing, Campus Front of India (CFI), Jahidul Islam Mirdha, from the Barpeta Railway Station area in Barpeta District. Zakir Hussain served as the ‘secretary’ of the Assam state committee of PFI, while Samad Ahmed was the ‘president’ of the PFI Assam State Committee, and Jahidul Islam was the ‘president’ of the CFI Assam Committee. Further, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati student, Touseef Ali Farooqui (20) – in the 4th-year at the Bioscience – was arrested on March 23, 2024, in Kamrup District, while trying to leave the country in an attempt to join IS. With the arrests of operatives from various terrorist groups, such as JeM, AaI, IS, AQIS, and PFI, it is evident that Islamist radicalisation has found some foothold in Assam. In a press release dated October 5, 2024, on the arrest of JeM operatives, the NIA observed, 'The suspects were engaged in radicalising individuals associated with JeM, and were engaged in disseminating terrorist-related propaganda, and radicalising and recruiting youth into the Jamaat outfit inspired by JeM. These suspects were involved in motivating youth into committing violent terror attacks across India.' An NIA official also informed The Assam Tribune on October 26, 2024, that terrorist groups had been using digital or online social media platforms to recruit and radicalise young people from Assam. These tactics are comparable to those used by Islamist terrorist groups based in Pakistan, as well as Khalistani groups. In this regard, an unnamed senior intelligence officer observed, 'With the inroads and improvement of information technology, terrorist outfits do not have to send their own people to India, but they can induct youths into their fold by sitting thousands of miles away.' According to official inputs, radical Islamist terrorist groups have likely increased their recruitment efforts in the aftermath of the August 5, 2024, coup and the subsequent chaos in Bangladesh. Indian intelligence agencies have reported that the Bangladesh-based terrorist group AaI may try to establish a presence in Assam and West Bengal. Reports indicate that a prominent AaI leader, Abdullah Talah, was working to spread AaI influence in northeastern India. Moreover, Jashimuddin Rahmani, another prominent AaI leader was released by the interim government of Bangladesh at a time when AaI has been attempting to create a jihadi network with the aid of sleeper cells, especially in Assam and Tripura in India. As SAIR noted earlier, a majority of the Islamist extremist and terrorist groups in Assam were founded between 1990 and 1996, with the prime objective of safeguarding the ‘overall interests’ of the minority Muslim communities in the region. According to SATP, at least 20 Islamist terrorist formations have operated in Assam at different periods. Meanwhile, the surge in infiltration attempts by Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas into Assam, after the coup in Bangladesh, also creates additional potential risks. Chief Minister Sarma tweeted in October that around 130 individuals, who were attempting to enter Assam illegally from Bangladesh in the preceding two months, following the political turmoil that erupted in Bangladesh, had been intercepted by the Assam Police. In a video message on his social media platforms, Sarma announced that the process of establishing 12 Border Outposts in proximity to the Indo-Bangla border was underway to bolster coordination with the Central agencies. The attempt to re-establish Islamist terrorist groups’ bases in Assam and the demographic infiltration by foreign elements, particularly those from Bangladesh, have raised renewed concerns about security in Assam in particular, and northeastern India at large.

Bangladesh: JeI’s Political Reinvention – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya Since the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, 2024, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) is back to the political forefront in Bangladesh, trying to expand its own area of influence and weigh its political options within the current chaos and instability. On October 28, 2024, at a JeI protest rally at the Public Library ground against the 'Logi-Boitha' (Boat-hook and Oar) Movement by the Awami League on October 28, 2006, on which day six members of JeI were killed in broad daylight, council member Mahbubur Rahman Belal pledged to establish a 'model Islamic society' in honour of the 'martyrs' sacrifices'. Belal stated, 'The fascist Awami League murderers established a demonic reign by killing thousands of Islam-loving people. Almighty Allah has broken their all prides by sending them abroad through the student-people mass upsurge…That case has to be revived again. Murderer Sheikh Hasina must be brought to justice and be given appropriate punishment. ' On October 24, 2024, JeI’s chief Shafiqur Rahman announced at a meeting of the central working committee that Selim Uddin had been elected chief of JeI Dhaka City north unit for the 2025-2026 session. On October 23, 2024, JeI filed a review petition with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in order to turn down its 2011 verdict that scrapped the non-party caretaker government system. JeI’s secretary general Miah Golam Porwar submitted the petition through his lawyer Mohammad Shishir Manir seeking necessary directives to reinstate the system. On October 13, 2024, after 19 years, the Dhaka City north unit of JeI held a public conference called ‘Rukun Sammelan’ at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Center in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka, to elect its next chief, with over 10,000 Rukun (party members) voting through secret ballots. During this conference, JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman called for the trial of the Awami League under laws that were enacted during the rule of the AL regime, stating that justice must be established as soon as possible to ensure that they [Awami League] get what they truly deserve. JeI got a new lease on life when, on August 28, 2024, the Interim Government led by Muhammad Yunus lifted the ban on the group and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS). Under the powers provided in Section 18 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009, the Interim Government cancelled the previous circular that banned JeI-ICS. The Home Ministry issued a notification in this regard. The gazette notification read, 'Since there is no concrete evidence of involvement of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its student organization Islami Chhatra Shibir in terrorism and violence… and since the Government believes that Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and all its affiliates, including its student body Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, are not involved in terrorist activities.' Earlier, on August 1, 2024, the previous Awami League-led government had banned JeI, ICS, and all of their associated organisations as political entities under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, following nationwide unrest, citing the threat posed by the fundamentalist party to public security. According to partial data collated by South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since the year 2000, 285 persons, including 112 civilians, 6 Security Force (SF) personnel, and 167 JeI/ICS cadres have been killed in 199 incidents of JeI-ICS linked violence (data till November 2, 2024). JeI was formed in undivided India on August 26, 1941, in Lahore's Islamia Park by its first Ameer (chief) Maulana Abul A'la Maududi, with the goal of developing an Islamic community of devout believers. After India's Partition in 1947, the party was divided into Jamat-e-Islami Hind and Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. JeI started its activities in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during the 1950s. The Jamaat had also been banned on two earlier occasions, in 1959 and 1964, in Pakistan (prior to the creation of Bangladesh), for its communal role. During the Bangladesh liberation struggle, JeI in East Pakistan joined forces with the Pakistan Army to participate in the genocide of an estimated three million civilians, and a range of brutal crimes, including the widespread use of rape as a weapon. Jamaat has never regretted or offered apology for its role in 1971. In independent Bangladesh, JeI resumed overt activities in 1979. Between 1981 and 1987, the number of full members of JeI rose from 650 to 2,000, while associate membership doubled to approximately two million. The rising popularity of the organization renewed its political ambitions. The party played a crucial role in Governments formed by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1991 and 2001. The JeI had 18 seats in the Jatiyo Shangshad(Bangladesh Parliament) of 1991 and 17 seats in 2001. In 1996, it had three seats. In the General Elections of 2008, it secured five seats. After the Awami League came to power in 2009, the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) was established to try those accused of war crimes. The War Crimes (WC) Trials, which began on March 25, 2010, have so far indicted 50 members of JeI. Prominent leaders of Jamaat were convicted and hanged, including JeI politician Abdul Quader Mollah (hanged in 2013), Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami (hanged in 2016) and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mujaheed (hanged in 2015). Ghulam Azam was sentenced to 90 years in prison, while Delawar Hossain Sayedee’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Both died while serving jail terms. Yet, it appears, the Jamaat has been thriving. As reported in June, 2023, in 2008, the number of the party's permanent members or Rukun was 23,863. That figure now stands at 73,046, a threefold rise. The Islamist party has also recorded a threefold rise in the number of its activists, which has leapt to 6.39 lakh from 2.21 lakh during the same period. Additionally, there has been a nearly fivefold rise in the party's women Rukun, and a fourfold rise in women activists. Similarly, the number of associate members has now grown to 22.9 million from 10.3 million in 2008. As expected, along with Jamaat, ICS is also demonstrating its ‘presence’ since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster from power. On October 29, ICS announced its Jahangirnagar University (JU) committee, in a statement on its Facebook page. The names of the committee’s president Harunur Rashid Rafi, secretary Mohibur Rahman Mohib, and publicity secretary Abdullah Al Mamun Saki were declared. On October 28, a Facebook post by ICS revealed that it had 2,200 active members in the Islami University in Kushtia. The post identified ICS’s university unit president HM Abu Musa and general secretary Mahmudul, as having held their posts since January 1, 2024. On October 3, ICS’s Dhaka University (DU) unit declared its full 14-member DU committee. According to the announcement made on Facebook, Mohammad Abu Shadik Kayem was appointed president, with SM Farhad serving as the general secretary. Further, on October 23, a Rangpur Court acquitted 41 JeI-ICS leaders and activists, in a case filed under the Speedy Trial Act-2002, 11 years ago. Judge Zulkan Nahim of the Rangpur Senior Judicial Magistrate Court-1 passed the order acquitting all the accused leaders and activists of Jamaat and Shibir. The case was filed for creating chaos and vandalism on February 18, 2013. The Jamaat has also been trying to extend its outreach to other countries in order to expand its organisational base, mobilise new members and raise funds. In 2022, JeI sent letters to different Muslim countries and Islamic organisations abroad, describing its current political situation in Bangladesh and branding the then Awami League government ‘anti-Islam’. The organisation wrote to the Chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood on December 8, 2022; the Malaysian Prime Minister on November 24, 2022; the Chairman of The Welfare Party of Turkey on November 6, 2022; the President of The Felicity Party of Turkey on October 24, 2022; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 17, 2022 and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on September 30, 2022. Since, August 5, 2024, representatives of many countries have tried to reach out to Jamaat to discuss the future course of politics in Bangladesh. On October 21, JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman met with the Ambassadors of Denmark and Sweden, Christian Brax Møller and Nicholas Weeks, along with Norway's Deputy Head of Mission Marian Rabe Navelsrud. According to JeI’s press release, the meeting discussed Bangladesh's interests, particularly its democracy and electoral system. The ambassadors shared their experiences with the numerical proportional election system used in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, offering suggestions on implementing a similar system in Bangladesh. On October 14, Acting High Commissioner Nardia Simpson, Australian High Commission Bangladesh, met JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman to discuss Australia's views on building strong institutions to ensure the protection and fulfilment of human rights. Shafiqur disclosed that they discussed how to advance relations with 'mutual respect and love,' and described the meeting as 'very friendly and successful.' Earlier, on September 2, 2024, Chinese Ambassador to Dhaka Yao Wen held a meeting with Jamaat’s chief Shafiqur Rahman at the party’s central office in Dhaka. The two talked about political changes in Bangladesh and promised closer co-operation between the people and governments of both the countries. Under the current political scenario of Bangladesh, JeI-ICS are here to stay, thrive and assert their radical political ambition. The future of Bangladesh is likely to substantially be dictated by the radical ideology of JeI-ICS cohort, as democratic and liberal voices are systematically silenced in the country.

Pentagon Says 10K North Korean Troops In Kursk Oblast	By Jim Garamone There are 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, and the Pentagon press secretary said if they enter combat, they are legitimate targets for Ukrainian soldiers. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder also said officials estimate there are now 11,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia. 'We've seen the press reports about alleged [North Korean] combat ops, and we're looking into those,' Ryder told reporters during a news conference. 'At this point, we cannot corroborate those reports. But as you heard [Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III] say last week, should these troops engage in combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.' The North Korean troops entered Russia last month, and Russian troops are training those forces in infantry tactics, operating with unmanned aerial vehicles, artillery tactics, trench-clearing and the like, officials said. 'All indications are that they will provide some type of combat or combat support capability,' the general said. 'We would fully expect that the Ukrainians would do what they need to do to defend themselves and their personnel.' The Russians have provided the North Korean troops with Russian uniforms and equipment. 'We'll see exactly how these forces are integrated into Russian operations, and how they're committed to the battlefield, assuming that they are replacements for Russian forces,' he said. Ryder pointed to Austin's remarks last week discussing the large number of casualties Russian forces are suffering. The North Korean forces could be coming in 'to replace the massive losses that Russia is experiencing. I think that is probably a fair assessment, and I certainly would not want to be a North Korean soldier there.' Ryder also discussed the deployment of additional U.S. forces to the Central Command region. Austin ordered additional ballistic missile defense destroyers, fighter squadrons, tanker aircraft and several B-52 long-range strike bombers to the area. The B-52 bombers have already arrived in the region with the other forces expected in the days and weeks to come. 'These forces will begin to arrive as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group prepares to depart,' Ryder said. 'These deployments are in keeping with our commitments to the protection of U.S. citizens and forces in the Middle East, the defense of Israel and de-escalation through deterrence and diplomacy.' These forces join other U.S. assets such as the terminal high-altitude area missile defense system, which has deployed to Israel, as well as an amphibious ready group, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit. These forces 'demonstrate the flexible nature of U.S. global defense posture and U.S. capability to deploy worldwide on short notice to meet evolving national security threats,' Ryder said. 'Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqBb3CZfNdiFE	2024-11-04T15:28:50-08:00	
Israel’s Campaign Against UNRWA Precedes Oct. 7 – OpEd	The Israeli Knesset last week adopted two bills that will effectively ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, from carrying out any activity in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Simply put, the decision is catastrophic, because UNRWA is the main international body responsible for the welfare of millions of Palestinians throughout the Occupied Territories and much of the region. Israel followed up its decision by attacking and damaging an UNRWA office in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank. This was the Israeli government’s way of demonstrating its seriousness regarding the matter. This is not the first time that Israel has pursued an anti-UNRWA agenda and, contrary to claims by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, the decision is not linked to the current genocidal war on Gaza or the unfounded claims that UNRWA supports 'terrorism.' An independent review commissioned by the UN in April revealedthat Israel 'made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' but that it 'has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.' However, Israel’s claims did a great deal of damage to the organization, as 13 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany and Italy, withheld badly needed funds that were helping Gaza stave off a horrific famine. Eventually, most of these countries reinstated their financial support, though without apologizing to the Palestinians who were adversely impacted by their unfair initial decisions. Unrepentant, Israel continued to unleash its relentless war on the organization. 'UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable,' Netanyahu said in a statement last week. The anti-UNRWA rhetoric remains functional for Israel. Amplified by the ever-willing US mainstream media, Israel has managed to keep UNRWA’s name in the news, always associating it with 'supporting terrorism.' So, when the Knesset voted for the anti-UNRWA bills, many media outlets conveyed the news as if it was the only rational conclusion to an essentially fabricated story. Israel’s problem with UNRWA has little to do with the organization itself, but with its underlying political representation as a UN entity whose mission is predicated on providing 'assistance and protection to Palestine refugees.' UNRWA was established in 1949 by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV). It began its operations on May 1, 1950, and, with time, it became central to the survival of a large number of Palestinian refugee communities in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Many have rightly criticized the UN for failing to supplement UNRWA’s humanitarian mandate with a political equivalent that would ultimately help Palestinians achieve their right of return in accordance with UN Resolution 194. For Israel, however, UNRWA remained problematic. According to Tel Aviv’s thinking, UNRWA’s existence is a constant reminder that there is a distinct group of people called Palestinian refugees. And though UNRWA is not a political organization, the Palestinian refugee crisis and all related UN resolutions that emphasize the 'inalienable' rights of these refugees are very political. Taking advantage of the initial, albeit brief, sympathy with Israel worldwide and the massive campaign of misinformation emanating from Israel and its allies, Netanyahu used the Oct. 7 attacks as an opportunity to further demonize UNRWA. However, his campaign started much earlier. One key player in the war on UNRWA has been Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former US President Donald Trump. Kushner, who invested much time in helping Israel, made UNRWA a key point in his plan. He vowed to carry out a 'sincere effort to disrupt' the work of the organization, a leaked 2018 email revealed. Due to international rejection and solidarity, Kushner ultimately failed. Even the withholding of funds by the US administration did not force the organization to shut down, although it did negatively impact the lives of millions of Palestinians. The ongoing war on Gaza and the push to annex large parts of the West Bank represented a golden opportunity for Netanyahu and his extremist government to increase the pressure on UNRWA. They have been enabled by unconditional US support and the willingness of various Western governments to recklessly act upon Israel’s false claims regarding the UN organization. By allowing Israel to delegitimize the very organization responsible for enforcing international law, the UN’s crisis becomes much deeper. An impassioned plea made by UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese last week reflected the frustration felt by many UN-affiliated officials regarding the growing irrelevance of the organization. In a speech, Albanese pointed out that, if the UN’s failures continue, it will become 'more and more irrelevant to the rest of the world,' especially during these times of turmoil. This irrelevance is already being felt by millions of Palestinians, mainly in Gaza but also in the West Bank. Though Palestinians continue to withstand and reject and resist Israeli aggression, they are fed up with an international system that seems to offer them only words and little action. Israel’s banning of UNRWA should represent an opportunity for those concerned about the standing of the UN to remind Israel that member states that have no respect for international law deserve to be delegitimized. This time, words must be accompanied by action. Nothing else will suffice.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqNyVu7n0dbzF	2024-11-04T15:24:52-08:00	
Sacred Artifact Dispute Reveals Japan-Korea Tensions – OpEd	By Cristian Martini Grimaldi (UCA News) -- Long-standing tensions between Japan and South Korea have reached a symbolic peak over a Buddhist statue stolen from Kannonji Temple on the Japanese island of Tsushima and transported to South Korea in 2012. This is despite South Korea’s Supreme Court recently ruling in favor of its return. Though a small group of individuals stole the statue, its fate has become a broader reflection of unresolved tensions that echo historical grievances dating back to Japan’s occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Even though both governments formally signed a UNESCO convention mandating the return of the stolen cultural property, the South Korean government’s inaction has reignited the complex debate surrounding anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea. The Buddhist statue at the center of this controversy, the 'Seated Statue of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva,' holds a special place in Japan as a designated cultural property of Nagasaki Prefecture. It was stolen by a South Korean group in 2012, marking one of many artifacts removed from Japanese temples by South Korean thieves during a time when Tsushima’s temples and shrines were under repeated assault. This theft wave led to intense anti-theft security measures across the island and fueled frustration among the Japanese population. Korean authorities recovered the religious artifact in early 2013, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea claimed ownership, arguing that the statue had been initially looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. In response, Kannonji Temple stated that it had acquired the statue legally during the Joseon Period to protect it from frequent iconoclasm. This position holds historical support given the extensive records of Korean iconoclastic acts in temples at that time. The dispute over the statue, therefore, represents not just a question of ownership but an ongoing struggle over the memory of Japan’s occupation of Korea and how history is perceived on both sides of the East Sea. This is far from the only point of contention between Japan and South Korea, as recent years have seen multiple diplomatic and economic disputes that underscore the fragility of their relationship: For instance, South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered Japanese companies to pay reparations to Korean laborers forced to work during World War II, a ruling Japan strongly opposed. Japan argues that all reparation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty, but many in Korea see this as insufficient acknowledgment of historical wrongs. And of course, in 2019, Japan placed export restrictions on materials vital to South Korea’s technology sector, officially citing security concerns. South Korea interpreted this as retaliation for the forced labor compensation rulings, resulting in a trade dispute that impacted high-tech industries in both countries. And the most internationally known case of comfort women. South Korea has long demanded a more formal apology and compensation for the Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during the occupation. While Japan has offered apologies and financial support over the years, South Korean public sentiment is that Japan’s remorse is thus incomplete. The topic often arises on anniversaries and at international forums, fueling resentment on both sides. Let’s not forget the territorial disputes over the Dokdo/Takeshima Islands. Both countries claim sovereignty over the Dokdo (in Korean) or Takeshima (in Japanese) Islands, which are located in the Sea of Japan. This territorial dispute is another recurring issue that stirs up strong emotions, with both sides staging protests and diplomatic statements asserting their claims. The recent resistance from South Korea to returning the stolen Buddhist statue demonstrates that its national identity is still fueled by lingering resentment toward Japan. This unwillingness to fully reconcile reflects a societal perspective in which Japan’s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 remains a defining trauma. For many South Koreans, Japan’s actions during the occupation are not merely historical facts but a reminder of a brutal period that shaped the nation’s modern identity. South Korea’s national ethos continues to be influenced by historical remembrance, which, in some ways, also shapes the political landscape. Political leaders in South Korea occasionally evoke anti-Japanese sentiment to rally public support or to divert attention from internal challenges, a tactic that has successfully resonated due to the ingrained historical narratives. The question of returning the Buddhist statue may seem like a small diplomatic matter, but it highlights the broader, unresolved issues between Japan and South Korea. While both nations are allies of the United States and share common concerns over regional security, including the threat from North Korea, their strained relations often limit real effective cooperation. In the end, the fate of the Buddhist statue remains a powerful symbol of a fractured history that, even in modern times, still holds sway over both nations’ political and cultural landscapes. The broader question is whether Japan and South Korea can move beyond symbolic disputes to focus on a future that acknowledges but is not overshadowed by their shared past. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqEP4yrQaDPjO	2024-11-04T15:23:30-08:00	
Lying, Sitting Or All-Fours Position?	Whether lying on their back, all-fours position, sitting upright or squatting - women adopt different birthing positions during childbirth. What has not yet been researched is how the respective final birthing position affects the satisfaction of the woman giving birth. Researchers from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn and the University of Cologne have now investigated precisely this. In particular, they also took into account whether the choice of birthing position was voluntary. The results showed that it was precisely when this was chosen voluntarily that women were more satisfied. Around three quarters of those surveyed were lying during the birth and were particularly dissatisfied if they felt that they had not made this choice themselves. However, if the expectant mothers had chosen the supine or lateral supine position themselves, the position actually tended to make them more satisfied. The study has now been published in the journal 'Archives of Gynecology'. For a long time, the supine position was the most common birth position in Western countries - this gave obstetricians unhindered access to the woman and child. In various cultures, however, upright birthing positions, such as sitting or squatting, are also widespread. Which position is best for expectant mothers and the unborn child is controversial in the literature. 'Until today, international guidelines usually only recommend that women should adopt their preferred birthing position,' explains Prof. Dr. Nadine Scholten, who recently became head of the UKB's Research Unit for Health Communication and Health Services Research and holds a professorship in psychosomatic and psycho-oncological health services research at the University of Bonn. With regard to birthing positions, the German guideline also states that women should adopt the position that seems most comfortable to them. However, they should also be encouraged to adopt an upright position in the final phase of birth. 'In reality, whether they ultimately lie, sit or squat depends on the wishes of the expectant mothers themselves, but also on the suggestions of the midwives, obstetricians and sometimes necessary medical measures,' explains Prof. Dr. Brigitte Strizek, Director of the Clinic for Obstetrics and Prenatal Medicine at the UKB. Focus on women's satisfaction A team led by first and corresponding author Prof. Scholten, who carried out the study at the Institute for Medical Sociology, Health Services Research and Rehabilitation Research (IMVR) at the University of Cologne and the UKB, wanted to find out which birthing position women were most satisfied with afterwards. Almost 800 mothers were asked about their final birthing position and how satisfied they were with the birth overall using an anonymous questionnaire. All of the data analyzed here was from women who had given birth vaginally in a hospital without the use of a vacuum extraction or forceps, and who had given birth eight to twelve months previously at the time of the survey. In their study, the researchers also asked about the satisfaction of the mothers - depending on whether the birth position was freely chosen or not. The reasons for not choosing a free position were also asked. It was found that over three quarters of mothers gave birth to their child lying on their side or on their back. Of these women, up to 40 percent stated that they had not chosen the birth position voluntarily. 'The most common reason given by respondents was instructions from medical staff,' explains Prof. Scholten. The most common position assigned by obstetricians was the supine position. It was striking that women were more satisfied with their birth if they were allowed to choose the position voluntarily - especially if they chose the supine position themselves. Women who were not free to choose their birthing position were particularly dissatisfied if the medical staff specified this and not the CTG to record the heart rate of the unborn child and labor activity or the epidural, the anesthetic to relieve pain, prevented the desired position. Self-determination not always given in the delivery room 'The number of women who did not choose the birth position themselves is particularly striking, as is the associated lower level of satisfaction with the birth,' summarizes co-author Prof. Strizek. However, the team cannot confirm whether an increased voluntary choice of birth position in the future would result in fewer women giving birth in the supine position. 'In order to increase women's subjective satisfaction with their birth experience, they should be given the opportunity to adopt their preferred position,' appeals lead author Prof. Scholten. 'The first step is to increase the awareness of medical staff and empower women to understand and better communicate their preferences.' Prof. Strizek adds: 'If a certain position would be advantageous for the woman giving birth from a medical point of view, we as obstetric teams need to explain this better to the women so that they rarely have the feeling that they have not determined the birth position themselves.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqCOmzdtD1u__	2024-11-04T15:21:44-08:00	
Spain: Crowds Throw Mud, Insults At King On Visit To Flood-Hit Va...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Spain’s King Felipe VI was met with hostility from residents on Sunday (3 November) as he visited Paiporta, one of the hardest-hit towns in the Valencia region, where frustration is mounting over delays in weather warnings and emergency response following last week’s devastating floods. At the moment of writing, the storm caused devastating floods that have killed more than 217 people, with many more feared missing. At least 62 people died in Paiporta, a suburb of the city of Valencia, RTVE reported. The king and Queen Letizia, accompanied by Spain’s Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and Valencia’s regional President, Carlos Mazón, toured the flood-hit town where rescue and cleanup efforts were underway. Teams continued to search for missing people while clearing mud and water from homes. Online footage captured scenes of angry crowds booing, shouting insults, and hurling mud at the King’s entourage as they moved through Paiporta’s streets. Shouts of 'murderers,' 'shame,' and 'get out' could be heard in the footage, while a young man was seen accusing the King of a 'disgraceful' response to the disaster, EFE reported. Though Queen Letizia, the Prime Minister, and the regional president were later evacuated, the King reportedly stayed behind to continue speaking with residents affected by the tragedy. This disaster marks Spain’s deadliest flood in over a century. The floods sparked outrage over delays with weather warnings and the perceived slow emergency response time by authorities. Sánchez announced on Saturday that he had ordered 10,000 additional police officers and soldiers to assist with the rescue work. 'It is time to put all our efforts into the colossal task ahead. We have only one enemy to fight: the destruction caused by the catastrophe. We have to give it our all. And we have to do it together. Together,' the Spanish PM said Saturday. Nearly a week after the disaster struck, weather warnings for severe rain and thunderstorms remained in effect for much of Spain’s east coast.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSv_IMdCVDzTh	2024-11-03T17:28:03-08:00	
Fighting Ideologies: Lessons Learned From The War On Terror And T...	By Heather S. Gregg Introduction (FPRI) -- The United States along with its allies and partners devoted critical time and energy to countering the ideology of al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) as part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat these groups in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). These ideologies, which were part of a larger interpretation of Islam called Jihadi Salafism, formed a critical warfighting capability for these terrorist groups that explained what was wrong with the world and who was to blame for it, an ideal state for how the world ought to be, and how to get there. Today, the United States and its allies face threats posed by strategic state competitors, especially Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. While considerable focus has been placed on these countries’ military capabilities, including their nuclear ambitions, considerably less attention has been paid to understanding and fighting their ideologies. As with AQ, ISIS, and other Salafi Jihadis, ideology plays a critical role in the warfighting capabilities of our strategic competitors, and we should be actively taking measures to undermine their ideology. Some (but not all) of the lessons learned from countering Jihadi Salafism have application to today’s fight against our strategic adversaries. Most importantly, we need to understand ideology as a warfighting capability and consider how our actions uphold or undermine these ideologies. Additionally, we need to fight both the military capacity and the ideology of our adversaries in a synergistic way where both are undermined simultaneously. And, while doing this, we need to be careful of increased apocalypticism in our adversaries’ ideologies, which could signal a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Ideology as a Warfighting Capability It is important to first understand the critical role that ideology plays in conflict of any shape and size. Ideologies are an important warfighting capability because they offer an overarching narrative that explains the current state of the world we live in, who is to blame for the suffering and injustice people face, and why violence is needed to right these wrongs. Ideologies perform several important functions in times of prolonged conflict. First, they encourage recruitment and retention of those supporting the fight; in fact, one could argue that since the birth of the levée en masse, ideologies have been necessary for encouraging recruitment of mass armies and sustaining their numbers. This is also true of creating and sustaining a fighting force for nonstate actors. Second, ideologies provide leaders and followers with a 'cause' that they can point back to during military setbacks and provide hope that the fight is not in vain. Powerful ideologies also situate setbacks within a wider context of victory, which may not happen in this lifetime, but will occur. The most powerful ideologies explain failures and setbacks as actual successes in the grand scenario and a better world for which individuals and groups are fighting. When considering ideology as a warfighting capability, one useful definition includes three subparts: a critique for how the world currently is, a set of beliefs for how the world ought to be, and a course of action for realizing that world. Each of these subcomponents provides opportunities to both understand the messaging of the adversary and create possible countermeasures to their worldview. Critique of the current world Critiquing the current state of the world is arguably the most important component of an ideology because it identifies the problem, explains how things came to be this way, and assigns blame for the situation people find themselves in. Critically, assigning blame also offers a target to channel one’s outrage and to begin to address the problem. The critique, in other words, draws the battle lines between 'us' and 'them' and explains who needs to be targeted and why. This part of an ideology, if constructed well, should be able to sustain minor setbacks to the war and be broad enough to absorb specific inconsistencies in facts and circumstances. It should be able to draw the widest number of supporters within the population it seeks to mobilize. As counterinsurgency expert David Galula famously noted in Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice, it is easier to get people to agree to be against something than to be for something. Most powerful ideologies, therefore, provide details on the problem but are more abstract on the solution (see below). Finally, powerful ideologies do a good job explaining the problem with history, culture, identity, religion, and other tools that personalize and emotionalize the struggle. The threat is not some distant, abstract problem, but it is here and now, and deeply personal. It requires both an individual and a collective response to defeat the threat. How the world ought to be As stated above, powerful ideologies provide more detail on their critique of the world, including especially who is to blame, than on the solution. Typically, a description of how the world ought to be is aspirational; it is light on details because specifics can divide people and therefore undermine active and passive support. The Islamic State, the Caliphate, the Worker’s Utopia, the Empire of the Sun, the Reich: these are all examples of ideal states that, while thin on details of the end state they were seeking, drew broad support from their target populations. The course of action The course of action in an ideology, like the solution, is usually broad and philosophical. It is more abstract than a specific strategy for what to do. Three approaches are particularly important for the types of political ideologies we face today: violent (including but not limited to the use of terrorism), nonviolent, and apocalyptic, which calls for the figurative destruction of the world as we know it with the hope of ushering in a new, better world in its place (the solution). Examples of each of these courses of action abound. Karl Marx’s articulation of the communist revolutionargued that the capitalist system could only be changed through violence; the system and the people that upheld it had to be destroyed by force rather than reformed. Mahatma Gandhi stated the only way to end colonialization in India was through non-violent activism against the British; this was the philosophical underpinning of the 'Quit India' movement. One strain of White supremacism aims to foment a racial holy war 'RAHOWA' with the goal of ridding the world of people of color, who bear the stain of the sins of Cain, and to usher in a new, better, racially pure world in its place. It is important to note that broad ideologies can support different courses of action to arrive at how the world ought to be. Salafism, as an ideological interpretation of Islam, supports a peaceful movement and a political approach, as well as a violent incarnation. These different approaches to realizing their ideal state provide opportunities for countermeasures that can exploit these ideological disagreements. Salafi Jihadi Ideology of AQ and ISIS Salafism is not a new ideology. Most scholars trace this interpretation of Islam back to the 19th century and include ideologues such as the Saudi ‘Abd al-Wahhāb and Egyptian scholar Sayyid Qutb. Salafism as an ideology offers a compelling critique of the current state of the world, claiming that society is in rapid decline, which is evident by the number of wars, social unrest, moral decay, and overall suffering in the world. One strain of Salafism purports that the world is in the end of times and draws on apocalyptic expectations outlined in the Qur’an, the Sunna, Hadith, and other sources as evidence that the end is near, including natural and manmade disasters. Salafism identifies two broad causes of the world’s rapid decline. The first and most important culprit is failed Muslim leadership, including the Ulama, or Muslim scholars, who have relied on past interpretations and rulings in Islam, instead of the words of the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet Muhammed to guide the community. This approach has led not only the Ulama off the true path of Islam but also society and has led to confusion and disunity in the umma, which is the worldwide Muslim community. Muslim rulers have contributed to the umma’s downfall by supporting and upholding these false teachings. The second cause of decline is the presence and influence of the West, which includes its actual colonization of much of the Muslim world, its support of the state of Israel, and its introduction of Western secularism and democracy, ideas that have led Muslims away from God’s rule. Western social influences in the Muslim world, including Western education, feminism, and homosexuality, have further led to its downfall. The Muslim world has fallen into a state of Jahiliya, ignorance, from the examples set by the West and by Muslims leaders who blindly follow these bankrupt and corrupt ideas. The solution to these problems is a return to the right path of Islam as articulated in the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet Muhammed, and to turn away from bid’ah, or any religious innovation, as well as Western ideas. Salafis further emphasize the need to recognize the indivisibility of God, or tawhid, in all aspects of life. Returning to the pure path of Islam will end divisions among Muslims, including Shia and Sunnis, and unify the umma. Ultimately, returning to what they believe is the pure path of Islam as articulated by the Qur’an and exemplified by the Prophet Muhammed’s life and the purification of the dar al Islam, the land and people connected to the faith, from foreign influence will create the conditions for the end of times, with a new world of justice and peace emerging in its place. Importantly, Salafism as an ideology is not de facto violent. According to Quintan Wictorowicz, Salafis fall into three categories of actors to realize their ideal state: what he calls nonviolent purists, politicos (those that aim to work through the state to realize Salafi goals), and jihadists, or those who see violence as the necessary path to realizing their utopic goals. Clearly, AQ and ISIS are proponents of the jihadi course of action for realizing Salafi ideology. Both movements see violence and shedding blood as necessary for realizing a unified umma, free of internal corruption and external influence, adhering to the oneness of God. Both groups also see the return of the Caliphate, the one right ruler, to the dar al Islam as a necessary state for returning Islam to the right path. Despite these similarities, ISIS and AQ also have some important differences. ISIS is deeply apocalyptic in its vision of the world and its salvation. Its messaging is steeped with symbols and references to Muslim expectations of the apocalypse, including discussions about a great battle in 'Dabiq' with 'Rome' (the West), which is an apocalyptic expectation, as are twelve righteous rulers in Islam, the eighth of which was believed to be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (who was killed in 2019), to name a few. ISIS, in fact, justifies its mass atrocities and shedding blood as a necessary pathway to realizing the apocalypse and ushing in a new and better world. Graeme Wood’s 2015 Atlantic article 'What ISIS Really Wants'summarizes, 'In fact, much of what the group does looks nonsensical except in light of a sincere, carefully considered commitment to returning civilization to a seventh-century legal environment, and ultimately to bringing about the apocalypse.' Countering Salafi Jihadi Ideology Throughout the GWOT, the United States and its allies implemented several initiatives aimed at countering the ideologies of AQ and ISIS. Three broad efforts are particularly important: countering the message, stopping the spread of the message, and creating a new message altogether. When done together and synchronized with other efforts, including military action, these efforts began to counter the ideology. Countering the Message The United States and its allies and partners took the ideology of AQ and ISIS seriously from the earliest days of the GWOT. There was an understanding that the ideology was important—that their interpretation of Islam mattered and needed to be addressed to curb recruitment and sympathy for these groups. For example, in the first one hundred days following September 11, the White House issued a statementoutlining how the United States had responded to the attacks. Within the details of forming an international coalition to counter al Qaeda and its use of military action, it included 'respecting Islam' as one of the actions taken. The statement quoted President George W. Bush, who asserted: 'The Islam that we know is a faith devoted to the worship of one God, as revealed through the Holy Qu’ran. It teaches the value and importance of charity, mercy, and peace.' The statement included discussions about protecting Muslims in the United States and celebrating Iftar at the White House. To specifically address claims that the West does not care about Islam or Muslims, the United States took several measures aimed at countering al Qaeda’s message. In 2003, the U.S. Department of State created the YES (Youth Exchange and Study) program, which gave students from Muslim-majority countries the opportunity to study in the United States. It also wrote a booklet called Muslim Life in America, which aimed to counter the specific message that the United States was hostile to Islam. The State Department also helped to fund the P2P (Peer to Peer): Challenging Extremism project, which aimed to amplify local voices speaking out against extremism. The United States has continued to emphasize its commitment to religious tolerance throughout the GWOT. However, efforts aimed at emphasizing Western countries’ tolerance toward Muslims and support of Muslim countries have most likely fallen on deaf ears for several reasons. First, these words and programs were overshadowed by U.S. and allied military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond, which provided key data points for AQ, ISIS, and others of Western aggression toward the Muslim world. Second, the United States specifically lacks credibility over its support of Israel and, by extension, Israel’s actions toward Palestinians and neighboring countries. Third, key European powers, including France, Belgium, and Great Britian, lack credibility in some parts of the world due to the legacy of colonialism. In other words, the messenger has corrupted the message. Taken together, these actions by themselves were unlikely to have successfully countered the anti-Western message of AQ and ISIS. Another major effort at countering the ideology of Salafi Jihadi was deradicalization programs, which aimed to turn individuals that embraced Salafi Jihadism back into healthy members of society. Some deradicalization efforts were government-sponsored, such as Saudi Arabia’s program to rehabilitate low-level jihadis they had apprehended. Other programs were initiated by nonprofits, such as the now shuttered Quillium Foundation in Britain. While this approach to countering the message was less strategic, it was still a major effort in countering Salafi Jihadi ideology. These programs also have faced considerable criticism since their implementation. One critique is their inability to measure overall effectiveness in countering Salafi Jihadi ideology, particularly when the target of these programs was individuals. Another is that these programs unjustly targeted conservative Muslims and aimed to paint all Salafis in a negative light. Finally, in Great Britain and elsewhere, several 'rehabilitated' jihadis were released from prison and went on to perpetrate terrorist acts, including the 2019 London attack by Usman Khan that killed two and the 2020 knife attack by Sudesh Amman. These acts have raised considerable doubt on the efficacy of deradicalization programs in Great Britain. Preventing the Spread of Ideology The United States and allied powers also engaged in several efforts aimed at preventing the spread of AQ and ISIS ideology. Although controversial, one approach was to take ideologues off the battlefield. The 2011 killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, a U.S. citizen, is one example of this effort. The death of ISIS media personnel is another example of this approach. Yet another approach was to disable the ability of AQ and ISIS to spread their ideology through the Internet. Task Force Ares is credited with disabling a range of Internet activities of ISIS. As with efforts to counter Salafi Jihadi ideology, measuring the effectiveness of preventing the spread of ideology is nearly impossible to do; it amounts to trying to measure something in the future that may, or may not, happen. Similarly, attributing measurable changes in behavior, like a downtick in recruitment, to one activity is difficult to do when a multitude of variables are occurring at once, what is known in academia as 'overdetermined.' Furthermore, as with most education programs, in addition to being overdetermined, changes in behavior may only be visible over time, making measuring these effects in the present difficult. Creating a New Message A third approach to countering the ideology of Salafi Jihadism has been to provide an entirely new message, as opposed to countering the ideology or trying to prevent its spread. One program, the Australian Beyond Bali Project, created a publicly available curriculum aimed at introducing peace and tolerance education in public schools. In Indonesia, the Muhammadiya School system, which was created in response to Dutch and British schools systems during colonialism, aims to reinforce the tolerant strain of Islam indigenous to Indonesia, which is distinct from Salafi Jihadism. As with the other countermeasures aimed at blunting the ideology of Salafi Jihadism, measuring precise effects of these programs is unlikely given the vast number of variables that influence why individuals and groups support a set of beliefs over another, and if those beliefs solely influence behavior. Finally, in addition to looking at various actions taken to deliberately try to undermine Salafi Jihadi ideology and change violent behavior, it is important to also address actions taken that reinforced the ideology, whether intentional or not. The full-scale military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, while undertaken for specific reasons and with broad political and military objectives, were actions that reinforced Salafi Jihadi narratives that the United States and the West more broadly were out to destroy the Muslim world. The fact that neither of these wars went according to plan and left both countries fragile and unstable has provided evidence that supports the Salafi Jihadi narrative that the West is out to destroy Islam. One could also point to the prolonged drone campaign in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan as another example that has reinforced the messaging of Salafi Jihadis of Western intentions toward Muslims and the Muslim world. Counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen wrote in a 2009 New York Times op-ed about the negative consequences of U.S. led drone strikes in Pakistan. He summarized that 'while violent extremists may be unpopular, for a frightened population they seem less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war from afar and often kills more civilians than militants.' Clearly, some of these military actions were necessary to fight transnational jihadis; however, it is critical to keep in mind how military actions might become examples that jihadis will use to reinforce their ideology. Applying Lessons Learned in GWOT to Countering State Ideologies While there are many important distinctions between AQ, ISIS, and state adversaries today, we can still draw important lessons from the twenty-one years fighting Salafi Jihadi ideology in the GWOT. Four salient lessons are proposed here with their application to our current state adversaries in an era of strategic competition. Ideology matters as a warfighting capability. The United States and its allies and partners took the ideology of AQ and ISIS seriously and understood it as something that contributed to the warfighting capability of the adversary. Today, the ideologies of our current strategic competitors, including Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, matter just as much. In fact, these adversaries are using some of the same themes as AQ and ISIS in their own ideologies. Take, for example, this quote from Vladimir Putin in a speech on February 24, 2022, the day of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine: '[The West] sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us, our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now.' This quote easily could have come from Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Awlaki, or Baghdadi. These are not new themes, and we have experience addressing them. As with AQ and ISIS, countering ideology is important because of its effects in luring potential recruits to the fight, both domestic and foreign, and sustaining support for the war in the long term. State actors are no different in these pursuits. Russia and China, for example, have used polarizing language about the West, including about colonialism, in efforts to draw more countries to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) alliance and to argue that BRICS is the best way to counter Western power through alternative economic, financial, and security alliances. As with the GWOT, we need to understand which themes are resonating with whom, why, and to what effect. We need to fight the ideology and the military capacity of our adversaries synergistically. In Russia, Putin’s ideology is playing a critical role in explaining and sustaining his aggression. He has devised an ideology of nationalist imperialism, what he calls 'scientific Putinism,' which goes far beyond financial profits and includes the restoration of the Russian Empire to its former territorial, political, economic, religious, and civilizational glory, free from Western influence. This government is using education at all levels to indoctrinate the population to this vision, and it is believed to have considerable support within the Russian Federation. We should not ignore this warfighting capability and should take measures to undermine and discredit his ideology. The same goes for the ideologies of our other strategic competitors. In the GWOT, academics spent considerable time and energy trying to understand the ideology of AQ and ISIS, how it was resonating with target populations, and why. Organizations like the Pew Foundationconducted repeated surveys on a variety of topics in Muslim-majority countries to get a sense of attitudes and level of support for Salafi Jihadism. Additionally, these same efforts also considered how U.S. and allied foreign policy affected populations, their attitudes toward the West, and their views toward Salafi Jihadism. We need to consider how our actions feed our adversaries’ ideologies and, wherever possible, work to undermine the message, not reinforce it. Successfully doing this requires understanding the message, those who create and propagate it, those who believe the ideology and those who do not, and how our actions affect the message. As with the GWOT, the messenger is as important as the message itself. If Western countries are the adversary’s target of the ideology, standing up and saying how great we are, or what we are (or are not) doing, is unlikely to be effective. This is a lesson learned from the GWOT, and it applies to our current era of strategic competition as well. Additionally, if we have a good messenger, partnering closely with that individual or organization may do more harm than good, especially if we are the adversary’s target. Rather than overtly embracing these individuals and groups, it is better to partner with them silently or not at all. We need to be careful of increased apocalypticism. As with the highly apocalyptic images and language of ISIS, we need to take increased apocalyptic rhetoric from our state adversaries seriously because this message could be the harbinger of mass death and destruction. Unlike ISIS or AQ, Russia, China, and North Korea all have weapons of mass destruction, and Iran has aggressive nuclear ambitions. In other words, these states have access to weapons that could make their dreams of the apocalypse come true. We therefore should pay attention to increased messaging and symbols that have an apocalyptic tone because this rhetoric could signal efforts to prepare populations for mass atrocities, including the use of nuclear weapons or attacking nuclear facilities with the promise of cosmic victory and ushering in a new era. Dimitry Adamsky’s fascinating book, Russian Nuclear Orthodoxy, warns of such a possibility. Measuring effectiveness is difficult. Within all of this, measuring effects in efforts to counter ideologies will be plagued with challenges of overdetermination. This does not mean we should abandon these efforts. Rather, at the strategic level, it is important to keep in mind that it is the totality of efforts across multiple domains and instruments of statecraft that have an overall effect on success or failure of objectives in modern war. Focusing on things that can be easily measured, such as spent ammunition, deaths, sorties, or territory lost or claimed, in most cases will not provide a comprehensive picture of the war’s trajectory. Synchronizing these efforts toward a clear goal should be the pursuit, with macro-level indicators that help identify success or failure in meeting the war’s goal. Ultimately, as with other warfighting capabilities, including materiel, money, industrial capacity, and manpower, the veracity of an ideology will contribute to the intensity and duration of our adversaries’ warfighting capabilities. We ignore the ideology of our adversaries at our own peril. About the author: Dr. Heather S.

Japanese Politics Faces Uncertainty After Electoral Deadlock – An...	By Purnendra Jain The snap election for Japan’s Lower House on 27 October 2024 produced a hung parliament with no political party or coalition receiving a majority, throwing Japanese politics into uncertainty and potential political instability. Japan’s long-time ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior ally Komeito, suffered a crushing defeat in this election. Newly minted Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had called it soon after taking office in early October 2024, hoping to cash in on his honeymoon period and catch the unprepared opposition unawares. Ishiba’s calculations backfired as voters registered their vote of no confidence in the LDP marred by a slush-fund scandal and the party’s unexplained connection to the Unification Church that had forced prime minister Fumio Kishida to resign in September 2024. Ishiba’s promises to clean up and reform the party cut no ice with most voters. A general sense of apathy towards politics and pessimism prevails among voters, resulting in one of the lowest turnout rates since the end of the Second World War. In the 465-member Lower House of Japan’s parliament, the LDP only secured 191 seats — 56 fewer than the 247 it held before the election. Komeito not only reduced its seats to 28, down from 32 seats, but its new leader, Keiichi Ishii, failed to retain his seat in the Lower House, illustrating the party’s waning electoral support and raising questions about its leader’s prospects. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), won 148 seats. Although this is up 50 seats from the CDP’s pre-election strength of 98, it’s not enough to form a government in its own right. Another opposition party, the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), gained substantially by quadrupling its strength from seven to 28 seats. The Japan Innovation Party (JIP), with 38 seats, and the DPP, with 28 seats, will hold the key to forming the next government either in coalition with the LDP or the CDP. Even after one of the LDP’s worst electoral performances, Ishiba did not stand down. Instead, he vowed to continue as prime minister, reform the party, and press ahead with his reform agenda. His political survival now depends on drawing support from some opposition parties besides Komeito. The most likely allies are the JIP and the DPP, both conservative stripes, although neither has yet committed to a coalition with the LDP. A parliamentary vote to designate a new prime minister must occur within 30 days after an election. Whether Prime Minister Ishiba or the largest opposition party leader, the DPJ’s Yoshihide Noda, wins the race is unclear at this stage. Both Ishiba and Noda will be busy with horse trading and power jockeying to have the required number when voting takes place on the floor of the parliament. How opposition parties and independent members align with the two major parties will determine who forms the government and who takes the helm. All bets are off at this stage. In any scenario, the new government will stand on shaky ground. Ishiba’s position would be weak, not only because his government would depend on opposition and independent members for policymaking and legislation but also because he faces an internally fractured party and leaders waiting in the wings to unseat him. Noda, the recently elected leader of the CDP, served as prime minister from 2011–2012 and was the leader of the now-defunct Democratic Party of Japan, reconstituted as CDP. But non-LDP governments in Japan have a poor track record. In 1993, when the LDP was defeated for the first time since 1955, it was touted as a new political era. This coalition government did not last long, and the LDP returned to power with coalition partners in 1994. Similarly, when the DPJ defeated the LDP in 2009, it raised the prospect of a truly two-party system. Yet the opposition in power failed again due to internal conflict and frequent changes of leadership, with three prime ministers in three years. The party suffered a humiliating electoral defeat in the 2012 general election with the LDP under Shinzo Abe reclaiming government. While the volatile situation makes domestic politics unstable and fragile by increasing the potential for policy paralysis, a multi-party coalition government in Tokyo will be weak internationally. Japan faces significant diplomatic conundrums. In its neighbourhood, China and North Korea constantly challenge Japan through their air and sea incursions into Japanese territories, missile launches and nuclear sabre rattling. Through its support to Ukraine and NATO, Japan has also upset Russia, its northern neighbour, which has formed a triple axis with China and North Korea, making Japan’s strategic environment even more precarious. Japan’s most significant foreign policy issue is its relationship with its security ally, the United States. Who wins the presidential race and how the new Japanese leader engages with the new US president will be watched in Japan, the region and around the world. A weak leader and unstable government in Tokyo do not bode well for Japan’s domestic policy challenges of inflation and low wages with a stagnant economy or foreign affairs demands. Neither Japan nor its friends and allies want a revolving door of prime ministers and frequent government changes in Tokyo.

Why America Embraces India’s Strategic Autonomy – Analysis	By Vivek Mishra and Kashvi Chaudhary There is a strong chatter in Washington DC that the US cut India significant slack under the Biden administration by keeping India embraced despite its unwavering ties with Russia throughout the shadow of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The perspectives in Delhi are tilted in its favour in that the US needs India just as much. The answer lies somewhere in between those two strands. As such, it is important to explore the nuances that make America’s embrace of Delhi compulsively strong. India, today, practices a unique realism where it does not seek a brutal interest-oriented path to any regional or global objective. Instead, its interests are balanced by values, most conspicuously of a rising power which is not expansionist and seeks dialogues to resolve disputes, as was exemplified in the recent border thaw with China. Furthermore, India’s rise and balanced position stemming from its strategic autonomy reflect a nuanced revisionism in at least two ways: first, it has nudged the global economy in its way. In the latest World Economic Outlook data shared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India continues to lead large economies in growth. Second, as a large economy seeking a bigger role at the global stage, India’s strategic choices have enforced recalibrations upon the West. This is particularly in contrast to India’s choices in its neighbourhood, where India has shown a considerable degree of adaptation itself. In many ways, India seeks to redefine its own realistic assessment, which reflects its role as a major power driving and capitalising on shifts in the global order. An important driver of that pursuit has been its economic growth, while its military strength has grown simultaneously. India’s engagement with America is at the forefront of this shift. Arguably, this shift also involves countries striving for greater individualism. India recognises that to achieve greater economic growth, it has to stay away from the idea of a rigid alliance system, which is conventionally security-based. In large parts, India’s strategic autonomy finds its roots in its non-alignment, which prevented it from becoming a proxy state of the Cold War era. The non-aligned movement was very much a strategic choice, as is its evolved form, strategic autonomy. Today, India is unapologetically focused on economic growth and wants to ensure peace and stability in the region by stepping up and being the first responder in the region through robust HADR undertakings. Most of all, India stands in regional contrast to most other countries in Asia in its position as a solid democratic anchor in the Indo-Pacific. In the security paradigm, this has often meant how India can balance China. Besides, India’s broad spectrum of democracy and a 'trusted' global partner status have allowed the sharing of sensitive information and technology, thus permitting America to have a substantively advanced situational awareness in the Indo-Pacific. These may be some compelling reasons why America seems to embrace India’s strategic autonomy despite the absence of a total strategic lockstep. For Washington, the China question is rapidly shifting. China’s behaviour on the global stage inherently opposes the type of hegemony the US aims to project and its fundamental belief system. While in the Indo-Pacific, the US’ approach hangs in the balance with two ongoing distractions in the form of the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the war in the Middle East, China’s increasing role and influence with opposing actors may undercut Washington’s Indo-Pacific focus. Given China’s recent strides in the Gulf, with its partnerships with Iran and Saudi Arabia, China is actively looking for a larger strategic space in the region. Furthermore, China’s stance on the war ideologically undermines Israel, America’s strongest ally in the Middle East. As Saudi Arabia is negotiating a new relationship with the US, China is keen to make economic inroads in the region. With the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China also aims to drive a complex interdependence with key US allies across the Middle East, Europe, and the Pacific. It is also essential to note that China’s economic ambitions are not the core issue that America faces but the geopolitical and ideological threat it poses. There is a tacit recognition in Washington of the indispensability of India in countering China geopolitically in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, the US’ larger regional policy in South Asia has sometimes diverged from core Indian interests, as has India’s own interests in the region from those of Washington. This has allowed India and the US to keep a broad bandwidth in their bilateral relationship, which a formal alliance would not have allowed. This seeming distance has been beneficial to both India and the US. For instance, China’s state behaviour on the global stage inherently opposes the US hegemony, necessitating alternative paradigms of both engagement and opposition. India, with its revamped image in the Global South, a leading economy and a key future player in the global order, provides that dual alternative, which is required to both engage China responsibly and stand up to it when necessary. Most importantly, it replaces the unilateral prism of hostility and provides a nuance to statecraft. India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, in his book 'The India Way', aptly summed it up by emphasising that India’s goal is to grow together, not separately. For the US, one of the most reassuring things for a bet on India is the latter’s focus on a strong Neighbourhood-First Policy. It has allowed India to balance regional peace and security with growth, especially from its standpoint of the largest economy in the region. Further, India’s 'No-First Use' policy, its refusal to station troops in Afghanistan despite US pressure under the Trump administration, positions it as a non-threat to its neighbours - a key component of stable growth. Meanwhile, the trade between India and the US has provided layers of trust in the relationship. In 2023, India rose to the US’ top exporter of refined petroleum, while most of this oil was procured by India from Russia, pointing to the fact that there remains a realistic assessment of bilateral ties rather than it being ideologically driven. Any enforcement of 'values' to navigate in the new world order, which is deeply fractured in the long run, could mean a collective downfall. Coming from the non-alignment legacy, India recognises the perils of such a mindset first-hand. India has positioned itself to champion a new global order, which is more pragmatic than rigid and away from conflicts, navigating a deeply polarised world order sped by the ongoing conflicts in two continents. For America, a partner in the Global South with such a balance may be an asset, as is India’s partnership with the US in compounding its rise to become the stakeholder that it desires. Partnership with successive administrations in Washington has proven that consolidating at home by building a more self-sufficientgrowth and strengthening its strategic partnership with the US may be a diplomatic balance which can be maintained. Compelling pulls on both sides have allowed India and the US to maintain independence in decision-making and yet align on issues of long-term strategic importance.

Jeff Bezos Is Right: Legacy Media Must Self-Reflect – OpEd	I can count on one hand the times I have seen leaders of media organisations engage in anything that could be described as hard-hitting forms of self-critique in the public square. One of those times was when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on public record, in a letter to the Republican House Judiciary Committee (dated August 26th, 2024), that he 'regretted' bowing to pressure from the Biden administration to censor 'certain Covid-19 content.' Another was the almost unprecedented public apology in January 2022 (here’s a report in English) by a Danish newspaper that it had towed the 'official' line during the pandemic far too uncritically. We witnessed a third moment of critical introspection from a media owner the other day, when Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post and is the largest shareholder of Amazon, suggested in an op-ed in his own newspaper that legacy media may have themselves at least partly to blame for the loss of public trust in the media. In this context, he argued that his decision not to authorise the Washington Post to endorse a presidential candidate could be 'a meaningful step' toward restoring public trust in the media, by addressing the widespread perception that media organisations are 'biased' or not objective. You don’t need to be a fan of Jeff Bezos, any more than of Mark Zuckerberg, to recognise that it is a good thing that prominent representatives of the financial and political elite of modern societies, whatever their personal flaws and contradictions, at least begin to express doubts about the conduct and values of media organisations. Some truths, no matter how obvious, will not resonate across society until prominent opinion leaders viewed as 'safe' or 'established,' say them out loud. Bezos opens his Washington Post op-ed by pointing out that public trust in American media has collapsed in recent generations and is now at an all-time low (a substantial decline can be seen across many European countries as well if you compare the Reuters Digital News Report from 2015 with that of 2023 — for example, Germany sees a drop from 60% to 42% trust and the UK sees a drop from 51% to 33%). In the annual public surveys about trust and reputation, journalists and the media have regularly fallen near the very bottom, often just above Congress. But in this year’s Gallup poll, we have managed to fall below Congress. Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working…Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Something we are doing is clearly not working. This is the sort of candid introspection we need to see a lot more of in journalists and media owners. If someone stops trusting you, it’s easy to point the finger at someone else or blame it on 'disinformation' or citizen ignorance. It’s not so easy to make yourself vulnerable and take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror to figure out how you’ve lost their trust. The owner of the Washington Post does not offer an especially penetrating diagnosis of the problem. However, he does point out some relevant facts that may be worth pondering if we are to come to a deeper understanding of the fact that the Joe Rogan podcast, with an estimated audience of 11 million, now has nearly 20 times CNN’s prime-time audience: The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite. More and more, we talk to ourselves. (It wasn’t always this way — in the 1990s we achieved 80 percent household penetration in the DC metro area.) More and more, we talk to ourselves. Much of the legacy media has become an ideological echo chamber, as I pointed out in an op-ed in the Irish Times a few years ago. Conversations go back and forth between journalists about things they care about, while a substantial number of ordinary citizens, whose minds are on other things, like paying their mortgage, getting a medical appointment, or worrying about the safety of their streets, switch off. While there are some notable exceptions, the echo-chamber effect is real and may be part of the explanation for the flight of a growing number of citizens into the arms of alternative media. The increasing disconnect between self-important legacy journalists and the man and woman on the street has been evidenced by the fact that so-called 'populism' was sneered at by many journalists across Europe and North America while gathering serious momentum on the ground. It was also evidenced by the fact that serious debates over issues like the harms of lockdowns and the problem of illegal immigration, were largely sidelined by many mainstream media across Europe while becoming a catalyst for successful political movements such as the Brothers of Italy, Le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France, Alternativ für Deutschland in Germany, and the Freedom Party in Austria. Perhaps part of the problem is that those working in well-established media organisations tend to take the moral and intellectual high ground and severely underestimate the capacity of ordinary citizens to think through issues for themselves, or to intelligently sort through competing sources of information. Indeed, even Jeff Bezos, in his attempt to be critical of legacy media, could not resist depicting alternative media exclusively in negative terms. 'Many people,' he lamented, 'are turning to off-the-cuff podcasts, inaccurate social media posts and other unverified news sources, which can quickly spread misinformation and deepen divisions.' While there is undoubtedly an abundance of confusion and false and misleading information on social media, it is by no means absent from the legacy media, which has gotten major issues badly wrong. For example, many mainstream journalists and talk show hosts uncritically celebrated the idea that Covid vaccines would block viral transmission, in the absence of any solid scientific evidence for such a belief. Similarly, many journalists dismissed the Covid lab-leak theory out of hand, until it emerged that it was actually a scientifically respectable hypothesis. We should thank Jeff Bezos for highlighting the crisis of trust in the media. But his complacency about the integrity of traditional news sources and his dismissive attitude toward 'alternative sources' of news and information are themselves part of the reason why many people are losing respect for the legacy media.

Harris, Trump Head To Battleground States 2 Days Ahead Of Electio...	By Ken Bredemeier Seeking to sway the remaining few undecided voters and rally their supporters to the polls, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump trekked Sunday to political battleground states two days ahead of Tuesday’s national election for a new White House term starting in January. Harris, the Democratic candidate, headed to Michigan in the upper Midwest, one of seven states where polling shows the contest is exceedingly close and the outcome uncertain. Political math shows that whichever candidate captures four or more of the seven battleground states is likely to become the country’s 47th president. Trump, the Republican candidate looking to become only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms, headed to three other battleground states, staging rallies in smaller cities where he hopes to run up big vote counts in rural areas to offset Harris’ expected large margins in Democratic-dominated cities. Trump started his day in Lititz, Pennsylvania, before heading to Kinston, North Carolina in the afternoon and ending with an evening rally in Macon, Georgia. It was the first day since last Tuesday that the two candidates had not campaigned in the same state. The focus on the battleground states is so pronounced that on Saturday, their planes shared a stretch of tarmac in Charlotte, North Carolina, where both candidates held rallies. Harris attended a Black church service in Detroit, the hub of the U.S. auto industry in Michigan, before heading to stops in Livernois and Pontiac and a rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing in the evening. More than 76 million people have already cast early ballots by mail or at polling stations, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, and early voting extends throughout much of the U.S. on Sunday and Monday. The total is nearly half the 158 million who voted through Election Day in 2020. Both Trump and Harris sought in the closing days of the campaign to portray the other as unfit to govern the country over the next four years. On his Truth Social media platform, Trump told voters, 'Every problem facing us can be solved—but now, the fate of our nation is in your hands. On Tuesday, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala that you’ve had enough, you can’t take anymore, 'Kamala Harris, You’re Fired!' At her rallies, Harris has sought to convince voters that she will cut the cost of living, which polling has shown to be the top concern across the country. She has also characterized Trump as dangerous and erratic and urged Americans to move on from Trump's chaotic approach to politics. 'We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that,' she said in Charlotte on Saturday. Trump has contended that Harris, as the sitting vice president for nearly four years, should be held accountable for rising consumer prices and the tens of thousands of migrants crossing the Mexican border into the United States for the past several years. He has portrayed the migrants as a consequential political threat to the country and their presence damaging financially to state and local governments throughout the U.S. 'The only free aid they are going to get is a free ride back home,' he said at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina on Saturday. Harris made a surprise cameo appearance on NBC’s comedy sketch show 'Saturday Night Live,' where she met up with actor Maya Rudolph, her doppelganger persona on the show. Rudolph told Harris at the end of the skit, 'I'm going to vote for us.' 'Great. Any chance you're registered in Pennsylvania?' Harris asked, reflecting on the importance of the large eastern state to the national outcome. 'Nope, I am not,' Rudolph said. 'Well, it was worth a shot,' Harris replied, before the two delivered the show's signature, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday night!' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung belittled Harris’ appearance on the show, saying, 'Kamala Harris has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity.' Trump hosted the show during his first run for the presidency in 2015. Last-minute polling shows the Harris-Trump race all but tied in the battleground states, within the margin of statistical error. ABC News polling shows Trump winning five of the seven battleground states, but The Washington Post says its aggregation of polls has Harris ahead in four. The New York Times says Trump is ahead in four, Harris two and the race tied in Pennsylvania. The importance of battleground states cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the seven remaining battleground states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops. Polling in the seven states is easily within the margins of statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSjXUzSm7OO-v	2024-11-03T16:25:49-08:00	
There’s No Market Process Independent Of Competition – OpEd	By Michael Njoku Many misconceptions about the nature of the free market system stem from an ignorance of who ultimately benefits from the market process. That the significant number of those who would benefit the most from the operations of the market—consumers—tend to also harbor much of the antagonisms against logically necessary features of the market highlights the unfortunate reality that the majority of people have yet to rightly understand how their best interests could be served by the mechanism of the market. Thus, it is not surprising that, in modern history, records abound of ambitious politicians, statesmen, and planners who have exploited this widespread ignorance in furthering utopian ends by means of eclectic and inherently contradictory policies which rational deliberation could easily expose as illusory. One of the widely criticized features of the market system is the concept of catallactic competition. Unsurprisingly, the notion of free competition within the market society is bound to attract the severest censures, given its incompatibility with the ideological pre-possessions of most people, such as compelled egalitarianism and 'social justice.' This article offers a defense of catallactic competition as an inherent feature of the social order of the division of labor and private ownership of the means of production. Through praxeological reasoning, this will illustrate the hidden effects of potential disruptions of the competitive order. Catallactic Competition vs. Darwinian Competition It is important to first make a clear distinction between competition as understood in the field of catallactics and competition as conceived in the Darwinian sense. Catallactic competition is an aspect of social cooperation, in which acting men consider outperforming fellow participants in serving consumers as a means toward the attainment of his own ends. It is not synonymous with the so-called 'law of the jungle,' or the Darwinian conception of biological struggle for survival. As such, use of combative terms or phrases as 'cut-throat,' 'conquest,' or 'crushing competitors' to describe the state of affairs in the field of catallactics are only misleading and, consequently, distract from serious deliberations on the subject matter. Put simply, catallactic competition precludes the initiation of force amongst market participants. A Series of Competition There cannot be a market independent of the process of competition. Viewing the market as a continuous process, rather than a state of equilibrium, in which there is no action, enables us to better grasp the fact that competition is always ongoing within distinct economic categories—entrepreneurs, capitalists, resource-owners, and consumers—as well as in their integrated functions. The market process is a series of competitive actions among various market participants acting to obtain scarce means which aid in the satisfaction of urgent wants. For instance, entrepreneurs—using economic calculation—embark on their buying factors. They compete based on the limit set by the anticipated prices of the marginal products. Because these resources are scarce and have alternative uses, they attempt to bid them away from other entrepreneurs who similarly evaluate and try to obtain these resources for alternative lines of production. Resource owners—through cooperating in the process—willingly offer up their resources for sale to the highest-bidding entrepreneur. Consumers are also not immune to market competition as the products which they most urgently want are simultaneously desired by other consumers in the market. Submarginal buyers become excluded from obtaining those commodities and they are directed toward more capable buyers. Thus, purchasing and bargaining power become the determining factors in competition of each consumer in the market. The Competitive Order and Monopoly It is often asserted that competition precludes monopoly. But the concept of monopoly is often undefined. Monopoly is a concept with several connotations. On the one hand, there is the connotation which implies absolute control of access to a vital resource, in which a single individual or group of individuals, through the use of force, exclude its employment by other users, whether in service of vested interests or according to arbitrary judgements. This would be the case in absolute dictatorship or a world-embracing socialist state, in which the Führer, production tzar, or some ruling bureaucracy dictates the circumstances of availability of these resources to other users. With regard to this connotation of monopoly, the above assertion can be said to be true. On the other hand, there is the connotation of monopoly which entails control of access to definite quantities of a vital resource of production as a result of original appropriation or voluntary exchange. This could occur through previous entrepreneurial alertness, foresight, and accurate anticipation of the future state of the market. This allegedly leads to subsequent charging of a 'monopoly price' for the resource in question. Before the emergence of the 'monopoly,' every other entrepreneur, in executing their buying function, was free to compete in the acquisition of the resource up to the maximum quantity obtainable for future production, however, they underestimated the potential significance of the resource in relation to future market conditions. It is important to note that this type of monopoly does not preclude free entry into the industry in question, nor does it preclude a market for potential substitutes to the monopoly good, thus, it is compatible with the competitive order. As Mises succinctly puts it in Human Action: 'It would be a serious blunder to deduce from the antithesis between monopoly price and competitive price that the monopoly price is the outgrowth of the absence of competition. There is always catallactic competition in the market.' Furthermore, any attempts to coerce the decisions of this 'monopolist'-entrepreneur into alternative actions, which—judged from his point of view—are dissatisfactory, become potentially disruptive of the competitive order. Disruption of the Competitive Order Given that the free market system is founded on the cooperation and voluntary interactions of individuals acting to satisfy their wants, it logically follows that any instance of coercive action by individuals or groups of individuals aimed at influencing the actions of other individuals become potentially disruptive of the competitive order which defines this system. The most systematic threat to the competitive order is the fallacious economic doctrine which has increasingly gained greater acceptance in virtually every country of the world today, and which has become the basis of policies which are disruptive of the mechanism of social cooperation—interventionism. Interventionism advances the notion of a compatibility between free market capitalism and violent interventions of the state in economic affairs. Interventionism is purportedly a middle-of-the-road economic system between capitalism and socialism, that is, a third economic system of economic organization. However, as Mises succinctly remarks in his book The Middle of the Road Leads to Socialism, Interventionism cannot be considered as an economic system destined to stay. It is a method for the transformation of capitalism into socialism by a series of successive steps. While disregarding the inescapable interdependence of economic phenomena, proponents of the doctrine of interventionism view the economy as a compartmentalized, loosely-coupled system in which specific actions can be tailored towards various 'compartments' of the economy in the hopes of obtaining desired outcomes. However, most policies advanced under interventionism almost always produce outcomes which, judged from the point of view of their initiators, are dissatisfactory. Most specifically, the policies directed towards the suppression of competition end up hurting the consumers whose needs would be better served in an unhampered market. Arguments against competition have been offered based on imperfections of competition that allegedly would cause more woes than if competition were suppressed. But, as Hayek puts it in the book, Individualism and Economic Order, ...the evils which experience has shown to be the regular consequence of a suppression of competition are on a different plane from those which the imperfections of competition may cause. For instance, the use of tariffs to suppress foreign competition in a domestic market usually end up raising the prices of locally-produced commodities, hurting the productivity of labor by shifting production from areas with favorable conditions to unfavorable areas, and encouraging cartelization and entrenched monopoly in the domestic market. The Ultimate Beneficiaries of Free Competition It is in the best interest of consumers—for whom every act of productive activity of the entrepreneur is directed—that the competitive order is preserved, for this would imply the possibility of better want satisfaction by accessing more attractive opportunities in the future. If consumers desire to satisfy various wants through the mechanism of the market, then they must realize that competition is an inherent feature of the market system and cannot be suppressed without hurting both their short- and long-term interests.

Kemi Badenoch And A New Era Of Leadership: Potential Opportunitie...	Kemi Badenoch’s rise to leadership within the Conservative Party signifies a crucial moment in British political dynamics, reflecting a movement towards enhanced diversity in representation while simultaneously reinforcing a steadfast dedication to conservative principles. The trajectory leading to Badenoch's current position, marked by a competitive leadership contest and significant backing from party members, underscores her growing popularity and the heightened expectations that accompany her responsibilities. Badenoch, as the inaugural Black leader of a significant political party in the UK, faces the imperative task of manoeuvrings through a complex terrain marked by ideological rifts, a difficult economic environment, and the necessity to re-establish connections with a voter base that is becoming ever more fragmented. Background and New Leadership Badenoch, born in Wimbledon on 2 January, 1980, has rapidly emerged as a prominent figure in the UK politics. Her political journey commenced with her election to the House of Commons in 2017, where she represented Saffron Walden, subsequently serving North West Essex from 2024. Badenoch swiftly attracted attention for her robust pro-Brexit position, symbolizing a profound alignment with a conception of the Conservative Party that emphasized sovereignty and British identity. Ascending within the political hierarchy during the tenures of Prime Ministers Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, she occupied significant positions, such as Secretary of State for International Trade and Minister for Women and Equalities. Her analytical approach to matters like identity politics and her resignation from Boris Johnson’s administration in opposition to his leadership style solidified her position as a politician willing to confront conventional standards within her party. The announcement of the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election took place on 5 July 2024, when the then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak articulated his decision to step down as leader of the Conservative Party in the wake of the party's loss in the General Election 2024. The leadership contest began on 24 July and reached its conclusion on 31 October, 2024. On 2 November, Kemi Badenoch emerged victorious in the members' ballot, marking a historic milestone as the first Black leader of any major UK political party. She is also the fourth female leader of the Conservative Party and the second consecutive leader of non-White descent within the party's history. Badenoch’s victory in the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election — a contest featuring prominent figures such as Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly, and Priti Patel — underscored her resonance with the party’s right-wing constituency. After a series of votes, she emerged as a leading candidate, securing victory in the final member’s ballot with a decisive margin over Jenrick, thereby garnering substantial grassroots support. This achievement has positioned her uniquely as the first Black woman to helm the Conservative Party, embodying a significant transformation within its ideological framework. Badenoch’s new leadership signifies a calculated shift towards fundamental conservative principles, with the objectives of rejuvenating the Conservative Party and reinstating public confidence. With a focus on fiscal prudence, minimal taxation, and restricted government involvement, she would likely to seek to address pressing economic challenges such as inflation and the rising cost of living. Her position on immigration and British identity highlights an emphasis on national sovereignty, demonstrating her dedication to maintaining a unique UK identity. Badenoch endeavors to challenge the prevailing trends of identity politics by advocating for a cohesive national culture rooted in meritocracy and traditional values, a stance that aligns closely with the sentiments of the party's grassroots constituents. Her vision encompasses the reinstatement of ethical standards within the government, aimed at restoring credibility and reconciling ideological divisions within the party. On the international stage, her objective is to utilize Brexit as a means to enhance the United Kingdom's position in global trade and economic affairs. Badenoch's leadership heralds a prospective transformation, characterized by a blend of traditional conservatism and a responsive approach to the prevailing political landscape. A Challenging Landscape for the New Leader The political and economic environment confronting Badenoch is characterized by complicated challenges. The 2024 general election marked a significant decline for the Conservative Party, as its representation in Parliament plummeted from 372 to 121 seats. This outcome underscores a profound public dissatisfaction with pressing issues, including inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, immigration, and the ethical standards upheld by the government. The prevailing public discontent regarding the party's management of critical issues, alongside a notable increase in support for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats, presents Badenoch with the formidable task of revitalizing the party's core constituency while simultaneously reaching out to a broader electorate. The United Kingdom is currently facing the challenge of lasting inflation, which remains elevated at approximately 6-7% as of late 2023, following a peak of 10.1% in 2022. The current inflationary landscape, exacerbated by elevated energy prices stemming from Eurasian geopolitical and geostrategic tensions/conflicts, have been placing significant pressure on household finances, thereby complicating the prevailing public sentiment. Badenoch’s leadership may be anticipated to respond to the pressing demands for tax relief, the stabilization of energy prices, and the strategic investment in sectors that promote sustainable growth. Her adherence to conservative principles — such as low taxes, free-market policies, and a reduction in state spending — may indeed find favor among her core supporters; however, it poses a significant risk of estranging those voters who prioritize immediate economic relief. Ideological Divide and Internal Dynamics The Conservative Party currently finds itself in a state of significant factionalism, characterized by deep ideological rifts that have been intensified by recent leadership transitions and public controversies. Badenoch’s triumph signifies a notable advancement for the party's populist, right-wing contingent, as evidenced by her opposition to what she describes as 'identity politics' and her contentious perspectives on matters such as maternity pay. The campaign strategically underscored a recommitment to foundational conservative tenets, resonating with party constituents eager to differentiate the party from centrist ideologies. However, this strategy prompts significant apprehensions regarding the party's overall attractiveness in a constituency that has progressively gravitated towards Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Her recent pronouncements in favor of a low-tax, limited-government paradigm, coupled with her criticisms of multiculturalism, indicate a distinct ideological shift that could potentially unify the party's core constituency. Nevertheless, this action carries the potential to estrange moderate leaders and voters who are in pursuit of stability and practical resolutions to the pressing economic and social issues at hand. Her focus on traditional values stands in stark contrast to the Labour Party's vision under Keir Starmer, who has adeptly solidified his support by clearly defining economic priorities. The dynamic interaction between these divergent ideologies is poised to significantly influence public discourse, as both factions strive to garner support in a precarious post-election environment. Vision for the Future and Party Reformation In her inaugural address as leader, Badenoch articulated her vision for reform, underscoring the imperative for the Conservative Party to 'reset our politics' and embrace a new beginning. She emphasized the imperative of restoring public confidence and reaffirming the party’s legitimacy following its recent electoral setback. Badenoch articulates a vision for the party that emphasizes a revival of foundational conservative principles, prioritizing fiscal responsibility, minimal state interference, and a strong stance on immigration policy. The emergence of her leadership may herald a transformative phase of reformation and critical self-examination within the Conservative Party, compelling it to reevaluate its policies and governance strategies in response to formidable challenges ahead. Badenoch, recognized for her forthright perspectives on social matters, may find that her position on cultural conservatism reinforces her backing from the party's right faction. Nonetheless, her efficacy as a leader will ultimately hinge on her capacity to reconcile these principles with the practical demands of a varied and evolving electorate. Conclusion The ascent of Kemi Badenoch to the leadership of the Conservative Party embodies a confluence of potential opportunities and significant impediments. Her rise represents a pivotal moment for the party, likely indicating a transition towards a more clearly articulated conservative agenda. Nevertheless, the challenges posed by economic volatility, the necessity for party unity, and the complexities of ideological fragmentation will require skilful manoeuvrings and strategic insight. As Badenoch readies herself for her inaugural significant engagements in the role of Leader of the Opposition, her capacity to connect with both her party's foundational supporters and the wider electorate will prove essential. The ability of her leadership to reconcile these divisions and restore the Conservative Party's standing in the political arena will significantly impact her legacy and the future course of British politics in the coming years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSinfqArvWKGx	2024-11-03T16:04:01-08:00	
Does The US Really Have Just ‘One President’ During Transitions? ...	America has one president at a time.' In these last few days before the US election, we are frequently reminded of this mantra regarding the transition of power. The Democrats are warning that, if former President Donald Trump wins, he will not abide by the rules and protocols of presidential transitions, just like the last time he was elected in 2016. One of the tenets of the transfer of power in the US is that the president-elect does not undermine the outgoing president by interfering in policymaking in the period before taking office. This is especially true of foreign policy. Past presidents have historically made sure that America has only had one president at a time. Bill Clinton, for example, stressed this point in 1992, when, after his election victory, he urged 'America’s friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one president at a time.' Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did it too, but in 2016 there was an outcry when the newly elected Trump made a few moves that were seen as violations of a tradition tested over time and enshrined in law. In particular, the Logan Act of 1799 forbids American citizens from unauthorized correspondence or negotiations with foreign governments that undermine the government’s position. This law, according to presidential historians, is to protect the powers of the president’s position under the Constitution, especially in dealing with foreign nations. In 2016, Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman introduced the 'One President at a Time Act,' to amend the Logan Act to 'ensure that US foreign policy is conducted only by the sitting president' and to make the law applicable to incoming presidents. Although this resolution did not go anywhere, it is understood that the Logan Act applies to elected presidents just as it applies to American citizens. Many invoked the Logan Act when criticizing President-elect Trump on two moves he made following the election in 2016. The first was his phone call in December 2016 with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen — the first by a US president or president-elect since 1979. The call angered China and raised concerns about whether America was still wedded to the One China policy. The second was his opposition to the Obama administration’s abstention on a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements. President-elect Trump interfered personally and unprecedently through phone calls he made, confirmed by his press secretary, to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which reportedly he spoke about the resolution. Trump was accused of violating one of the principles of American presidential politics. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, during the transitional period, a president-elect 'traditionally engages in limited outreach to foreign leaders.' The center adds that 'it is important for the president-elect and the staff to ensure the government is always speaking in one voice, particularly on matters of national security and foreign policy.' Presidential transition experts and Democrats say that President-elect Trump in 2016 took calls from the leaders of various countries without coordinating with the State Department, which is tasked with organizing these calls and prioritizing and sequencing them to reflect the importance of the countries to America. In 2016, many in Washington were furious when President-elect Trump spoke with Middle Eastern leaders before he spoke with the prime minister of the UK, Washington’s closest ally. Trump’s critics are worried that, this time around, he will not only do the same but he will double down on making foreign policy decisions and commitments without coordinating with the Biden administration, hence undermining it. They find evidence in Trump’s recent positions and statements. This month, the Republican candidate told his supporters that he had spoken with Netanyahu about the situation in the Middle East. News stories reported that he told Netanyahu, when asked for advice on how to respond to Iran’s missile attack on Israel, 'do what you have to do.' Slate magazine considered this, if accurate, 'not only an act of diplomatic recklessness but also, quite possibly, a federal crime.' It referred to the Logan Act. Moreover, in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump vowed to settle the Ukraine war 'before I even become president,' adding he would do it, 'if I win, when I’m president-elect.' Although Trump no doubt used this emphasis to indicate the urgency of the situation in his mind, his opponents saw it as another sign that he will flout the rules. Aaron Miller, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment, said Trump does not need to reach out to anybody, as everybody is instead reaching out to him, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nonetheless, he expressed concern that Trump 'will create expectations and make promises and commitments he is not empowered by law to make.' Miller sees Trump as the 'president norm-breaker,' adding 'it is not a question of the Logan Act or any other act, it is going to happen and there is nothing anyone except Trump can do to stop it.' But it seems Trump is not alone in terms of breaching the rules. Jeffrey Michaels and Andrew Payne, co-authors of 'One President at a Time? The President-elect and Foreign Policy in American History' argue that this tradition 'may by a constitutional reality but it is also a political fiction, more honored in the breach than in the observance.' Miller acknowledged that presidents-elect often interfere in foreign policy, but with the approval of the outgoing administration. He gave, as an example, his participation in the 1988 transition from Secretary of State George Shultz to James Baker, when 'we helped orchestrate a dialogue with the (Palestine Liberation Organization) during November-December that was consistent with the US national interest and with the policies of both administrations.' The divisions in the US over the election and Trump’s positions are extending to every aspect of presidential transitions and power. It is not realistic to expect the upcoming transition to be different if Trump wins. Washington is holding its breath and hoping we do not have a repeat of the 2021 transition. • Dr. Amal Mudallali is a visiting research scholar at Princeton University and former Lebanese ambassador to the UN.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSiM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-03T16:01:50-08:00	
Polarization, Public Sentiment, And Electoral Dynamics: 2024 US P...	I. Introduction The 2024 U.S. presidential election unfolds in an era of unprecedented polarization and heightened public sentiment, posing significant implications for the stability of American democracy. This election’s significance lies in its potential to either deepen ideological divides or catalyze efforts toward democratic cohesion. Polarization, defined by a marked increase in ideological, cultural, and socio-economic divides, has become pervasive within the American electorate, with empirical data illustrating sharp splits along key issues such as healthcare, immigration, and climate change (Pew Research Center, 2023). These divides are not limited to partisan lines but also extend to broader attitudes about democratic norms, including trust in governmental institutions and commitment to electoral integrity. Scholars such as Larry Diamond describe this polarization as 'a fundamental challenge to the integrity of democratic governance in the U.S.' (Diamond, 2022, p. 47), underscoring the stakes of this election for the future of political representation and institutional trust. Some counter that polarization is not a new phenomenon in U.S. politics, contending that historical tensions have been equally contentious (Abramowitz, 2022). However, recent evidence suggests that today’s polarization, coupled with declining trust in institutions, may uniquely threaten democratic resilience (Hetherington & Rudolph, 2015). The primary objectives of this study are to examine the intersection of polarization, public sentiment, and electoral dynamics, and to assess the impact of these factors on democratic governance. Specifically, this research will analyze how polarization influences public sentiment and how voter behavior in turn shapes candidate strategies and electoral outcomes. Additionally, the study seeks to understand the implications of these dynamics on the broader trajectory of American democracy. Recent findings indicate that heightened public sentiment, often fueled by partisan divides, significantly affects political participation, contributing to heightened voter turnout and stronger ideological alignment (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). For instance, high levels of public engagement during the 2016 and 2020 elections exemplify how polarized sentiments can mobilize voters, leading to historically high turnout rates and intense candidate loyalty (McKee, 2021). Guided by key questions, this study examines how polarization shapes voter behavior, how public sentiment influences candidate strategies and media framing, and how the 2024 election may impact American democracy’s future. We hypothesize that high polarization correlates with increased emotional engagement, thereby intensifying both voter turnout and allegiance to ideologically extreme candidates. This hypothesis finds support in literature suggesting that 'negative partisanship'—the opposition to an opposing party rather than support for one’s own—motivates a significant portion of voter behavior (Abramowitz & Webster, 2016). Additionally, we anticipate that media framing may amplify polarized sentiment by fostering 'echo chambers' where voters consume ideologically aligned content, thus influencing campaign strategies and further entrenching political divides (Sunstein, 2017). Finally, the study considers the democratic implications of these dynamics, noting that sustained polarization without institutional redress risks eroding public trust, ultimately threatening democratic cohesion and stability (Levendusky, 2009; McCoy, Rahman & Somer, 2018). By situating the 2024 U.S. election within the context of these political dynamics, this analysis seeks to contribute a nuanced understanding of the election’s implications for American democracy. Through empirical evidence, scholarly insights, and theoretical perspectives, this study critically assesses the interplay of polarization, sentiment, and electoral dynamics, aiming to illuminate pathways that may either mitigate or exacerbate democratic tensions. II. Background and Political Landscape The political landscape leading into the 2024 U.S. presidential election is marked by two major candidates: Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Each represents distinct political platforms that reflect deeper ideological divides in the American electorate. Vice President Harris’s platform centers on progressive policies aimed at expanding healthcare, addressing climate change, and advancing social equity (The White House, 2024). Her vision emphasizes inclusive governance, promising a renewed commitment to civil rights and climate resilience. In contrast, former President Trump’s platform is founded on conservative principles, prioritizing economic deregulation, immigration control, and strengthening American sovereignty (Republican National Committee, 2024). Trump advocates for a return to 'America First' policies, positioning himself as a defender of traditional values and a counterbalance to perceived progressive overreach. This clash of visions is emblematic of the polarized climate characterizing the 2024 race, with each candidate rallying their base around highly distinct ideals that have intensified partisan divides. Historically, polarization has been escalating in American politics, particularly over the past two decades, with notable shifts observed in recent elections (Pew Research Center, 2022). Studies indicate that ideological and partisan divides have increased, evidenced by a growing mistrust between party affiliates and a decline in bipartisan cooperation (Abramowitz, 2022). The 2016 and 2020 elections marked critical points in this trend, as identity-based politics and negative partisanship—where voters are motivated more by opposition to the other party than support for their own—dominated campaign strategies and media narratives (Abramowitz & Webster, 2016). Furthermore, research highlights that such polarization is not limited to political elites but extends to the general public, affecting social dynamics and community relations (Mason, 2018). The trajectory of these trends suggests that the 2024 election is likely to be influenced heavily by deep-rooted partisanship, setting the stage for a potentially contentious political environment. In response to this polarized climate, both campaigns have adopted increasingly targeted and sophisticated electoral strategies. The Harris campaign, for instance, leverages social media and data analytics to reach specific voter demographics, particularly younger and minority groups, focusing on issues such as climate action and social justice that resonate with these populations (Democratic National Committee, 2024). By contrast, Trump’s campaign has employed narrative framing that appeals to his base’s concerns over economic security and cultural values, using platforms like Truth Social and rallies to fortify his message (Republican National Committee, 2024). The use of targeted advertisements and 'echo chambers' within partisan media channels also highlights the role of modern campaign strategies in intensifying voter sentiments and reaffirming ideological divides (Sunstein, 2017). This evolution in campaign tactics underscores how modern electoral strategies are both a product and a driver of the current polarized political environment, further entrenching divisions within the electorate. This background reveals not only the stark ideological divide but also how campaign dynamics have evolved within a politically charged atmosphere. The candidates’ platforms and strategic approaches highlight the extent to which partisan identities have become a central factor in American politics, as each campaign seeks to galvanize its base in ways that reflect and intensify prevailing societal divides. The implications of this evolution for American democracy are profound, as it challenges the prospects for achieving national unity or cross-partisan cooperation. III. Key Factors Influencing the Election The 2024 U.S. presidential election is significantly influenced by a range of factors, most notably economic conditions, swing state dynamics, and the pervasive impact of polarization and misinformation. Firstly, the economic landscape plays a critical role in shaping voter sentiment and behavior. As inflation rates have surged to levels not seen in decades, reaching 8.2% in 2022, public dissatisfaction with the current administration's handling of the economy is palpable (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). This dissatisfaction is reflected in polling data, which indicates that economic concerns have consistently ranked as the top issue for voters, surpassing concerns over social issues and foreign policy (Gallup, 2023). Furthermore, employment rates, while improving, have not kept pace with inflation, leading to heightened anxiety among voters about their financial futures (Smith, 2023). This economic backdrop creates a challenging environment for the incumbent, as historical trends show that poor economic performance typically correlates with unfavorable election outcomes for the ruling party (Cohen & Zeitz, 2022). Additionally, the dynamics of swing states play a pivotal role in determining electoral outcomes. States like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona have emerged as critical battlegrounds due to their diverse demographics and fluctuating political allegiances (Pew Research Center, 2023). The 2020 election demonstrated that these states can shift the balance of power in the Electoral College, underscoring their strategic importance (Smith, 2020). With the electoral college system remaining a central feature of U.S. elections, candidates are likely to focus disproportionately on these swing states to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This focus may result in tailored campaign strategies that address the unique concerns and preferences of voters in these regions, further emphasizing the importance of understanding local demographics and issues. Moreover, the current election cycle is marked by increased polarization and the spread of misinformation, which have significant implications for voter perceptions and trust in the electoral process. The rise of partisan media and social media platforms has created echo chambers, where voters are exposed primarily to information that reinforces their preexisting beliefs (Sunstein, 2017). This polarization not only affects voter behavior but also contributes to a decline in trust in electoral integrity, as many voters express skepticism about the legitimacy of the electoral process (Pew Research Center, 2022). Misinformation campaigns, particularly those targeting specific demographics, exacerbate these issues, leading to confusion and apathy among voters (Fridkin et al., 2023). The interplay of these factors highlights a troubling trend in American democracy, where voter engagement and trust may be significantly undermined by external influences and internal divisions. In conclusion, the interplay of economic conditions, swing state dynamics, and the roles of polarization and misinformation will be crucial in shaping the electoral landscape for the 2024 presidential election. Understanding these factors is essential for analyzing how they may impact voter behavior and the overall democratic process in the United States. IV. Theoretical Frameworks and Predictive Models Understanding the theoretical frameworks and predictive models is essential for analyzing the dynamics of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as they provide insights into voter behavior and electoral outcomes. One prominent predictive framework is Lichtman’s '13 Keys' model, which evaluates the likelihood of a party maintaining the presidency based on thirteen true/false statements about the incumbent party’s performance (Lichtman, 2020). This model posits that if six or more keys are false, the incumbent party is likely to lose, emphasizing the importance of historical patterns in forecasting electoral success. In contrast, Silver’s data-driven model employs advanced statistical methods to analyze polling data and electoral trends, offering a more dynamic and real-time perspective on voter sentiment (Silver, 2023). By comparing these methodologies, it becomes evident that while Lichtman’s model relies on historical precedent, Silver’s approach adapts to the shifting political landscape, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of electoral dynamics. Additionally, theoretical interpretations of voter behavior shed light on the motivations behind electoral choices. Rational choice theory suggests that voters make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the perceived benefits of a candidate's policies against the potential costs (Downs, 1957). This framework can explain why economic conditions significantly influence voter sentiment, as individuals may prioritize candidates promising economic stability and growth. Moreover, cultural backlash theory offers insights into the increasing polarization observed in recent elections, suggesting that voters may react against perceived threats to their cultural values, thereby favoring candidates who resonate with their identity (Inglehart & Norris, 2016). Economic voting theory further elucidates how voters’ evaluations of their financial situation impact their electoral choices, supporting the notion that economic performance is a critical determinant of electoral success (Lewis-Beck & Paldam, 2000). Cultural and social dynamics also play a vital role in shaping voter demographics and their alignment with candidates. Factors such as race, gender, and education level influence voting behavior, with certain demographic groups gravitating toward candidates who address their specific concerns and aspirations (Pew Research Center, 2023). For instance, the increasing prominence of issues related to social justice and climate change among younger voters indicates a shift in priorities that candidates must acknowledge to mobilize this demographic effectively. Furthermore, the intersection of these cultural factors with the candidates’ platforms may create complex electoral alignments, as seen in previous elections where candidates who authentically engaged with these issues gained substantial support from previously disengaged voter bases (Tucker et al., 2022). In summary, the integration of various forecasting models and theoretical frameworks is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. By examining Lichtman’s and Silver’s models alongside voter behavior theories and cultural dynamics, we gain valuable insights into the electoral landscape and the factors that will influence voter choices in the upcoming election. V. Potential Election Scenarios and Outcomes The 2024 U.S. presidential election presents distinct pathways to victory for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, each requiring strategic approaches to secure the necessary electoral votes. For Harris, the key to success may lie in mobilizing a broad coalition that emphasizes issues resonant with younger, urban, and minority voters, while also addressing the concerns of working-class citizens who feel overlooked by mainstream politics (Pew Research Center, 2023). Targeting swing states, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have significant urban populations and labor interests, could be crucial for Harris in solidifying her electoral base. In contrast, Trump’s route to victory likely hinges on maintaining strong support among rural voters and the white working-class demographic, which played a pivotal role in his previous election (Rosenfeld & Riffkin, 2023). By reinforcing his messaging on economic recovery and national security, Trump aims to galvanize these groups while also appealing to disaffected voters in battleground regions. The impact of key demographics and regional variations is paramount in understanding the dynamics of the election. For instance, working-class voters, particularly in the Midwest, have shown fluctuating loyalty, influenced by economic conditions and perceptions of candidates' authenticity (Pew Research Center, 2023). Urban populations tend to lean Democratic, driven by progressive values and diversity, while rural areas exhibit stronger support for conservative candidates, highlighting the geographic polarization in American politics. Additionally, factors such as race and gender will significantly shape voting patterns, with women and minority voters increasingly mobilized around issues of social justice and equity, potentially swaying the election in favor of Harris if she effectively addresses these concerns (Smith, 2024). Predicted electoral outcomes based on current trends indicate a highly competitive race. Polling data suggests a narrow margin between the candidates, reflecting heightened voter engagement and turnout, particularly among younger voters and those in suburban areas (Gallup, 2024). If current trends continue, with Harris capitalizing on demographic shifts and urban support, she could secure a substantial electoral vote count. However, Trump's stronghold on rural America and his ability to maintain loyalty among his base could present significant challenges for Harris, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the electoral landscape. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on each candidate's capacity to adapt their strategies to engage key voter blocs and respond to the evolving political climate. VI. Implications for American Democracy The implications of the 2024 U.S. presidential election for American democracy are multifaceted, particularly concerning the impact on democratic institutions and norms. Should Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump emerge victorious, the election results will likely shape public trust in governance and the resilience of democratic frameworks. For instance, Harris's administration may prioritize restoring faith in institutions by emphasizing transparency and accountability, essential for reinforcing democratic norms (Smith & Jones, 2024). Conversely, if Trump wins, there is a risk of exacerbating distrust in governmental institutions, particularly among those who perceive the electoral process as biased or flawed, which could further polarize the electorate (National Democratic Institute, 2024). The risks associated with electoral misinformation and challenges are critical to consider in this context. Misinformation campaigns, which have proliferated in recent elections, can undermine public confidence in electoral integrity, fostering skepticism toward legitimate processes (Pew Research Center, 2023). Legal challenges are also anticipated, as candidates may contest the election results, which could lead to prolonged disputes and further erode trust in the democratic system (Bennett & Sutherland, 2024). Such scenarios present significant risks for governance and societal cohesion, as public perceptions of legitimacy and fairness hang in the balance. Broader consequences for political polarization and civic engagement are also expected to emerge from the election outcomes. The increasing polarization evident in the current political landscape poses challenges for civic participation and national unity (Fisher & Smith, 2024). If the election intensifies partisan divides, it could lead to decreased voter turnout and disengagement among moderate voices, who may feel alienated by extreme rhetoric (Gallup, 2024). This potential decline in civic engagement highlights the urgent need for initiatives promoting dialogue and collaboration across party lines, fostering a healthier democratic culture that encourages participation from all segments of society. VII. Conclusion In conclusion, the analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential election has highlighted several key findings related to polarization, voter sentiment, and electoral dynamics. It is evident that the current political landscape is marked by significant polarization, which not only influences voter preferences but also shapes the overall electoral process. Voter sentiment is deeply intertwined with economic conditions, social issues, and the pervasive impact of misinformation, leading to varying levels of engagement and trust among different demographic groups. This election serves as a crucial juncture for American democracy, reflecting broader societal divisions and the urgent need for collective discourse. As we reflect on the stakes of the 2024 election, it becomes clear that its outcomes will have profound implications for the future of American democracy. The elected leadership will either reinforce or challenge the existing democratic norms and institutions, influencing public trust and civic engagement. The potential for heightened polarization and discontent underscores the importance of fostering a more inclusive and informed electorate. To strengthen democratic processes in this challenging environment, several recommendations emerge. First, addressing polarization requires fostering open dialogue and encouraging cross-partisan collaboration to bridge divides within the electorate. Second, improving voter education initiatives is essential, ensuring that citizens have access to accurate information about candidates, policies, and the electoral process. Lastly, enhancing the integrity of democratic institutions through transparent practices and robust safeguards against misinformation will be critical in restoring public trust and promoting a resilient democracy. By implementing these strategies, we can work towards a more unified and participatory political landscape that upholds the values of American democracy. References Abramowitz, A. I., & Webster, S.

Strengthening Ties: President Prabowo’s Strategic Visit To The UK...	In November 2024, President Prabowo's visit to the United Kingdom signifies a significant advancement in the Indonesia-UK relationship. This visit underscores the renewed commitment of both nations to their advanced partnership across strategic sectors and strengthens bilateral ties amid shifting global dynamics. Prabowo's agenda includes enhancing collaboration in defence, trade, education, technology, and sustainability. By prioritizing these high-impact areas, he aims to generate long-term economic and security benefits for Indonesia while fostering shared prosperity. This thesis posits the potential for a mutually beneficial relationship, wherein targeted collaboration yields broader regional influence and strategic stability. Given that both countries are influential actors in the Indo-Pacific and European theatres, respectively, a strengthened Indonesia-UK relationship would facilitate coordinated responses to regional challenges, bolster economic resilience, and enhance global security frameworks. President Prabowo's discussions regarding defence collaboration are central to his objectives, particularly as Indonesia seeks to modernize its military capabilities in response to increasing geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The United Kingdom's advanced defence technology and expertise render it an ideal partner for Prabowo's aspirations to enhance Indonesia's national defence infrastructure. Both countries stand to gain from joint training programs, military exchanges, and intelligence-sharing agreements, which would improve interoperability and strategic response capabilities. In addition to these cooperative efforts, the acquisition of British defence technologies would bolster Indonesia’s maritime security and counter-terrorism initiatives, particularly within its contested maritime regions. A strategic defence agreement that encompasses technology transfers, acquisition deals, and expanded military dialogues would signify a deeper commitment to security collaboration. This defence-oriented cooperation aligns with broader UK interests in promoting stability and security in the Indo-Pacific region, thereby contributing to a balanced security environment that addresses regional threats. Trade and economic partnerships between Indonesia and the United Kingdom offer significant transformative potential for both economies. As Indonesia seeks to diversify its export markets and attract foreign investment, the United Kingdom is well-positioned to provide essential access to global markets. A primary focus for Prabowo should be the reduction of trade barriers that impede Indonesian exports, such as palm oil and textiles, while concurrently encouraging British investment in infrastructure, digital technology, and renewable energy within Indonesia. Such a partnership could entail the establishment of frameworks that facilitate joint ventures and promote investment agreements designed to incentivize participation in sustainable and high-growth sectors. Strengthened trade relations would lay a foundation for economic resilience, diversify Indonesia's revenue streams, and enable the United Kingdom to secure a more robust foothold in the rapidly expanding markets of Southeast Asia. Moreover, education represents a critical avenue for collaboration as Indonesia endeavours to enhance its human capital and cultivate a knowledge-based economy. British institutions, known for their high educational standards, could play a pivotal role in advancing Indonesian education through student exchange programs, joint research initiatives, and institutional partnerships. By encouraging British universities to partner with or establish campuses in Indonesia, Prabowo would enhance the skills and competitiveness of the Indonesian workforce. Areas of focus may include vital fields such as artificial intelligence, engineering, and environmental science, enabling Indonesia to address its technological and environmental challenges while simultaneously building expertise in these growing industries. Furthermore, partnerships in technology and innovation underscore the compatibility of Indonesian and UK priorities, as both nations aim to establish themselves as leaders in the digital and cybersecurity landscapes. With the United Kingdom’s advanced technology sector and Indonesia’s burgeoning digital economy, collaborative initiatives in technology development could foster innovation across various domains, including smart cities, artificial intelligence, financial technology, and cybersecurity. The establishment of collaborative research hubs and digital laboratories would yield mutual benefits by combining UK expertise with Indonesia’s expanding technological ecosystem, thereby creating pathways for innovation that benefit both nations. Environmental sustainability and climate change represent domains in which Indonesia and the United Kingdom can identify mutual interests. Both nations confront significant environmental challenges and are committed to attaining global carbon reduction targets. Collaborative initiatives in renewable energy—specifically focusing on solar, wind, and geothermal resources—could enhance sustainable energy utilization and support each country's decarbonization objectives. Indonesia’s resource-abundant landscape positions it advantageously to emerge as a leader in renewable energy, while UK expertise offers a robust foundation for sustainable development. Furthermore, joint efforts in conservation and sustainable tourism in ecologically sensitive areas could bolster biodiversity protection, thereby reinforcing the environmental goals upheld by both nations. Additionally, people-to-people and cultural exchanges would strengthen diplomatic relations, promoting mutual understanding and cultural respect. This foundation is essential for establishing a sustainable bilateral relationship that transcends mere economic or strategic interests. Programs aimed at promoting cultural, artistic, and educational exchanges would enhance interpersonal connections, creating a shared cultural base upon which broader diplomatic initiatives can be constructed. In conclusion, President Prabowo’s visit presents a pivotal opportunity to advance the Indonesia-UK relationship by addressing shared priorities such as economic resilience, defence stability, educational cooperation, and environmental sustainability. The establishment of regular high-level dialogues focused on Indo-Pacific stability would reinforce the strategic significance of this partnership. An Indonesia-UK alliance that encompasses multiple sectors will not only generate economic and strategic benefits for both nations but also serve as a model for inter-regional cooperation in addressing global challenges. By fostering strong foundations in defence, trade, education, technology, and sustainability, Prabowo's visit could enhance bilateral ties contributing to shared security and prosperity on a global scale.

From Dollar Monopoly To BRICS Diversification – OpEd	The pressure toward the diversification of world currency reserves intensified after 2008, escalated following 2022 and is accelerating, as evidenced by the recent BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. In the past 15 years or so, BRICS have rapidly grown into a geoeconomic front of the Global South. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates attended their first summit as member states in Kazan. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join BRICS. Together, the BRICS members encompass nearly a third of the world's land surface and almost half of world population. In September, Turkey officially applied to join the bloc. Numerous countries have expressed interest in joining the BRICS or have already applied membership in Africa (18 countries), East and Southeast Asia (11), Americas (7), Middle East and Central Asia (8), and Europe (4); that is almost 50 nations. Risks of US dollar Much of world trade remains invoiced and settled in U.S. dollars; many banks based outside the United States nonetheless offer dollar-denominated deposits; many non-U.S. corporations borrow in dollars; central banks hold a large share of their reserves in dollar assets; and so on. The assumption is that, a bit like diamond, US dollar is forever. In reality, no dominant reserve currency has had an indefinite life-span. It is precisely the increasing weaponization of the coercive monopoly of the US dollar – the world’s disproportionate dependency on US dollar in trade invoicing and settlement, and the dollar reliance by non-US corporate and financial giants, and dollar’s high share in central banks’ reserves – that increasingly worries not just the Global South, but an increasing number of major economies in the West. The skeptics say that the dollar has been buried many times before. Why should it die this time? But who says it would have to die. The more, the merrier. Most BRICS economies still rely significantly on the US dollar, whereas those that have been sanctioned by the US and/or its allies have significantly reduced their dollar reserves, often opting for gold instead. Weaponization of US dollar When the dollar is weaponized by the US foreign policy in the name of international community but without the broad support of international consensus, it puts trade invoicing and settlement, foreign corporates, financials and central bank reserves at risk. Worse, the weaponization of US dollar and its complicity facilitates the ongoing genocidal atrocities in the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s actions rely on US arms and financing, while turning the rest of the world – even countries that are vehemently protesting such 'wars' of obliteration – into co-conspirators of sorts. The writing is on the wall. Since the creation of the BRICS in July 2009, the value of gold has surged tripling from $953 to almost $2,740 per ounce. It parallels the failure of global recovery and the rise of trade wars since 2017/2018 and the consequent wars and crises. Dollar erosion In historical view, global currency diversification is far from a new idea. John Maynard Keynes sought even more making the case for a supra-national currency bancor (lit. French banque, 'bank gold') in Bretton Woods in 1944. But the idea was torpedoed by the U.S. negotiators, who wanted to replace the UK pound with the dollar as the world’s major reserve currency. Keynes cautioned that the dollar primacy would result in great uncertainty and volatility following the reconstruction and recovery of Western Europe and other major economies. That’s what ensued in 1971, when President Nixon ended unilaterally the convertibility of the dollar to gold. As gold no longer offered a yardstick for value, the perception of value replaced value itself. The consequent price shock reverberated across the world. With the twin oil crises, it was followed by the quadrupling of oil prices, then runaway inflation and stagflation, and eventually record-high US interest rates and massive rearmament drives. In geopolitics, the U.S. leans on major Western economies and Japan, but international economy is a different story. As a net consequence, the dollar monopoly contributed to asset bubbles in the 1980s, early ‘90s, early 2000s and finally in 2008. Amid the Great Recession, China’s central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan revived the idea and urged major Western economies to 'reform the international monetary system.' Then, great pledges were made in Brussels, Washington and Tokyo, but nothing much happened. Obviously, the economic architects of the US administrations seek to promote the advantages of the US dollar at the expense of viable alternatives. That’s very much in their economic and geopolitical interest. Similarly, the British, too, touted the blessings of their sterling pound until 1914. But that primacy ended with the overstretch of the UK economy after 1945. Unfortunately, the United States is in the same trajectory, thanks to record-high debt taking, particularly by the Trump and Biden administrations. Advantages of diversification How are the BRICS contributing to diversification? Thanks to their organizational flexibility, the bloc makes possible unilateral, bilateral and multilateral measures. Analytically, these range from gradual reforms to more unilateral individual measures. The latter, in turn, are driven by the original BRICS founder economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the new aspiring members and the coalition partners who share the basic BRICS vision and are considering membership as well. Hence, the efforts at complementary development institutions and critical infrastructure, including the BRICS New Development Bank (NBD), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Bridge and Road Initiative (BRICS), and the quest for new currency arrangements. The rising number of populous and large emerging economies make possible the kind of 'network effects' and 'positive spillovers' that will be critical to launch the new critical infrastructure for the proposed alternative global financial system. The goal is not to eliminate the dollar, as the BRICS critics claim particularly in the West. In reality, the BRICS have little to do with rogue states seeking to subvert international order. Rather, like asset managers who seek to maintain appropriate diversification in their portfolios, the BRICS’ objective is diversify and recalibrate rather than simple de-dollarization. Global currency arrangements must not reflect just the interests of Americans who account for 4.2 percent of the world population. They must also reflect the aspirations of the multipolar world economy in which global growth prospects are driven by the large emerging economies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSs44Vzs33wq8	2024-11-03T15:55:43-08:00	
What Is China’s United Front And How Does It Operate? – Analysis	By Paul Eckert Evidence is mounting of clandestine Chinese influence operations in the heart of America. Just in the last few months, a former aide to the governor of New York state and her husband were arrested for alleged illicit activities promoting the interests of China; a Chinese democracy activist was arrested and accused of spying for China; and a historian was convicted of being an agent for Beijing. The three separate cases of former Albany functionary Linda Sun, dissident Yuanjun Tang and author Wang Shujun took place in New York alone. And they were not the first cases of alleged Chinese influence operations targeting immigrants from China in the Big Apple. Those cases came to light as a detailed investigation by the Washington Postrevealed that China’s diplomats and pro-Beijing diaspora were behind demonstrations in San Francisco that attacked opponents during President Xi Jinping’s visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit last November. All bear the hallmarks of China’s 'united front' influence operations conducted by government ministries, party operatives and local proxies – but in a veiled manner. 'United front work is a unique blend of influence and interference activities, as well as intelligence operations that the CCP uses to shape its political environment,' said the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in a report published last November. What is the United Front Work Department? Coordinating this overseas influence and interference work is Beijing’s shadowy United Front Work Department, or UFWD, set up in 1942, even before the Communists took over control of China. Headed by Shi Taifeng, a Politburo member, it seeks to promote China’s political interests through an extensive network of organizations and individuals around the world, experts say. It spares no effort trying to push Beijing’s view – and crush dissenting opinions – among people in Taiwan and Hong Kong, ethnic minorities such as Mongolians, Tibetans and Uyghurs as well as among religious groups. How does the UFWD operate? The United Front Work Department is engaged in a mixture of activities, from interfering in the Chinese diaspora and suppressing dissidents to gathering intelligence, encouraging investment in China and facilitating the transfer of technology, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, said in a report. It uses quasi-official organizations and civil society groups based overseas to blur the line between official and private, giving China plausible deniability in many cases, witnesses told the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which advises Congress on China. It funds Confucius Institutes – Chinese-language study centers on university campuses around the world – many of which have been shut down in the United States. It also funds diplomats’ engagement with foreign elites and its police force’s perpetration of 'transnational repression' – clamping down on dissidents or opponents outside China’s borders, the review commission said in a 2023 report based on expert testimony. United front groups often have innocuous sounding names, like the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification or the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. Many appear to be ordinary overseas Chinese community organizations, and are found in business and even in multinational corporations. Lurking behind or within them, though, are government or party agencies – very often China’s powerful intelligence, security and secret police agency. 'United front groups are used – very specifically – to hide the Ministry of State Security,' said Peter Mattis, head of the non-profit Jamestown Foundation. 'This is why I like to think of the United Front Work Department as the tall grass that is sort of deliberately cultivated to hide snakes,' he told RFA. What is the history of China‘s ’united front’ work? Under the Moscow-led Comintern in the 1920s, the Chinese Communist Party adapted Soviet revolutionary Vladimir Lenin’s concept of forming a 'united front' – forging temporary alliances with friends and lesser enemies in order to defeat greater enemies. After Mao Zedong’s Communists took power in 1949, united front work focused internally on co-opting Chinese capitalists and intellectuals, who were brought to heel and persecuted in the 1950s under Mao’s vicious ideological campaigns. Xi Zhongxun, the father of current President Xi Jinping, played a key united front work role with top Tibetan Buddhist figures, trying to influence the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. What role has Xi played? While China denies meddling in the affairs of foreign nations, experts say that under President Xi, China’s overseas influence activities have become more aggressive and technologically sophisticated. In 2017, Xi famously repeated Mao’s description of united front work as a 'magic weapon' for the party’s success. But two years before that, he established a 'leading small group' to coordinate top-level united front work and carried out a major expansion and reorganization of the UFWD. 'We will build a broad united front to forge great unity and solidarity, and we will encourage all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation to dedicate themselves to realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation,' Xi told the 20th Party Congress in 2022. That congress saw Xi’s top ideological theorist, Wang Huning, who ranks fourth in the Politburo, appointed to lead the national-level united front system, the House Select Committee report said. Xi has built up the power and capacity of the UFWD, which controls 11 subordinate government agencies, including the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Administration for Religious Affairs, according to Australia’s ASPI. What are some examples of the UFWD’s efforts in the U.S.? In New York, prosecutors say that Linda Sun and her husband, Christopher Hu, received millions of dollars in cash, event tickets and gourmet salted duck from the UFWD. In exchange, Sun tried to remove references to Taiwan in state communications, and obtained unauthorized letters from the governor’s office to help Chinese officials travel, prosecutors say. In California during Xi’s visit in November, the Washington Post reported, the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles paid for supporters’ hotels and meals and directly interacted with aggressive actors who punched and kicked anti-Xi protesters and attacked them with flagpoles and chemical spray. U.S. stopovers by Taiwan leaders have drawn similar protests. Who are the targets of united front work? Sun and Hu represent a key demographic in the UFWD’s crosshairs: the Chinese diaspora. The activist Tang had access to the overseas Chinese dissident and pro-democracy community and its network of supporters. United front pressure and harassment tactics – including threats against family in China – are deployed against diaspora members of China’s persecuted ethnic and religious minorities: Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and members of the banned Falun Gong movement. Citizens of Taiwan have for decades been pressured by united front efforts to support unification with the Communist-controlled mainland. The recent imposition of draconian national security legislation in Hong Kong has made citizens and exiles who oppose those authoritarian steps in formerly free Chinese territory targets of united front pressure. These targets are not alone and the list is growing, with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand also grappling with Chinese influence campaigns that smack of united front work. 'There’s no clear distinction between domestic and overseas united front work: all bureaus of the UFWD and all areas of united front work involve overseas activities,' the report from Australia’s ASPI said. 'This is because the key distinction underlying the United Front is not between domestic and overseas groups, but between the CCP and everyone else,' it said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington told Radio Free Asia that the United Front’s domestic role is to 'promote cooperation between the (Communist Party) and people who are not members of it.' Outreach to the diaspora 'helps give full play to their role as a bridge linking China with the rest of the world,' the embassy spokesperson’s office said in an e-mailed statement. 'Its work is transparent, above-board and beyond reproach,' it said. 'By making an issue out of China’s United Front work, some people are trying to discredit China’s political system and disrupt normal exchange and cooperation between China and the United States.'

Moldova: Pro-West Sandu Declares Victory In Tight Presidential Ru...	(RFE/RL) -- Pro-Europe incumbent Moldovan President Maia Sandu has declared victory over Russia-friendly challenger Alexandr Stoianoglo, in balloting marred by accusations of of Russian interference and voter fraud. With 98 percent of ballots counted in the November 3 election, the Central Election Commission said Sandu had 54.35 percent of the vote to Stoianoglo’s 45.65 percent, a lead of more than 140,000 votes. 'Moldova, you are victorious!' a jubilant Sandu, who was boosted by votes in the capital, Chisinau, and from diaspora votes, said shortly after midnight. 'Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova! In our choice for a dignified future, no one lost,' she added. Stoianoglo, who has not conceded, had held the early lead, but it continued to narrow as votes were being counted from the large cities, where Sandu has most support. In addition, votes from the diaspora West could favor Sandu as they are reported. The Central Election Commission reported that turnout surpassed 54 percent, stronger than in the first round and also higher than in the 2020 presidential runoff. Sandu won the first round on October 20 with 42 percent of the vote compared to 26 percent for Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor-general who received backing from the pro-Russia Socialist Party of Moldova. In comments to reporters after casting her ballot at a Chisinau polling station, Sandu said she voted 'with Moldova.' 'Thieves want to buy our vote, they want to buy our country, but the power of the people is infinitely greater than any of their malice,' she said. 'The power of Moldova is in each of you, go out to vote with faith and hope. Heads up, Moldovans!' Following the close of most polling stations, Stoianoglo said the large turnout proved that 'Moldova is not just a point on the map with simple spectators, but a country of responsible people.' The vote came amid accusations of Russian meddling in both the presidential race and a referendum on Moldova’s potential further integration with the European Union -- a direction Sandu and her supporters strongly support. The pro-EU side scored a razor-thin victory in the referendum -- the 'yes' vote getting 50.38 percent – but Sandu quickly alleged that 'criminal groups together with foreign forces' tried to 'buy 300,000 votes,' making the final result significantly closer than pre-vote polls had indicated. Surveys also indicated that Sandu would take an easy victory in the first round of the presidential election, but Socialist challenger Stoianoglo surprised with a better-than-expected total, forcing the runoff vote. Sandu's national security adviser posted a statement to X, claiming 'massive interference' by Russia in the runoff vote. 'An effort with high potential to distort the outcome,' Stanislav Secrieru said in his post. He gave no details. Moldova has 3.02 million registered voters, including those in the diaspora. Voters in the West were credited with helping the 'yes' side eke out the narrow victory in the EU referendum and helped Sandu in the runoff election. According to the CEC, foreign voting went to Sandu by a large margin, with the incumbent winning 81 percent to 19 percent over the challenger. Votes in Chisinau also went to Sandu by a 57-43 percent margin. While the position of president is technically a ceremonial position in Moldova, holders of the office often wield considerable political influence. A president may serve for two consecutive four-year terms. Scattered irregularities were reported during the early voting hours on November 3, including incidents of purported photographing of ballots -- which voters in the past have used to prove their choice in potential vote-buying cases. Angelica Caraman, head of the election commission, said that as of 4 p.m., 18 cases of alleged electoral corruption had been officially reported, while police authorities said they had registered at least 126 complaints of electoral violations. Police authorities said in a statement that outside the country, voters were being transported in large groups to two polling stations in Moscow as well as polling stations in the Belarusian capital, Minsk; Baku, Azerbaijan; and Istanbul, Turkey, including by airplane. Moldovan voters in those countries are known to typically support pro-Russian groups. Election authorities called on citizens to report any attempts to transport voters to polling stations in an organized manner. Similar violations were flagged by independent observers from Promo-Lex, a democracy watchdog. There were also reports of apparently fake bomb threats called into polling stations in Moldova and in several countries, including in Britain, Germany, and Romania. Elsewhere outside the country, polling stations for Moldovans in Japan and China were among the first to close. In Tokyo, officials reported Sandu winning by 58-7, while in Beijing, Sandu had 59 votes out of 73 cast. Sandu, 52, is a Harvard graduate and former employee at the World Bank. She became Moldova's first female president with a landslide victory in 2020, running on a strong pro-EU message and vows to fight corruption. But her support may have slipped during her first term amid an economy that was ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic and rising tensions with Russia. As president, Sandu was instrumental in securing Moldova's candidacy for future EU membership, an achievement given extra urgency following Russia's full-scale invasion of bordering Ukraine a few months earlier. Throughout her presidency, Sandu has been criticized by pro-Kremlin political parties who have accused her of stoking conflict with Moscow. Stoianoglo, 57, from Gagauzia -- an autonomous region of Moldova with pro-Russia sentiment -- was Moldova's prosecutor-general between 2019 and 2021. He campaigned on a law-and-order theme, although critics have slammed him for what they say was a failure to address high-level corruption during his time in office. Stoianoglo has claimed he holds no political affiliation and has rejected accusations that he is 'Moscow's man.' His reaction to the war in Ukraine has been ambiguous -- expressing a 'negative attitude' toward the conflict but not directly condemning Russia for the invasion. Although he has often taken anti-EU stances, he is also a Romanian -- and thus EU -- citizen, and his daughter reportedly works at the European Central Bank. After media reports revealed that he possessed a Romanian passport, he argued that he obtained it in 2019 in an 'apolitical context,' without elaborating. Most of Moldova was part of Romania until the end of World War II and many Moldovans also hold Romanian citizenship, which gives them the opportunity to travel freely to the EU and work there. Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries with a sizeable Russian minority and a Moscow-backed separatist region, Transdniester, located on the left bank of the Dniester River.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbShEIIBtQNfNv	2024-11-03T15:48:48-08:00	
Russia-Africa Expo 2024: Evaluating Results And Achievements – In...	After the first and second summits held in Sochi and St. Petersburg, strengthening economic cooperation and deepening Russian-African business relations have taken the central stage which is especially important in the context of global geopolitical changes. Africa is a huge and rapidly developing market that can become a strategic partner for Russia, says Louis Gouend, founder of Hello Africa and founding Executive Director of the African Business Club. In this interview taken by Kester Kenn Klomegah late October, after the first international B2B business forum 'Russia-Africa Expo 2024' Made in Africa, Louis Gouend offered some useful insights into the dynamics why Russia and Africa ultimately have to forge an engagement in business and economic sectors, to expand cooperation in both regions, and further highlighted the existing challenges facing the evolving entrepreneurial initiatives in Russia and Africa. Here are the interview excerpts. Estimate the achievements and results of the historic first Russia-Africa B2B forum 2024 organized under the auspices of RusAfro Club and African Discussion Club (ABC) at the Friendship University (RUDN)? The first international B2B business forum 'Russia-Africa Expo 2024' Made in Africa was a great success, demonstrating wide interest from both Russian and African participants. The forum brought together more than 500 participants representing 15 African diplomatic missions, more than 20 African countries, about 50 business representatives from Africa and more than 150 Russian companies, business associations and investment agencies. These figures show a high degree of involvement and willingness to cooperate. The plenary session allowed Russian and African entrepreneurs to share knowledge about the specifics of the business environment in Africa and Russia, to identify the most promising sectors for investment and trade. This contributes to a better understanding between partners and facilitates the search for mutually beneficial projects. It is especially worth noting the preparation for signing several contracts for the supply of products from Africa to Russia, which is direct evidence of the success of the forum and its real business effectiveness. It is planned to make the forum an annual event and expand its program, which is a good sign for the continuation and deepening of Russian-African business relations. At the exhibition accompanying the forum, participants could get acquainted with African agricultural, cosmetic, souvenir products and tourism opportunities, which also contributed to the strengthening of cultural and business ties. Have the speakers and participating guests critically identified existing challenges, roadblocks and other factors hindering expected levels of bilateral relations in trade and economic cooperation between Russia and Africa? Discussion of challenges and obstacles to bilateral relations: During the forum, key challenges facing Russian-African business relations were identified. One of these challenges is logistics and transportation of goods, which was mentioned in his speech by the chairman of the subcommittee on logistics and supply chains Andrey Severilov. He emphasized the need to optimize the existing infrastructure, which will help make the transportation of goods more efficient and less expensive. Another obstacle is the financial instruments necessary for trade with African countries. Marina Nesterenko presented current financial instruments that can facilitate interaction between entrepreneurs on both sides. Significant points were also identified from the African side. For example, Ngo Towada Marie Caroline from Cameroon spoke about the potential of MADE IN AFRICA products for the Russian market. Such presentations help to identify and initiate discussions on the obstacles facing bilateral trade. After that admirable forum held mid-October 2024, what policy measures would you suggest or recommend, as an experienced expert, to authorities in the Russian Federation? Recommendations for the Russian authorities: 1. Specialized trade zones and investments: The establishment of specialized trade zones for African partners in Russia can significantly simplify logistics and speed up customs clearance processes. It may also be useful to create programs that support joint investment projects in strategically important sectors such as agriculture, logistics and creative industries. 2. Educational programs and consulting support: The development of educational programs aimed at raising awareness among Russian businessmen about the specifics of working in African markets will help to avoid many mistakes and speed up the process of entering new markets. A good example is specialized courses and seminars conducted with the participation of experts from both sides. 3. Diplomatic efforts: Intensifying diplomatic efforts to create a favorable investment climate and provide legal guarantees for Russian and African entrepreneurs will be an important step towards strengthening bilateral relations. The development of bilateral agreements on investment protection and prevention of double taxation will help increase trust and investment. Would these support Russia's relations with Africa, especially during this time of multifaceted collaboration with Asia and Africa as an integral part of Global South? Development of Russia's relations with Africa: Strengthening trade and economic ties with Africa will help diversify Russia's foreign economic partners, which is especially important in the context of global geopolitical changes. Africa is a huge and rapidly developing market that can become a strategic partner for Russia. Africa, as part of the Global South, offers Russia unique opportunities to intensify its foreign economic policy. Given the growth of consumption and economic development in African countries, trade between Russia and Africa has the potential to increase significantly. The Russia-Africa Expo 2024 Forum was an important step in this direction, demonstrating a high level of mutual interest and readiness for further cooperation. The B2B meetings held on the sidelines of the forum allowed for direct contacts between entrepreneurs, which is the basis for further successful cooperation. It is especially valuable that the event found a positive response among the participants, which indicates the need and demand for such platforms for dialogue and cooperation. It is important to continue to develop and deepen these relationships, turning the forum into an annual event.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSj-JSHNZ8ptM	2024-11-03T15:40:31-08:00	
UN Experts Say Houthis Collaborated With Al-Qaeda To Weaken Yemen...	By Saeed Al-Batati Yemen’s Houthi militia has armed Al-Qaeda militants, provided them with a haven, and facilitated attacks on Yemeni government-controlled areas, UN experts said. The Houthis have also made millions of dollars through sea piracy. Disclosing the strange partnership between the Houthis and Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, including Al-Shabaab in Somalia, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen said in their report that the Houthis and Al-Qaeda agreed to put aside their differences and focus on weakening the Yemeni government by transferring weapons, coordinating attacks on Yemeni government forces, cooperating to smuggle weapons into Yemen, sharing intelligence information, and providing haven for the other’s fighters. 'That opportunistic alliance is characterized by cooperation in security and intelligence, offering safe havens for each other’s members, reinforcing their respective strongholds and coordinating efforts to target the Government’s forces,' the report said, adding that the Houthis also released incarcerated Al-Qaeda fighters convicted of terrorism and provided Al-Qaeda with drones and rockets. 'Since the beginning of 2024, the two groups have coordinated operations directly. They agreed that the Houthis would transfer four uncrewed aerial vehicles, as well as thermal rockets and explosive devices, and that the Houthis would provide training to AQAP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) fighters.' Citing deadly drone attacks by Al-Qaeda in Abyan, Yemeni military commanders have lately accused the Houthis of supplying Al-Qaeda with drones and other weapons, as well as sheltering Al-Qaeda militants who stage hit-and-run attacks on government troops. The 537-page report, which covers the period from Sept. 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024, described Hezbollah as 'one of the most important' supporters of the Houthis in Yemen, assisting them in decision-making, field military support through the use and assembly of weapons and fighting techniques, increasing their financial revenues, recruitment and brainwashing techniques, and managing Houthi media propaganda. The Houthis have a variety of revenue sources to support their military efforts, including selling rare and valuable antiques and antiquities abroad, minting coins and printing currencies, imposing levies on telecom companies in areas under their control, confiscating assets of companies, including Yemenia airways revenues, smuggling weapons and banned pesticides, and imposing levies on oil imports to the country. 'The Houthis have been amassing substantial illegal resources through the organized smuggling of various items such as weapons, drugs, telecommunications equipment, prohibited goods such as banned pesticides, non-permissible medicines, and cultural heritage property,' the report said. It added: 'The Panel's investigations revealed that Houthi-appointed authorities collected approximately 994 billion Yemeni rials in the name of customs duties on imports of fuel through ports under their control during the period from April 1, 2022, to June 30, 2024, under the exchange rate prevailing in government-controlled areas.' However, during the Houthi campaign against ships that the Yemeni militia claimed were in support of the Palestinian people, the Houthis have collected approximately $180 million a month from ships to allow them to sail in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden without being attacked, and a high-ranking Houthi leader facilitated the transfer of the money from the shipping agencies to the militia’s coffers. 'The sources estimate the Houthis’ earnings from these illegal safe-transit fees to be about $180 million per month. The Panel has not been able to verify this information independently.' The UN experts also accused the Houthis of recruiting and exploiting Ethiopian migrants — who arrive in the country by the thousands each year — to fight alongside them against the Yemeni government while also facilitating drug trafficking. The Yemeni government, as well as local and international rights groups, have previously said that the Houthis recruited thousands of African migrants to fight the Yemeni government. 'Other sources informed the Panel that the Houthis have also recruited mercenaries from the Tigray and Oromo Ethiopian tribes, at salaries ranging from $80 to $100. The Panel has been unable to verify that information and continues to investigate,' the experts said. The Yemeni government welcomed the findings of the UN report and urged the world to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization and cut off their financial resources. Yemen’s Information Minister Moammar Al-Eryani said in a post on X that the collusion between the Houthis and other terrorist organizations is intended to 'weaken the Yemeni state, destabilizing security and stability in liberated areas,' thereby undermining maritime navigation security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSl62ZFRs2unL	2024-11-03T15:37:24-08:00	
IRGC Deputy Chief Says Iran Planning Retaliatory Operation Agains...	Iran will certainly carry out a retaliatory military operation against the Israeli regime, a deputy commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said. Asked whether an ‘Operation True Promise III’ against the Zionist regime is on the agenda, Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi told reporters at the Sharif University of Tehran on Sunday that the operation will definitely be carried out. 'It is not possible to comment on its details,' the general stated. On October 1, Iran responded to the Israeli assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan by launching as many as 200 ballistic missiles toward the Zionist regime’s military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories. In the early hours of October 26, the Zionist regime attacked a number of military sites in Iran, which resulted in the martyrdom of four servicemen and a civilian. In remarks on October 27, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei emphasized the necessity of disrupting the flawed calculations of the Israeli regime regarding Iran. 'They’re making a miscalculation with respect to Iran… our officials should be the ones to assess and precisely apprehend what needs to be done and do whatever is in the best interests of this country and nation. They (the enemy) must be made to realize who the Iranian people are and what the Iranian youth are like,' the Leader added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSiBMFh7WUnkK	2024-11-03T15:34:43-08:00	
China Restricts Young Tibetan Monks In ‘Prison-Like’ Schools	(UCA News) -- Tibetans have accused the pro-Beijing authorities in the region of housing hundreds of young Tibetan Buddhist monks in prison-like conditions at government-run boarding schools, says a report. The students forcibly transferred from the Kirti Monastery schools in Sichuan province’s Ngaba county are not even permitted to leave the school grounds or meet their parents, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Oct. 31. 'Since being forcibly removed from the monastery, the students have been denied contact with their parents and receive inadequate medical care when ill,' RFA reported, citing an unnamed source. 'When parents request to meet their children, they are given various excuses about needing higher-level approval and ultimately face threats of imprisonment if they persist,' the unnamed source added. The students between the ages of 6-17 are taught exclusively in Mandarin, RFA reported. Some of the students who attempted to escape the school were apprehended and are now being treated 'like criminals' and forbidden from leaving the school grounds. Over 1,000 young Tibetan monks were transferred from the Kirti Monastery to state-administered 'colonial style' boarding schools in July. The authorities closed another school at Lhamo Kirti Monastery in Dzoge county, affecting some 600 students.x The authorities had compelled parents to sign agreements ensuring that their children would be enrolled in government-run schools, where they would undergo state-approved 'patriotic education.' Pro-Beijing authorities in Tibet cite China’s regulations on religious affairs which mandate that the students at monastic schools must be 18 or older, display patriotism, and be compliant with national laws. Tibetan critics of China’s communist-led government allege that these regulations are part of a broader policy to eradicate the use of the Tibetan language, suppress Tibetan culture, and enforce 'patriotic education.' China’s patriotic education policy mandates that the love of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party be incorporated into work and study for all citizens. The Chinese authorities in the region have also intensified surveillance and restrictions on Tibetans in Ngaba county following the school closures. A high-ranking official from China’s United Front Work Department is permanently stationed in Ngaba for several months, overseeing control measures over both the monastery and the local community. The authorities have also unleashed a crackdown on any form of communication with the outside world, RFA reported. In October, the authorities in Dzoge seized the phones of monks and teachers of Lhamo Kirti Monastery, accusing them of sharing the news of school closures. In September, the authorities arrested four Tibetans, including two monks from Kirti Monastery, as well as two laypersons in Ngaba, accusing them of contacting Tibetans outside the region. The Chinese government has claimed that the communication between Tibetans and their family members and friends abroad undermines national unity as a reason for communication restrictions, RFA reported. Tibetans have denounced Beijing’s surveillance, accusing the authorities of violating their human rights and trying to eradicate their religious, linguistic, and cultural identity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSucLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-03T15:32:12-08:00	
Boosting Immune Cell Tolerance May Help Prevent Early Pregnancy L...	Recurrent pregnancy loss can be devastating and exert a major impact on women, their partners, and society more broadly, but currently there are few options for effective therapies. Over several years, there has been mounting evidence that a deficiency in special immune cells called T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which are essential for preparing the uterus for receptive embryo implantation, are a factor in early pregnancy loss. A new study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, details evidence in a pre-clinical animal model that boosting these cells improves the chance of healthy pregnancy. The work raises the prospect of evaluating this intervention in women who are prone to experience early pregnancy loss, a common condition affecting natural conception and women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Lead investigator Sarah A. Robertson, PhD, The Robinson Research Institute and School of Biomedicine, the University of Adelaide, Australia, explains, 'Previous studies have found low numbers of Treg cells in women who experienced early pregnancy loss as well as changes that lead Treg cells to have functional problems that are reminiscent of autoimmune diseases. This can impair the implantation process and suppress development of the early placenta. Therefore, Treg cells provide an attractive target for interventions to improve maternal immune tolerance and protect against pregnancy disorders caused by immune imbalance in at-risk women.' The researchers utilized a mouse model of early pregnancy loss to test a new candidate treatment intervention in which the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is combined with specific antibodies to target Treg cells. Like humans with recurrent pregnancy loss, the mice have an immune defect that arises at conception and results in later fetal loss. The researchers administered the IL-2 antibody complex (called IL-2/JES6-1) in the time between conception and embryo implantation to the miscarriage-prone mice and also in mice that have had healthy pregnancies. They observed significant changes to the number and phenotype of the Treg cells in the uterus, blood, and other tissues in both groups of mice. The expanded pool of Treg cells exhibited features that are characteristic of robust pregnancy tolerance and were effective in preventing generation of detrimental effector T cells that threaten pregnancy success. Importantly, the miscarriage-prone mice showed markedly improved pregnancy outcomes after treatment, and their miscarriage rate was consistently reduced from 30% to 11%, which is within the normal range for mice. Professor Robertson adds, 'The results show that efficacy of the IL-2/JES6-1 treatment might be achieved with lower doses, which will likely be important as we consider how to translate the findings to human application. Another notable observation was that treatment in very early pregnancy, even before the embryos commence implantation, has a profound effect on the progression of the pregnancy with lasting benefit into late gestation. This is consistent with growing evidence pointing to embryo implantation and early placental development being the turning point for pregnancy success.' The study demonstrates the potential of targeting Treg cells and provides pivotal evidence to justify human studies; however, it will be important to undertake clinical trials to assemble evidence of safety and benefit in humans before the treatment can be recommended.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSjMAmASR8tUb	2024-11-03T15:27:44-08:00	
The Changing Climate Could Increase Mobility Of Toxic Metals In S...	The changes scientists expect in the climate could cause the toxic metals naturally occurring in soils to become more mobile, destabilize ecosystems and increasingly enter the human food chain via agriculture. Such scenarios are particularly likely to occur in slightly acidic soils, which make up around two thirds of all soils. These are the conclusion of an experimental study on agricultural soils tested for the metal cadmium, which can cause cancer. The study was headed by assistant professor Marie Muehe from Plant Biogeochemistry at the University of Tübingen and the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ). The results have been published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment. By 2100, global temperatures are predicted to rise by two to four degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. In that time, the current carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is expected to double. Here in Germany, the amount of precipitation could decrease slightly. Marie Muehe says the further effects are hard to predict: 'Climate change and metals each separately place stress on the microorganisms in the soil, collectively referred to as the soil microbiome. We sought to investigate the previously little-known combined effects of these influences,' she says. There are toxic metals in every soil on our planet, says Muehe, but in bound form they are of little significance for soil organisms and plant cultivation. The situation changes when the metals are mobilized. 'In our study, we examined cadmium, the classic example of a toxic metal found in the soil,' she says. Cadmium has a toxic effect on all living organisms because it inhibits physiological processes in the cells. Complex interactions In the experiment, the research team filled columns with agricultural soil provided by various farms. 'We ran these soils through a regular growing season in Germany in the laboratory, but under the assumed climate conditions of the year 2100,' explains the study's lead author Sören Drabesch, also from the University of Tübingen and the UFZ. 'We investigated the changes in the soil and soil microbiome over time.' The research team found that the mobility of the cadmium present in the soil will increase on today’s conditions by around 40 percent in slightly acidic soils in the summer temperatures of future climate conditions. 'It can then be found in higher concentrations in the pore water of the soil and influences the soil microbiome, or the activity pattern of various microorganisms,' says Drabesch. 'Certain microorganisms become more active, utilize more nitrogen and thus further acidify the soil environment.' In some soils, cadmium levels are set to rise to such an extent that the soil microbiome suffers and the ecosystem has to adapt. By contrast, no comparable problems were found in soils that were originally slightly alkaline. Even under changed climatic conditions, the cadmium was not mobilized to any great extent. The study shows how complex the interactions are between the changing climate, the substances in the soil and the soil microbiome, says Muehe. 'Ecosystems, including agricultural ecosystems, could be massively disturbed by increased amounts of mobile cadmium in the future. This could also change the greenhouse gas emissions caused by agriculture and the mobile cadmium could end up in crops which could then be harmful to human health.' These developments must continue to be monitored, the researchers say.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSi4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-11-03T15:23:09-08:00	
Pakistan’s Youth: Opportunities, Challenges, And The Digital Volc...	Pakistan is at a crunch moment in its history, when decisions made today will shape the country's course for future generations. With 170 million young people aged 18 to 30, the country has an extraordinary demographic advantage. This youth bulge, if properly utilised, has the potential to convert Pakistan into a financial superpower. However, the opposite side of this demographic dividend is as scary. There are 25 million youngsters out of school, 60 million on TikTok, and 70 million on Facebook. These figures reflect a technologically savvy youth that lacks access to formal education, crucial skills, and organised direction. With 230 million phones in circulation, Pakistan's youth are firmly entrenched in the digital world, absorbing information. This uncontrolled arena poses significant concerns, including the dissemination of disinformation, digital radicalisation, and societal instability. The question is, what is the government doing to solve this issue? More significantly, how can Pakistan leverage this complicated dilemma into an opportunity? Demographic Dividend or Demographic Disaster? A predominantly young population is both a benefit and a challenge. If educated and employed, this demographic may drive economic growth and social improvement. However, without access to decent education, technical skills, and jobs, these young people may become disillusioned, destitute, and vulnerable to radicalisation. History demonstrates that jobless youth in many nations have led to societal discontent and bloodshed. Pakistan is in danger of suffering the same destiny unless it takes strong action to invest in education, skill development, and digital literacy. According to UNESCO's 2022 study, Pakistan's youth literacy rate is only 72.7%, indicating a need for immediate development if the country is to properly harness its youth bulge. The government must enhance educational opportunities and vocational training programs to guarantee that young people are prepared not only for traditional employment but also for the emerging digital economy. A systematic focus on education, critical thinking, and creativity is required to prepare this generation to prosper in a rapidly changing environment. The Role of Education and Critical Thinking Education is the cornerstone of any thriving nation. However, education in Pakistan must go beyond memorisation and rote learning. It must emphasise critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that will equip young brains to face complicated issues. These skills are necessary not just for personal growth, but also for country prosperity. In the twenty-first century, where technology and global integration are transforming the world at an unprecedented rate, only well-rounded, critical thinkers will prosper. Furthermore, critical thinking is becoming increasingly necessary in the digital age, in which young people are continuously assaulted with information from several sources. Youth are susceptible to manipulation due to their inability to distinguish between legitimate and false information. The proliferation of fake news, conspiracy theories, and extremist ideologies on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube can have serious social and political implications. As a result, educational reforms must incorporate digital literacy and media analysis into curricula, teaching students how to fact-check material, identify credible sources, and assess content objectively. Innovation should also be a top priority, encouraging young Pakistanis to think imaginatively and build their answers to economic, environmental, and security concerns. Security Challenges and Cyber Threats The value of an educated, critical-thinking young population goes beyond economic growth; it is also crucial for national security. Pakistan's importance in fighting terrorism and supporting regional stability has long been acknowledged. However, the nature of security threats is changing, as cyberattacks, misinformation operations, and digital warfare provide new concerns. In 2023, Pakistan had a 17% rise in cyber-attacks over the previous year. In such a scenario, it is critical that the youth—who are profoundly connected to the digital world—be prepared to repel cyber threats and actively participate in public diplomacy to combat disinformation. Educated young may play an important role in national security by inventing new technologies, combating fake news, and defending the country from digital threats. What Should the Government Do? The government cannot afford to remain complacent about these difficulties. To turn Pakistan's youth bulge into a productive force, a comprehensive national approach is required. This includes: Expanding Educational Access: Pakistan must prioritise education investment by expanding the number of schools, enhancing teacher quality, and enrolling out-of-school children. Promoting Digital Literacy: To safeguard young people from the dangers of misinformation, the education system must include media literacy and critical thinking skills. The government might undertake awareness efforts to teach kids how to spot false news and check information sources. Vocational Training and Entrepreneurship: With few job possibilities in the formal sector, the emphasis must move to skill development and entrepreneurship. Government-backed initiatives can provide young people with the resources they need to start small companies, lowering unemployment. Regulating Social Media Platforms: While free expression is crucial, unchecked digital platforms may cause social and political instability. The government must implement balanced laws to control material on social media platforms, ensuring are not used to disseminate hatred, ignorance, or extremist beliefs. Engaging Youth in National Policy-Making: Giving young people a say in national policy decisions may instil a feeling of duty and belonging. Platforms for youngsters to express their concerns and ideas can also assist close the gap between government policy and public expectations. Conclusion Pakistan's youth population has a unique opportunity to shape the future. However, failing to engage in education, skill development, and media literacy risks turning this potential into a burden. With millions of young people using digital platforms, the government must take quick action to lead, control, and educate this generation before the digital volcano bursts. To give young people the resources they need to succeed, the government, educational institutions, civic society, and the commercial sector must work together. If properly exploited, Pakistan's young have the potential to drive economic growth, social advancement, and national stability. However, if allowed uncontrolled, illiterate and misguided young threaten the country's future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcsH4rcofTnjbntg0J9u_75	2024-11-03T15:01:31-08:00	
Countering The Russia–North Korea Alliance Requires A Policy Shif...	By Yeji Chung On 13 October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that North Korea was transferring people to the armed forces in Russia. A few days later, Ukrainian intelligence announced that the first North Korean military units had arrived in the war zone in Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Intelligence estimates suggest North Korea has sent over three million artillery shells to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from 2022–24. Moscow has dispatched high-level officials to Pyongyang to tour weapons factories and assets. Anti-tank systems, rifles, rocket launchers and other assets are likely part of what are now regular container shipments from North Korea to Russia. The countries have reforged bilateral ties on the back of these transactions, marked by a new security pact signed by North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in June 2024. The treaty features a Cold War-era military intervention provision that raises the stakes for security in the Korean peninsula and beyond. But this new pact does not present particularly novel threats for the United States and its allies. Many provisions in the newly signed ‘Treaty on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ reflect activities between the two countries that have been going on for years. This highlights the inadequate and ineffective intervention by the international community, which permitted this dangerous friendship to flourish. The part of the Treaty that has received the most attention is Article 4, which stipulates that both nations must ‘immediately provide military and other assistance by all means available’ if either faces an armed attack or goes to war. North Korea has been supporting Russia since it first attacked Ukraine, first diplomatically at the United Nations and soon after with artillery shells and missiles. Illicit arms transfers that contravene international sanctions were recorded as early as 2022 and included artillery shells and rockets from North Korea. The recent agreement between North Korea and Russia appears to do little more than reinforce the status quo. The alliance has already been built up, with few obstacles and little interference from the United States and its allies, who appear confined to rely on sanctions and financial penalties with increasingly little impact. But obstacles remain for the US–South Korea alliance and effective deterrence. Chief among them is that North Korean issues have not been a primary concern for US President Joe Biden’s administration, and international interest appears to have waned. The 2024 G7 summit in Italy focused on development, Ukraine and the Middle East, but not North Korea, as it has in past years. This inattention gives North Korea and Russia an even freer hand to strengthen their bilateral ties with little scrutiny or pressure. South Korea, for its part, is increasingly questioning the reliability of US security commitments. 76.6 per cent of South Koreans expressed the belief that the country should develop its own nuclear weapons. Former US president Donald Trump, who may return to the White House in November 2024, regularly criticised South Korea as a free rider unworthy of an alliance and engaged in extortionary tactics to try and convince Seoul to pay billions to keep US military bases open. A new administration, led by US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, would continue existing deterrence dialogues, such as the Nuclear Consultation Group and the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group, further strengthening the alliance. But doubts about inaction on Pyongyang will likely persist, even if Harris takes office. During her acceptance speech as the Democratic Party nominee for the US presidential election, Harris said she will not ‘cozy up’ to Kim, reflecting a probable continuity of the Biden administration’s North Korea policy. It is increasingly clear that North Korea’s nuclear program is so advanced that the focus should shift to preventing its use rather than revisiting denuclearisation discussions, but Washington seems unwilling to entertain this prospect. The United States needs to move off its demand of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, and instead focus on ‘[disrupting] the arms tradebetween Russia and North Korea’. To accomplish this, South Korea and the United States have to strengthen alliance coordination on arms trade intelligence between Russia and North Korea. The United States reported that Russia has secured more than 16,500 containers of munitions from North Korea since September 2023, while South Korea cited a lower figure of 13,000 since mid-2022. This discrepancy in container counts points to a lack of seamless intelligence-sharing and monitoring, despite the two allies’ earlier commitment to strengthen security cooperation to counter North Korea. Washington’s strict focus on the irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea highlights a broader issue of misaligned priorities and insufficient coordination. Without this policy shift, the US–South Korea alliance risks another four years of ineffective pressure on Pyongyang as it escalates its nuclear ambitions and forges greater ties with other US adversaries. Sooner or later the United States and South Korea will need to consider concessions to reengage North Korea in negotiations. Seoul must also prepare to adapt its policies and work with new US leadership after the presidential election.

Iraqi Kurdistan’s Parliamentary Elections: Resilience, Challenges...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The Kurdistan Region of Iraq finally held its long-overdue parliamentary elections on October 20, two years past the original due date. Final results announced by the Iraqi electoral commission on October 30 showed that the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) won 39 and 23 seats, respectively, out of the 100-member parliament. A relatively nascent opposition group, the New Generation Movement, won 15 seats, coming third. Islamist groups secured 10 seats, making up 10 percent of the newly elected parliament, in contrast to the Iraqi federal Parliament that is dominated by various Islamist forces. Despite the absence of significant political changes, the elections hold important implications for the Kurdistan Region’s future and broader US policy in the region. Continuity and Renewed Legitimacy The first significant takeaway from the election results is the continued dominance of the KDP and PUK, which have shaped Kurdish politics for over five decades. This duopoly, though frequently criticized for fostering corruption and nepotism, remains largely unshaken due to its entrenched patronage networks and the deep sentimental ties many Kurds have to the parties, rooted in their historical struggle for Kurdish rights. These election results suggest that these two parties will remain central players in Kurdistan’s political landscape for the foreseeable future. Second, despite these enduring dynamics, the elections mark a crucial moment of renewal for the Kurdistan Region’s executive and legislative branches which have been in a lame-duck status for the past couple of years. The Iraqi Federal Supreme Court dissolved the Kurdish Parliament in May 2023, after it exceeded its four-year term. Despite not being a sovereign state, the Kurdistan Region has been an important actor within Iraq and its surrounding region, largely due to the de facto independence it has enjoyed since the end of the First Gulf War in 1991. Moreover, Iraq’s Kurds have played a pivotal role in shaping the country’s political and security dynamics, both before and after the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. If managed effectively, this renewed popular legitimacy could strengthen Kurdistan’s hand in negotiations with Baghdad over revenue-sharing, oil exports, and confronting the threats posed by pro-Iranian factions within Iraq. Third, despite some heated and at times inflammatory rhetoric—particularly from the PUK—the election process unfolded in a mostly peaceful, civic, and well-organized manner. Although the political playing field was uneven, and some smaller opposition groups alleged vote-rigging without presenting concrete evidence, the elections were, by most accounts, largely fair and transparent, setting a new standard for Kurdish elections since 1992. This was further confirmed by congratulatory statements from US and EU diplomatic missions in Iraq, which commended the success of the electoral process. Fourth, these elections took place against a backdrop of increasing regional turbulence and the looming threat of escalation, possibly even all-out war, between Israel and the Iran-led camp. While Iraq officially remains neutral, powerful Iran-backed Shia militias, which wield significant influence over Iraq’s security and political sectors, have been active belligerents on Iran’s side, frequently striking Israeli and US targets since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza. The fact that the Kurdistan Region held elections amid such volatility signals a strong desire for normalcy and stability among Iraqi Kurds, as well as a clear declaration of their intent to remain distanced from escalating regional hostilities. US Policy and the Need for Strategic Engagement Now that the elections are over, the focus shifts to the formation of the new cabinet of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which presents both challenges and opportunities for US engagement. The United States, which has long enjoyed a strong relationship with Kurds, should play a hands-on role in facilitating dialogue between Kurdish parties to ensure a timely and effective government-formation process. Kurdistan’s ability to form a stable government is critical not only for its own governance, but also for broader US strategic interests in Iraq and the Middle East. Some policymakers in Washington might be tempted to see Kurdistan’s internal politics as a secondary concern, particularly in light of the more pressing regional crisis between Israel and Iran. However, the United States should recognize the strategic value of assisting Kurds. This moment in Iraqi Kurdistan should be understood within the broader historical context of US-Kurdish relations and the mutual benefits that have emerged and can continue to grow from this partnership. Although the Kurdistan Region is a non-sovereign, non-state entity, it has maintained a unique relationship with the United States since the 1990s—one that, in some ways, parallels the US-Taiwan relationship, albeit at a smaller scale and with less formal commitment. Since the end of the First Gulf War, Washington has served as the guarantor of Kurdish security in Iraq. In return, Kurds played a crucial role in the removal of Saddam Hussein, were instrumental in the post-2003 political process, and helped develop Iraq’s political and security system. However, since the unsuccessful 2017 Kurdish independence referendum and in the face of sustained attacks by Iran and its Iraqi proxies, there has been growing concern in Kurdistan that the United States is not as committed to the relationship as it once was. This has created space for increased interference from Iran and Turkey, often to Kurdistan’s detriment. By assisting with the government-formation process in Erbil, the United States would signal its renewed commitment to the partnership with Kurds at this juncture and strengthen the autonomous region’s stability without any cost in terms of US resources or lives. From a broader regional perspective, Washington must consider the significant role Iran and its allied groups have played in undermining KRG autonomy in recent years. As Tehran has expanded its political and military influence across Iraqi Kurdistan—especially areas under KDP control—it remains the only region resisting Iranian domination. Notably, these KDP-controlled areas also host two of the four key sites for US military presence in Iraq. Iran and its proxies, through a combination of lawfare, economic/financial pressures, and political maneuvers, have systematically attempted to erode the KRG’s economic foundation and exert control over its internal political dynamics. This interference is perhaps most visible in the Federal Supreme Court’s politicized rulings that targeted Kurdistan’s energy and financial sectors. Additionally, the Court’s redesign of the KRG electoral law have further deepened Kurdistan’s internal tensions, making it difficult for any single party to secure a majority and exacerbating instability. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that while US military presence in Iraq faces growing hostility in many regions, Kurdistan remains a steadfast ally. The United States and Iraq have agreed to withdraw most American forces by 2026, yet Kurdistan’s Harir airfield is expected to remain a key base for US troops beyond that deadline. The strategic importance of Kurdistan becomes even more apparent when considering its role in the US-led campaign to counter the Islamic State, better known as ISIS. For the past couple of decades, Iraqi Kurdistan has played a vital role in countering Sunni jihadism across Iraq and the broader region. It also serves as a crucial logistical hub for the US mission in Syria, where ISIS remains a serious and resurging threat, and continued US cooperation with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces is essential for maintaining regional security. The US mission in Syria, which also monitors and contains Iranian and Russian expansionist efforts, heavily relies on the stability and support of Iraqi Kurdistan. The unwavering Kurdish commitment to its partnership with the United States has intensified animosity from Iran and pro-Iran factions in Baghdad, as these groups have led efforts to expel US troops from Iraq. This push is part of Iran’s broader strategy to reshape the regional order and diminish US influence. To apply pressure on the Kurds, Iran and its Iraqi proxies have launched numerous drone and missile attacks on Kurdish targets, including energy fields and business figures. Kurdistan’s energy sector is crucial to Iraq’s energy independence and electricity supply—key issues driving public frustration and discontent with the government. Despite immense pressure from Iran and its allies, Kurdish parties have consistently resisted supporting or voting for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq, both in 2020 and more recently in Februarythis year. Given these dynamics, it is critical for the United States to support the timely formation of a broad-based KRG cabinet with a strong popular mandate, especially in its dealings with Baghdad. This will help ensure the Kurdish region can resist external pressures while maintaining its autonomy. In promoting dialogue and compromise, Washington should particularly urge the PUK, under its new leadership, not to obstruct the government-formation process by holding unrealistic expectations about its share of power. Weakened by internal divisions over the past decade and a half, the PUK—now with nearly half the popularity of the KDP—still expects an equal share of power in the Kurdistan Region’s governing institutions. The party’s new leaders are holding onto this maximalist stance to signal strength to their base, harking back to the party’s heyday from 1991 to 2009, despite their significantly diminished share of the votes. In an effort to compensate for their shrinking popular support and to counterbalance the KDP’s dominance, the PUK has increasingly leaned on Iran and Iran-backed actors in Iraq. This dynamic risks turning the PUK into a vehicle for destabilizing Iranian influence in the Kurdistan Region, deepening internal divisions and potentially prompting greater political intervention from an increasingly more assertive and concerned Turkey. US mediation should encourage the PUK to adopt more realistic expectations, while ensuring that the KDP remains flexible in expanding the government’s power base and accommodating meaningful participation and partnership by others, particularly the PUK, in the governing institutions. Amid escalating regional instability and a wider region becoming less amicable to the United States, it is critical to maintain the Kurdistan Region as a stable safe haven and to avoid it becoming a political battleground for regional powers to settle scores. Therefore, it is essential to prevent Iranian and Turkish intervention, which would further complicate an already challenging but still manageable situation. The US embassy in Baghdad should take an active role in mediating the government-formation process, but support and engagement from higher levels of the US government are equally crucial. This includes senior officials from the State Department in Washington, the White House, and the National Security Council’s Middle East team. For this process to succeed, Kurdish leaders must recognize the strategic value of maintaining strong ties with the United States and avoid jeopardizing the relationship for personal or factional gains. For Washington, this is a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to strengthen bilateral ties during a time of uncertainty. Ultimately, it would send a clear message to regional actors, in Baghdad and beyond, that the United States remains committed to its distinctive relationship with Kurds and will not allow the weakening of the KRG.

Trumpist Conservatism: How It Differs From Classical American Con...	Did the Republican Party sell its soul to the devil by choosing Donald Trump as its nominee for the third time? How can it support a man who defies all the safeguards of democracy and radically reinterprets conservative beliefs? The Republican Party has fully embraced Donald Trump, who has represented it in three presidential elections (2016, 2020, 2024). The last time a political figure dominated an American party with such absolute power was during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four presidential campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s. Whatever the outcome of the November 2024 election, Trump’s longevity has already had a profound effect on his party. Based on an analysis of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024 and Trump’s campaign since then, this essay seeks to define the ideological positioning of the 'Trumpified' Republican Party by situating it within the long history of conservatism in the United States. Republican Classics Trump’s rhetoric is reasonably consistent with an ideological core that upholds the Republican classics established by Ronald Reagan since the 1980s. On the economic front, promises of tax cuts and support for growth through supply-side policies clearly dominate this approach. Trump repeatedly boasts about the huge tax cuts passed by Congress during his first term (2016-2020). He often claims that these tax cuts are the largest in history, a point he is right to emphasize given that his 2017 tax reform surpasses the already impressive tax cuts implemented under Ronald Reagan (1981) or George W. Bush (2002, 2003). In a campaign where his economic agenda has been extremely ambiguous, taxes are Trump’s single unambiguous promise: 'No tax on tips!' - the goal being to exempt from taxation the tips earned by 'waitresses, golf caddies, and chauffeurs,' as he stated at the Milwaukee Convention. Another 'classic' staple of Republican electoral campaigns: the culture wars. Indeed, the Milwaukee Convention ticked all the boxes expected by the party’s evangelical base: rejection of trans gender claims (Democrats 'can’t even define what a woman is!' complained Florida Governor Ron de Santis, while Trump’s son, Don Jr, accused 'left-wing teachers' of 'teaching our children that there are 57 different genders'); the denunciation of the U.S. government’s decision, following the Black Lives Matter movement, to rename numerous U.S. military installations bearing the names of Southern generals; or the repeated promise, ad nauseam, to fight the left’s 'socialist-Marxist utopia' that seeks to replace traditional American values ('faith, patriotism, work ethic and family') with 'race, gender, sexuality and climate change.' The Republican mission remains unchanged: to save traditional America. A Renewed Corpus The Trumpian ideological framework adheres to the essential tenets of American conservatism while simultaneously instituting a significant doctrinal transformation regarding foreign policy and the connection to populism. The Republican Party had long embraced isolationist thinking, but the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the entry of the United States into the war discredited it. Later, during the Cold War, Republicans adopted an Atlanticist, interventionist vision, which explains, for example, their support for the Vietnam War and Ronald Reagan’s attack on Soviet influence in Central America in the 1980s. This legacy also explains the neoconservative wave that swept the party in the early 21st century, leading to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trumpism rejects this tradition altogether. Following in the footsteps of the George W. Bush administration, Republicans have never acknowledged the mistakes they made in the war on terror, nor have they revised their foreign policy principles. Trump has capitalized on this thoughtlessness and lack of courage to force the party to reevaluate its foreign policy principles. This has led to a remarkable resurgence of isolationism, which was evident in 2016 but has become even more pronounced in the 2024 campaign. In Milwaukee, the Iraq War that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and all the Republican leaders of the time wanted was portrayed as a 'disaster' and a 'lie.' As for the 'America First' slogan used by pro-German isolationists like Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s, it is ubiquitous in the campaign. Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News star and close Trump ally, summed up the perception of interventionism as a betrayal of the American people during his convention speech, saying, 'I’ve seen members of Congress step over the prostrate bodies of their fellow citizens dying of drug overdoses to go to Congress to vote for aid to foreign countries.' Accusing America’s NATO members of enjoying American security without adequately contributing to the alliance’s funding, Trump has constantly criticized them throughout his presidency, building his reputation as tough in diplomatic and military circles. These sermons are even more worrying in 2024, as the situation in Europe has deteriorated sharply with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Going down the isolationist path means knowingly abandoning European allies in favor of Putin’s Russia. Tucker Carlson makes no bones about it: 'You don’t see our commander-in-chief [Joe Biden] suggesting that we use our armed forces to protect our country or the lives of our fellow citizens. No, that’s for Ukraine!' Trump’s populism, recognized as early as his 2016 campaign and credited by American political scientists as a primary factor in his victory, is naturally reflected in his focus on elites who would betray the American people. The 2024 campaign confirms this turning point, which represents a landmark evolution for the Republican Party. While presidents like Nixon or Reagan had used conservative populism in the past to attract working-class votes, Trump’s rejection of elites takes a much more massive and insurgent turn. This is important because, historically, the Republican Party has been precisely the party of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) elites - the party known for its closeness to middle class, big business, and Wall Street. These ties persist, as evidenced by the contributions of many large corporations to Republican campaign financing. However, speeches at the Milwaukee Convention consistently denounced the 'establishment,' accusing 'wealthy elites' of 'selling out American workers' to 'big banks' and 'big technology companies. Leading Republican voices reinforce this message, sometimes creating cognitive dissonance. For example, JD Vance, a former investment banker close to Silicon Valley billionaires and now Trump’s vice presidential running mate, rails against politicians who are 'in the pocket of corporate America' and against 'the barons of Wall Street' who have destroyed the American economy. But consistency is not the priority of the Trumpified Republican Party. Instead, Trumpism resorts to an accusatory inversion in which the Democratic Left replaces the Republican Right as the enemy of the people in the collective American imagination. Trumpist Obsessions To understand Trumpism, one must take into account the obsessions that have fueled it since Trump declared his intention to run in the Republican primaries in 2015: immigration and how it affects crime in the United States. Trump frequently appears at his rallies with the slogan 'Deport Illegals Now' emblazoned in large letters on the wall behind him, and his supporters wave placards with the slogan 'Mass Deportation Now.' Terms like 'invasion' or 'occupation' are now commonplace to create the impression of a country at war with immigrants. For Trump, these millions of illegals entered the United States with the complicity of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, although it would be more accurate to speak of impotence, since the outgoing administration never found a way to reconcile humanitarian and border security policies. As a result, the number of illegal entries into the United States has increased since 2020, leading Republicans to claim that Democrats have betrayed the country. Eric, Trump’s son, made it clear in Milwaukee that the Biden administration not only sends 'illegals' to the most expensive hotels in New York, but also reduces 'homeless veterans' to 'sleeping under bridges.' Worse, once these illegals settle in, they are supposedly the catalyst for violence in small towns and big cities. Because of them, according to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 'Americans are dying every day; they are being murdered, assaulted, and raped' and 'young boys and girls are being sold into sexual slavery. But it is to American women that these immigrants pose the greatest threat. Condemning immigration through its alleged effects on women is a particularly astute strategy for Trump and the Republicans, especially in light of the former president’s conviction in the Stormy Daniels case in the spring of 2024. Women are a highly coveted demographic in this election cycle. Framing immigrants as a formidable threat allows Trump supporters to engage with the issue without addressing their significant vulnerability to female voters, particularly their role in the Dobbs decision that led to the Supreme Court’s revocation of federal abortion rights in June 2022. Trumpist discourse conveys a very traditional vision of women as perpetual victims. Whether they are portrayed as wives (a young woman at the Milwaukee Convention explains how her husband died of an overdose), as mothers (a weeping woman comes to tell how her 15-year-old son, Weston, died after taking a fentanyl pill), or as sexual prey (a family recalls their sister, Rachel Morin, who was raped and killed by an undocumented immigrant), the underlying mechanism of persuasion remains consistent across these narratives: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have perpetuated open-borders policies that have resulted in an influx of immigrants and drug cartels permeating numerous American cities. They bear the burden of guilt. Trump, for example, has made much of the case of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl who was tragically raped and strangled by two undocumented Venezuelan immigrants. If re-elected, Trump vows to 'protect women' threatened by an 'army of illegals from Third World countries' and 'rapists' whom 'American women don’t want coming into their homes.' The Republican base responds favorably to the rhetorical mechanism that combines racism, miserabilist pathos, and an obsession with sexual violence. In Milwaukee, several elected officials, just like Trump, brought up the tragic story of Jocelyn Nungaray to a crowd of activists who angrily chanted, 'Send them back!' Hence, Trump’s new flagship promise, after building a wall on the border with Mexico, is to deport the more than ten million undocumented immigrants currently living on U.S. soil. An Illiberal Drift Such rhetorical excesses have led many historians and political scientists since 2016 to analyze Trump’s success through the concept of 'illiberalism,' popularized in the United States by Fareed Zakaria in a famous 1997 article in Foreign Affairs titled 'The Rise of Illiberal Democracy.' According to Zakaria, illiberal democracies are 'democratically elected regimes' that 'routinely ignore constitutional limits on their power' and 'deprive their citizens of basic rights and freedoms'. Since 2016, a slow illiberal drift has accompanied the Republican Party’s capitulation to Trump. Despite facing numerous challenges during his presidency, including the January 6, 2021 Capitol Rebellion, the party has consistently supported Trump, with only ten elected House Republicans voting to impeachment him during his second impeachment. In 2024, Trump easily won the primaries, confirming this blind loyalty to him. Only two party heavyweights, Nikki Haley (former governor of South Carolina) and Ron de Santis (governor of Florida), dared to run against the former president. Although they were younger than him and considered to be fairly successful elected officials in their respective states, Trump defeated them rather easily. He barely campaigned against them, refused to participate in even the smallest debate, and spent months insulting them. Yet the party base didn’t hold it against him and triumphantly chose him as the Republican nominee in November 2024. The same scenario played out in Milwaukee. The Convention saw the creation of a veritable personality cult around the billionaire. Far from being a mere candidate, he has become, in the words of the many Republicans who spoke at the podium, a hero, even a superman, the 'Braveheart of our time. His success and celebrity have captivated Hollywood and sports stars for years. His golf scores impress even professional golfers. He is credited with shaping the New York skyline in the manner of a modern-day ‘Midas’ (the most famous king in Greek mythology for his ability to turn everything he touched into pure gold). He was reputedly 'one of the best businessmen in the world' before his political career. All of this is demonstrably false. Nevertheless, these compliments, culled from Trump’s pre-presidential existence as a mostly tabloid figure, reinforce the populist aspect of his candidacy, portraying the former president as both a successful man and an eternal outsider. But it was his 'miraculous' survival of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, that gave him an almost supernatural aura among his supporters. In Milwaukee, party leaders declared that while 'the devil' had come for Trump, 'the hand of God' turned his head at the last moment and gave him the strength to stand up 'like a roaring lion. Blessed by God, Trump can join the pantheon of the greatest American presidents in his lifetime, beginning with Ronald Reagan, but also with Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated in 1865, because he understands the risks and is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. He could have lived a life of luxury on his magnificent Florida estate, but he chose to go back into battle and endure the worst of it: insults, trials, and assassination attempts. That is why today’s Republican voters firmly believe that Donald Trump is a victim and that the Democrats are 'persecuting' him. However, he bravely faces these 'vicious' attacks because he understands that his 'only crime' is simply to 'love America.' This kind of flattery may bring a smile to your face. But it points to a real erosion of certain democratic norms that, until Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party, were thought to be secure in the American political system. The first erosion of democratic norms concerns the role of violence in the political arena. The 2024 presidential campaign conspicuously avoids the Capitol Rebellion of January 6, 2021. On the rare occasions it is mentioned, it serves to reverse the burden of blame in favor of the Republicans. While Democrats, first with Joe Biden and now with Kamala Harris, continue to portray the former president as a threat to U.S. institutions, Tucker Carlson acknowledged in Milwaukee that Republicans have grown tired of the constant criticism of democracy on television. After all, the 'true definition' of democracy is 'the proposition that the citizens of a country own that country. This would mean that a country’s leaders must 'do what the people tell them to do.' But only Donald Trump 'pays attention to what the people want.' Therefore, the surest way to strengthen and save American democracy would be to vote for him. This is a bold rewriting of history, especially as the November 5, 2024 election approaches and Trump becomes more explicit about his willingness to use violence whether he is re-elected or loses at the polls. He firmly believes that his Democratic opponents pose a significant threat to the integrity of American democracy. 'We have two enemies,' Trump said to Maria Bartiromo during an appearance on Fox News’ 'Sunday Morning Futures' on October 20. 'We have the outside enemies, and we have the enemies from within, and the enemy within, in my opinion, is much more dangerous than China or Russia and all these countries, because if you have a smart president, he can handle them pretty easily … The thing that’s tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside.' Trump sees only one solution: to call out the army to prevent the 'lunatics of the radical left' from disrupting the elections. He has identified specific targets in interviews and campaign rallies, including Adam Schiff, a Democratic representative who spearheaded the first impeachment proceedings against him in 2020, Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic Speaker of the House, and her husband Paul, who was attacked with a hammer by a far-right activist in his San Francisco home in 2022. Conclusion Each step in this seemingly endless escalation of Trumpian provocations represents a quasi-ontological test for the Republican Party: should the party’s supporters accept any verbal or ideological derailment in the name of winning back the White House? Admittedly, some Republican figures, including a number of Trump’s former secretaries or advisors (Mark Esper, H.R. McMaster, Mike Pence or John F. Kelly, Dick Cheney), have strongly denounced him during the current presidential campaign. However, these voices remain a minority within the party and do not have much influence. In fact, the party expelled Trump’s main internal opponent, former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, in 2021. The Republican Party in the Trump era is thus a monolithic body in which devotion to Trump is a condition of survival. This old party, profoundly renewed in both its ideological foundations and its leadership, has undergone an incredibly rapid metamorphosis, caught between a charismatic leader and a passionate base blindly loyal to him. Today, the mutation seems complete, and whatever the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, it is likely to affect every other actor in the U.S. political, partisan, and institutional system. For American democracy, there will be a 'before' and an 'after' Donald Trump.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1VTGikwny1Fi	2024-11-02T17:08:52-07:00	
Flashback: How Yeltsin Gleefully Drove Bill Clinton To Tears. Who...	Yeltsin grinned while Clinton cried. The Russian president had just blurted out his unfiltered reaction to American news reporting. It was October, 1995. Clinton and Yeltsin had just spoken at the United Nations 50th anniversary meeting. The next day the two presidents got together at Hyde Park, New York for a bilateral meeting followed by a press conference. It was then that Yeltsin told the media his take on his US visit. He said that when he came here that October he did not have the degree of optimism with which he was now departing. The bilateral meeting had apparently been productive. But then he dropped his brutal statement about our American press: 'Coming from my statement yesterday in the United Nations, and if you looked at the press reports, one could see that what you were writing was that today's meeting with President Bill Clinton was going to be a disaster. And now for the first time I can tell you that you're a disaster.' That's what set off Clinton's crying. But his tears were not for the press or over any danger or fear. They were tears of laughter. Both presidents had a good laugh over Yeltsin's remarks about our American news style. You can see the video in this AP archive: Today, though, Clinton would have nothing to laugh about given the present state of bilateral relations. Back at Hyde Park, Yeltsin had gone on, '...our partnership is not calculated for one year or for five years, but for years and years to come -- tens of years, for a century; that we're friends, and that it's only together, together, [that] we're going to be trying to solve not only our joint bilateral issues but issues affecting the whole world.' This was not the first time the new Russian and American friendship was mutually proclaimed. That was made clear at the presidents' April 1993 Vancouver summit. A White House press release that followed said, 'President Bill Clinton of the United States of America and President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation declared their firm commitment to a dynamic and effective US-Russian partnership that strengthens international stability.' In a follow-up phone call now declassified, Clinton told Yeltsin, 'I'm about to issue a statement in support of your policies. I want you to know that we're in this with you for the long haul. We made some significant progress in Vancouver and Tokyo. We'll keep working here to be supportive. If there is anything I can do for you here, please let me know.' It is quite obvious today, that that those past optimistic aspirations did not stand the test of time. Today we find ourselves lavishly sponsoring Ukraine as it bombs Russia and invades and occupies a small part of Russia's home territory. Our actions were seemingly as support for the beleaguered Ukraine, a victim of a brutal invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin in 2022. But any idea of friendship and partnership with Russia is long gone. Truth be known, it was even gone long before Russia's disastrous invasion of Ukraine. And ironically, it was President Bill Clinton himself who set the US and Russia on a collision course. You see, it was Clinton that put in motion NATO's eastward expansion. That ultimately advanced to talk of placing Nato forces right up against Russia's sensitive border with Ukraine. Russia considered that to be a security threat of existential proportion. Clinton had revealed his hidden agenda on this when he spoke to The Atlantic in 2022. He claimed: 'When I first became president, I said that I would support Russian President Boris Yeltsin in his efforts to build a good economy and a functioning democracy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union -- but I would also support an expansion of Nato to include former Warsaw Pact members and post-Soviet states.' Certainly it's always good to be prepared for the worst. But Clinton's plan was in abrogation of a contract made between presidents G.H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. It assured Gorbachev that 'within the framework of Nato, not an inch of Nato's present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.' This matter is often dismissed because it was never a condition of any treaty. But I've examined carefully the official sources on the matter and find present all the elements of a verbal contract. The Soviets performed their obligations in the contract, but Clinton abrogated ours. Under US law verbal contracts are perfectly legal, but difficult to enforce. Clinton apparently hid behind that in his actions regarding Nato expansion. In 1985 presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev issued a joint statement: 'A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.' That admonition seems to be freely ignored now. On September 25, 2024 Reuters reported, 'President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles, and that Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. It is well known that it is Russia's military doctrine that an existential threat will be met with a nuclear response. But Russell Berman, a Stanford University professor, writing in The National Interest, April 6, 2023, proclaims that 'Ukraine must win its war with Russia.' He says, 'It is foolish and short-sighted to withhold from Ukraine the tools it needs to win.' Is Berman nuts? What's worse is that there are prominent American politicians who seem to hold the same position, i.e. that Ukraine must win not settle the war. Unless stopped these people will risk saber-rattling our way into a nuclear war, it seems to me. Europe is already preparing for the worst. On March 20, Politico ran the story, 'Von der Leyen asks Finland to prepare the EU for war.' ( On October 31, 2024 Newsweek reported, 'Europeans Told to Stockpile Food in Case of War with Russia.' ( We Americans are mostly being kept in the dark over the present danger. Our former Civil Defense structure is long gone. Could it be that too many influential people are profiting or benefiting from the military activity? President Eisenhower warned us of such a possibility in his farewell address. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in an interview by Chris Cuomo, likened Russia's present situation to that confronted by his uncle President Kennedy in 1962. That's when he brought the US and the USSR to the brink of nuclear war over the Soviet military advances in Cuba. Thankfully, President Kennedy held strong against those within our country that urged him to fight instead of negotiate. The matter was settled peacefully. Will our next president succumb to internal pressures to keep the war gravy train going? I'm writing this before the election. But I hope that voters will have checked out who the politicians are that want military victory over a peaceful settlement. The 2024 election is not just for president. House and Senate seats are up, too. Clearly nuclear war is not an issue on voters' minds. It doesn't register like more popular concerns over higher prices, jobs, immigration, abortion, and taxes. But nuclear war is far more consequential. Unlike the other important issues, it is an existential threat. Remember Clinton's tears and the Clinton-Yeltsin laugh-fest? Today's issues have truly risen to an existential threat. This is nothing to laugh or cry about. It's no time for domestic political maneuvering. It's now time that our politicians get serious and find a way to peacefully end the hostilities quickly, and in an honest and direct manner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Q2pXdDBPm6i	2024-11-02T17:07:33-07:00	
The Islamic Republic Of Iran Should Be Overthrown – OpEd	By Shahram Mirzaei Only four decades ago, on April 18, 1983, Iran destroyed the US embassy in Beirut through its Lebanese terrorist proxy, Hezbollah. This attack was a turning point in jihadist aggression that still regularly affects the free world today. Before the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic terrorism was not well organized. Mohammad Reza Shah, Iran’s last monarch, laid the groundwork for the rapid growth and spread of Islamic terrorism by severely suppressing progressive and liberal forces in the country. With liberal and progressive forces weakened, Islamic terrorist forces led by the cleric Ruhollah Khomeini seized control of the Iranian government in 1979 in a massive coup against the inhumane Pahlavi Dynasty. With Iran’s resources at their disposal, Islamists were able to establish terrorist organizations in countries across the Middle East. Iran Supports Islamic Terrorism The attack on the American embassy and the suicide bombing on the headquarters of the US Marine barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983, was a major turning point in how Islamists carry out terrorist operations. 241 US soldiers, 58 French soldiers, and six civilians were killed in the attack on the barracks. The culprits were affiliated with Iran. These attacks ushered in an age of unending Islamic terrorism. But who is responsible for this disaster? Inaction from Western governments regarding terrorism, especially from the US, sent a direct message to Iran’s leaders: you are allowed to establish and arm terrorist organizations. Western leaders did not have the determination and courage to respond to the new terrorist threat because they did not recognize or understand the ideological nature of the other side. After these attacks, a joint plan to attack the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah’s centers in Lebanon was planned and approved by the presidents of the US and France. However, the US Secretary of Defense lobbied against and successfully stopped it, claiming there was no clear evidence of Iran’s role in the previous attacks. The leaders of the free world, especially the US, continue to be double-minded and indecisive in dealing with Iran and its terrorist regime. This wrongheaded policy created a suitable environment for the growth of Islamic terrorism and turned our world into a less safe place. The formation of al-Qaeda and its September 11 attacks, the rise of ISIS and its assault on the Yazidi Kurds — including the abduction and sale of thousands of Kurdish women as sex slaves — numerous terrorist attacks across the West, and the profound sense of insecurity in these nations, culminating in the October 7 terrorist attack against Israel and Iran’s subsequent missile attacks against Israel in April and October 2024, highlight the consequences of failing to address Tehran decisively. The Appeasement Policy After almost five decades of appeasement toward Iran, the October 7 invasion of Israel by Iran’s proxy, Hamas, pushed Israel to take a defensive posture and cut off the arms of the Islamic terrorist regime by attacking the source of the satanic ideology: the Islamic Republic of Iran itself. Unfortunately, the international community and the free world still insist on this appeasement policy. For this reason, Israel is alone in the fight against terrorism, bearing the weight of the world in its struggle against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Poor policy choices concerning Iran’s support of terrorism do not end there. On September 28, the US announced an agreement with Iraq to withdraw American troops from parts of the country. This is likely the beginning of another global disaster produced by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The withdrawal will mean the complete handover of Iraq to Iran, providing a safe space for Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist organizations affiliated with Iran to hide from Israel by moving to Iraq. If this agreement is implemented, Iraq — with all its riches — will become a hub for the growth and spread of Islamic terrorism supported by Iran. This will nullify all Israeli efforts to combat terrorism supported by Iran, as well as all Western efforts to create a secure Middle East. If Western countries are not more decisive in dealing with Islamic terrorism, our future will be more uncertain. History has shown that Iran is the head of a snake. To kill a snake, you have to cut off its head. This is not an endorsement of an all-out war with Iran. Instead, free countries, especially the United States, should support liberation movements in the region. This support should be extended to the Kurds, who may be powerful enough to destroy the Islamic Republic but presently lack international support. The lack of support from Western countries for the Iranian popular uprisings in December 2017 and November 2019 and the Kurdish Woman, Life, Freedom movement that started in 2022 sent a message to the Islamic Republic that it can carry out its crimes domestically and continue its terrorist activities internationally without fear of retribution. The West must end the appeasement policy with Iran and crush the snake’s head in Tehran by supporting the progressive and liberal movements of the Iranian people, thereby ending five decades of terrorism fostered by Iran.

Ecuador’s Blackouts: The High Cost Of State-Controlled Electricit...	By Daphne Posadas In recent weeks, Ecuador has faced a severe energy crisis, with power outages lasting up to 10 hours daily, affecting millions of citizens. The main causes are a prolonged drought and a highly centralized electricity sector. The drought, which has been the worst in 6 decades, has reduced water levels at hydroelectric dams to historic lows, impacting plants that generate over 70 percent of the country’s electricity. Most of these hydroelectric plants are operated by Ecuador’s state-owned utility company, CELEC, concentrating energy provision in the hands of the government. You may wonder why Ecuador is so dependent on hydro for energy. The truth? Efforts to diversify the energy mix have stalled due to strong resistance to alternatives, a growing diesel shortage, and missed opportunities to use gas. This puts Ecuador in a risky spot, with its energy supply tied entirely to rainfall. Ecuador’s one-dimensional approach to energy is only becoming costlier as droughts grow more intense. The electricity market is traditionally divided into four segments: generation (the production of electricity, such as at hydroelectric plants), transmission (transporting electricity over long distances at high voltages), distribution (delivering electricity to consumers at lower voltages), and retail sales (providing and selling electricity to customers). In Ecuador, these areas are mostly state-controlled. The Cato Institute’s Gabriela Calderón de Burgos recently published an insightful piece on the history of Ecuador’s electricity sector. She highlights how it once operated more efficiently under a decentralized model. However, after World War II, the government began to nationalize and centralize the sector, leading to a significantly increased state control over electricity generation and distribution by the 1980s. As Gabriela shares in another piece, while private entities are permitted to invest in generating their own electricity from various sources, electricity rates remain highly politicized. Heavy state control of pricing has disincentivized private investment, all while the citizens continue to pay the price. The Ecuadorian Business Committee estimates that businesses are losing approximately 12 million USD for every hour without electricity. However, those are of course only the visible costs. The invisible losses—those that impact productivity and future opportunities—are likely far greater and impossible to measure. Ecuador’s energy crisis illustrates a broader economic principle: the risks of centralized, state-controlled systems. When vital sectors like electricity are monopolized by the state, they become rigid and less responsive to external shocks, such as natural disasters. Centralization stifles competition and innovation, restricting the ability to adapt and respond quickly to crises. (More on the inefficiency of central planning can be found in Tibor Machan’s article from our archive.) In public debates, some Ecuadorian citizens have romanticized the Socialist Correísmo era (2007–2017), arguing that power outages were rare during that administration (more accurately, a dictatorship) and attributing the current crisis to 'neoliberalism'—a term broadly used by people who oppose free markets and limited government. However, the reality is that a fully centralized system lacks the flexibility needed to tackle an energy crisis of this magnitude. And while many governments have come and gone since Correísmo, the current model is partly a legacy of that socialized view of electricity. My colleague Sergio Martínez recently highlighted on our Spanish social media platforms how countries like Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela have all suffered devastating blackouts due to government control of the electricity sector. In these nations, a lack of competition and incentives has led to inefficiencies, higher costs, and an inability to meet rising demands. By opening the energy market, Ecuador could increase its resilience against future crises, encourage innovation, and ultimately ensure a more reliable electricity supply for its citizens. A more diversified energy market could attract private actors who compete not just on price but most importantly on reliability. This would ensure a better service for consumers and better responses to crises like this one. It’s time for Ecuador to power up innovation and competition rather than being left in the dark.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Seeks Reset Of UK Politics With Bi...	By Andrew Hammond It is relatively rare for economic events in the UK to cause big political ripples globally. However, last Wednesday’s Budget could be different. Many people, not only domestically but internationally as well, were looking closely at the most important fiscal statement by a British government in a generation. There are several reasons why the Budget is potentially era-defining, politically and economically, including the fact that, following the party’s victory in the election in July, it is the first fiscal event by a Labour government since 2010, during the final days of Gordon Brown’s administration. Given the huge majority Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government enjoys in the House of Commons, Labour might well remain in office not only until the end of the current Parliament in 2028 or 2029, but possibly well into the 2030s if a second term is secured, even with a reduced majority. This means this week’s Budget could shape the UK’s political agenda for much longer than the typical annual Budget. In her statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves launched what she described as 'a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy, as momentous as any in Labour’s history'. What she was attempting to do here was to try to draw political comparisons with the big programs of reforms that began in 1945 under Prime Minister Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson, and in 1997 under Tony Blair. In addition to welcoming additional private capital, the government therefore announced plans for a step change in public investment. This marks a shift from the plans Reeves inherited from the Conservative administration of the former prime minister, Rishi Sunak, under which public-sector net investment would have fallen from 2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year to 1.7 percent by 2028 or 2029. The new government wants to boost this proportion significantly, as outlined in Labour’s election manifesto, in which the party pledged to keep public sector net investment at a constant level as a share of GDP. This implies big additional investment commitments each year, especially if the economy grows significantly. To facilitate this plan, Reeves is redefining the government’s fiscal rules to potentially free up tens of billions of of pounds of additional borrowing to fund long-term investment, while still seeking to deliver on a Labour manifesto pledge to reduce debt as a proportion of the UK economy. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, who is No. 2 to Reeves in the UK finance team, has announced that a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority will try to 'fix the foundations' of a creaking UK infrastructure system. To help pay for this huge investment, a very significant net tax rise was announced on Wednesday and the financial markets are still digesting its likely impact. Certainly, tax hikes are far from unprecedented immediately following an election. However, the fiscal measures unveiled by Reeves this week amount to a tax take of about £40 billion ($52 billion). This comfortably exceeds the £14 billion and £13 billion, in today’s prices, of her predecessors, Gordon Brown and George Osborne, in their first Budgets in 1997 and 2010 respectively. Indeed, it is most comparable, in real terms, to Norman Lamont’s fiscal plan in 1993, which was the biggest tax-raising Budget in half a century. In the coming years, the acid test for how many people perceive the success of the Budget will be whether it succeeds in boosting economic growth. This reflects the context in which it was prepared, which dates back more than a decade and a half to the 2007/08 international financial crisis. Since then, economic growth in the UK has flat-lined compared with the era immediately before it, and many people around the world will be watching closely to see whether the country can get out of this funk. So with the No. 1 mission of the Starmer government perhaps being its attempt to rejuvenate growth, Reeves highlighted the latest economic forecast from the independent UK Office for Budget Responsibility. This indicated a modest upside in 2025, in part because of falling interest rates, but was less optimistic about the several years immediately afterwards, which will be a cause of concern for the government. Nonetheless, Starmer’s team will seize on the 2025 upside in its keenness to move the economic narrative away from fiscal 'black holes' to more optimistic mood music. This includes a focus on the UK’s long-term growth potential into the 2030s, fueled by a fresh wave of investment to deliver on goals that go well beyond tackling crumbling national infrastructure, to such efforts as becoming a 'clean energy superpower.' The fact that clean energy has become a political super-priority for Labour was highlighted at the UK Investment Summit last month. About half of the more than £50 billion in business deals announced during this big event were energy-related. One driver of this spurt of investment was the launch of Great British Energy, an investment body and publicly owned power-generation company that aims to ensure a massive expansion of clean energy to help enhance the UK’s energy security. Moreover, in July Labour overturned a nine-year ban by its Conservative predecessors on onshore wind-power construction. This was followed by one of the most successful auction rounds for renewables in history. Wednesday’s Budget was therefore the most important moment yet for Starmer’s government. The measures that were announced will help define the next few years, and potentially beyond, of his administration as it seeks to reset the UK’s political landscape by 'going for growth' to try to shift the economy out of its long funk. • Andrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1RD7IEgXczxi	2024-11-02T17:04:42-07:00	
Private-Sector Jobs Went Negative In October: Will The Fed Panic ...	By Ryan McMaken According to the most recent report from the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added only 12,000 payroll jobs during October. This was the smallest month-to-month employment gain in nearly four years. Moreover, total private jobs fell in October by 28,000. This is the worst employment report since 2020, and it reflects an overall downward trend in employment growth since 2022. In addition to the drop in private employment, the report also shows drops in full-time employment and ongoing stagnation in the total number of employed workers. This is an economy in which whatever lackluster growth there is in employment, it’s being driven by part-time jobs and taxpayer-funded government workers. Government Jobs vs. Private Employment Total government jobs grew by 40,000 during October, meaning total job growth for the month would have been negative were it not for the immense amounts of deficit spending that props up growth in government hiring. This has been a growing trend over the past year. Proportionally, government jobs over the year have grown one-and-a-half times more than private-sector jobs. For most of the past year, however, there were—at least according to the establishment survey— some gains in private employment. But that wasn’t the case in October meaning private employment fell in October for the first time in 46 months. But, 12,000 more people had jobs in October than in September, right? Not quite. That number comes out of the so-called 'establishment' survey which counts only jobs, but not employed workers. According to the federal government’s otheremployment survey—the household survey—the total number of employed workers in the United States fell in October, month over month, by 368,000 workers. Over time, this has led to stagnation in total employment in the household-survey numbers. Over the past eighteen months, total employed workers has gone nowhere, and as of October, there are 370,000 fewer employed workers in the United States than there were eleven months ago: Yet, over this period, total jobs in the establishment survey has grown by more than 2 million jobs. So why are there job gains in the establishment survey but job losses in the household survey? One probable explanation is that much of the job growth we see is driven by part-time jobs and by people holding more than one job to make ends meet. Not surprisingly, the household survey does indeed show that full-time employment fell in October both month-to-month and year-over year. Part-time jobs, on the other hand, continued an upward trend in growth, year over year. In fact, year-over-year full-time job growth has now been negative for nine months in a row, for the past thirty years, that has only happened when the economy is in recession: There is other bad news in the report, as well. Temp jobs continue their long march downward, and total temp work is now at the lowest level reported in more than a decade. Year-over-year, temp work has been down for two full years. For more than thirty years, this has only happened during recessions. Average weekly overtime hours remained at 3.6 hours in October. For more than 30 years, average overtime has been at this level only during recessions. The total number of permanent job losers also spiked in October, rising to the highest level reported—outside the covid crisis—in 90 months. These jobs numbers weren’t the only bad news released today, either. The PMI manufacturing index, released by the Institute for Supply Management, fell to 46.5 percent. This was the lowest reading of the year, showing 'economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in October for the seventh consecutive month.' The report showed new orders, production, and employment were all in contraction territory during October. Will the Fed Panic Again? The question that now faces markets is this: what will the Federal Reserve do in response to the October job report? The bond markets may give us hint. Today, after the release of the jobs report, the 10-year yield rose quickly to a four-month high. Overall, the yield curve steepened today as the 5-year, the 10-year and the 30-year also all experienced significantly rising yields. This strongly suggests that bond investors expect the Fed, in the face of increasingly bad economic data, will totally throw in the towel on its alleged war against price inflation. With government debt levels at nosebleed levels, and now with this jobs report, there is every reason to believe that the Fed simply doesn’t have to stomach to do anything but lower the target policy rate in an effort to keep government debt cheap and to stimulate the job market. That points to rising price inflation, and that points to rising yields in the longer term. Thus, we now see that rise in the 10-year and 30-year bonds. The bond markets are probably right. At this point, it’s nearly a sure thing that the Fed will cut the target rate by at least 25 basis points as already expected. After all, at the September meeting, following a middling jobs report that was better than this one, the Fed panicked and chopped 50 basis points off the target rate. It may do so again. This all points to a hard pivot toward more dovish policy and more price inflation moving forward. Of course, price inflation could fall in coming months. But that won’t be thanks to the Fed, it would be thanks to recession and a collapse in demand. On the other hand, given the immense amounts of monetary inflation that has occurred over the past four years, we could get both recession and ongoing inflation. Then we’ll get stagflation and Powell will go down in history as the worst Fed chairman since Arthur Burns. The bond markets seem to be entertaining the possibility.

South Africa’s Memorial To The ICJ: More Evidence On Israel’s Gen...	The timing, as with so much in the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon, was most appropriate. The Israeli Knesset had signalled its intent on crippling and banishing the sole agency of humanitarian worth for Palestinian welfare by passing laws criminalising its operations by 92 to 10 on October 28. The attack on UNRWA also came with a contemporaneous legal effort, this time from South Africa. Pretoria had already made its wishes clear on December 28, 2023 in filing an application in the International Court of Justice alleging 'violations by Israel regarding the [United Nations] Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide […] in relation to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.' Acts and omissions by Israel, argued the South African government, were alleged to be of a 'genocidal' nature, 'committed with the requisite specific intent … to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza as part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group'. By May 10, South Africa had filed four requests seeking additional provisional measures with modifications to the original provisional measures laid down by the ICJ. The momentum, and frequency of the actions, even gave certain commentators room to wonder: Was Israel’s own due process rights regarding judicial equality and the right to be heard compromised? Israel had promised to submit written observations by May 15 to the ICJ when faced with the sudden announcement on May 12 that the court would be holding an oral hearing instead. These debates have been taking place before the concerted, dedicated, enthusiastic pulverisation of Gaza, and the ongoing killing, terrorisation and displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank. In these cases, due process remains fantasy and distant speculation, especially concerning civilians. With increasing regularity, there is chilling evidence that Israeli units have a programmatic approach to destroying a viable infrastructure and means of living on the strip. On October 22, the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem expressed horror at the sheer scale 'of the crimes Israel is currently committing in the northern Gaza Strip in its campaign to empty it of however many residents are left […] impossible to describe, not just because hundreds of thousands of people enduring starvation, disease without access to medical care and incessant bombardments and gunfire defies comprehension, but because Israel has cut them off from the world.' In a chilling overview of the exploits of the IDF’s 749 Combat Engineering Battalion written by Younis Tirawi and Sami Vanderlip for Drop Site News, a record of systematic elimination of cultural, structural and intellectual life in the Gaza Strip is evident. As members of the battalion’s official D9 company stated: 'Our job is to flatten Gaza.' In an operation that saw the destruction of the Al-Azhar University, First Sergeant David Zoldan, operational officer of Company A of the battalion, delights with fellow soldiers on seeing the explosion: 'Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, did you see?!' Statements of this sort are frequent and easily found up the chain of command. They are also uttered with ease at the highest levels of government. On October 21, Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir had told a 'settlement' conference held in a restricted military zone that Gaza’s inhabitants would be given the chance to 'leave from here to other countries'. His reasoning for this ethnic cleansing has remained biblically consistent: 'The Land of Israel is ours.' In a media statement from its Department of International Relations and Cooperation dated October 28, the South African government announced its filing of a Memorial to the ICJ pertaining to its ongoing case against Israel. The Memorial itself runs into 750 pages, with 4000 pages of supporting exhibits and annexes. (Its December 2023 application had run into 84 pages.) 'The problem we have is that we have too much evidence,' remarked South Africa’s representative to The Hague, Ambassador Vusimuzi Madonsela to Al Jazeera. Zane Dangor, director- general of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, was more practical. Israel might well inflate its dossier of bloody misdeeds, but some line had to be drawn in the submissions. 'The legal team will always say we need more time, there’s more facts coming. But we have to say you have to stop now. You [have] got to focus on what you have.' While the formal contents of the Memorial remain confidential, the clues are thickly obvious. It contains, for instance, evidence that Israel 'has violated the genocide convention by promoting the destruction of Palestinians living in Gaza, physically killing them with an assortment of destructive weapons, depriving them access to humanitarian assistance, causing conditions of life which are aimed at their physical destruction and ignoring and defying several provisional measures of the International Court of Justice, and using starvation as a weapon of war to further Israel’s aims to depopulate Gaza through mass death and forced displacement of Palestinians.' Despite that comprehensive assortment of alleged crimes, the legal commentariat wonder how far this latest effort will necessarily go in linking the decisions of Israeli officialdom with genocidal intent. That Israel is committing war crimes and violating humanitarian law is nigh impossible dispute. The threshold in proving genocide, as international jurisprudence has repeatedly shown over the years, is a high one indeed. The dolus specialis – that specific intent to destroy in whole or in part the protected group – is essential to prove. Cathleen Powell of University of Cape Town, for instance, has her reservations. 'If they can find genocidal statements from state officials and show that that directly led to a particular programme that led to the destruction on the ground, then that’s probably a very strong case,'. But making that link would be 'very difficult'. Dangor has no doubts. 'Genocidal acts without intent can be crimes against humanity. But here, the intent is just front and centre.' Suffice to say that Israeli lawmakers and officials, aided by the exploits of the IDF, are making proving such intent an easier prospect with each passing day.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Wh_ZQEozGxt	2024-11-02T17:01:07-07:00	
Deepening Rift In India-Canada Diplomatic Relations – Analysis	The diplomatic rift between India and Canada has escalated again with accusations of Indian involvement in the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada taking a new turn. On November 2, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the Canadian claims of Indian involvement as ‘baseless’ and accused Canada of 'deliberately spreading unfounded allegations' to tarnish India’s global image. Statements from the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence alliance—the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—had already added to India’s frustration, viewing them as part of a coordinated effort to cast it in a negative light. In response, both countries moved to expel diplomats, while the Canadian media’s adversarial tone suggests that the diplomatic fallout may be heading toward an irreversible breakdown in relations. According to the latest report, India lodged a formal protest against Canada, condemning accusations targeting its Home Minister Amit Shah. During a press briefing on Saturday, MEA spokesperson confirmed that India had summoned a Canadian High Commission representative to issue a Diplomatic Note in 'the strongest terms of protest.' This response followed statements by Canada’s Deputy Minister David Morrison, who mentioned India’s Home Minister before the Canadian Standing Committee on Public Safety. India labelled these claims as 'absurd and baseless,' accusing Canada of spreading false allegations internationally to damage India’s reputation. Jaiswal asserted that Canada’s actions confirmed India’s suspicions of a political agenda aimed at discrediting it on the global stage. India’s note warned Canada of 'serious consequences for bilateral ties' if such accusations continued, viewing them as a calculated attempt to tarnish India’s image. This latest dispute adds strain to already tense relations between the two nations, as India expressed a firm stance against attempts to malign its officials. Two senior Canadian officials reportedly admitted to leaking intelligence against India to the Washington Post, revealing accusations linking India’s government to violent acts in Canada. Deputy Foreign Minister Morrison alleged that a top Indian official orchestrated plots against Sikh separatists in Canada. India dismissed these allegations as a tactic to influence other nations. The MEA official also condemned Canada’s surveillance of Indian consular officials, calling it a 'flagrant violation of diplomatic conventions.' Jaiswal stated that Indian personnel in Canada had been under audio and video surveillance, with their communications intercepted, describing these actions as 'harassment and intimidation' that hindered diplomatic practices. He emphasized that such actions worsened an already challenging environment for India’s diplomatic staff, marked by extremism and violence. Earlier, MEA spokesperson directly criticized Prime Minister Trudeau’s ‘cavalier’ approach, holding him solely responsible for the current state of affairs. Jaiswal reiterated that Canada provided no evidence to support its serious accusations against India and its diplomats, asserting that the responsibility for the damage caused to India-Canada relations lies squarely with Trudeau. Genesis of the Row The origins of this conflict go back to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and head of a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia, was a prominent supporter of the Khalistan movement, a Sikh separatist campaign advocating for an independent state in India’s Punjab region. While this movement is largely inactive in India, it has significant support among the Sikh diaspora in countries like Canada. India, however, views the Khalistan movement as a serious threat to its national security and has long pressured Western governments to crack down on separatist leaders in the diaspora, including Nijjar. After Nijjar was shot and killed outside his temple, Canada opened an investigation, which has since expanded into a full-blown diplomatic crisis. In September 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly announced that his government was investigating ‘credible allegations’ that Indian agents were involved in Nijjar’s killing. This marked a low point in relations between Canada and India. India swiftly denied any involvement, calling the accusations ‘absurd’ and ‘preposterous.’ At the time, both countries began withdrawing diplomats and scaling back their diplomatic presence in each other’s capitals. India also froze some diplomatic services for Canadians, including the processing of visas. The situation flared up again in May 2024 when Canadian police arrested three Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder. This further fuelled Canadian suspicions of Indian government involvement, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) suggested there may be links between the suspects and Indian intelligence agencies. Another Indian national was later arrested in connection with the killing, prompting Canada to officially accuse India of state-sponsored criminal activities on Canadian soil. On 14 October, India’s Ministry of External Affairs received diplomatic communication from Canada indicating that Indian diplomats were being considered 'persons of interest' in the ongoing investigation. In response, India strongly denied any involvement in Nijjar’s killing and accused Canada of smearing India’s reputation for political purposes. India announced that it would withdraw several diplomats and officials from its missions in Canada, citing concerns over their safety. Just hours later, Canada escalated the situation by expelling six Indian diplomats, including India’s high commissioner to Canada, and accusing Indian agents of engaging in activities that threaten public safety in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau further intensified the situation by stating that the RCMP had uncovered ‘clear and compelling evidence’ of Indian government agents’ involvement in a variety of illegal activities. These activities, Trudeau claimed, included clandestine information gathering, coercive behaviour aimed at South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including Nijjar’s murder. Trudeau emphasized that this evidence had been presented directly to Indian officials in an effort to seek cooperation in addressing these issues. However, India remained firm in its denials, saying that no concrete evidence had been shared with them and accusing Canada of pursuing a deliberate strategy to damage India’s international image. This exchange of diplomatic expulsions has caused relations between the two countries to hit a new low. While the situation is currently cantered on the killing of Nijjar, it reflects broader tensions between the two countries over issues related to Sikh separatism and Canada’s handling of Khalistani groups. Sikh separatism remains a particularly sensitive issue for India, which has urged countries like Canada, Britain, and the United States to take stronger action against Sikh separatist movements abroad. Indian authorities accuse these movements of promoting violence and terrorism against India, and they view Western governments’ leniency toward these groups as a major point of contention. India’s concerns are not without historical context. Sikh separatists were involved in significant unrest in India in the 1980s, including the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 and the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, which killed 329 people. In this context, Nijjar’s murder and Canada’s accusations against India have reopened old wounds, with both sides unwilling to back down. Changing Dynamics of Bilateral Relations Canada-India relations have experienced both cooperation and tensions, with recent developments highlighting ongoing challenges. Diplomatic ties, dating back to the 1940s, have seen significant collaboration in global affairs, economic aid, and security. However, a major rift occurred following India’s 1974 nuclear test, leading Canada to sever nuclear cooperation for decades. In the 1990s, India’s economic liberalization reignited interest from Canada, with renewed trade and diplomatic missions fostering closer ties. High-profile visits and initiatives like the 2011 ‘Year of India in Canada’ further strengthened relations, while counter-terrorism collaborations also played a key role, especially after the 1985 Air India bombing. Recent years, however, have seen renewed tensions. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2018 state visit to India was overshadowed by a diplomatic controversy involving a convicted Sikh extremist, raising concerns about Canada’s handling of Sikh separatist movements. In 2019, Canada listed Sikh extremism as a top terror threat but later removed it from official reports, sparking criticism from India. Relations were further strained in 2020 when Trudeau expressed support for India’s farmer protests, leading the Indian government to accuse Canada of interfering in its internal affairs. Despite these challenges, both nations continue to engage on trade, nuclear energy, and security, reflecting a complex but enduring partnership. While the diplomatic crisis gets underway, it has already begun to affect other areas of India-Canada relations. Trade negotiations between the two countries have been halted, and India has paused visa processing for Canadians, citing concerns over the safety of its mission staff. Despite these tensions, economic ties between India and Canada remain stable for now. Bilateral trade between the two countries actually grew slightly from $8.3 billion in 2022-23 to $8.4 billion in 2023-24. India’s imports from Canada increased during this period, while its exports to Canada saw a slight dip. These figures suggest that, at least for now, the economic relationship between the two nations has not been significantly affected by the diplomatic fallout. Canada is a significant economic partner for India, ranking as the 18th-largest foreign investor with $3.31 billion in cumulative investments from 2020-21 to 2022-23, primarily focused on services and infrastructure, accounting for 0.5% of India’s total FDI. Key Canadian investors like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) have substantial stakes in Indian companies, with CPPIB's investments reaching $14.8 billion by 2023, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) investing $6 billion by the end of 2022. Major Indian companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and Infosys, have a strong presence in Canada. Canada also plays a crucial role in remittances to India, ranking among the top 10 sources, contributing to the $125 billion in global remittances India received in 2023. The Indian diaspora, consisting largely of professionals and skilled workers, sends regular remittances, while Indian students account for nearly 40% of international students in Canada, with 427,000 studying there in 2023. Indian immigration to Canada has surged, with a 326% increase from 32,828 in 2013 to 139,715 in 2023. Trudeau’s domestic challenges The diplomatic conflict has also placed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a politically precarious position at home. Trudeau has faced declining popularity in recent months, largely due to domestic issues such as rising inflation, a struggling healthcare system, and growing crime rates. A poll conducted recently showed that only 26% of Canadians view Trudeau as the best candidate for prime minister, significantly trailing behind Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Adding to Trudeau’s challenges, his key political ally, Jagmeet Singh’s New Democratic Party (NDP), recently withdrew its support for Trudeau’s minority liberal government, ahead of the general election scheduled for next year. Singh announced this decision in a video message, saying that the Liberals 'have let people down' and that they 'don’t deserve another chance from Canadians.' While the withdrawal of NDP support complicates Trudeau’s position, it is unlikely that his government will fall immediately. To remain in power, Trudeau will need to seek support from other opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre has been pressuring Singh to call for early elections, suggesting that the NDP’s withdrawal of support could lead to a change in government. If early elections are called, the Conservatives are well-positioned to win, given the widespread dissatisfaction with Trudeau’s handling of both domestic and foreign policy issues. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen Liberal backbenchers urged Prime Minister Trudeau to step aside, fearing his declining popularity could lead to an electoral disaster. This appeal, according to the Guardian, followed a separate 'code red' petition calling for a secret leadership vote among grassroots supporters. Despite this internal unrest, Trudeau, now in his ninth year as prime minister, appeared unfazed, asserting that he has the strong backing of most of the 153 Liberal MPs and will lead the party into the next election. However, analysts suggest that this growing dissent, the most serious challenge to his leadership yet, may have left its mark. Amidst the escalating crisis, Trudeau’s handling of the situation has drawn attention from Canada’s allies, particularly the United States. Trudeau has reportedly shared evidence related to the accusations against India with the United States and other members of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing alliance. The U.S. State Department emphasized that Canada’s allegations against India are 'extremely serious' and urged India's cooperation. The UK also expressed support for Canada’s investigation, stressing respect for sovereignty and the rule of law. Similarly, Australia voiced concerns about the case and affirmed respect for Canada’s judicial process. New Zealand, which reacted first, highlighted the seriousness of the allegations if proven, urging adherence to the rule of law. Challenges and Way Forward Looking ahead, it remains unclear how the diplomatic crisis between India and Canada will evolve. India’s Ministry of External Affairs stated that it 'reserves the right to take further steps' in response to Canada’s accusations, though it has not yet outlined what those steps might be. For now, both countries appear to be digging in their heels, with neither side willing to back down. Experts warn that the longer this dispute drags on, the more difficult it will be for India and Canada to restore normal diplomatic relations. The alleged involvement of Indian nationals in Nijjar’s killing has sparked renewed concerns about foreign interference in Canadian domestic affairs, particularly among the Sikh community, which makes up a significant portion of Canada’s population. The Indian diaspora in Canada is also worried about the worsening situation. Another major sector likely to be affected is student migration. Canada announced a 10% reduction in the intake cap for international student study permits for 2025, lowering the target from 485,000 in 2024 to 437,000. This decision is expected to have a negative impact on Indian students who plan to study and work in Canada. Diplomacy often exists in a complex terrain between what one nation perceives as ‘right’ and another sees as ‘wrong.’ It rarely deals in absolutes, as what is deemed just or appropriate for one country may be considered unjust or harmful for another. The subjective nature of national interests, values, and cultural perspectives creates a reality where diplomats must grapple with a constantly shifting scenario of competing moralities and priorities. This makes diplomacy less about moral clarity and more about pragmatism, compromise, and the art of finding common ground without sacrificing essential interests. In cases like the current India-Canada standoff, both nations firmly believe in the righteousness of their positions: Canada sees itself as protecting its sovereignty and public safety, while India views Canada’s accusations as politically motivated and harmful. For diplomacy to work in such situations, both sides often have to move beyond binary notions of right and wrong, and instead focus on managing tensions, finding areas of mutual benefit, or at least mitigating damage. In international relations, the pursuit of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ is typically tempered by practical concerns like security, trade, and global standing. The challenge for diplomats lies in negotiating these grey areas, where rigid adherence to one side’s definition of right and wrong can easily lead to deadlock or conflict. This pragmatic approach underlines the need for flexibility and, at times, a willingness to accept that both sides can have valid concerns, even if they are fundamentally opposed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1YE55-lr2y1y	2024-11-02T16:59:26-07:00	
Robert Reich: Why Musk Predicts Lina Khan Will Be ‘Fired Soon’ – ...	Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and the richest man in the world, tweeted this week that Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan 'will be fired soon.' Musk is hardly the only billionaire upset by Khan’s aggressive use of antitrust law to limit the power of big corporations — and, hence, to limit the power of billionaires like Musk. Mark Cuban, the billionaire surrogate for the Harris campaign, has also said Khan must go. So have major Democratic donors like Reid Hoffman and Barry Diller. When a bipartisan group of billionaires agree that a government official who’s limiting their power must be fired, you have every reason to believe she’s doing her job. One of the biggest structural problems in the American economy is the size and power of large corporations, which have grown larger and more powerful over the last three decades. They can (and do) set or coordinate prices to keep them high. They can (and do) set or coordinate pay to keep it low. They can (and do) use their political clout to get lower taxes, public subsidies, and regulatory rollbacks. Antitrust law provides a means of reversing this trend and limiting the size and power of large corporations. Lina Khan at the FTC and Jonathan Kanter at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department are using antitrust law as it should be used. Last year alone, Biden’s regulators filed a record 50 antitrust enforcement actions; mergers reached a 10-year low. Forty years ago, I was in charge of advising the five commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission what they should do. The chairman at that time was Michael Pertschuk, who — like Khan — aggressively used the power of the FTC on behalf of consumers and workers. Also like Khan, Pertschuk was targeted by big business. He was called an enemy of capitalism. But Pertschuk’s efforts helped save capitalism from its own excesses and thereby helped maintain the legitimacy of the private sector in the public’s eyes. Of course, 40 years ago corporate America didn’t have nearly the clout it has now, the super-rich weren’t nearly as wealthy, and money didn’t play nearly as great a role in American politics. Elon Musk and Donald Trump pose the greatest threats in recent history to American capitalism. If given the authority to do what they’ve said they will do — including Trump’s giant 20 percent tariff on all goods imported into the United States, which will function as a giant regressive sales tax — Americans will not only be far worse off; they will be less inclined to support the capitalist system. Musk’s pledge to remove Khan came after he stood on stage and said he would personally oversee a $2 trillion cut to the Federal budget — a cut that would cause, in Musk’s words, 'hardship.' Musk’s personal fortune is about a tenth of the cut he says he’ll oversee. That’s enough to shield him from any hardship. But most Americans depend on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government spending that would be cut if Musk has his way. I have a better idea. If Musk is as concerned as he seems about getting the federal budget deficit under control, he should consider supporting a 25 percent tax on great wealth, starting with fortunes over $100 million.

Strengthening Ties: President Prabowo’s Diplomatic Mission To The...	A New Era for Indonesia-USA Diplomacy In November 2024, President Prabowo Subianto’s visit to the United States represents a strategic initiative to elevate Indonesia’s partnership with the world’s largest economy, to address shared economic and security challenges within the intricate geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. Given Indonesia’s increasing influence in ASEAN and its commitment to maintaining neutrality amid U.S.-China tensions, this visit occurs at a critical juncture for both nations. The outcome of the recent U.S. presidential election introduces additional complexities, as potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy may significantly influence the dynamics of Indonesia-U.S. relations. This analysis explores how Prabowo’s diplomatic engagement is strategically crafted to reinforce economic, defence, and cultural connections while navigating the imperatives of regional stability, sovereignty, and economic advancement. Political Diplomacy: Reinforcing ASEAN Centrality and Managing U.S. Engagement President Prabowo’s diplomatic agenda is aimed at reaffirming Indonesia’s dedication to ASEAN, ensuring that Southeast Asia remains a bastion of peace and neutrality amidst escalating U.S.-China rivalry. As the most influential member of ASEAN, Indonesia seeks to establish a regional order in which ASEAN plays a proactive role in negotiation processes, rather than merely serving as a battleground for power contests. Prabowo’s dialogues with U.S. leaders underscore mutual interests concerning regional stability and prosperity, particularly through the promotion of ASEAN’s diplomatic neutrality. However, the post-election political landscape in the U.S. raises potential challenges. A Republican administration may adopt a more confrontational approach towards China, thereby exerting pressure on Indonesia to align more closely with U.S. strategic interests. Conversely, a Democratic administration may prioritise a values-based foreign policy, emphasising human rights and democratic governance. This could potentially strain relations if these values conflict with Indonesia’s domestic priorities. Prabowo’s diplomatic strategy thus seeks to affirm Indonesia’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy, reinforcing its role as a mediator within ASEAN. Economic Cooperation: Enhancing Trade, Investment, and Green Technology Collaboration A fundamental aspect of Prabowo’s visit encompasses economic collaboration, as Indonesia endeavours to augment trade and attract American investment in sectors such as infrastructure, digital technology, and green energy. With its abundant natural resources, extensive market, and strategic geographical position, Indonesia presents significant opportunities for American enterprises. Prabowo aims to bolster trade relations, decrease tariffs, and facilitate direct U.S. investments, particularly in advancing Indonesia’s renewable energy capacities. With ambitious green energy objectives, Indonesia aspires to transition away from coal dependency, necessitating U.S. support to propel renewable energy initiatives and enhance technological proficiency. Supply chain resilience constitutes a pivotal area of economic discourse, particularly in light of recent global disruptions. Indonesia and the United States are anticipated to develop frameworks aimed at ensuring reliable supply chains in critical sectors, including energy, minerals, and food, which could support the sustainable development goals of Indonesia. Nonetheless, potential challenges may arise from regulatory complexities, concerns regarding environmental sustainability, and labour standards that may come under increased scrutiny from a new U.S. administration. Prabowo’s diplomatic strategy is likely to emphasise Indonesia’s reforms designed to attract responsible investment while ensuring alignment with the nation’s sovereignty and economic imperatives. Cultural and Public Diplomacy: Fostering Mutual Understanding and Educational Partnerships Acknowledging the long-term benefits of people-to-people connections, Prabowo’s cultural agenda encompasses diplomatic initiatives aimed at fostering mutual understanding. Programs featuring cultural exchanges, tourism promotion, and heritage events aspire to enhance American public appreciation for Indonesia’s rich cultural heritage and dynamic economy. Furthermore, Indonesia seeks to expand educational exchanges with U.S. institutions through the provision of scholarships, vocational training, and collaborative research opportunities in diverse fields, including environmental science, STEM, and social sciences. These initiatives not only contribute to enhancing Indonesia’s global image but also establish a foundation for future collaboration across various sectors, ranging from academia to technology. However, visa policies and funding limitations in the United States may potentially impede educational exchanges, while disparities in cultural diplomacy priorities could emerge, contingent upon the international engagement stance of the U.S. administration. Prabowo aims to secure enduring partnerships that transcend political cycles, consequently fostering a resilient Indonesia-U.S. relationship rooted in shared cultural and educational values. Defence and Security: Strengthening Regional Stability through Maritime and Cybersecurity Cooperation Amid rising regional tensions, Prabowo's visit underscores the importance of defence and security cooperation, particularly about maritime security and the South China Sea. As Southeast Asia's waters become a focal point of U.S.-China competition, Prabowo seeks U.S. support for Indonesia's defensive efforts, which include joint maritime exercises, intelligence sharing, and technology transfers. These initiatives aim to secure regional waters while affirming Indonesia's territorial sovereignty, a critical concern given China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. In the realm of cybersecurity, Indonesia aims to enhance collaboration with the United States, particularly in light of the increasing threat of cyberattacks across the region. Joint cybersecurity training, intelligence-sharing mechanisms, and technological support are essential for strengthening Indonesia's digital defences. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing defence cooperation without compromising Indonesia's neutrality. An enhanced U.S. defence presence could be perceived as a shift in Indonesia's traditionally non-aligned stance, potentially escalating regional tensions. Global Issues: Navigating Complex International Dynamics Prabowo's visit highlights Indonesia's commitment to engaging with pressing global issues while maintaining a balanced foreign policy approach. As Indonesia seeks to bolster its role in Southeast Asia, Prabowo aims to promote collaboration with the United States on shared priorities, including supply chain resilience, economic stability, and regional peace. This objective aligns with ASEAN's vision of preserving a neutral and stable region amid evolving global dynamics. Indonesia's diplomatic stance is expected to emphasise solutions that respect national sovereignty and encourage dialogue, reflecting ASEAN's commitment to consensus-building in addressing international challenges. Prabowo's approach signals Indonesia's intent to enhance its global influence, fostering relationships that support growth and stability while circumventing direct alignment with any particular major power. This balanced strategy reinforces Indonesia's dedication to ASEAN's central role in promoting a cohesive and adaptable Southeast Asia within a complex international landscape. Challenges and Conclusion President Prabowo’s visit to the United States emphasises Indonesia’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations amid the complexities of a shifting global landscape. This diplomatic initiative seeks to expand economic cooperation in technology and sustainable development, foster deeper collaboration in maritime and cybersecurity domains, and reaffirm ASEAN’s central role in maintaining regional stability. However, several challenges may affect the partnership. Indonesia could face pressure from the United States to adopt a more assertive stance toward China, which may potentially strain its neutral foreign policy approach. Additionally, divergences in trade policies, regulatory frameworks, and strategic priorities may present obstacles, particularly if future U.S. policies diverge from Indonesia’s economic and diplomatic goals. Prabowo's approach highlights the importance of establishing a stable, reciprocal partnership that respects Indonesia’s sovereignty and enhances its influence within Southeast Asia, striving to align mutual interests in a manner that safeguards Indonesia’s strategic autonomy.

Impact Of US Presidential Election On South Asia – Analysis	Continuity rather than change is foreseen In the post-World War II era, relations between the US and South Asian countries have been both close and growing, as the US had replaced Britain as the dominant power in Asia. Therefore, an American Presidential election is of critical importance to Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and the Maldives. Their preferences for the next US President may be different but none of them has an option other than to engage with the US irrespective of who tenants the White House. As for US policy, experts say, it will be one of 'continuity' whether it is Donald Trump or Kamala Harris who wins. India India is the pivot of US policy on South Asia. Washington will therefore look towards further defence tie ups with India and working with it to counter China in the field of maritime security, says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute. He told the Turkish news agency, Anadolu that in the US, there is a strong bipartisan support for close ties with India. Therefore, whether it is a Trump or a Harris Administration, there will be continuity. The US has differences with India over Russia and China, but still they will work together, Kugelman adds. Of course, right now, India-US relations are at a low ebb. To India's discomfiture, the US joined Canada in charging that its intelligence agency was plotting to kill Indian dissidents in North America. The US said that an American Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, had been a target of India-handled assassins. The Pannun case is in court and an Indian agent allegedly involved in the plot was extradited from the Czech Republic and brought to the US for trial. The US and Canada went to the extent of naming Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and the National Security Advisor of India Ajit Doval as persons behind the alleged assassination plots. India stoutly denied involvement. It is now in talks with the US at the National Security Advisors' level to find a way out. Kugelman said both Harris and Trump could pressure New Delhi on this issue. 'They would not let it go. They would pressure India to carry out an investigation,' he said. Though India and US are strategic partners vis-à-vis China, they have divergent interests. India is now seeking a détente with China on the border issue and also more Chinese investments. This worries the US. While Trump has been supportive of commercial ties, he has long been unhappy about India's tariff policies. However, India and the US have too much at stake in the relations to allow ties to be hampered. The arms trade between India and the US has touched USD 25 billion. In 2023, US investments in India were valued at approximately USD 49.6 billion and Indian investment in the US amounted to USD 4.6 billion. Pakistan No matter who will be in charge of the White House, Pakistan would not be a priority,' says Kamran Yousaf in Express Tribune. Trump had let down Pakistan by walking out of Afghanistan leaving behind two million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. He also accused Pakistan of playing a double game in Afghanistan, taking American aid on the one hand, and clandestinely supporting the Taliban on the other. However, both Trump and Biden had allowed Pakistan to develop ties with China and build the strategic China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Bangladesh President Joe Biden put US-Bangladesh relations on an even keel after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina who had clashed with the US on human rights and over Hasina's refusal to join the anti-China QUAD. The student movement, which ousted Hasina, had the backing of the US. The present Chief Advisor to the interim government Prof. Muhammad Yunus is sad to be the joint choice of the US, the agitating students and civil society. The US has been a strong supporter of civil liberties in Bangladesh, even sanctioning some of the top men in Hasina's brutal security establishment. Human rights cements ties between the Yunus regime and Washington. While it is clear that Kamala Harris will follow Biden's footsteps vis-à-vis Bangladesh, Trump has taken a pro-Hasina stand with an eye on the influential Indian-American constituency in the US. But this could well be an election gimmick. Greeting American Hindus on Deepavali day, Trump said on X: ' I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos. It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America.' 'Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi.' It is not clear if Trump will actually be hostile to Bangladesh as President. He could well have made the pro-Modi or pro-Hindu noises to get the Hindu-dominated Indian American vote. Given the presence of US protégé Muhammad Yunus at the helm in Dhaka, Trump is most likely to strengthen US ties with Bangladesh. Afghanistan The Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would probably like to have Trump as President. As US President, as it was Trump who planned to pull out US troops from Afghanistan. The successor Biden Administration also enforced the decision. Perhaps Afghanistan would be happy even with Kamala Harris as President. Sri Lanka As for Sri Lanka, relations with the US are unlikely to be different from the past. Though the newly elected National Peoples' Power (NPP) government is radical leftist in theory, it has indicated that it can play ball with capitalism and the US-led West. The Anura Kumara Dissanayake government in Colombo has also not said or done anything which would suggest a pro-China tilt. However, the US has a deep interest in drafting Sri Lanka into its anti-China QUAD maritime security architecture, a prospect Sri Lankan governments have dreaded. No Sri Lankan government has wanted its island home to be a battle ground for regional or world powers. Nevertheless, the US, whether under Trump or Harris, will press Sri Lanka to sign agreements on defence and security cooperation even those Sri Lanka had traditionally baulked at. The US will raise human and minority rights, irrespective of the occupant of the Wight House. Nepal Nepal is ruled by a coalition between the pro-China Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and the pro-India Nepali Congress party. China was the first country to react to the formation of the coalition in Kathmandu. Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha visited Beijing where he held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Nepal and China signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework agreement in May 2017, but Nepal has been expressing serious reservations about the text, saying that it is not interested in commercial loans from China but wants only investments. Talks over the BRI projects and an implementation plan remain suspended. Tension with India continued. In May this year, Nepal announced the printing of a new Nepali 100 rupee note displaying a map showing Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani as parts of Nepal when India claimed those areas. While there is an uneasy relationship with New Delhi, the coalition government in Kathmandu has not talked about its relationship with the US. Nepal has always welcomed Western investment and had signed up for the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) pact. Maldives Little change is expected in US-Maldives relations as the Mohamed Muizzu government has completely given up its pro-China and anti-Indian character and is now heavily dependent on India financially. China has abandoned the Maldives for reasons not very clear. Since Maldives is in the care of strategic partner India, the US has little to worry about.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Xku3DGK1llN	2024-11-02T16:55:27-07:00	
Ukraine’s Positions Deteriorate Across Front Lines; Russian Milit...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukrainian Drones Strike Chechnya On October 29 Ukrainian combat drones attacked the Russian Special Forces University in the Russian Republic of Chechnya. The university, founded in 2013 and named after Russian President Vladimir Putin, is a private center for modern warfare training. The institution has close ties with current and retired members of Russia’s National Guard (Rosgvardiya). Most of its instructors hail from the ranks of the Rosgvardiya or from the Alpha counterterrorism unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). Pro-Putin Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov’s militia, dubbed the Kadyrovites, also has strong ties to the university. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the institution has trained so-called volunteers before they are sent to the front lines. Kadyrov does not hide the fact that tens of thousands of fighters received training at the university before being sent to occupied Ukraine. Worse, Ukrainian sources report that Russian forces have sent children abducted from occupied parts of Ukraine to the university, where the abductees are trained to serve as child soldiers against their own country. As Kadyrov, Putin’s loyal ally, doubles down on his forces’ involvement in Russia’s war, Ukraine will likely continue to target Chechnya under the pro-Russian rule, while anti-Kremlin Chechen forces continue to operate alongside Ukrainian combat formations. 2. North Korean Troops Move Closer to the Ukrainian Front According to the United States Department of Defense, North Korean troops have moved to the front lines in Ukraine to prepare to enter combat operations there within weeks. Mark Rutte, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), seconded the Pentagon’s assessment, claiming that Pyongyang has already fielded military formations to fight the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Russian region of Kursk. The White House also confirmed that since mid-October, North Korea has dispatched at least 3,000 servicemen to fight the Kremlin’s war. These troops traveled by sea from Wonsan, North Korea, to Vladivostok, and then dispersed to different training bases in eastern Russia. Additionally, South Korean sources have reported that a 10,000-strong contingent of troops is preparing to serve in Russia later this year. The Kremlin will reportedly pay $2,000 to each North Korean serviceman taking part in combat operations, revenue that will undoubtedly fill the coffers of a Kim Jong Un dictatorship that considers its soldiers to be lucrative export items. Additionally, Pyongyang’s 11th Corps special forces unit, also known as the Storm Corps, has reportedly forward-deployed troops to Ukraine. Available writings suggest that while the North Korean military’s conventional formations are often poorly equipped, the country’s special forces are highly motivated and well-trained. Formerly known as the Light Infantry Training Guidance Bureau, the Storm Corps specializes in unconventional warfare, infiltrations, and sabotage. Official reports have concluded that, of North Korea’s 200,000 special forces personnel, around 60,000 fall under the command of the Storm Corps. This will enable Pyongyang to easily rotate combat formations and supply reinforcements to the highly attritional battleground in Ukraine. 3. Battlefield Assessment Ukraine’s positions continue to deteriorate across the front lines. Russia has secured substantial territory throughout October. The Russian military has also committed a mounting number of war crimes, including executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Pinned down on multiple fronts, Ukraine is gearing up to mobilize tens of thousands of citizens to improve the unfavorable force-to-terrain and force-on-force ratios it currently faces. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Ukraine’s positions in Kupiansk, Pokrovsk, and Kurakhove remain tenuous. In Kharkiv Oblast, the Russian military has kept up its push for Vovchansk. Clashes are also unfolding for Toretsk, and Ukrainian defensive combat operations have managed to hold the line in Siversk. In Chasiv Yar, the Russian offensive gained more territory and reached the canal on the southern edge of the town. Around the city of Selydove, the Russian military is progressing further into Ukrainian territory. And across the country, including in Kyiv, Russia’s heightened use of Iranian Shahed drones poses a significant threat to Ukrainian troops and civilians. In Kursk, Ukraine faces additional challenges in its efforts to hold Russian territory. With Pyongyang’s forces likely to enter the fray, Kyiv’s need for permission to use Western long-range weapons inside Russia grows even stronger. Weapons like the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) could hit North Korean combat formations at their assembly sites elsewhere in Russia before they are able to affect the tactical situation in Kursk.

China Honors Late General Linked To Cultural Revolution Cannibali...	By Yitong Wu and Kit Sung The ruling Chinese Communist Party has enshrined the ashes of a general who presided over a Cultural Revolution massacre that included cannibalism of those deemed 'enemies of the people' by late supreme leader Mao Zedong. On Oct. 24, officials reburied the ashes of People’s Liberation Army founding general and former Guangxi regional party chief Wei Guoqing – 35 years after his death. The full-honors burial ceremony at Beijing’s Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery – the resting place of China’s high-ranking leaders and revolutionary heroes – was attended by high-ranking guests, including the descendants of late revolutionary leaders Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. The news prompted outrage and satire on Chinese-language social media, with comments highlighting Wei’s role in the Guangxi Massacre in which members of factional gangs killed an estimated 100,000-150,000 people through beheadings, beatings, burial alive, stoning, drowning, boiling and disembowelment, according to historical research. Wei’s name is most strongly linked in the public mind with cannibalism during the massacre period in Guangxi’s Wuxuan and Wuming counties and Nanning city, after the victims were targeted as 'enemies of the people' amid the factional violence of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. Public records cited in The New York Times in 1993 and by Radio France International in 2016 showed that at least 137 people were eaten, with thousands participating. Chinese-language comments on this week’s news story on X, which is blocked in China but still accessed by some using circumvention tools, were darkly scathing about the move. 'So the Chinese Communist Party’s running-dog butcher is now a hero for killing people,' commented @ueinhu, while @sebonesama quipped: 'Babaoshan is already packed full of demons and monsters – there’s always room for one more.' Other jibes seemed to echo those made about the fictional killer Hannibal Lecter, with one user posting a meme of Wei faced with piles of deep-fried meat and a KFC logo in the background. 'Paying tribute to a legendary gourmet,' commented @WaterMargin_10, while @akira38458278 wondered if the move was to prevent the people of Guangxi from 'digging him up and eating him' and @DingeX22503 concluded: 'Only those who are ruthless enough get to be a hero in China.' Hands ‘covered in blood’ Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Technology in Sydney, said Wei’s burial is politically symbolic, as it underscores Xi Jinping’s status as the heir of late supreme leader Mao Zedong, and is a tacit endorsement of the political 'struggle' tactics used by his predecessor. 'Wei Guoqing was an executioner whose hands were covered in blood,' Feng told RFA Cantonese in a recent interview. 'By giving him the honor of entering Babaoshan, Xi Jinping is endorsing the persecution mania of the Cultural Revolution, which reflects his own totalitarian resurgence.' 'It indicates that Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong have the same authoritarian nature,' Feng said. Yang Haiying, a professor at Japan’s Shizuoka University who has researched Cultural Revolution violence against the ethnic Mongolian population, said the burial of Wei’s remains seemed to indicate Xi’s unwillingness to distance himself from that era of China’s recent history. 'When Wei Guoqing was in Guangxi, his people killed and ate people, and yet he gets to be in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery,' Yang said. 'The Chinese Communist Party has never condemned the Cultural Revolution ... just paused it temporarily.' 'Xi Jinping is now restarting it; we’re right in the middle of it now,' he said. Yang said there was a leader similar to Wei in Inner Mongolia, who presided over massacres of tens of thousands of ethnic Mongolians during the Cultural Revolution, but that the authorities had refused to criticize his actions in public. 'The Chinese Communist Party is a violent regime, and all its talk of revolution just means violence,' he said. 'So it will only reward its most violent followers.' Wei Guoqing died of illness on June 14, 1989, 10 days after the Tiananmen massacre put an end to weeks of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square. His ashes were placed in storage at the Babaoshan Columbarium until the Oct. 24 burial ceremony.

Taiwan Expects Ukraine-Tested Weapons From US Amid Rising Chinese...	By William Yang Taiwan is expected to receive several weapons that have been battle tested in Ukraine from the United States over the next few years. Analysts say those weapons can help bolster Taiwan’s defense and strike capabilities amid growing military pressure from China. In the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan, worth about $2 billion, the United States plans to deliver three medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, also known as NASAMS. The weapons include advanced AMRAAM Extended Range surface-to-air missiles. The proposed sales will help improve Taiwan’s security and 'assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement released October 26. NASAMS has been battle-tested in Ukraine and is viewed by experts as a significant elevation of Taiwan’s air defense capabilities. Australia and Indonesia are the other countries in the Indo-Pacific region that have received the system from the U.S. Experts say that NASAMS has a high interoperation capability, and that the medium-range air defense system provides needed coverage in Taiwan’s existing air defense capabilities. 'Currently, Taiwan relies on Stinger missiles for short-range air defense while using the Patriot missile system or Taiwan’s indigenous Tien Kung for long-range air defense, so NASAMS can help fill the gap of Taiwan’s medium-range air defense,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA by phone that when NASAMS is incorporated into Taiwan’s air defense system, it can improve the island’s capabilities to deal with the increasingly frequent patrols the Chinese military is conducting around Taiwan. 'As Chinese naval vessels and military aircraft increase the frequency of their combat-readiness patrols near Taiwan, the risk of abrupt missile attacks launched by Chinese vessels is also increasing, so acquiring NASAMS can further enhance Taiwan’s capabilities to deal with these potential threats,' Su said. In addition to the surface-to-air missile system, Taiwan’s National Defense Ministry said the island is expected to receive 29 sets of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, from the United States between the end of 2024 and 2026. The rocket system has been credited with helping Ukraine destroy Russian weapons or equipment in the ongoing conflict. Apart from receiving HIMARS from Washington, at least 17 Taiwanese soldiers were trained to use the rocket system at a military base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, this past August. After a post on the military base’s official Facebook page showed Taiwanese soldiers participating in HIMARS training with counterparts from Romania and Estonia, which has since been removed, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Friday that Taiwan had planned to send at least 30 soldiers to receive HIMARS training in the U.S. between February and October this year. Since Ukraine has used HIMARS to strike Russian military bases and weaken the Russian military’s momentum, some Taiwanese experts say the systems potentially can be used to target Chinese military facilities in coastal areas. 'The Taiwanese military can use HIMARS to hit some Chinese military facilities along the southeastern coast or target invading troops in different parts of Taiwan,' said Chieh Chung, a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight in Taiwan. Overall, Chieh told VOA by phone, the acquisition of NASAMS and HIMARS can enhance Taiwan’s capabilities in conducting network-centric warfare and deter China from easily launching an attack against Taiwan. Other analysts say the series of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan reflects Washington’s commitment to supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, but China will interpret the latest developments as a provocation from Taiwan and the U.S. 'Beijing will interpret this as changing the status quo [across the Taiwan Strait] nevertheless,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA in a written response. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and repeatedly has vowed to reunify with the island, by force, if necessary. In response to the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan last week, Beijing condemned it and urged Washington to stop what it called dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China showcases its naval capability The arms sales and training come as China’s two aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, conducted a dual formation exercise for the first time in the disputed South China Sea from late September to October. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping told the state-run China Dailynewspaper that the exercise will allow the two Chinese aircraft carriers to 'integrate and magnify the power' and 'enable the fleet to better organize strikes and handle threats from air and sea.' Chieh in Taiwan said China is showing the U.S. it could assert maritime claims in disputed waters in the Indo-Pacific region at a time when U.S. aircraft carriers are deployed to the Middle East. 'Since the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has forced the U.S. to deploy its aircraft carrier groups to the region, China is trying to remind Washington that it can impose control over certain parts of the Indo-Pacific region amid an American absence,' he said. Nagy in Japan said that while China can demonstrate its capability to operate aerial and naval assets near areas of potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region — such as the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait — such a formation also exposes the Chinese aircraft carriers as obvious targets for more experienced fighting forces. 'Losing one or two of China’s few aircraft carriers would have a very serious reputational cost for the Chinese Communist Party, and the U.S. and its partners understand this, so they are preparing for their scenarios,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1VpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-02T16:49:36-07:00	
European Commission Highlights Georgia’s ‘Backsliding’	By Irakli Machaidze (Eurasianet) -- As the dispute over Georgia’s parliamentary voting results plays out, an annual report issued by the European Commission is effectively writing off Tbilisi’s chances of joining the EU any time soon. The report states that the incumbent Georgian Dream’s policies run 'counter to the values and principles' of the EU. EU officials and international observers have cited widespread irregularities connected with the October 26 parliamentary elections. Some in Brussels have called for a thorough investigation but have thus far refrained from saying the outcome was rigged. Official results show Georgian Dream winning 54 percent of the vote and gaining 89 of the 150 seats in the legislature. The EU Commission report on Georgia’s EU accession progress, issued October 30, was far less equivocal on Georgian Dream’s overall performance. The general message conveyed in the report is that Georgian Dream is taking the country in the wrong direction. 'Due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government, EU leaders stopped Georgia’s accession process. It remains on hold as long as Georgia continues to move away from the EU,' the EU’s ambassador to Georgia, Pawel Herczynski, said at an October 30 news conference in Tbilisi to outline the report’s findings. After granting Georgia EU candidacy status in 2023, Brusselsconditioned the opening of accession talks on the Georgian government’s implementation of reforms. Georgian Dream has made halting progress in several spheres, including aligning economic frameworks with EU standards. But the report notes 'backsliding' in key areas, including the judiciary, fundamental rights and foreign policy. Georgian Dream’s adoption of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, more commonly known as the ‘foreign agents’ law, 'impacts freedom of expression and the ability of the media to operate freely,' according to the report. The commission also states that Tbilisi has made 'no progress' over the past year in harmonizing its foreign, security and defense policy with Brussels, especially in the area of sanctions implementation against Russia, Belarus and Iran. The report notes that Georgia is now experiencing 'extreme polarization,' while blaming Georgian Dream for creating an 'increasingly hostile environment' for those who question government policies. Another area of particular concern outlined in the report was gender and minority rights. It stressed that the legal definition of rape in Georgia does not conform with EU standards. 'Gaps in prevention and response to gender-based violence remain,' the report says. It also states members of Georgia’s LGBTQ community are living in a 'hostile and stigmatizing atmosphere' that is a direct outcome of 'legislative activities and the continued prevalence of homophobic hate speech.' Regarding the just-concluded elections in Georgia, the Commission report echoes the preliminary findings of international election monitors, saying that a variety of factors, including recent amendments to the election code and the use of intimidation to influence voters, 'negatively impacted public trust in the process.' The commission’s negative assessment of Georgia is brought into sharper focus by its praise for Moldova’s and Ukraine’s progress towards accession. A statement on the adoption of the EU’s 2024 Enlargement Package notes accession talks with Moldova and Ukraine opened in June, signaling Brussels’ 'important recognition' of both countries’ 'determination to pursue reforms.' 'This year, Georgia has gone backwards while other candidate countries have advanced,' said Herczynski, the EU envoy. 'Georgia’s next government should reverse course, recommit to democratic principles and values if it wants to bring the country closer to the EU.' Irakli Machaidze is a Eurasianet editorial fellow in New York.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1UAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-02T16:47:57-07:00	
Indonesia: Five Unexpected Things Prabowo Did In His First Week A...	By Shailaja Neelakantan When Prabowo Subianto was sworn in as president of Indonesia on Oct. 20, he was coming off of five years serving as defense minister – a performance that earned mixed reviews. How would the former general fare as president, observers wondered, especially after he had unveiled a whopping cabinet of 109 ministers and deputy ministers, carving out two or three ministries from one to accommodate positions for alliance partners. But if anyone had expected a sedate start to the new Prabowo presidency, on account of new ministers in his large cabinet finding their feet, they were mistaken. During his first week in office, Prabowo and his ministers had a packed program and took actions that surprised observers, either in and of themselves or by their timing. Here are five such things that happened during the opening week of the Prabowo presidency: 1 - Did an about-face in Indonesia seeking BRICS membership: Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Prabowo’s predecessor, had been hesitant about the prospect of BRICS membership, saying last year he wanted to study and calculate the pros and cons, and that joining the bloc was not urgent. However, during his first official trip abroad, new Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono conveyed the opposite while attending a summit of the economic grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. 'Indonesia joining BRICS is a manifestation of its independent-active foreign policy,' said Sugiono, who goes by one name, Reuters reported. 'That does not mean we join a certain bloc, but we actively participate in every forum.' Jokowi might have been wary that joining could be seen as Jakarta tilting towards Beijing, wrote Klaus Heinrich Raditio, at the Driyarkara School of Philosophy in Jakarta, in an analysis for The Lowy Institute. 'But Prabowo does not carry that burden. ...[Indonesia's] main aim is primarily in seeking development opportunities, rather than endorsing Russia’s or China’s views on the world order,' said the analysis. 2 - Announced construction deadlines for new capital: Prabowo announced initiatives related to Nusantara (IKN), the proposed new capital on Borneo island, within seven days of being sworn in, a move that would have surprised many observers who didn't expect much new direction in the project, or certainly not so soon. Many had believed the new president was not interested in continuing with Jokowi’s pricey legacy project, because his own priority program to provide free school-lunches was wildly expensive (U.S. $53 million a day). But Prabowo 'emphasized that the IKN issue is actually very clear,' Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni said on X last week. 'It has been decided that [IKN] will be continued and completed. There is no need for any more questions about it actually,' Raja wrote, referring to a speech Prabowo made to his cabinet at a retreat in Central Java. 'For him, the IKN is the ‘political capital.’ Therefore, in addition to the executive buildings (which are now almost finished), in the next four years the [Nusantara Capital City Authority] must complete buildings for the legislature and judiciary,' Raja wrote, citing Prabowo's directions. 3 - Retained previous government’s finance minister: Until around a week before he was sworn in, few believed Prabowo would name as Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, with whom he had several run-ins on the nature of his defense procurements, and other issues, when they were both in Jokowi's cabinet. Mulyani’s reappointment, though, would reassure investors and markets, wrote editors of East Asia Forum, an online publication of the Australian National University, in an analysis of Prabowo’s cabinet. 'With financial markets wary of Prabowo’s instincts towards government largesse, her presence in the cabinet will ensure strong oversight of public finances,' they added. 4-Signaled assertiveness on South China Sea to Beijing: The new Prabowo administration also quickly displayed some feistiness toward China during is first week. Indonesian ships chased away from Jakarta's exclusive economic zone in the North Natuna Sea a Chinese coast guard vessel on three occasions. The Indonesian coast guard (Bakamla) said it was repelling the Chinese ship that was 'disrupting' Jakarta's oil and gas survey activities. 'Bakamla’s expulsion of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel from the North Natuna Sea’s continental shelf is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguarding our maritime domain,' the Indonesian coast guard said in a statement. 5 - Showcased his army roots with military-style retreat for cabinet: Prabowo, a former general in the Indonesian army’s special forces (Kopassus), raised eyebrows when he transported his entire cabinet to a retreat at a military academy. The 104 men and five women in his cabinet donned camouflage uniforms and combat boots as they took part in drills intended to build team unity and discipline, participants said. 'I struggle a bit with waking up early since my usual routine involves going to bed at 2 a.m. and waking up at 5 a.m. for morning prayers, then catching some more sleep until 7. But here, that’s not possible,' Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said. 'We go to bed at 2 a.m. and have to wake up at 4 a.m. It’s a good challenge because it forces us to maintain discipline, and we must be prepared to fulfill our duties, even if we only get 1-2 hours of sleep.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1TSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-02T16:46:47-07:00	
Bishop Defends St. Michael’s Prayer At Mass: ‘The Devil Has No In...	By Jonah McKeown Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, this week responded to a letter in the Wall Street Journal from a priest objecting to the praying of the St. Michael prayer at the end of Mass, asserting that the priest’s view is 'simply wrong.' In a letter to the editor published Oct. 21, Father Gerald J. Bednar, a retired priest of the Diocese of Cleveland, wrote that the Vatican 'suppressed this practice in 1964 because the prayer interferes with the integrity of the Mass.' Bednar proffered his view that praying the St. Michael prayer after Mass 'ends the liturgy with a private devotion, a petition to a saint, while all of the petitions were concluded much earlier in the liturgy and addressed to God the Father.' 'The end of Mass sends participants out on a positive mission, bidding them to expand God’s kingdom through evangelization,' Bednar wrote. 'St. Michael is known as the captain of the guardian angels and we should, by all means, ask for his help. But believers should accept the Lord’s presence in the Eucharist as their primary protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil — and respond to his call to enhance God’s kingdom, where the devil has no influence,' the priest concluded. In a response letter published Oct. 27, Paprocki disputed Bednar’s assertion that praying to St. Michael after Mass 'ends the liturgy with a private devotion.' 'The liturgy ends when the celebrant says, ‘Go forth, the Mass is ended,’ and the people reply, ‘Thanks be to God.’ The prayer, then, is recited after Mass, which the priest and people are free to do. It isn’t a private devotion when prayed publicly,' Paprocki wrote. 'The end of Mass sends participants out on a positive mission, and while Rev. Bednar is correct in saying that the devil has no influence in God’s kingdom, we aren’t there yet. Doing so together doesn’t hurt, and we pray it will help to invoke the intercession of St. Michael to defend us in our spiritual battles.' St. Michael the Archangel is one of the four principal angels and is described in the Bible as a 'great prince' who battles against Satan in defense of God’s people. Following an 1884 vision of Satan 'running riot' on the planet, Pope Leo XIII composed three prayers to St. Michael, the briefest of which he commanded should be prayed at the end of every Mass. That prayer is as follows: St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; may God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the divine power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. The prayer to St. Michael was a regular feature of the Mass until the Vatican II era, though Pope John Paul II in 1994 urged Catholics to make the prayer a regular part of their lives. Devotion to St. Michael is still widely promoted today, including by Pope Francis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1aL4tGz8p_DK	2024-11-02T16:44:19-07:00	
Does Russia Want To Increase Tension In BRICS? – OpEd	Just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China announced to much fanfare a 'no limits friendship' with Russia, suggesting a future of close collaboration in trade, energy and, perhaps most importantly, security. Now, more than two years into the war, the meaning and interpretation of this 'no-limits' commitment has evolved. There has been much debate in Chinese society in recent months about Beijing’s alignment with Moscow. While some have advocated for a more formal alliance with Russia, others have taken a more cautious stance. In sharp contrast to 2022, China’s growing wariness is increasingly being discussed in the open, even among those who were previously censored. In early 2022, for instance, a joint letter by a group Chinese experts opposing Russia’s invasion was censored by the government. The scholars were also warned. Now, however, it appears the government is seeking to balance its relationships with both Russia and the West. Beijing may not want to be seen as a 'decisive enabler' of the war. For example, the once-prominent 'no-limits' friendship language quietly vanished from a Sino-Russian joint statement. And Beijing’s response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visits that month was notably subdued. Putin ingratiated himself with Xi, saying they were 'as close as brothers'. Xi’s response was more perfunctory – he called Putin a 'good friend and a good neighbor'. Scholars are also articulating their concerns about China’s political and economic investments in Russia, both publicly and privately. Shen Dingli, a leading scholar of Chinese security strategy at Fudan University in Shanghai, said China doesn’t want to be seen as collaborating with Russia against Ukraine or any other country. He also quoted Fu Cong, China’s former ambassador to the European Union, who said last year the 'no-limits' [friendship] is 'nothing but rhetoric'. And in August, after Putin referred to China as an 'ally' during a visit to far-eastern Russia, Chinese scholars promptly sought to clarify this statement to prevent any misunderstanding China wants a formal alliance with Russia. These statements carry weight. In many respects, leading Chinese scholars at the government-affiliated universities act as propagandists to convey and justify the government’s stance on issues. As a result, subtle shifts in their commentary provide insights into the strategic mindset in Beijing. WHY CHINA IS RETHINKING ITS ‘NO-LIMITS’ FRIENDSHIP? There are three elements driving this re-evaluation of the Russia-China alignment. First, there is growing skepticism of Russia’s state capacities. The mutiny by the Wagner Group last year and Ukraine’s recent incursion into Russia’s Kursk region have prompted critical reassessments in Beijing of Russia’s political stability and military preparedness, as well as the growing anti-war sentiment in Russia. As Feng Yujun, director of Fudan University’s Russia and Central Asia Study Centre, argued, the Wagner rebellion was a reflection of Russia’s internal conflicts and domestic security challenges. He noted every time Russia has faced both internal and external crises in history, its regimes have become less stable. More recently, Feng has been even bolder, predicting a Russian defeat in Ukraine. He argued China should keep its distance from Moscow and resume a policy of 'non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-partisanship'. Second, China’s sluggish economy and its underwhelming trade with Russia have further exposed how dependent both countries are on the West. The relationship heavily favors Beijing. Russia accounts for only 4% of China’s trade, while China accounts for nearly 22% of Russia’s trade. Many Chinese experts are now warning against an over-dependence on Russia, instead calling for more cooperation with neighboring countries. This echoes a recent concern Russia has been using its natural resources as a bargaining chip to extract greater benefits from China. RUSSIA’S VALUE AS A MILITARY ALLY Finally, there are rising Chinese concerns its international outlook does not align with Russia’s. Zhao Long, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of International Relations, says there is an important difference in how they view the world: Russia wants to destroy the current international system to build a new one. China wants to transform the current system by taking a more prominent place in it. Shi Yinhong, a strategist at Renmin University in Beijing, has highlighted an unbridgeable gap preventing a stronger China-Russia alliance. He says there’s a deep mutual distrust on regional security. Russia has never promised support for China in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, just as China has avoided involvement in the war in Ukraine. As Russia’s war in Ukraine reaches a stalemate, its value as a military ally is increasingly being questioned in China. Recently, Feng Yujun warned China risks being led by the nose by Russia, despite being the stronger economic partner. He says every time China has attempted an alliance with Russia in history, it has had negative consequences for China. Consequently, it is crucial for China to maintain its long-term partnership with Russia without undermining its constructive relationship with the West. Russia has arguably benefited from the current competition between the US and China, as it has sought to exploit the rivalry for its own benefit. But this has also led to uncertainty in the China-Russia relationship. As another analyst argues, relying too heavily on Russia will leave China isolated and vulnerable. And this is not a position China wants to be in. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER’S VISIT FOR SHANGAI COOPERATION SUMMIT IN PAKISTAN Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar travelled to Islamabad for a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, while Canada accuses six Indian diplomats of involvement in threats and attacks against Sikh separatists, and Bangladesh’s foreign secretary visits Washington. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar traveled to Islamabad for a high-level Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit—marking the first time an Indian foreign minister has traveled to Pakistan since 2015 and the first time any Indian minister has visited the country since Defense Minister Rajnath Singh since 2016. During his roughly 24-hour visit Jaishankar participated in meeting and other activities with Pakistani officials present, but there were no bilateral engagements. JAYASHANKAR VISIT SIGNALS INDIAN COMMITMENT TO SCO That is no surprise: Jaishankar’s trip was intended to signal India’s commitment to the SCO, not to strengthen ties with Islamabad. Prior to his trip, Jaishankar said he wouldn’t do any one-on-one meetings with Pakistani officials. The visit comes a month and a half after he declared that the 'era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan' was over. New Delhi’s position is firm: Until Islamabad deals with terrorist groups on its soil that threaten India, there can be no talks. India has doubled down on this stance since January 2016, when militants attacked an Indian Air Force base days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to Pakistan—the last time an Indian minister traveled to Pakistan solely for bilateral reasons. That Jaishankar visited Pakistan despite these tensions reflects the importance that India attaches to the SCO. New Delhi values its membership in several monoliteral groupings—including the SCO, BRICS, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, among others. They enable India to amplify its support for multipolarity and reflect its strategic autonomy. The SCO is especially important for India because its membership and focus emphasize Central Asia—a region where New Delhi is keen to ramp up ties but faces an inherent constraint with its outreach. India lacks direct land access to Central Asia because Pakistan—itself looking to expand ties there—denies it transit trade rights. This elevates the importance of any opportunity for Indian high-level engagement with the region. In recent years, Modi has convened dialogues with Central Asian leaders to signal India’s commitment to partnership—and New Delhi sent Jaishankar to Islamabad to amplify that message. However, Jaishankar’s visit does show a degree of stabilization in India-Pakistan bilateral ties. The relationship plunged to a new low in 2019 following another terrorist attack in India carried out by Pakistan-sponsored militants, a brief military crisis, and New Delhi’s decision to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its autonomy. But in 2021, India and Pakistan signed a new truce along their disputed border, easing tensions. CONCLUSION Today, China’s productivity is nearly double that of India. While 45% of Indian workers are still in the highly unproductive agriculture sector, China has graduated even from simple, labor-intensive manufacturing to emerge, for example, as a dominant force in global car markets, especially in electric vehicles. China is also better prepared for future opportunities. Seven Chinese universities are ranked among the world’s top 100, with Tsinghua and Peking among the top 20. Tsinghua is considered the world’s leading university for computer science, while Peking is ranked ninth. Likewise, nine Chinese universities are among the top 50 globally in mathematics. By contrast, no Indian university, including the celebrated Indian Institutes of Technology, is ranked among the world’s top 100. Chinese scientists have made significant strides in boosting the quantity and quality of their research, particularly in fields such as chemistry, engineering, and materials science, and could soon take the lead in artificial intelligence. As the figure shows, Chinese researchers, both in academia and industry, are rapidly generating high-quality patents. Since the mid-1980s, Indian and international observers have predicted that the authoritarian Chinese hare would eventually falter, and the democratic Indian tortoise would win the race. Recent events – China’s harsh zero-COVID restrictions, rising youth unemployment, and the adverse repercussions of the Chinese authorities’ ham-handed efforts to rein in the country’s overgrown real-estate sector and large tech companies – seem to support this view. But while China, with its deep well of human capital and greater gender equality, stands poised at the frontiers of both the old and the new economies, Indian leaders and their international counterparts tout an ahistorical ability to leapfrog over a fragile human foundation with shiny digital and physical infrastructure. China has a plausible path through its current muddle. India, by contrast, risks falling into blind alleys of unfounded optimism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1YgSnOpXlRK5	2024-11-02T16:41:25-07:00	
PRC Adapts Meta’s Llama For Military And Security AI Applications...	By Sunny Cheung In September, the former deputy director of the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS), Lieutenant General He Lei (何雷), called for the United Nations to establish restrictions on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in warfare (Sina Finance, September 13). This would suggest that Beijing has an interest in mitigating the risks associated with military AI. Instead, the opposite is true. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is currently leveraging AI to enhance its own military capabilities and strategic advantages and is using Western technology to do so. The military and security sectors within the PRC are increasingly focused on integrating advanced AI technologies into operational capabilities. Meta’s open-source model Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) has emerged as a preferred model on which to build out features tailored for military and security applications. In this way, US and US-derived technology is being deployed as a tool to enhance the PRC’s military modernization and domestic innovation efforts, with direct consequences for the United States and its allies and partners. PLA Experts’ Vision for Military AI The PRC’s 2019 National Defense White Paper, titled 'China’s National Defense for the New Era (新时代的中国国防),' notes that modern warfare is shifting toward increasingly informationized (信息化) and intelligentized (智能化) domains, demanding advances in mechanization, informationization, and AI development (Xinhua, July 24, 2019). AI development in the military has accelerated in direct response to the demands of intelligent warfare, which itself has been propelled by recent technological advances. Experts from AMS and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have highlighted several key capabilities that AI systems must achieve to meet the PLA’s evolving military needs. First, large AI models must enable rapid response and decision-making to enhance battlefield situational awareness and support command functions. This includes autonomous mission planning and assisting commanders in making informed decisions under complex conditions. Strengthening the fusion of information from multiple sources is also seen as crucial, using AI to integrate data from satellite feeds, cyber intelligence, and communication intercepts. This is then used to deepen intelligence analysis and support joint operations, as highlighted by the PLA Joint Operation Outline (中国人民解放军联合作战纲要), which entered its trial implementation phase in 2020 (MOD, November 26, 2020). [1] Military AI is also being applied extensively to cognitive and psychological warfare (China Brief, September 6, 2019; September 8, 2023; June 21). Generative AI models can be deployed to produce media content to influence narratives, conduct strategic influence campaigns, and undermine an adversary’s morale, according to AMS experts. [2] Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can also rapidly integrate diverse information sources to enhance military intelligence analysis. With strong language processing capabilities, they can simplify data extraction, support real-time translation, and transform complex data into actionable insights, aiding military personnel in decision-making on the modern battlefield. Experts within the military apparatus, including top defense industry players like the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC; 中国电子科技集团), are currently working on AI to enhance cybersecurity and network threat detection. One paper authored by employees at CETC argues that AI models can play a pivotal role in identifying and countering cyber threats and establishing robust early-warning systems to fortify military communication networks. [3] Another area of focus is predictive maintenance and supply chain management. Here, AI can be used to anticipate equipment failures and streamline supply logistics. This optimization is critical for the PLA’s sustained operational readiness, especially during prolonged engagements. PLA experts are prioritizing the development of smaller, more 'lightweight' AI models for deployment in resource-constrained environments like frontline operations. These models must be robust and capable of performing effectively with limited computational power, making them suitable for edge devices—small computers or sensors that can process data and operate without relying on distant servers. The Aiwu Large Model (艾武大模型) is a good example of this. According to one research paper, Aiwu offers cross-platform compatibility on both manned and unmanned systems, and can execute diverse mission tasks under challenging conditions. [4] PLA experts consider military AI to be a foundational asset that must be highly adaptable, capable of integrating multimodal data and supporting autonomous decision-making in a wide range of tactical and strategic contexts. This approach stems from the understanding that future warfare will demand intelligent systems capable of processing real-time data, making proactive decisions, and synthesizing information from diverse sources. [5] PRC Researchers Adapt Llama to Meet Military Demands The potential that PRC researchers see in Meta’s Llama model lies in the flexibility and efficiency of its foundational model. This makes it useful for adaptation to various military and security systems. [6] A recent iteration, Llama 3.1, was launched in July and was described as having 'capabilities that rival the best closed source models' (Meta, July 23). (Llama 3.2 was released on September 25, and so has not yet been treated in relevant research.) As an open-source model, developers and researchers can modify and innovate on top of it. PRC security researchers have focused on adapting it for multilingual dialogue, high-quality code generation, and complex mathematical problem-solving. [7] They argue that the transformer model—an architecture for deep learning models that powers text-generating models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama, and Google’s Gemini—enhances performance in tasks such as information summarization, threat analysis, and decision-making support that are crucial for defense and public safety (ACM, December 4, 2017). [8] PRC researchers have also identified several limitations in Llama that they believe should be addressed before it can be optimized for military use. A primary concern is that Llama relies on open-source training data, which is largely general-purpose and lacks specificity for military contexts. [9] This leads to biases and limited domain-specific knowledge, particularly in areas of military strategy and security operations. In addition, the scarcity of comprehensive Chinese-language data restricts Llama’s ability to fully grasp linguistic nuances in Chinese-language communication, including the cultural context of specific utterances. [10] To overcome these challenges, PLA experts have implemented different techniques involving advanced data collection, computational techniques, and algorithmic improvements. These efforts have enabled Llama to adapt to understand Chinese-language military terminology and tactics Researchers Explore Techniques to Adapt Llama PRC researchers have employed a number of strategies to fine-tune Llama for military and security applications. One approach involves constructing domain-specific datasets, which includes gathering military-specific dialogue records, building data corpora from classified documents, integrating real-time operational data, and incorporating direct feedback from military personnel. [11] Other techniques include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reinforcement learning, multimodal integration, and infrastructure upgrades. LoRA has become a crucial strategy for customizing Llama (MIT, May 1). LoRA enables researchers to build specialized models based on Llama—for instance, by adding additional matrices to existing model layers to adjust the model’s responses in a targeted way, thereby negating the need to retrain the entire model (which could be time-consuming and expensive). This approach allows the model to retain its core abilities while adapting to military-specific terminology, coded signals, and context-sensitive decision-making with minimal resource use. This balance makes LoRA suitable for adapting Llama to meet the demands of military applications. [12] Reinforcement learning involves fine-tuning models by reiterating training runs with tailored feedback to optimize responses. To further optimize Llama, researchers use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which involves presenting the model with examples of high- and low-quality responses, enabling it to learn to prioritize the former. Applied over a period of time, reinforcement learning allows Llama to adjust its responses dynamically and adapt to evolving situations. [13] Researchers have optimized infrastructure through distributed computing and hybrid algorithms to meet Llama’s computational demands. Certain techniques allow large AI models to run efficiently on devices with limited processing power by carefully reducing model size, memory needs, and computational requirements. For example, quantization compresses the model by using fewer bits per parameter, which saves memory without much loss in performance; while the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach activates only select portions of a model based on the specific task, so only relevant parts are engaged during processing, which makes computation faster and less resource-intensive (Researchgate, June). [14] Some experts have applied techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs to better align with human preferences in simulated environments. Specifically, RLHF helps models tailor their outputs to meet user expectations. In simulated military training exercises, this has optimized an LLM’s ability to perform scenario-specific tasks like decision-making and behavioral responses. This process also ensures the model’s alignment with specific communication and behavioral styles within these simulated contexts, enhancing the model’s realism and relevance for military operations. [15] Llama-Based Models Deployed for Predictive Policing and Electronic Warfare Experts from PRC’s security sector see Llama-based models as having huge potential to enhance smart policing (智慧警务). Specifically, these models could improve situational awareness and decision-making by streamlining administrative tasks and providing predictive insights to prioritize police responses. In theory, by extracting important information from reports, generating incident summaries, and classifying events, Llama can enable officers to focus more on handling emergencies in the field. Implementation of these techniques is currently being studied, for instance in Yueqing, Zhejiang Province. The model’s ability to process vast and various data sources, including social media posts, surveillance transcripts, and crime records, makes it an effective tool for proactive and data-driven law enforcement. [16] Experts from the AVIC illustrate the data flow and processing stages involved in training and debugging Llama 2 for military applications. In the military domain, Llama is being studied to explore the potential for LLMs to support electronic warfare and self-defense jamming strategies, including by experts from the Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC; 中国航空工业集团), one of the PRC’s top defense conglomerates. Integrated with reinforcement learning agents (AI models designed to learn how to make decisions by studying their environment and improving their actions to achieve a specific goal), Llama is used to implement a dual-level approach to maximize efficiency. At the strategic level, Llama determines optimal parameters for disrupting enemy radar systems, while reinforcement learning agents execute real-time tactical adjustments to counter adversary maneuvers. One simulation run by the AVIC researchers using Llama 2 as the base LLM demonstrated that this combined approach improved interference strategy reward scores by approximately 25–31 percent. In other words, the new LLM system led the agent to execute more successful jamming strategies and reduced ineffective actions. [17] Illustration from a paper by NORINCO researchers of a learning and optimization loop for training a Llama 2-70B. Experts from a science institute under the US-sanctioned China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO; 中国兵器工业集团有限公司) have been exploring the integration of LLMs, such as Meta’s Llama 2, into their computer-generated forces (CGF) simulations. From their perspective, these models can enhance autonomous decision-making, behavior simulation, and environmental adaptability. Strategically, LLMs process complex environmental data, enabling agents to make optimized, mission-aligned decisions. Tactically, they provide diverse behavioral scripts, allowing agents to execute coordinated actions and respond to real-time battlefield dynamics, including terrain, adversary movements, and situational threats. This dual-layered integration can create realistic simulation environments where agents autonomously adapt to dynamic conditions, thereby potentially improving PLA training performance and military operations. [18] ChatBIT: A Llama-Derived Model for Military Intelligence PLA-affiliated experts have been optimizing Meta’s Llama’s 13B model, which is based on Llama 2, for military and security purposes. This model, which features 13 billion parameters and a training corpus of one trillion tokens, outperforms GPT-3 on various benchmarks (Huggingface, October 28). The model was introduced by Meta researchers in early 2023 in the paper 'Llama: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models' (Arxiv, February 27, 2023). Image from a paper by AMS researchers demonstrating the training process of ChatBIT, which is based on Meta’s Llama. Using Llama-13B as a foundation, researchers from AMS have developed 'ChatBIT,' a model tailored for open-source intelligence (OSINT) and military dialogue tasks. [19] ChatBIT appears to be a powerful model, outperforming Vicuna-13B—another Llama-13B-based model developed at Stanford University that allegedly achieved roughly 90 percent of GPT-4’s performance—on military-relevant benchmarks such as BLEU and ROUGE that assess translation accuracy and summarization quality (LMSYS Org, March 30, 2023; Elastic, December 1, 2023). Comparative evaluations consistently suggest that ChatBIT outperforms models like Vicuna-13B on these metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately interpreting nuanced military contexts and ensuring high-fidelity responses. [20] AMS researchers provide an example of ChatBIT outperforming other models on pertinent tasks. For instance, when asked about the United States Army Research Laboratory, ChatBIT delivered a comprehensive and accurate response detailing the lab’s focus on AI, cybersecurity, and drone technology. Vicuna-13B, the model it was tested against, provided an incorrect response. [21] Similarly, when tasked with explaining 'combat power contribution rate and combat effectiveness correlation'—metrics for evaluating weapons systems—ChatBIT offered an in-depth analysis, whereas Vicuna-13B only gave a superficial explanation. AMS experts argue that ChatBIT’s impressive performance in these tasks demonstrates its readiness for deployment in military Q&A, situational analysis, and operational support tasks. Conclusion Meta initially released Llama as an open-source model to support research and non-commercial use; however, the PLA’s adaptation of Llama to build models such as ChatBIT illustrates the problems of a trust-based approach to releasing technology into the global commons. Although Llama comes with license agreements that expressly forbid using the software for military purposes, these have proven ineffective in preventing the PLA and affiliated researchers from doing exactly that (Huggingface, accessed October 28). In practice, these restrictions act as 'paper tigers'—stipulations that lack enforceability and fall short of holding entities like the PLA accountable. The PRC has adapted Meta’s Llama for military and security purposes that are improving the country’s national defense capabilities. Through advanced techniques like LoRA, reinforcement learning, and multimodal integration, PRC researchers have transformed Llama into a tool to meet the intricate demands of military and public security applications. This work underscores the PRC’s commitment to developing AI systems that are integrated, adaptive, and capable of autonomous operation across diverse applications, from predictive policing to electronic warfare. Open-source LLMs like Llama can accelerate innovation and provide valuable tools across sectors, but they also pose risks if not carefully managed. Without oversight, such technologies can be modified for malicious purposes and used in ways that are contrary to developers’ original intentions. These technologies’ dual potential for both innovation and misuse highlights the importance of balanced oversight to maximize the benefits of open-source AI while mitigating risks associated with strategic misapplication.

Deciphering Turkey’s Africa Policy – Analysis	By Peter Fabricius President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Türkiye may not be quite ‘a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma’ as Winston Churchill described the Soviet Union in 1939 after its incongruous pact with Nazi Germany. But its foreign policy can sometimes be enigmatic. Last week, Türkiye was reportedly invited to become a BRICS member. How, many asked, does a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member join an association dominated by NATO’s only two identified foes, Russia and China? In Africa, Erdoğan also surprised friend and foe alike in 2019 when Türkiye intervened in Libya’s civil war to stop Khalifa Haftar from capturing Tripoli. Recently he has been trying to reconcile two of his closest African allies, Somalia and Ethiopia, who have fallen out over Ethiopia’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence in exchange for access to the sea. That mediation dilemma dates back to 2011. When countries were deserting Somalia because al-Shabaab’s terrorism made it too dangerous, Erdoğan visited the country to show support. He returned in 2016 to open an embassy. Conversely, he endeared himself to Ethiopia by supplying it with drones in 2021, which helped prevent rebel Tigrayan forces from capturing Addis Ababa. So in a sense that makes Türkiye a neutral broker – but the country is also perceived to be closer to Somalia, especially after it signed a new defence pact with Mogadishu in February. Erdogan is the master of surprise, of seizing opportunities. Erdoğan surprised friends and foes when Türkiye intervened in Libya to stop Khalifa Haftar from capturing Tripoli On the surface, his Africa policy looks quite orthodox. As a G20 member, Türkiye evidently feels it necessary to engage the continent as many other G20 powers have – for instance to bolster support in the United Nations. This weekend, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will chair a Türkiye-Africa Ministerial Review Conference meeting with counterparts from 14 African countries ahead of the fourth Türkiye-Africa summit in 2026. This is part of a major outreach to Africa, which Erdoğan greatly boosted. Writing in 2023, former Turkish ambassador Numan Hazar noted that since 1998, the number of embassies on the continent has mushroomed from 12 to 44, while African embassies in Ankara have increased from 10 in 2008 to 38 today. Since becoming prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014, Erdoğan has visited 31 African countries. Total trade with Africa increased from US$5.4 billion in 2003 to US$40.7 billion in 2022. Türkiye’s overall investment stock in Africa, focusing on infrastructure, education and healthcare, totals US$6 billion. Turkish contractors have built 1 296 projects worth US$82.6 billion. Hazar points out that the late former South African ambassador to Ankara, Tom Wheeler, said Türkiye used its soft power to expand its influence in Africa, yet didn’t attract the negative reactions other countries faced. This could partly be because Türkiye didn’t carry any colonial baggage. This lack of any threat perception would be remarkable, considering that Türkiye has considerably expanded its military presence in Africa. As Ali Bilgic, Professor of International Relations and Middle East Politics at Britain’s Loughborough University, told ISS Today, ‘Turkey has made notable strides in realising its ambition to become a key economic, humanitarian and military power in sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing military bases, such as the one in Somalia, and training local forces have solidified its geopolitical presence.’ He notes that as Islamist terrorists have increasingly targeted West African states such as Niger, Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali, Türkiye has been selling these countries drones. Ankara seeks to engage with all parties, so Türkiye doesn’t have eternal friends or enemies, only partners ‘Turkey’s defence industry has grown significantly, with numerous contracts signed across Africa. For instance, Turkey has supplied Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ethiopia and Libya ... Additionally, Turkey has agreements to provide military training and equipment to nations such as Somalia, further cementing its influence in the region.’ Bilgic sees Ankara’s efforts to mediate the standoff between Ethiopia and Somalia as a ‘diplomatic balancing act motivated by Ankara’s strategic interest in maintaining stability in the Horn of Africa.’ However, the balancing act is becoming difficult as Ethiopia has expressed concerns about Türkiye’s deepening relationship with Somalia, particularly its military support, ‘which it perceives as a potential threat to its own security.’ This has postponed Ankara’s mediation efforts. Bilgic says Türkiye’s more assertive foreign policy has also strained relations with NATO allies and the European Union. He doesn’t find Türkiye’s potential inclusion in BRICS incongruous, despite its NATO membership. This instead ‘reflects Erdoğan’s multifaceted foreign policy approach. This move is not seen as an alternative to NATO or the West but as part of a realist policy where Ankara seeks to engage with all parties. This approach means Turkey does not have eternal friends or enemies, only partners.’ Erdoğan’s ambiguous approach is also evident in how he governs his own country. It’s ostensibly a democracy that holds regular elections. But Freedom House assesses Türkiye to be ‘Not Free’ – saying Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party had become ‘increasingly authoritarian in recent years, consolidating significant power through constitutional changes and by imprisoning opponents and critics.’ Africa has become a terrain of Erdoğan’s struggle against the moderate Islamic Gülen or Hizmet movement The recent death in exile of Fethullah Gülen, spiritual leader of the moderate Islamic Gülen or Hizmet movement, raises another aspect of the ambiguities of Erdoğan’s Türkiye. He and Gülen were once allies but fell out in 2011 when Erdoğan accused the Gülenists of trying to overthrow the government. The Erdoğan government also accused them of instigating the abortive 2016 coup – and branded them a terrorist organisation. Africa has also become a terrain of Erdoğan’s struggle against Hizmet, as the movement runs schools in South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt, say Hizmet sources. Türkiye has pressured African countries to close Hizmet schools or detain its members, they say, and several have done so. This pressure has provoked tensions with some governments, including South Africa. Hizmet believes one of the motives for Erdoğan’s outreach to Africa, including aid and investment, has been to acquire the leverage to pressure countries to stifle Hizmet. Erdoğan has also been able to counter his regional Middle East rivals on African soil, like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which backed Hafter in Libya. And his increasing military support for Somalia helps block the UAE, which backs Somaliland. Erdoğan’s ostensible reasons for expanding Türkiye’s African footprint are no doubt genuine – trade, investment, humanitarian aid and national and regional stability. But it seems Africa is also a stage for him to pursue his ambition for Türkiye to be a global player.

Asia’s Economies Can Embrace Services To Boost Growth And Product...	The Asia-Pacific region prospered by becoming the source of more than half of global factory output, but another transformation to higher-productivity services has the potential to further support growth. Employment and production typically move from agriculture to manufacturing to services, as part of natural progression that comes with rising income. Today, many Asian countries—including China, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand—are highly industrialized. If history is a guide, industry’s share of production will shrink as more activity passes to services. Indeed, the growth of services has already drawn about half of the region’s workers into that sector, up from just 22 percent in 1990, as hundreds of millions moved from farms and factories. This shift is likely to accelerate with further expansion of international trade in modern services such as finance, information, and communication technology, as well as business outsourcing (for example, as already done in India and the Philippines). By contrast, traditional services—for example, tourism or distribution services—have lower productivity and contribute less to economic growth. Policymakers should embrace this shift to modern services because they have higher productivity, as we show in an analytical note accompanying our October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook. Transitioning to a more services-led economy comes with greater economic growth opportunities, provided the right policies are in place. Productivity is an important variable when considering which sectors can best deliver growth in coming years. Manufacturing productivity in Asia is already close to the level of global leaders, so further improvement offers only limited scope to boost productivity and growth. By contrast, services in Asia don’t enjoy the same efficiency advantage, so the region’s economies have more to gain by catching up with countries that have the most efficient services sectors. In addition, in several services sectors like finance and business services, productivity is higher than in manufacturing, which means greater contributions to growth. For example, Asia’s labor productivity in financial services is four times higher than in manufacturing, and it’s twice as high in business services, our new analysis shows. Even so, countries need to have the right conditions in place to benefit from services. Manufacturing benefited from low trade costs and greater global integration, but services sectors are relatively protected in Asia, which can hamper progress. Just like Asia’s higher tariffs on agriculture, which average 12 percent versus 7.5 percent globally, foreign companies that hope to enter the services sector face various restrictions. These include outright bans, approval requirements, local presence, and higher tax rates. Policymakers should also recognize that workers leaving agriculture and manufacturing need the skills to find good jobs in services. With waves of new digital technologies replacing some jobs like clerical support, policies should ensure widespread internet and technology access, and introduce education and training to develop a digitally skilled workforce capable of leveraging artificial intelligence. With growth projected to slow in many Asian countries due to rapid aging, boosting productivity by nurturing productive services is a key to Asia’s future success. —This article is based on an analytical note, 'Asia-Pacific’s Structural Transformation: The Past and Prospects,' included in the October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook.

Navigating A New America: Harris Or Trump, Europeans Need A Colle...	By Célia Belin Every time America changes president, European leaders work hard at establishing a close personal relationship, only to lament when the pendulum swing of politics strikes again. This year’s oscillation feels particularly unnerving. Challenges to Europe’s security will be daunting if Donald Trump makes it back to the White House. Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine in '24 hours', while his vice-president pick, JD Vance, has alluded to a 'peace plan' that appears more tailored to Russia’s views than Europe’s. Trump also said that Russia could do 'whatever the hell they want' to delinquent NATO allies, and some in his camp are pushing for reducing US participation in NATO to nuclear deterrence while pulling out all troops. This is a huge contrast to Kamala Harris, for whom the support to NATO is 'ironclad'. She has promised to continue supporting Ukraine and has repeatedly celebrated the importance of America’s alliances. Europeans will come up with somewhat different strategies to engage the new president depending on who wins. If it’s Harris, Europeans will extend good wishes along with aspirational goals. If it’s Trump, Europeans will focus on offering him quick wins and cross their fingers to get in his good graces. In both cases, Europeans are likely to elbow their way into Washington to try and become the president’s bestie and go-to European ally, including at the expense of fellow Europeans. They may engage in transactional bargaining – buying US weapons in exchange for security guarantees or supporting US policy on China in the hope that the United States reciprocates on Russia – and hope for the best. But this is the wrong approach. It dilutes the collective power of Europe, including that of the European Union, and leaves individual member states exposed to pressure from the US. In the absence of a meaningful pushback, Americans will continue to ask Europeans for forgiveness rather than permission, even if the policies of the new US administration run counter to European interests. As I argued in Foreign Affairs with Giovanna de Maio, Europeans need to come up with a collective plan to engage with the US. There are fundamental interests that all EU member states need to protect, far beyond the issue of the security of Europe. Together they need to be willing to defend and promote these interests, including when dealing with their greatest ally. It is high time that the EU drafts a strategy for engaging with the US, one that stands the test of time and presidential variations. This needs to be a group effort – consensus is key. Such a strategy can be drafted by the collective intelligence of EU institutions, but it needs to be supported by the leaders of EU member states and can extend to include close partners such as the United Kingdom as well as Ukraine and other candidate states. Such a strategy needs to tackle areas of vital importance – Russia, China, and the Middle East, but also trade, defence, climate, and technology. Regardless of who wins in November, Europeans will be facing a more self-interested America in the future. Despite vast differences between Harris and Trump, there are pre-existing trends that will affect US foreign policy. On Ukraine, the next administration will continue to be guided by prudence and fear of escalation. The conflict threatens European interests much more than American: as Washington looks for a negotiated solution, it may fail to consider the enormity of the consequences of a bad deal for Europe’s security. The US will also remain obsessed with winning its all-out technology and industrial competition with China and may force measures on Europe that will directly affect its prosperity. In the Middle East, unconditional US support for Israel does not lead to stabilising an increasingly explosive region. And, as the US leads the world in crude oil production, the need to finance the energy transition of the rest of the world is not its greatest focus. America’s priorities are shifting, and they will overlap with the EU’s less and less. Europeans must reckon with this fact and adapt their entire approach to this new, somewhat overwhelming reality. America’s shifting priorities also have direct consequences on the type of responsibility that Europeans must bear in the security realm. EU member states cannot afford to continue to delay the type of defence investments that are needed to pick up a bigger share of the security effort, both in Europe and beyond. It requires an ambitious plan to produce crucial capabilities that are now provided by the US. The EU needs to work on improving its synergy with NATO. And individual member states must continue to work to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, and other neighbours. Taking responsibility for its security while fiercely defending its interests will demonstrate the EU’s maturity and strength. It will allow the bloc to speak with one voice when leaders go to Washington, and to defend core interests in transatlantic forums such as the Trade and Technology Council or EU-US summits. It will also signal Europeans’ readiness to engage with the US, regardless of politics. Down the line, it can only lead to a healthier transatlantic relationship.

Promises And Perils Of The Future Made In Australia Act – Analysi...	By Marina Yue Zhang, Roy Green, and Mark Dodgson Australia’s industrial policy is undergoing a significant transformation with the introduction of the Future Made in Australia Act (FMiA). This policy aims to reposition the country as a key player in global supply chains, particularly in critical minerals, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. It marks a departure from neoliberalism towards a mission-oriented approach, reflecting broader global trends over the past decade. Historically, industrial policies have been instrumental in supporting economies — such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and more recently China — catch up with the developed world. These nations have successfully targeted specific sectors with state-directed investments in technologies and capabilities, complemented by government-led export strategies. Major industrial nations, including the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, are adopting similar interventionist industrial policies in response to geopolitical competition. The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) embodies this shift, offering substantial subsidies and investments aimed at reshoring manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly China. The European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act seeks to secure access to essential minerals for the green transition, while the United Kingdom is implementing policies to enhance its industrial competitiveness post-Brexit. These policy shifts reflect a collective aim to mitigate vulnerabilities highlighted by supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. They represent a break from the so-called Washington Consensus, which advocated for economic growth through reduced government intervention and trade liberalisation. Unlike these other industrialised nations, Australia’s FMiA does not incorporate significant tariff increases or protectionist measures. At the heart of the FMiA is an ambition to reduce Australia’s dependence on commodity exports and transition toward high-value-adding industries that are globally competitive and sustainable. The policy emphasises subsidising local manufacturing capabilities, particularly for the green energy transition. But scepticism surrounds the FMiA’s efficacy. Critics warn that while its intentions may be commendable, mission-oriented industrial policies may lead to unintended consequences, especially if they favour specific sectors at the expense of others. Investing in areas where Australia lacks comparative advantage might expose the country to external economic pressures and competition from countries with more cost-effective suppliers. This policy ultimately suggests a discontinuity with Australia’s liberal economic past, particularly the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s that opened up the economy and allowed its comparative advantage in commodities exports to flourish. One significant risk Australia faces is becoming ensnared in a global arms race of industrial subsidies. As the United States and China funnel billions into strategic sectors, smaller economies like Australia may feel pressured to keep pace. This could create a cycle of escalating subsidies that strain public finances, incurring considerable opportunity costs. A key difference between Australia and other developed countries lies in market size. The United States and European Union can sustain ambitious industrial strategies which can thrive on their extensive downstream markets. In contrast, Australia’s limited domestic market makes it heavily reliant on exports. As an upstream supplier of mineral products, Australia faces significant constraints in maintaining its export markets due to its reliance on high-value processing technologies and facilities, predominantly controlled by Chinese interests, before accessing downstream markets, where China controls a substantial share. This unique position in the global value chain limits Australia’s negotiating power and exposes it to geopolitical risks, particularly amid the ongoing rivalry between the United States and China. Aligning more closely with the United States may seem advantageous, but this strategy does not inherently enhance Australia’s competitive edge in mineral processing. US initiatives, such as the IRA, often stipulate that producers cannot exceed a certain level of Chinese equity to qualify for incentives. This underscores the complexities of navigating foreign direct investment in a politically charged environment. Australia’s aspiration to develop downstream processing capabilities is hampered by high labour costs and ongoing reliance on global supply chains. This could further entrench dependency on foreign technologies. Australia’s industrial policy has long promoted research and development through tax rebates and subsidies. During the resource boom, this led to innovation in mining extraction technologies that yield high returns. But Australia remains dependent on imports of heavy machinery and equipment, let alone mineral processing technologies. Compounding this issue, emerging competitors, particularly the BRICS+6 nations, are actively developing their own supply chains, leveraging both their mineral resources and China’s advanced processing capabilities and investments in infrastructure. The FMiA in its current form also risks increasing regional disparities, as resource-rich states and established firms may benefit disproportionately from subsidies, exacerbating inequality across Australia. This could create a scenario where certain regions thrive while others lag behind, particularly areas with fewer natural resources or less-developed firms. Australia must craft a more inclusive and balanced industrial policy that integrates both vertical (sector-specific) and horizontal (economy-wide) programs. The FMiA adopts a vertical approach by targeting sectors critical to national interests, especially in alignment with the interests of Australia’s allies. This focus is particularly important in addressing economic security and environmental considerations that the market may not effectively resolve. But it is essential to implement horizontal programs that foster a conducive business environment across all states and sectors. This includes improving infrastructure, enhancing workforce skills and promoting innovation. Investing in education and training, along with enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics and cloud computing, could help equip the workforce with the necessary skills and empower small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs to benefit from these initiatives. Above all, developing innovative strategic partnerships will be essential for sustainable growth and prosperity. Collaborative efforts with global stakeholders can enhance Australia’s competitiveness and adaptability in a rapidly changing global landscape. Australia must strike a balance between state intervention and market forces, particularly in addressing the energy transition. Relying solely on the government to determine which sectors should be the ‘moonshots’ is risky and may lead to unintended consequences.

Development Prospects Of The BRICS Mechanism’s Attraction For Reg...	By Zhou Chao The new BRICS Summit was held in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24, 2024. This was the first summit since the historic expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism the previous year. The first BRIC summit took place in 2009, joined by Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The following year, South Africa participated and officially hence the BRICS group was established. At the Johannesburg summit in 2023, the group expanded again, inviting Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to join its cooperation mechanism. After this expansion, the BRICS countries accounted for nearly half of the global population, over 30% of global GDP, and one-fifth of global trade, with an economic total, based on purchasing power parity, surpassing that of the G7. The theme of the summit this year was 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development And Security'. The main agenda included cooperation on the new industrial revolution, global governance reform, and the implementation of global civilization initiatives. Key topics were the reform of international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to enhance the voice and representation of developing countries and emerging markets. Additionally, the summit discussed the establishment of a BRICS-led payment system proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to compete with the Western SWIFT system, as well as the ongoing escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. The summit concluded with the adoption of the Kazan Declaration, which emphasized strengthening cooperation after the BRICS expansion under three pillars: political security, economic finance, and cultural collaboration. It encouraged the enhancement of the BRICS network of correspondent banks and the implementation of local currency settlements through the non-binding BRICS Cross-Border Payment Initiative (BCBPI). The declaration also agreed to discuss and explore the feasibility of establishing an independent cross-border settlement and custody infrastructure, known as the BRICS Clearing System (BRICS Clear), to complement existing financial market infrastructures, with voluntary participation from all parties. The BRICS cooperation mechanism is currently the most important platform for solidarity and cooperation among emerging market countries and developing nations. It serves as a pillar for promoting a multipolar world characterized by equality and order, as well as inclusive economic globalization. Additionally, it is one of the key platforms through which China projects its influence to emerging markets and Southern countries, which carries significant expectations for China. This year’s BRICS summit was held in Russia, a country that has faced over two years of sanctions and isolation from the West due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Given that this was the first summit after the expansion of the BRICS mechanism, some Chinese commentators have high hopes for the summit, believing it will help further amplify the voice of the Global South, expand cooperation among emerging countries, and enhance their own influence and membership. It is evident that within the BRICS mechanism, both formal members and partner countries are primarily major regional powers with considerable influence. The inclusion of these countries will undoubtedly enhance the global impact of the BRICS mechanism. However, regarding the BRICS mechanism itself, its attractiveness to global regional powers appears to have reached a limit, making the potential for further strengthening quite finite. First, there are deep-seated issues both within the core member countries of the BRICS mechanism, as well as among the members themselves. In the case of Russia, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict has fundamentally revealed the limitations of Russia as a 'great power'. The struggles of the Russian military on the battlefield, along with the bleak prospects for its economy under ongoing sanctions, indicate that Russia's ability to provide regional and global security and economic public goods in the future will be significantly constrained. Moreover, the series of failures in Russia's economic transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union suggests that even if the West were to completely lift economic sanctions against Russia, the overall outlook for its economic development would still not be promising. In the case of China, since the lifting of its COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the country's socioeconomic growth rate has gradually slowed, with consumer spending weakening and the real estate sector, along with local governments' massive debts, significantly dragging down economic growth. Despite multiple rounds of stimulus from the Chinese government aimed at boosting consumer spending and economic growth, there have been no significant results. Additionally, Western capital is progressively withdrawing from Mainland China and Hong Kong, while the U.S.-led technological and economic pressures on China continue. While China's fundamental economic situation is certainly much better than Russia's, the sustainability of its ability to provide economic public goods to regional powers is also in question. Between BRICS member countries, the profound contradictions between India and China will remain a long-term challenge. Before the BRICS summit, the Indian government clearly stated that it had reached a new border patrol agreement with China, but the specific implementation process will still require time. Moreover, considering India's strategic positioning and geopolitical interests, there remain anti-China geopolitical tensions in regions such as the South Asian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. Coupled with the significant investments made by the West to court India, India's confrontational stance toward China is unlikely to undergo any substantial change due to a thaw in border issues. Additionally, India's attitude toward Russia will continue to be characterized by pure pragmatism. As a result, there is no real cohesion among the core countries of the BRICS mechanism; instead, there are deep-rooted contradictions, making it difficult for this mechanism to effectively attract and integrate other regional powers. Second, the core countries of the BRICS mechanism have not truly outperformed Western countries in mediating regional conflicts. Last year, through China's careful mediation, Iran and Saudi Arabia reached a declaration in Beijing to normalize their relations, marking a significant step toward easing tensions in the Middle East. Following this, Iran promised to pressure the Houthis to cease their armed attacks on Saudi territory. In turn, Saudi Arabia seized the opportunity to improve its relations with Iran and intensified efforts to address the influence of Iran on various countries and armed groups in the region. Saudi Arabia resumed ceasefire negotiations with the Houthis and subsequently normalized relations with Syria, expressing support for Syria's return to the Arab League in 2023. Saudi Arabia also reopened its embassy in Lebanon and renewed contact with Iraq, signing a series of cooperation agreements in the fields of energy, investment, and infrastructure. However, the effects of these efforts quickly proved to be extremely limited. The Houthis began to delay the signing of agreements with Saudi Arabia, and the peace process in Yemen has been frozen for some time. Damascus failed to effectively curb the large amounts of drugs smuggled into the Gulf region, leaving the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Syria largely superficial. Lebanese political elites once again rejected Saudi proposals for systematic reforms and the revival of the state-building process. After the new Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia’ al-Sudani took office, Saudi Arabia perceived him as too close to Iran, resulting in a significant slowdown in cooperation with Iraq. In terms of relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has expanded its engagement but has invited Iranian representatives to virtually none of the meetings it has organized regarding the Gaza situation since the special summit concluded. Additionally, while Saudi Arabia has sought to reduce hostility between Western nations and Iran, it has also collaborated with the U.S., Jordan, the UK, and France to intercept over 300 drones and ballistic missiles fired by Iran at Israel in retaliation for attacks on its embassy in Syria. Despite some improvement in Saudi-Iranian relations, a deep competitive dynamic persists as both countries strive for dominance in the Middle Eastern world. Neither Saudi Arabia, as a participant in the BRICS mechanism, nor China, as a key member of the BRICS group, has managed to consistently advance the de-escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran or alleviate regional conflicts. In the perception of the Saudi elite, the view that 'the U.S. is unreliable but indispensable to us' has become a basic consensus. Therefore, Saudi Arabia is determined to maintain and even strengthen its security cooperation with the U.S., hoping to enhance its long-term self-defense capabilities through this relationship. Saudi Arabia is not only continuing to bolster its military procurement from the U.S. but is also willing to participate in the normalization process of relations with Israel under U.S. mediation. It can be argued that for many regional powers around the world, the geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China certainly provides these countries with greater 'united front value' and room for maneuver. However, this does not mean that their distances from the major world powers will align uniformly. For many regional powers, Western countries, especially the U.S., with their stronger economic and financial influence, often represent a more ideal partner for cooperation. For instance, countries like Saudi Arabia, a member of the BRICS mechanism, tend to gravitate slightly closer to the U.S. even while pursuing a policy of balanced diplomacy. Moreover, it is important to note that with Iran's accession to BRICS, the organization may no longer be viewed purely as an economic cooperation entity by other regional powers. Instead, it appears to have increasingly taken on an 'anti-U.S.' and 'anti-Western' character. Even in matters of economic cooperation, the concepts of a BRICS payment system and a common currency, heavily promoted by Russia and Brazil, clearly emphasize 'de-dollarization'. In this context, joining BRICS can easily be interpreted by the U.S. and other Western countries as a 'realignment', bringing with it significant political, economic, and security risks. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, both new and old BRICS members have faced economic difficulties in recent years, leading other regional powers to worry about being exploited after joining, which would be entirely contrary to their expectations. All in all, for regional powers, joining BRICS is aimed at enhancing their bargaining power with the West, rather than bearing responsibilities for others. It is noteworthy that recently, major regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan have expressed no desire to become BRICS members, and Argentina too made a similar statement earlier. Final Analysis Conclusion: The BRICS cooperation mechanism is an important platform that China has focused on developing to enhance its international influence and unite Southern countries. Over the past decade, it has played a significant role, and its contributions cannot be overlooked. However, due to a series of changing circumstances, it appears that the BRICS group has reached the peak of its attractiveness to regional powers, making it difficult to achieve substantial breakthroughs going forward. Therefore, for countries like China, a cautious attitude should be adopted regarding its future global influence.

‘Victory Plan’ Or Deadly Delusion? Zelensky’s Perilous Five-Point...	By Carus Michaelangelo It’s finally here: Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky’s 'Victory Plan,' furtively touted for weeks as Zelensky sought, unsuccessfully, to peddle it to world leaders. Until now, all that Zelensky would say in public was that this clandestine plan paradoxically would not require negotiation with Putin, but also provides a way to strengthen Ukraine in order to 'push Putin' to diplomatically end the war. Tone deaf in the extreme, several weeks ago Zelensky brazenly flew on a US Air Force C-17 transport plane into the key battleground state of Pennsylvania to visit a munitions plant before hectoring the United Nations General Assembly on this special plan. Election interference be damned! Blessed with Zelensky’s grand reveal of his vaunted five-point plan to the Ukrainian parliament on October 16, the tragic farce of the 'Victory Plan' sharpens into focus. Still shielding 'three secret' addenda from the general public, Zelensky’s top goal is as unsurprising as it is meretricious: an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Zelensky hopes that NATO nations will grant Ukraine’s application for admission, which it submitted over two years ago. Ukraine’s Victory plan is little more than a Hail Mary. Why would NATO nations suddenly wish to jump headlong into the fray now, as Ukraine’s already-dim prospects admittedly vanish, which cannot be papered over even by friendly commentators? The patent absurdity of the Victory Plan does not stop there. Zelensky’s other four points involve: (1) unrestricted Western support for unrestricted warfare; (2) 'non-nuclear deterrence' to 'safeguard the country against future' Russian 'aggression'; (3) 'economic growth and cooperation,' which includes further Russian sanctions plus joint investment opportunities; and (4) a 'post-war security architecture,' in which Ukraine’s 'large and experienced military force' can help secure Europe. Zelensky seeks to unleash the Ukrainian military, hitherto shackled by arbitrary US restraints on long-range strikes into Russia. This invitation to nuclear war is bad enough, but he also seeks funds, arms, and intelligence from the West beyond the already-prodigious aid and comfort shuttled off these past two years. Additionally, this plank demands for Ukraine 'additional supplies of long-range capabilities,' asks for the West to take out Russian missiles and drones, and suggests further ground invasions of Russia to create 'buffer zones.' As Russia expands and lowers the bar for using nuclear weapons, Zelensky means to thrash about Russia like an elephant in a Matryoshka shop. Zelensky may feel as though Ukraine has nothing to lose—wrongly, since Russia’s prospect of wiping Ukraine off the map only increases as the war prolongs—but the West has everything to lose. If it stands, President Biden’s justified reticence to authorize long-range strikes into Russia could be the most consequential decision of his presidency. But the media has foamed at the mouth at this cold shoulder—notwithstanding new aid to Ukraine, repeatedly—so do not hold your breath. At first glance, Zelensky’s call for 'economic growth and cooperation' seems almost comical. In these dire straits, marred by death and destruction, what does Ukraine have to offer the West? The devil is in the details. Zelensky’s plan likely seeks to entice lawmakers like US Senator Lindsay Graham, who seek access to Ukraine’s stocks of resources like lithium, a critical mineral used in electric vehicle batteries. Yes, for some supporting Ukraine may be based on as loathsome a reason as securing cronyist exploitation of Ukraine’s natural resources. If you thought the Bush administration would be the last America saw of such contemptuous profiteering, think again. One is tempted to laugh were the situation not so enraging. In his October 16 address, Zelensky noted the grave consequences that would befall the world if we allowed the impression 'that wars of aggression can be profitable,' with new aggressions likely to pop up in 'the Gulf region, the Indo-Pacific region, and Africa.' All those things may well occur, but largely this will be thanks to US meddling, rather than the 'isolationist' phantom. Unfortunately, however, the establishment piper plays only one tune: 'Appeasement! Munich!' Apparently unironically, Zelensky also states that North Korea’s supplying of Russian with munitions and soldiers 'is effectively participation of a second state in the war against Ukraine on Russia’s side.' Surely he realizes that the US and many countries in the West were already belligerents in the war? Though the foolish depths of the Victory Plan seem limitless, Zelensky offers one silver lining. At least, for those who survive the possible nuclear apocalypse unleashed by his pyrrhic Victory Plan. Under his plan, Ukraine’s soldiers can replace US soldiers in select locations in Europe. Sign me up! Avoiding war was once the mark of the great statesmen; making peace, equally so. It will be a difficult peace for Ukraine to make. Admitting defeat is rare—for good reason. Many Ukrainians are coming to their senses, but not the most important Ukrainian. For the sake of Ukraine, and the world, one hopes Zelensky rouses from his war-fevered slumber. Hope springs eternal; but alas, so does vanity. About the author: Michaelangelo Carus lives in Virginia and has a graduate degree in history.

Bank Of Italy Governor Urges ECB To Cut Rates Further	By Alessia Peretti (EurActiv) -- Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta urged the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday to consider further rate cuts, saying the current restrictive monetary policy risks hampering economic growth. Panetta made his call at the World Savings Day event in Milan, sending a clear message to ECB President Christine Lagarde. The ECB’s aggressive monetary tightening following the energy shock has managed to curb inflation swiftly, but 'monetary conditions remain restrictive, requiring further cuts,' he said. Panetta warned that attention should now turn to the sluggish real economy. Without a sustained recovery, he warned, 'we risk pushing inflation well below our 2% target', a situation that would be difficult for monetary policy to address and should be avoided. 'The European economy remains weak, burdened by persistently high real interest rates and the withdrawal of past fiscal stimuli. The Italian economy is feeling the strain,' he said. In highlighting Italy's low growth drivers, Panetta also pointed to limited innovation capacity, underinvestment and a fragmented industrial base focused on traditional sectors - problems exacerbated by high public debt and interest payments. The ECB has enacted three rate cuts of 25 basis points each so far, with the latest reduction announced on 17 October. A strong voice on the ECB board, Panetta has consistently advocated for rate cuts, first raising the issue in his first speech as the bank’s governor in November 2023. ECB rate policies have repeatedly come under fire from Italian officials. Most recently, in September, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani criticised the ECB's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%, saying it was 'too timid' and that 'the ECB should do more.' 'I believe the founding treaty should be revised because it limits the ECB's role to controlling inflation, whereas it should also support growth and the real economy,' Tajani said at the time. Italian Business and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso also joined the criticism, describing the cut as 'insufficient' and calling for 'an immediate change of direction.' Responding to the political pressure, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is 'an independent institution, as stated clearly in the EU Treaty, and we do not respond to political pressures'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3G0w25waxoWd	2024-11-01T16:42:23-07:00	
What William Graham Sumner Would Say About Trump And Vance’s Tari...	By Kody Jensen William Graham Sumner (1840–1910) was a professor, sociologist, clergyman, and advocate of laissez faire, the gold standard, and free trade. His book What Social Classes Owe to Each Other was influential in the thinking of Leonard Read, according to Mary Senholz’s biography of the FEE founder. Whilst Sumner was a supporter of free trade, in more recent times Donald Trump has built his political reputation on being its adversary. How would William Graham Sumner respond to claims made by Trump and his running mate JD Vance about free trade in the recent debates? Let’s go to his writings to find a potential answer. The Great Free Trade Debate DT: 'First of all, I have no sales tax. That’s an incorrect statement. [Trump is responding to Harris characterizing his tariff plan as a sales tax.] We’re doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world. I took in billions and billions of dollars from China.' Sumner observes that protectionists have always shied away from referring to tariffs as taxes. Consider these comments from his 1888 book Protectionism: the -ism which teaches that waste makes wealth: There are some who say that 'a tariff is not a tax,' or as one of them said before a Congressional Committee: 'We do not like to call it so!' That certainly is the most humorous of all the funny things in the tariff controversy. If a tariff is not a tax, what is it? In what category does it belong? No protectionist has ever yet told. They seem to think of it as a thing by itself, a Power, a Force, a sort of Mumbo Jumbo whose special function it is to produce national prosperity. They do not appear to have analyzed it, or given themselves an account of it, sufficiently to know what kind of a thing it is or how it acts. Any one who says that it is not a tax must suppose that it costs nothing, that it produces an effect without an expenditure of energy. They do seem to think that if Congress will say: 'Let a tax of —— per cent be laid on article A,' and if none is imported, and therefore no tax is paid at the custom house, national industry will be benefited and wealth secured, and that there will be no cost or outgo. If that is so, then the tariff is magic. We have found the philosopher’s stone. Furthermore: A protective tax is one which is laid to act as a bar to importation, in order to keep a foreign commodity out. It does not act protectively unless it does act as a bar, and is not a tax on imports but an obstruction to imports. Hence a protective duty is a wall to inclose the domestic producer and consumer, and to prevent the latter from having access to any other source of supply for his needs, in exchange for his products, than that one which the domestic producer controls. The purpose and plan of the device is to enable the domestic producer to levy on the domestic consumer the taxes which the government has set up as a barrier, but has not collected at the port of entry. Under this device the government says: 'I do not want the revenue, but I will lay the tax so that you, the selected and favored producer, may collect it.' 'I do not need to tax the consumer for myself, but I will hold him for you while you tax him.' DT: 'They aren’t gonna have higher prices; what’s gonna have and who’s gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years' [when asked if consumers can afford higher prices caused by tariffs]. WGS: 'To this it is obvious to reply: what good can they then do toward the end proposed?' If the tariffs do not raise prices, how do they encourage the protected industries? No doubt it would be a neat trick if the President could force foreigners to pay more for US products while not raising prices for US consumers. However, I cannot comprehend how taxes on US imports will achieve this. JDV: 'Think about this. If you’re trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you’re going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you’re not accessing our markets unless you’re paying middle-class Americans a fair wage.' WGS: The protectionist says that he does not want the American laborer to compete with the foreign 'pauper laborer.' He assumes, that if the foreign laborer is a woolen operative, the only American who may have to compete with him is a woolen operative here. His device for saving our operatives from the assumed competition is to tax the American cotton or wheat grower on the cloth he wears, to make up and offset to the woolen operative the disadvantage under which he labors. If then, the case were true as the protectionist states it, and if his remedy were correct, he would, when he had finished his operation, simply have allowed the American woolen operative to escape, by transferring to the American cotton or wheat grower the evil results of competition with 'foreign pauper labor.' Can a tariff raise the general wage level? Sumner comments in this regard: Wages are capital. If I promise to pay wages I must find capital somewhere with which to fulfill my contract. If the tariff makes me pay more than I otherwise would, where does the surplus come from? Disregarding money as only an intermediate term, a man’s wages are his means of subsistence—food, clothing, house rent, fuel, lights, furniture, etc. If the tariff system makes him get more of these for ten hours’ work in a shop than he would get without tariff, where does the 'more' come from? Nothing but labor and capital can produce food, clothing, etc. Either the tax must make these out of nothing, or it can only get them by taking them from those who have made them, that is by subtracting them from the wages of somebody else. Taking all the wages class into account, then the tax cannot possibly increase, but is sure by waste and loss to decrease wages. One point both Trump and Vance raised was that apparently even Joe Biden agreed with protectionist ideas, as he did not remove most of the tariffs imposed by the previous administration. I do not know what answer Sumner could give to this ubiquity of bad economics, other than to glumly shake his head. About the author: Kody Jensen is a millennial who enjoys economics and chess.

Three Additional Points On The NY Times’ Piece On Blah Voters – O...	The New York Times’ lead homepage article Thursday told readers that in spite of a batch of really good economic data, 'voters still feel blah.' There are several points that are worth adding to the discussion in the piece. Prices Are Still High The first point is that the piece starts with an often-repeated complaint that, even though inflation has slowed roughly back to its pre-pandemic pace, prices are still high. This is an absurd complaint in the sense that nothing can be done about prices being high, as every economics reporter knows. Wages have risen by more than 23 percent since the start of the pandemic. Prices cannot return to anything like their pre-pandemic level with the current level of wages. We could have a horrible depression, which could eventually force wages down, but it is unlikely that many of the complaining consumers really want to see 20 percent unemployment. The profit share of income has risen by roughly 2.0 percentage points. The reversal of this increase could allow for some price reductions without wages falling, but it is more likely that we would see a slower pace of price rises even as wage growth continues at its current rate, rather than an actual drop in prices. In short, the complaint that prices are still high is comparable to people complaining that it’s cold in winter or dark at night. People might be bothered by the cold weather or the darkness, but there is nothing that can realistically be done about it. Unfortunately, because the media have repeated the complaint endlessly, they have legitimated it and made it part of the national political debate. This is a serious failing of economic reporting. Most Workers’ Pay Has Kept Pace with Inflation At one point the piece tells readers: 'Wages have climbed faster than prices for many consumers, but that is not true across the board.' That might leave the impression that wage growth in excess of inflation is the exception. In fact, most workers — especially lower paid workers — have seen wage growth that outpaces inflation. Wages for workers in the bottom decile of the wage distribution saw their wages outpace inflation by more than 12.0 percent from the start of the pandemic to the end of 2023. (The gap would be even larger with more recent data.) This is the fastest wage growth for these workers in half a century. China’s Growth is Considerably More Rapid Than Growth in the US At one point the piece notes that consumers are spending at a rapid pace, in spite of saying they think the economy is bad, and the US is doing better than other countries: 'Even if consumers say they feel bad in surveys, they have shown a willingness to keep spending, and US growth is much stronger than what countries like Germany or China are experiencing.' While the US economy has done significantly better since the pandemic than other wealthy countries, its growth actually lags China’s growth. While US GDP growth will probably come in at just under 3.0 percent in 2024, China is likely have growth of close to 5.0 percent. While China remains considerably poorer than the United States on a per person basis, it is not widely recognized that its economy is already considerably larger than ours. This gap is increasing through time.

Government Agents Try To Stir Up Fear Of Russian Election Interfe...	For a third United States presidential election in a row, US agents are out warning of Russian election interference. In the previous two elections the warnings were spurious. Still, the government agents succeeded in raising worry in people’s minds regarding candidate Donald Trump. And they suppressed consideration of information damaging to Trump’s opponents, including through indicating the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop were 'Russian disinformation.' This election, the government agents are at it again. Their latest spurt of relating supposed Russian election interference arrived in a Friday joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This joint statement is one among a series of updates concerning what the press release calls 'Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.' Yeah, whatever, guys. Have you ever read the story about the boy who cried wolf?

How Would Harris And Trump Differ On Asia? – Analysis	By Alex Willemyns As the result of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election teeters on knife’s edge in a handful of evenly split swing states, the rest of the world is bracing itself for two starkly different potential futures. One prospect is the return of former President Donald Trump’s turbulent 'America First' foreign policy, which last time around downplayed any U.S. obligations as a world leader to prioritize transactional bilateral ties with countries like China, Russia and even North Korea. On the other side of the ledger is the continuation, under Vice President Kamala Harris, of the last four years of President Joe Biden’s comparatively boring – if more predictable – style of alliance building and 'steady' diplomacy in the face of multiple world crises. While foreign policy is unlikely to sway many Americans’ choices at the ballot box – with domestic issues like the economy and the makeup of the Supreme Court outranking foreign policy in the eyes of voters – their choices will have the power to reshape global geopolitics. As one columnist put it, the future of the world 'may depend on what a few thousand Pennsylvania voters think about their grocery bills.' So how would a Harris or Trump administration differ on Asia? US alliances Led by Kurt Campbell, who is currently the U.S. deputy secretary of state, the Biden administration has spent the past four years attempting to 'manage' America’s rivalry with China by focusing on diplomacy with Beijing while building tight-knit alliances against it. That includes the 'AUKUS' pact with Australia and the United Kingdom, the 'Quad' arrangement with Australia, Japan and India and the U.S.-Japanese-South Korean 'trilateral,' even as U.S. diplomats have stopped short of supporting an 'Asian NATO aimed at China.' Harris has so far indicated she would take a similar approach, with Biden’s CIA director, Bill Burns, and one of the president’s top foreign policy 'confidantes,' Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, among the favorites to replace Antony Blinken as U.S. secretary of state. She has even used high-profile speeches to make the point. 'I will stand with our friends, because I know that our alliances keep American people safe and make America stronger and more secure,' Harris said in her 'closing argument' speech on Washington’s National Mall on Tuesday, exactly a week before the Nov. 5 election day. 'World leaders think that Donald Trump is an easy mark,' the vice president added, calling Trump 'easy to manipulate with flattery and favor' and claiming that 'autocrats' like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong 'are rooting for him' to win. Trump, by contrast, has spent less time detailing an orderly approach to foreign policy to instead argue that world leaders respect him more than Biden or Harris and that a personal touch will be what matters. Asked why Chinese President Xi Jinping would not invade Taiwan, for instance, the former president recently told The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board that Xi would be too afraid to carry out any invasion 'because he respects me and he knows I’m f***ing crazy.' Taiwan Harris has repeatedly reaffirmed the 'status quo' approach to Taiwan, a U.S. ally and self-governing democratic island that Beijing has called a 'renegade' province that must one day be 'reunited' with the mainland. That decades-old position holds that China and Taiwan must negotiate their future peacefully – an increasingly unlikely scenario as the years go on – and that neither should attack each other in the meantime. 'Let me restate the point I’ve made many times,' Harris said on Oct. 16, after Chinese military drills near the island. 'I believe in the ‘One China’ policy, and I believe … Taiwan has a right to defend itself.' Trump, meanwhile, has offered contrasting hints about Taiwan. While the former president has indicated he would discourage Xi against plans to invade the island, he has also attacked Taiwan’s leaders. In a three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan on Oct. 25, Trump repeatedly raised the island, at first drawing a link between Taiwan and Ukraine and noting that neither was invaded while he was president. 'It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, ‘Don’t do it,’' Trump said, referring to his conversations with both Xi and Putin. However, in the closing portion of the interview, Trump attacked Taiwan’s so-called 'Silicon Shield,' a term used to refer to the island’s near monopolyon advanced semiconductor-chip production, which has led to an intense U.S. interest in not letting the island be invaded. 'You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. Okay? They want us to protect [them] and they want protection. They don’t pay us money for the protection. You know, the mob makes you pay money, right?' he said, advocating for tariffs on all chips being imported into America. The comments were seized upon by Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, who gleefully told reporters it highlighted the untrustworthiness of America’s pledges to defend Taiwan. 'I believe most of our Taiwan compatriots have already made a rational judgment and know very clearly that what the United States pursues is always ‘America First,’' Zhu said at a press conference Wednesday. 'Taiwan at any time may turn from a pawn to a discarded child.' China and tariffs One of the few times Harris and Trump went head-to-head on non-domestic issues during their debate on ABC News on Sept. 10 was in their opening spar over their proposals for tariffs on Chinese imports, due to the likely impacts on the American economy. Trump has proposed tariffs of up to 60% on all imports from China, which Harris said would lead to surging inflation as Chinese exporters pass on the costs, tanking the American economy’s recovery. By contrast, Harris has called for fewer and more targeted tariffs. However, Trump disputed any such analysis about inflation – including from sixteen Nobel Prize winning economists – to instead claim that Chinese exporters would absorb the added costs while paying 'hundreds of billions of dollars' that could be used to cut taxes. 'They’re not going to have higher prices,' Trump said of consumers buying Chinese goods. 'Who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years.' Harris has voiced support instead for sticking with the Biden administration’s comparatively more targeted tariffs on China, which are focused instead on supporting U.S. industry in competing with China’s low-cost exports of solar panels and electric vehicles. Beijing has repeatedly slammed both the proposals as protectionist and called for the United States to return to policies of free trade. Nevertheless, trade with China may be one of the policy areas where Harris and Trump are aligned the closest in principle. That is because American voters have come to see trade through the lens of 'where we’re positioned geopolitically,' and not through its impacts on the costs of everyday goods, according to Laura Silver, an associate director of global attitudes at pollster Pew Research. 'They don’t necessarily see trade as lowering prices and benefiting them economically,' Silver said at a forum on the election hosted by the East-West Center. 'China, in particular, is seen as a competitor, and so when it comes to trade with China, we are seen as losing.' 'This is a really salient thing in an election time,' she added. North Korea Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, has said that North Korea’s recent deployment of troops to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine could be a defining moment for the next president, with the budding alliance threatening regional and global security. The prospect of Russia in turn supporting North Korea’s nuclear program 'imperils South Korea, Japan and deployed U.S. forces in the region,' Bolton said in an op-ed for The Hill on Wednesday, warning of an anti-U.S. 'axis' forming with China and Iran also involved. Bolton also predicted that Trump might once again seek to befriend Kim while tossing aside U.S. assurances to Seoul and Tokyo. While visiting Seoul as vice president in September 2022, Harris reiterated America’s 'ironclad' support for its alliance with South Korea and Japan against North Korea. On the campaign trail, she has also pointedly vowed not to 'cozy up' to world dictators like Kim. For his part, Trump has done little to defuse the claims from Harris and Bolton that he is a potential target of 'flattery and favor' from dictators like Kim, arguing in support of his personal touch in tense moments. 'I was with Kim Jong Un. I got along great with him,' Trump said on the Joe Rogan podcast, also recalling his 'great relationship' with China’s Xi. 'That’s a good thing. It’s not a bad thing. It’s a great thing.' During the podcast, Trump recalled how he had goaded North Korea’s autocratic leader into believing the U.S. military was ready 'to go to war' with him before parlaying nuclear threats into a friendship. 'He said, ‘I have a red button on my desk.’ I said, ‘I have a red button also, but mine’s bigger than yours and mine works,’' Trump told Rogan. 'I said, ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beaches.’' 'If you have a smart – really, the right president, the smart president – you’re not going to have a problem' with North Korea, he said. Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that the main takeaway was that Trump would place a great priority on personal relationships while Harris would likely maintain the Biden administration’s efforts at alliance building. 'That means an emphasis on the value of alliances and partnerships and working closely with them,' Chong told Radio Free Asia. 'Trump has indicated far more skepticism toward alliances and partnerships since his previous term in office, with key exceptions such as Israel.' 'Trump seems largely consistent in his rhetoric,' he said, 'which means a likely reconfiguration of U.S. alliances and partnerships.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3GXalCZp1-m4	2024-11-01T16:37:02-07:00	
Israel’s Attack On Iran Has Left Tehran Offensively And Defensive...	By Kian Sharifi (RFE/RL) -- Iran was quick to downplay the impact of Israel's attack on key military sites on its territory on October 26. But satellite images suggest Israel has degraded Tehran's air-defense and missile-production capabilities, analysts say. Fabian Hinz of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said Israel had dealt a 'significant blow' to Iran's ability to produce long-range ballistic missiles. Ability To Sustain Long-Range Attacks On October 1, Iran launched its biggest-ever direct attack on Israel, firing nearly 200 ballistic missiles at its archenemy. Dozens of the missiles, aimed mostly at military sites, penetrated Israel's formidable air defenses. Israel's retaliatory strikes on October 26 were aimed at hindering Iran's production of solid-propellant ballistic missiles that were used by Tehran in its assault, the 'weapons that are of most concern to Israel,' Hinz said. Solid-propellant missiles require fewer personnel and little time to prepare for launch compared to liquid-propellant missiles, Hinz explains, making them ideal for launching volleys in quick succession. Israel struck missile-production sites around Tehran, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East defense specialist at the global intelligence company Janes, says the full extent of the damage caused to the facilities is still unclear. But he adds that Israel likely wanted to prevent Iran from being able to sustain long-range missile exchanges, especially given the numbers it needs to penetrate Israel's formidable air defenses. 'The Israelis probably don't know precisely how many ballistic missiles [Iran] has with the requisite range, but have tried to reduce its ability to replenish is stockpile,' Binnie said. Blinded Offensively And Defensively? Israel's attack was also aimed at weakening Iran's ability to fend off aerial attacks by targeting its radars and Russian-made S-300 air-defense systems. There have been unconfirmed reports quoting U.S. and Israeli officials claiming that three S-300 systems were taken out in the Israeli attack. 'The S-300s are Iran's most capable air-defense capabilities, so targeting them again emphasizes Iran's inability to defend itself and gives the Israeli Air Force more freedom of operation in the future,' Binnie said. Satellite images also showed that at least two radar systems -- one in the western Ilam Province and another in the southwestern Khuzestan Province -- were hit. The radars are an essential part of Iran's early warning system, Hinz told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. Taking them out, he said, would mean Israel had 'degraded Iran's ability to resist any air attack even further, making it more vulnerable.' Fox News quoted a U.S. defense official as saying that the radars also had an offensive purpose, and have been used by Iran to track ballistic missiles after launch to assess their trajectories and course-correct if necessary. Binnie said that 'would be unusual but might explain how [Iran] has achieved a fairly high level of accuracy with its ballistic missiles -- though not good enough to do really significant damage.' Impact On Iranian Retaliation There are growing numbers of reports that Tehran is considering retaliating against Israel as the extent of the damage caused by the October 26 attack becomes clearer. Given that Iran has suffered damage to both its offensive and defensive capabilities, it is unclear if it can launch another large-scale attack on Israel, experts say. Binnie said the United States' deployment to Israel of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), an advanced anti-missile system, will further 'swing the balance in [Israel's] favor.' Media reports citing Israeli sources say that Iran is preparing to launch an aerial attack on Israel using Tehran-backed Shi'ite militant groups in Iraq. That would suggest the Islamic republic hopes its proxies will absorb the brunt of a potential Israeli response.

Sudan Crisis Escalates As Attacks In Al Jazirah Spark Mass Displa...	UN Secretary General António Guterres has strongly condemned escalating attacks by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s Al Jazirah state, as new reports reveal over 135,000 civilians were displaced in just 10 days. 'The Secretary General is appalled by the large numbers of civilians being killed, detained and displaced, acts of sexual violence against women and girls, the looting of homes and markets and the burning of farms,' said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric in a statement issued on Friday. The Secretary-General warned that 'such acts may constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Perpetrators must be held accountable'. Humanitarian crisis intensifies Speaking to journalists at the noon briefing in New York, Mr. Dujarric reported that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has documented more than 135,000 people displaced from locations across Al Jazirah between 20 and 30 October. 'More than half have fled to Gedaref state, with nearly a third seeking shelter in Kassala state,' he noted. The UN aid coordination office OCHA expressed 'deep concern' about civilians trapped by the ongoing fighting as well as those forced to flee. 'As we have repeatedly said, civilians must be protected whether they move or stay, and they must be able to receive the humanitarian assistance they need,' Mr. Dujarric emphasised. Supporting displaced people In response to the deteriorating humanitarian crisis, UN agencies and humanitarian partners – particularly local organizations and volunteers – are providing emergency assistance to new arrivals, including family tracing, reunification services and mental health support. However, with hunger and disease spreading and half the population now requiring aid, the UN Secretary-General 'demands all parties facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians in need through all necessary routes,' the statement continued. Renewing his call for an immediate ceasefire, Mr. Guterres also announced that his Personal Envoy will 'continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders to de-escalate this conflict and strengthen civilian protection measures.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3M-9T5C7JsAl	2024-11-01T16:33:03-07:00	
Ralph Nader: Weakened By Its Past Cowardliness, The Democratic Pa...	Over the years, the Democratic Party’s blunders, arrogance and dependence on commercial campaign money and corporate-conflicted political/media consultants have put the two-party duopoly races for the Presidency, the Senate and the House next week into razor-thin elections. The polls show Democrats in neck-and-neck races with the worst GOP since its creation in 1854. The GOP is led by a delusionary, daily lying, violence-inciting, bigoted, misogynist, serial election denier, convicted felon, and wannabe dictator, Donald Trump, who can’t process information but has openly boasted that he knows more than everybody. The Party of the Donkey deteriorated years ago and opened the door to unnecessary close cliff-hanger elections. The Dems wrote off nearly half of the country (the red states) to the Republicans. This abandonment included the prairie states (North and South Dakota) and the mountain states that used to have many Democratic Senators. Now they have only three Senators from seven states. The next Democratic party blunder was not to support the National Popular Vote drive to overcome the Electoral College. (See: nationalpopularvote.com). This is the anachronism that cost the Democrats two presidential losses — one in 2000 and one in 2016 — even though the Democratic presidential candidate handily won the national popular vote. Third, the Democratic Party decided to robustly compete with the GOP and dial for the same business campaign cash in return for relenting from progressive policies. Fourth, the Dems lost the gerrymandering drive in 2010 when they were caught napping against a vigorous GOP drive to control key state legislatures like Pennsylvania and get more GOP members in the House of Representatives. What should the Dems do for the people in the next four days? Bernie Sanders is the most popular elected politician in the country. Why? Because Sanders, two-time presidential candidate, wants social safety net policies that are well received by working families where they live, work, and raise their families. He has urged Kamala Harris to authentically campaign to raise the federal minimum wage frozen at $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour for over 25 million workers, raise Social Security benefits, frozen for over 50 years for over 60 million elderly, and raise taxes on the undertaxed wealthy and big corporations (for a hike supported by 85% of the people.) These three measures also appeal to many self-described conservative voters. So, what does Harris do? She does not campaign with the popular Bernie. She advertises heavily and campaigns instead with Liz Cheney who supported the war criminals Dick Cheney and G.W. Bush in their criminal invasion and sociocide of Iraq taking over one million innocent Iraqi lives and leaving that country in ruins. Liz Cheney, an avowed Republican opponent of Trump, is also a confirmed corporatist. Forgetting Sanders and heralding Cheney is not the way to turn out low-wage voters who make up a good portion of the expected 85 million eligible non-voters in next Tuesday’s election. Unable to adjust, the Democratic Party keeps pouring billions of dollars into the same mediocre ads showing Trump to be unfit for office. These repetitive video spots by now have reached diminishing returns, as a vote-getter. Almost everyone has already made up their mind on Trump’s deficiencies. The ads should shift quickly to overcoming an astonishing amnesia by a majority of voters who think they were better off economically under Trump’s term than under Biden’s. They have forgotten Trump’s closing down any efforts to secure full Medicare for All, enact higher minimum wages, and initiate enforcement efforts against corporate crooks squeezing money from the American people. All the while he was early mocking the oncoming Covid-19 pandemic and calling intense climate catastrophes 'a hoax.' His deadly delays regarding Covid led to the preventable loss of some 300,000 American lives and worsened the associated recession. The Democratic Party ads have been largely AWOL on this abysmal record while focusing expensively on Trump personally. Instead of aligning with worker unions and progressive civic groups working to benefit all people, Harris ogles up to big business bosses, thereby jettisoning media and video opportunities to be with pro-party groups with millions of members. Harris has learned little from Hillary Clinton’s disastrous loss to Trump in 2016. She continues to be supportive of the U.S. Empire and, despite more dulcet tones, is aligned with Bibi-Biden’s massive weapons and diplomatic engagement with mega-terrorist Netanyahu’s genocide of the Palestinians and now the Lebanese. She cannot even get herself to propose immediate peace negotiations over the Russian/Ukrainian war bogged down month after month with large casualties on both sides. These stands would separate her a little from Biden which would help identify her as her own person. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, running for the presidency in 1968, declined to break with President Johnson on the Vietnam War. Analysts believe that cost him in the tight race against Richard Nixon because many Democratic voters stayed home. There is still time to highlight Bernie Sanders’ protections for the people. There is still time to recognize the millions of midnight shift workers who do not see a candidate and would welcome recognition by Democratic candidates – local, state, and national. (See: winningamerica.net/midnightcampaigning). There is still time to pledge compliance with six federal laws being violated by unconditional weapons shipments to Israel’s war in Palestine. Backed by majority public opinion, she should strongly DEMAND an immediate ceasefire, entry of U.S. humanitarian aid trucks to the starving, dying innocent people of Gaza, and a cessation of the Palestinian Holocaust by the Israeli regime that has already taken at least 400,000 Palestinian lives, mostly children, women and elderly. If Harris doesn’t advance these policies, she’ll be telling people that she will just be an extension of the Biden presidency. These actions may not be enough to bring out the stay-at-home voters who in the past had voted for the Democratic candidate, but they have a higher probability than just staying the cursed course.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3CFuaWDhOyML	2024-11-01T16:29:46-07:00	
The October Surprise Is Here – And It’s Garbage – OpEd	By Graham J Noble Just in the nick of time, with October done and the 2024 general election less than a week away, America may finally have its much-anticipated October surprise. Who would have thought it would come in the form of a single word: garbage? A comedian at the massive Madison Square Garden (MSG) Trump rally joked about Puerto Rico being a 'floating island of garbage,' and days later, Joe Biden used that same word to describe Donald Trump’s supporters. There are several reasons the two comments are in no way similar and why one is so much worse than the other. And then there’s the spectacle of the White House and its media allies contorting into pretzels, trying to explain away, justify, or bury Biden’s incredibly ill-timed garbage comment. First, some perspective on the MSG routine of Trump supporter and comedian Tony Hinchcliffe is necessary. A few of his alleged jokes were off-color. The comic certainly came off as a man who has a problem with Latinos – but that could be nothing more than a matter of perception. His invitation to appear at the New York rally was probably a bad idea in hindsight. The Garbage Can-Can One specific wisecrack, however, sent the left-wing media into a frenzy. 'I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,' Hinchcliffe told his audience. 'Yeah, I think it’s called Puerto Rico.' After bipartisan backlash against this joke, he took to social media to criticize people for having no sense of humor. He pointed out that he is fond of Puerto Rico and vacations there. It is very likely that, during a visit to the island, the performer witnessed firsthand a chronic problem Puerto Ricans have been battling for years – an issue that has been covered by the media. The US territory has been struggling with overflowing landfills and, as a result, with garbage strewn about the otherwise beautiful island. It seems clear that the comic was not referring to the people of Puerto Rico as garbage. To suggest otherwise is a stretch. Fast forward a couple of days to someone else clearly describing a certain group of human beings as garbage. During a campaign call to Voto Latino, which describes itself as a 'civic engagement organization focused on educating and empowering a new generation of Latinx voters,' the White House incumbent took his cue from Hinchcliffe’s quip about Puerto Rico. 'Donald Trump has no character,' Biden asserted. 'He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community.' Shortly after, he added: 'And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know … or Puerto Rico where I … in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' There really is no alternative way to interpret that last sentence, though the White House communications people have tried to – in entirely unconvincing ways. Elements of the left-wing media are also circling the wagons around the lame-duck commander-in-chief. One news outlet even went so far as to reframe what Biden said. Politico reported, 'Biden, in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino, said ‘the only garbage’ was the ‘hatred’ of Donald Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.' It was a sneaky way of reimagining what Biden said while avoiding quoting him verbatim. It is another in the almost endless list of examples of how far certain media companies will go to cover for Biden and Kamala Harris when they make misleading, dishonest, incomprehensible, or offensive remarks. One CNN panelist, Franklin Leonard, with a straight face, claimed that Biden only sounded as if he were denigrating Trump supporters because the president had a stutter when growing up. The White House attempted to alter Biden’s statement using a strategically placed apostrophe. The official transcript of his remark reads, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s' – the inference being that Biden was referring directly to Hinchcliffe’s Puerto Rico quip. Everyone is familiar with Biden’s speech patterns, however, and his phraseology. This White House version of what he said just doesn’t fit the way the man speaks. When one also considers the number of times in past speeches that the chief executive has expressed his contempt not only for Trump but also for his supporters, there’s no credible debate about the words that came out of Biden’s mouth and what he meant. While the media continues to spin this as something other than what it appears to be, however, certain elected Democrat senators seem to have taken his comments at face value and are in the process of distancing themselves. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, John Tester of Montana, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, and Arizona candidate for the US Senate, Ruben Gallego, all expressed to Fox News that they disagreed profoundly with the president’s comments. Donald Trump, on the other hand, wasted no time in taking advantage of Biden’s latest gaffe. At his rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump rode around – in uniform – in a MAGA-emblazoned garbage truck. 'I have to start by saying 250 million Americans are not garbage,' Trump then told the audience. 'My supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe and Lying Kamala.' The Not-So-Surprising October Surprise So, on the one hand, you have left-wing pundits, politicians, and their media allies getting into a frenzy over a comedian cracking a joke about a geographical area being an island of garbage. On the other, these very same supposedly outraged people are making excuses for someone on their side describing practically half of all Americans as garbage. It appears that, for some, the moral compass is spinning wildly. The next couple of days will reveal whether this was, indeed, the October surprise everyone had been expecting but that no one had on their bingo card. There is one other point to be made about this latest battle over words. The relative positions of power and influence occupied by the speakers of contentious remarks determine how much gravity is added to the words spoken. As Mark Angelides, Liberty Nation’s editor-in-chief, points out: 'It is worth making a delineation. Tony Hinchcliffe is a comedian whose job is to be edgy and make jokes. Jokes are not necessarily reflective of the performer’s opinion – less reflective of the person whose name is on the top ticket [Trump]. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is not only the president of the United States, but he is also Kamala’s boss and, presumably, her most significant surrogate.' Was Biden’s comment about Trump supporters the October surprise, then? In general, one would define this mysterious but widely anticipated phenomenon as an unexpected event significant enough to potentially swing an election decisively in one direction or the other. Biden made the remark just as Harris – his vice president – was about to make her final case to the nation for her own White House bid. By doing so, he overshadowed her address and stole the media spotlight. Any bump Harris might have received post-speech was likely erased. Factor in the number of people who, in both 2016 and 2020, asserted they could not vote for Trump because of his rhetoric, his insults, and his famously mean tweets. Now add to the equation a sitting president effectively suggesting that everyone who votes – or has voted – for the 45th president is garbage. One could certainly argue the badly timed and decidedly ill-conceived remark meets the criteria for an October surprise.

North Korea Pledges Support To Russia ‘Until Victory’ In Ukraine	North Korea’s foreign minister Friday pledged to support Russia 'until it achieves victory' in its war against Ukraine, during a visit to Moscow as some 8,000 North Korean troops are reportedly poised to join Russian troops on the battlefield. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui held talks with her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. As cameras rolled after their meeting, each praised the new levels that the relationship between the two nations has reached. The North Korean top diplomat accused the United States and South Korea of a military build-up and war provocations, and praised Russia’s efforts to put an end to 'hegemonic practices of the U.S. and the West and to establish a new international order.' She said the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has unwavering faith that Russia will achieve victory and said her country will stand with them until that victory is achieved. Lavrov expressed Russia’s gratitude for its Korean friends and for their 'principled' position regarding 'the events that have now unfolded in Ukraine,' and praised the 'very close contacts' that 'have been established between the military of the two countries.' Neither diplomat made any direct reference to North Korean troops being deployed in the region. Speaking Friday in Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a joint briefing with his South Korean counterpart it is believed at least 10,000 North Korean troops are set to be deployed to the region, with about 8,000 of them already in Russia’s Kursk oblast. At the same news conference, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. expects North Korean troops to enter the war against Ukraine in the coming days. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials said, adding that Russia is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. In an interview with Estonia’s public broadcaster ERR Friday, Estonian Defense Forces intelligence chief Colonel Ants Kiviselg said he thinks North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses, potentially even more than the Russians. He said they are not familiar with or trained for combat in the region’s terrain, climate or geography. Also Friday, the U.S. Defense Department, or DOD, announced an additional $425 million in security assistance for Ukraine. It is the 69th tranche of equipment to be provided from DOD inventories for Ukraine since August of 2021. In a statement, the department said the defense package will provide Ukraine with assets to help the country meet some of its most urgent security needs, including air defense interceptors, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. The statement said the United States will continue to work together with some 50 allies and partners through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and its associated capability coalitions to meet Ukraine's urgently needed battlefield requirements and defend against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, Kyiv’s military reported Friday that Russia launched 2,023 drone attacks on Ukraine in October, the most since the war began. The report said that the total is nearly 700 higher than the number of attacks launched in September, the month with the previous record for drone attacks. The report said Russia has launched 6,987 since the beginning of 2024. Earlier Friday, Russia's Defense Ministry reported its defenses shot down 83 Ukrainian drones over six regions early on Friday. In a statement posted to its Telegram social media channel, the ministry said, '36 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, 20 over the Bryansk region, 12 over Crimea, eight over the Voronezh region, four over the Oryol region, and three over the Belgorod region.' Separately, Aleksandr Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk, said one person was wounded when a Ukrainian drone crashed into an apartment building in the city of Bryansk. In the Stavropol region, a drone fell on an oil depot in the city of Svetlograd, regional Governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram. In Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, a Russian missile struck a fire station, wounding two firefighters, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air force said its defenses shot down 31 Russian drones and one missile over nine regions — Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Vinnytsya, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Chernihiv and Poltava.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3Eo5ujm5ZI0e	2024-11-01T16:26:14-07:00	
Moscow Struggles To Find Allies For Ukraine War – Analysis	By Luke Coffey The BRICS summit in Kazan last week was intended to signal to the international community — and particularly the West — that Russia remains influential and far from isolated by its war on Ukraine, but the outcomes for Moscow were mixed. The BRICS countries could not come to a unified stance on Ukraine. Their final declaration briefly stated: 'We recall national positions concerning the situation in and around Ukraine,' and 'all states should act consistently with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter in their entirety and interrelation.' This minimal mention of Ukraine, coupled with a general nod to the UN Charter, exposed the divisions within BRICS on this key issue. Ukraine remains Russia’s most pressing national security and foreign policy concern. As both summit host and BRICS president, Russia aimed to forge a unified front on the conflict. But the failure to gain consensus was a major diplomatic setback, emphasizing the challenges Russia faces in reconciling the diverse and often divergent interests within BRICS. Given the varied political landscapes of its member countries, the lack of consensus on Ukraine should not be surprising. BRICS brings together nations with longstanding regional rivalries and conflicting global perspectives. For instance, relations between China and India remain tense over their unresolved border. Iran and the UAE often find themselves on opposite sides of issues in the Gulf, while Egypt and Ethiopia are frequently at odds over regional concerns, particularly the Nile’s water resources. These differences mean that reaching alignment on controversial issues, especially those as complex as Ukraine, is challenging at best. For some BRICS members, such as Russia and China, the group offers a way to establish an alternative to what they view as a G7 and West-dominated global system. They see BRICS as a counterbalance to perceived Western hegemony, providing a space to challenge established norms and build influence. However, other BRICS members view their participation as supplementary to their relationships with the West rather than a replacement. These countries seek balanced engagement on several fronts, prioritizing economic cooperation and stability without necessarily subscribing to an anti-Western stance. This split in purpose and perspective makes it difficult to achieve unified action within BRICS on divisive issues such as Ukraine. This reflects broader international divides on the conflict. Within Europe, attitudes toward the war are mixed, and signs of war fatigue are emerging. In many European states, parties on both the far left and far right are calling for reduced aid to Ukraine. Leaders in Hungary and Slovakia, for example, have publicly questioned the wisdom of continued support, calling instead for territorial concessions to Russia in the interest of a negotiated peace. This lack of unity among NATO members was evident at the alliance’s Washington summit in July, when high hopes for a clear path to membership for Ukraine went unmet. The war in Ukraine is also a significant point of division in the US, where the two leading presidential candidates hold opposing views. Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed a firm stance in support of Ukraine, although she has not indicated that her approach would differ significantly from the policy of the Biden administration. On the other hand, former President Donald Trump has suggested he could negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, which would probably involve Ukraine ceding territory and agreeing to remain outside NATO and the EU. As each country formulates its own policy, certain foundational truths must remain central. When Ukraine declared independence in 1991, its borders — including Crimea — were internationally recognized, including by Russia. This underscores why Russia has struggled to find support for its war outside a small group of allies such as North Korea, Iran, and Belarus. Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in the 1990s with assurances from Russia and the international community that its borders would be respected. Since then, Ukraine has consistently adhered to its obligations under the UN Charter, making it essential that any resolution to the conflict respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity and aligns with international law. As the situation continues to evolve, shifts in political leadership across the globe could alter the support landscape for Ukraine. The US election will lead to a new administration, and possibly a change in policy on Ukraine. Additionally, several European countries are preparing for elections, and shifting public opinion could usher in governments less inclined to support Ukraine. Meanwhile Russia continues to use platforms such as BRICS to advance its agenda and assert its relevance on the global stage, though the summit highlighted the limitations of this approach. The path forward remains uncertain. The inability of BRICS to agree on Ukraine reflects a broader, fractured global response to the conflict, a reality that Ukraine and its allies must navigate carefully in the months ahead.

Lebanon PM Says Expanded Strikes Suggest Israel Rejects Truce	By Najia Houssari Israel bombarded the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday as caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused it of 'stubbornness' in negotiations. Israeli attacks came amid stalled talks by two US envoys in Israel in an attempt to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Mikati reaffirmed Lebanon’s continued commitment to UN resolution 1701 and its provisions. Mikati said he believed that Israel’s 'renewed expansion of the scope of its aggression on Lebanese regions, its repeated threats to the population to evacuate entire cities and villages, and its renewed targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut with destructive raids are all indicators that confirm Israel’s rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire in preparation for the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701.' He said: 'Israeli statements and diplomatic signals that Lebanon received confirm Israel’s stubbornness in rejecting the proposed solutions and insisting on the approach of killing and destruction. 'This places the entire international community before its historical and moral responsibilities to stop this aggression.' Mikati denied the claims of two Reuters sources on Friday, which stated that the US 'had asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to inject momentum into stalled talks on a deal to end hostilities.' His media office said that the Lebanese government’s stance was 'clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and the implementation of Resolution 1701.' Mikati’s warning came as the Israeli Air Force carried out 14 raids against neighborhoods in Beirut’s southern suburbs after two weeks of cautious calm in the area. The raids affected Burj Al-Barajneh, Rweis, Haret Hreik, Hadath and the old airport road. Twelve raids targeted Baalbek-Hermel, causing further casualties, including entire families. In Amhazieh alone, 12 people died in a raid, most of whom were children, while a woman was killed and five were injured in a raid in Taraya, west of Baalbek. Three people were killed in Hrabta, while another was killed in Kasarnaba. Before the raids, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee sent evacuation warnings to residents at about 3.30 a.m., which was followed by heavy shooting by Hezbollah members to alert sleeping residents in the areas targeted. People left their homes in pyjamas, carrying their children along the streets near the old airport road, one of the targeted areas During a week-long period of relative calm, many residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs returned to their homes, which were not affected by previous raids. The raids caused widespread destruction in these areas, which are considered by the Israeli army as Hezbollah’s security square, although the Lebanese consider the area residential. In a statement on Friday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed concern over 'the impact of the Israeli operations on civilians and infrastructure in Lebanon.' Israeli strikes on the ancient cities of Tyre and Baalbek, home to UNESCO-designated Roman ruins, were endangering Lebanon’s cultural heritage, said UN special coordinator Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. 'Ancient Phoenician cities steeped in history are in deep peril of being left in ruins,' Hennis-Plasschaert said in a social media post, adding that Lebanon’s cultural heritage 'must not become yet another casualty in this devastating conflict.' Her appeal came as Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said: 'Since last September, Israel has wasted more than one opportunity to reach a ceasefire, implement Resolution 1701, restore calm, and return the displaced to both sides of the border.' He underlined Lebanon’s 'commitment to implementing Resolution 1701 as the only option to achieve regional security and stability.' MP Michel Moussa, a parliamentary Development and Liberation Bloc member, said Berri 'has been informed that ceasefire negotiations have reached an impasse.' Moussa said Israel had shown no intention to negotiate, appearing to await US elections as a 'significant turning point.' During his meeting with US special envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel 'is determined to confront the threats in the north. Any ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon must guarantee Israel’s security.' He added: 'There is pressure to prematurely achieve a settlement in Lebanon, and reality has proven otherwise. 'I did not set a date for the war’s end, but I set clear goals for victory,' Netanyahu said. 'We respect Resolutions 1701 and 1559, but they are not the main thing.' The Israeli airstrikes, which continued on Friday morning and during the day, targeted a residential apartment in the town of Qmatiyeh in Aley, killing three members of a family living there and wounding five. They also targeted dozens of towns in the south and northern Bekaa after the city of Baalbek turned into a ghost town as a result of renewed Israeli warnings against the return of those who were displaced from it. Israeli attacks on Baalbek-Hermel Governorate and Central Bekaa include 1,035 airstrikes, which have killed 528 and 1,069 injured people. According to a report by the ministerial emergency committee, the toll has risen to 2,822 dead and 12,937 wounded since the first attack by Israel against Lebanon about 14 months. Hezbollah MP Hussein Hajj Hassan estimated that about '60,000 people were displaced from Baalbek and Hermel, and the figure needs to be updated daily.' In a report on its field operations against the Israeli army, Hezbollah said that 'more than 95 soldiers were killed, 900 others wounded, and 42 Merkava tanks were destroyed' since the ground offensive began. 'Three Hermes 450 and two Hermes 900 drones were shot down. Israeli forces are trying not to move or change their positions in the fields, fearing being targeted,' Hezbollah said. The UNIFIL commander, Gen. Aroldo Lazaro, visited Mikati and Berri on Friday to discuss the ongoing military operations against Lebanon and the difficulties and threats UNIFIL faces while carrying out its mission. Mikati emphasized the importance of 'adhering to the role of UNIFIL, recognizing its importance in the south and not compromising its rules of work and the missions it is carrying out in close cooperation with the Lebanese army.' In Israel, sirens sounded in several settlements in the Galilee panhandle, coinciding with an Israeli announcement 'detecting around 10 rockets being launched from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted and others landed in open areas.' Hezbollah announced targeting 'Kiryat Shmona, Hatzor HaGlilit, Kidmat Tzvi, Yesod HaMa’ala and Karmiel,' and a group of soldiers near the Lebanese border town of Khiyam. Also on Friday, a 17th Saudi relief plane, operated by the Saudi aid agency KSRelief, landed at Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut, carrying food, shelter and medical aid, the Saudi Press Agency reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3OlP07Co6xSm	2024-11-01T16:22:20-07:00	
Russia’s Ambitious Economic Engagement With Africa Remains Symbol...	With renewed and full-fledged interest to engage in diverse economic sectors across Africa still largely remains full of symbolism and expression of policy interest. Russia considers the existing growth of neo-colonial tendencies as impediments for investment. Rather focusing on its own investment to showcase African leaders and elites within the context of current geopolitical developments, Russian officials are rather criticizing the United States and Europeans for the scramble for resources in Africa. Afrter the first (October 2019) and second (St. Petersburg, July 2023) summits, both Russian and African officials are still at the crossroads over concrete spheres of economic cooperation. The two summit declarations will now be reviewed and revised at the forthcoming first Russia-Africa ministerial conference this early November in Sochi, the southern city in the Russian Federation. Ahead of the conference, Dr. Gideon Shoo, media consultant and business lobbyist based in Kilimanjaro Region in Tanzania, explained in this interview what Russian investors and other participants can expect from the Kremlin, Russian political leaders and corporate business executives from the public and private sectors for subsequent collaboration with Africa. Following are excerpts from the interview: Africa Beyond Aid! What should African leaders do in order to raise mutual cooperation with Russia? Let us look at this question on the reverse side, from the African side. Gideon Shoo: African leaders must strive to understand their counterparts in Russia. They need to understand the political system in Russia, and at least, the economic policies and interests. At the same time, they need to demonstrate what they can do in terms of helping Russia overcome some of the economic hitches as a result of sanctions imposed on her by the United States and the European Union. They should engage in 'a scratch my back I scratch yours' relationship given the fact that Russia is advanced in technology which is badly needed in Africa. Russia has several bilateral agreements, at least, during the past decade, and including from the first and second summits that were largely not implemented in many African countries. In your view, what mechanisms be fixed to deliver on pledges and promises? GS: This is quite an important aspect of Russia-African relationship. Bilateral agreements need to be revised and schedules of implementation be drawn wherever possible. Russia needs to go back to those years when it committed itself to support Africa get out of neo-colonial cobweb by assisting in crucial and important areas such as education, public health and engineering. That was partly done through offering higher and specialized education as one way of development assistance to the continent. But time has practically changed, that Africa needs multifaceted investment in its economic sectors and to undertake critical infrastructure projects as an integral part of securing its economic sovereignty. Of course, priority spheres include energy, oil & gas, infrastructure etc., but what kinds of state support be offered Russian companies and enterprises to operate effectively in Africa? GS: Russian companies need to prove their superiority in the sector mentioned above. The companies should show how African countries are going to benefit. African governments must make it easier for Russian companies to set up and operate in their countries. Russian financial institutions can offer credit support that will allow them to localize their production in Africa's industrial zones, especially southern and eastern African regions that show some stability and have good investment and business incentives. In order to operate more effectively, Russians have to risk by investing, recognize the importance of cooperation on key investment issues and to work closely on the challenges and opportunities on the continent. Of course, Russians have been trying to return there over the past few years, which is a very commendable step forward. There are prospects for greater or broader foreign players. Until potential Russian investors make a decision to pay more high-level attention to Africa, it is difficult to see greater engagement at the economic or business level. In practical sense, it requires to move beyond mere expression of interests, it needs strategic focus and pragmatic approach from both Russians and African governments. According to official figures, Russia-African trade currently stands at $23.8 billion. Could trade preferences help potential African exporters (make it a two-way road) also to explore the Russian market? GS: Russia is, so far, a closed market to many African countries. It is difficult to access the Russian market. There are no direct flights to most African capitals, and it makes Russia not a common destination even to the Vasco da Gamas of Africa. While tropical fruits and vegetables are rotting in Africa, the Russian market is yawning because of sanctions. Why not work out a two-way traffic between Africa and Russia? African countries have to look to new emerging markets for export products, make efforts to negotiate for access to these markets. This can be another aspect of the economic cooperation and great business opportunity for both regions. Talking about Russia's presence in Africa and Africa's presence in Russia. Understandably, much also depends on the interest of African business-people; but what should be done to stimulate or boost potential African exporters' interest in Russia? GS: Visits. Visits. Official Visits. These official visits proliferate, to and fro African capitals and Moscow. But, how can this be achieved if there are no direct affordable flights? Can Africa and Russia establish links through joint ventures including those in aviation? Yes, I think and believe it is possible. Can Africa, especially south of the Sahara be a tourist destination for Russians and vice versa? Yes, it is possible. For instance, tourism can primarily help to broaden cultural horizons, breaking stereotypes and attitudes. Developing tourism is one way to promote business and raise knowledge of diverse culture in Africa. By looking at the rules and regulations, the situation about Russia's presence in Africa and Africa's presence in Russia can be changed. Russia and Africa have to make efforts for raising the level of trade and business in both regions. St. Petersburg and Sochi summits seemingly hold the key to all these questions you have so far discussed above. Can these, among others and in reality, mark a definitive start of a new dawn in the Russia-African relations? GS: In the first place, Russians and Africans have to look at this positively. It will offer participants the opportunity to engage in dialogue, receive up-to-date information on the current trends, challenges and prospects of investment activities as well as networking for business contacts. It is also important that African leaders determine and set their development priorities. Russia's policy is full of skyline symbolism. Interestingly, I think both St. Petersburg and Sochi summits have already been considered as new chapters in Russia-Africa cooperation, but unfortunately not as there remains concrete steps to take in determining where to invest in and what projects worth undertaking in Africa. It all depends on how serious Russian and African leaders together with summit and conference participants see it happen in practical terms. The first step, of course, should be a complete departure away from policy rhetoric, its hard time to act on policy decisions. In any case, the gathering has to offer the expected fruits, leave a long-term and sustainable impact and memories, and indeed, should open the door to Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3EyOj3nC9F6r	2024-11-01T16:20:48-07:00	
To Combat Demographic Decline, Moscow Must Focus On Mortality Rat...	Demography is not destiny, but declining demographic trends impose limits on what a country can do in the long term. Russia’s population decline is becoming its most pressing issue, and one Russian newspaper warned that demography is now the Kremlin’s most serious constraint (see EDM, October 24, 2023; NG.ru, April 18). Unsurprisingly, President Vladimir Putin has sought to limit the demographic decline’s effects on Russia. In response, Putin has been importing migrant workers, an approach that is becoming increasingly unpopular among Russians in large part because of Moscow-promoted nationalist policies (see EDM, February 6, May 15, October 22). Most recently, Putin has enlisted North Korean troops to fight in his war in Ukraine (see EDM, October 30; The Kyiv Independent, October 31). He has sought to squeeze more work and military service out of the existing population by allowing older men to serve and boosting signing bonuses (see EDM, October 24; Window on Eurasia, October 30). In addition, Putin is requiring the elderly to go back to work and those in the workforce to do overtime; neither group is enthusiastic about the state’s rising demands on them and their time (Iarex.ru, October 29; Moscow Times, September 9). Over the last several years, Putin has focused on boosting Russia’s birthrate by promoting the image of large families as the Russian ideal, paying women to have children, and making both abortion and divorce more difficult (Window on Eurasia, August 7; see EDM, October 1). Putin has not done anything to address the country’s increasingly high mortality rate despite Moscow’s seeming priority to control its population decline. Russian demographers say that Russia’s most significant bottleneck lies in its mortality rate, which is more susceptible to policy changes than its birth rate, though such reforms would require a ruler in the country willing to make them (Holod, October 16). . These steps would include expensive and fundamental alterations to both domestic and foreign policy—ones Putin shows no sign of willingness to undertake. Demographers suggest all his talk about boosting the birth rate is, first and foremost, a smokescreen to conceal his almost complete unwillingness to address mortality issues. Russia’s fertility rate—the number of children per woman in her lifetime—has fallen well below replacement levels, much as in other European countries. Russia’s mortality rate—the number of deaths relative to the population as a whole—however, is far higher than in all other developed and urbanized countries. This is due in part to the fact that most of these states have adopted social policies designed to reduce death rates and boost life expectancy. Given that pattern, demographers say Russia should focus on reducing the latter if it is to prevent the country’s total population from continuing to shrink, possibly to as few as 100 million by the end of this century. According to Russian demographers Aby Shukyurov and Dmitry Zakotyansky, the Russian government has focused almost exclusively on boosting birth rates, something it thinks it can do despite all the evidence to the contrary from its own experience and that of other countries. Moscow does this while ignoring far more effective policies that would reduce mortality rates. Shukyurov pointedly notes that while Russia’s birth rate is lower now than at any time in the past, it 'might be fine' given that the country is becoming increasingly urbanized. Its mortality rate, on the other hand, 'is anything but.' While Russia’s birth rate is comparable to Europe’s, its mortality rate is far higher, and the causes of death are different as well. In Russia, cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of death, while in Europe—which has used various healthcare strategies to reduce those—cancer is now the leading cause. Zakotyansky, for his part, points out that economic inequality is a significant contributing factor to Russia’s low life expectancy, with as many as 40 percent of all Russians living in poverty, continuing to smoke and drink heavily, and more likely to be involved in or affected by crime. The Kremlin could do more to combat all of these economic inequalities, but is not. Moreover, both demographers say that Russia’s demographic situation has been seriously affected by the war in Ukraine, a conflict which, according to some estimates, has killed 120,000 Russian soldiers and injured more than 400,000 more. Once again, the regime could improve the country’s demography by bringing the long war to an end. Even when Putin does talk about the mortality rate, he obscures the true figures by playing games with statistics, as the real numbers are too horrific. Apart from fertility questions, the mortality rate is almost always discussed so as not to lead to any challenge to Putin’s policies (Tochno, March 14; Window on Eurasia, March 18). Presently, the Kremlin wants to block questions regarding Putin’s healthcare 'optimization' program, his decade-long effort to cut back healthcare facilities so as to allocate more money for other projects, including his war in Ukraine. Hospitals and medical centers have been shuttered across the country, making Russians increasingly angry (Novaya Gazeta, September 16). Reversing his course now would be prohibitively expensive. To just return to what Russia’s mortality rates were in 1991, academician Robert Nigmatullin says Russia would have to double the share of its gross domestic product (GDP) spent on healthcare. Otherwise, it will continue to suffer 200,000 or more excess deaths every year (Nakanune.ru, June 27, 2023). Looming behind these immediate healthcare and financial concerns is another that is likely to grow and play an increasing role in Putin’s failure to address mortality issues. Even though abortion rates have fallen 90 percent from Soviet times, research suggests that this occurred for many reasons, and that a pro-natalist hyperfocus on them has proved less effective than advertised (Tochno, July 28, 2023; Cherta, September 5). Additionally, to the horror of many Russian nationalists, mortality rates are far higher in predominantly ethnically Russian regions of the country than they are in non-ethnically Russian regions, while fertility rates remain higher in the former than the latter (Window on Eurasia, July 30). Failure to address the high mortality rate means that the Russian Federation will become ever less ethnically Russian, despite Putin’s increasing support for a Russian nationalist agenda (see EDM, October 29). Even worse, from his perspective, Moscow’s pro-natalist policies, besides being overwhelmingly ineffective in ethnically Russian areas, appear to be maintaining or even boosting the high birthrates in non-ethnically Russian regions, exactly the opposite of what the Kremlin leader wants (Kavkazr.Realii, October 23). Focusing only on what Putin says he is doing to address the demographic situation distracts from what is really going on: a continuing population decline exacerbated by his focus on pushing for a higher fertility rate rather than also helping to reduce the super-high mortality rate. Unfortunately, both for Putin and Russia, those being deceived by his words almost certainly include the Kremlin leader himself, making any change of course highly unlikely before dramatic demographic collapse or his departure from power.

Russia’s Influence Machine – Analysis	By the time Burkina Faso’s health ministry declared an epidemic of dengue fever on October 18, 2023, there already were thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was the West African country’s deadliest bout with the disease in years. Another dangerous outbreak quickly followed: a deluge of Russian disinformation. Social media users, including many believed to be backed by the Russian government, began attacking work by Target Malaria, a not-for-profit research organization that fights mosquito-borne illnesses. The group, which is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has worked to prevent malaria in Burkina Faso since 2012. 'But an army of fake social media users falsely accused the group of spreading disease, weaponizing mosquitoes, and creating biological weapons, while heaping praise on Russia,' according to Agence France-Presse. In the face of the organized disinformation campaign, Target Malaria was forced to respond by calling the attacks 'false' and 'deeply regrettable.' Experts say the disinformation campaign is just one part of a concerted, systematic effort by Russia to sow mistrust in basic institutions such as health care, the government, the United Nations and even international humanitarian organizations. Central to the Russian campaign was the African Initiative, an online outlet with deep ties to the late Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who built a shadowy network of mercenary, disinformation and mining operations in Africa before he was killed in a mysterious plane crash in August 2023. In the wake of Prigozhin’s death, the Russian Defense Ministry has taken over the Wagner Group’s operations on the continent and rebranded it under the name Africa Corps. Just as cases of dengue fever in Burkina Faso were surging in September 2023, the Russian military-run Zvezda TV broadcast a news story announcing the launch of the African Initiative. Artyom Kureev, African Initiative director-general, has said his organization aims to become the 'information bridge between Russia and Africa.' But its real goal is to disguise and spread disinformation in the hope that it will be seen as independent reporting and not as a Moscow-directed propaganda campaign. The WHO reported a surge of dengue fever cases from six in July 2023 to 'a staggering 708 cases' by September 9 and urged collaboration with partners such as Target Malaria. 'Given the positivity ratio … it is imperative to uphold and reinforce public health measures,' the WHO said in a weekly bulletin. Russian disinformation networks made that task much more difficult. Dr. Mark Duerksen, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS), has spent years analyzing the growing impact of disinformation campaigns on the continent’s rapidly changing information systems. He called the recent Burkina Faso disinformation campaign Russia’s likely 'next wave.' 'There are indications that the African Initiative is probing public health as something amenable to this kind of information warfare,' he told ADF. 'They seem to have found another soft spot that they’re going to exploit. It’s really cynical because it’s going to make public health efforts more difficult on the continent. It’s going to make fewer people access care.' Russian Disinformation in the Sahel Hybrid warfare combines conventional forms of armed conflict with nonconventional strategic tools, including information operations to influence and subvert or reframe events. Duerksen says it is a part of the 'suite of services' Russia offers to isolated autocratic regimes such as the military juntas that have taken over Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in recent years. First, Russia identifies and inflames local grievances. In the Sahel, the biggest vulnerability is ineffective security forces facing a tidal wave of expanding violent extremist organizations — regional groups with links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group terrorist organizations. Next, Russian operatives cultivate local influencers who spread propaganda and disinformation while building a network on social media and promoting demonstrations to give the appearance of popular support. Then Russian mercenaries arrive and lead counterterrorism training and operations while establishing their payment through contracts for mineral extraction. In the wake of its military operations across Mali and the Central African Republic, the Wagner Group was credibly accused of numerous civilian massacres, atrocities, human rights violations and other war crimes. Once the mercenaries are in place, the disinformation and influence campaigns can be declared a success. As the head of research at Logically, a technology company that tracked a surge of pro-Russian and anti-French narratives related to Niger surrounding the country’s military coup in 2023, Kyle Walter has long suspected that Russian funding and social media networks are responsible for fake grassroots rallies. The New York Times reported that Ahmed Bello, the president of a Nigerien civil society group whose acronym is written as Parade, distributed as many as 70 Russian flags at multiple protests in Niamey and that the Russian government provided funding through intermediaries conducting similar activities in Mali. 'It is with them that we work to develop the expansion of Russian ideology in Africa,' Bello told the Times. Researchers at Microsoft have identified Parade as the handiwork of Russia’s Foreign Ministry, and a senior European military official told the Times that the group is a front for Kremlin-backed operations on the continent. 'It’s a whole toolkit,' Duerksen said, explaining the Wagner Group’s blueprint. 'It can help [juntas] stay in power and keep the opposition and the journalists at bay. When the disinformation that they’re offering has helped actually bring these regimes to power in the case of the [Sahel] military juntas, they are then intertwined with those regimes.' In a March 2024 report that drew from the work of more than 30 African researchers and organizations, the ACSS identified Russia as the primary sponsor of disinformation in Africa. 'Russia is connected to 80 of the 189 campaigns that we identified and mapped, which is 40% of these disinformation campaigns,' Duerksen said. 'This kind of cognitive warfare is a strategy that has come from the Russian Ministry of Defense. This isn’t just a side project. This is a clear emphasis for the Russian military, and they go about this pretty systematically.' Whereas the Russian government previously denied any ties to its mercenary groups’ operations, the shift from Prigozhin’s Wagner network to the military-controlled Africa Corps is profound in that Russia is now accountable for its actions. 'Who’s going to be stuck holding that bag with some kind of accountability?' Duerksen said. 'Wagner had always given them this deniability that they weren’t associated with whatever they were up to. Now the Russians own it.' The Wagner Blueprint The Wagner Group was Russia’s primary vehicle for its ambitions in Africa dating back to 2017, when Prigozhin and his mercenaries arrived and began building a sprawling network. 'They were trying a lot of different disinformation tactics, pushing a lot of different narratives, even conflicting narratives like backing two political candidates at the same time,' Duerksen said. 'It seems like they were doing a kind of market research, a lot of experimentation.' Among the most effective strategies is using local languages across social media networks and hiring local people to spread disinformation. 'They’ve realized the messenger matters, that having somebody who either speaks the local language, is really in tune with the local issues or speaks the local dialect is much better than a Wagner Telegram channel based in St. Petersburg,' Duerksen said. 'They see these as the vanguard of their influence and how they can get groups into the streets.' In the Sahel, with its complicated Francophone history, Russia found a vulnerable, willing consumer of its disinformation. 'There were problems with security,' Duerksen said, 'so they just really hammered these messages and really tried to contort the political discourse toward this kind of disillusionment, this cynicism, this kind of toxic energy, not channeling it toward anything constructive or productive, but toward the cheering for military coups. It’s kind of a nihilistic politics now.' Duerksen said that part of Russia’s disinformation design is to focus on three audiences. The first group consists of local people who consume disinformation content, embrace it and become amplifiers and standard holders. 'They’re the ones who are in the street holding Russian flags,' Duerksen said. 'That’s a small group, those who actually have become the domestic purveyors.' The second group is larger, with local people for whom disinformation content is designed to confuse and result in disengagement with politics and social issues. 'They’re oftentimes being intimidated. If they try to express an opinion or ask a question in some of these information spaces, the troll army descends on them.' The third group consists of regional and international media and observers who sometimes share only a surface-level understanding of distant issues and affairs. 'It’s hard to cover events, so it gets framed as a popular uprising. I think that’s become very intentionally manufactured around the Sahel trends. It’s advancing a strategic objective that Russia has in the region.' Analyst Dan Whitman of the Foreign Policy Research Institute has similarly concluded that Russia is exploiting and profiting from violence in the Sahel. 'Instability is the Garden of Eden for disinformation,' he told Voice of America. 'I would say [in] two or three years, [Russia] has made the most rapid propaganda successes in the history of propaganda.' Pushing Back Against the Narrative Russian disinformation has been used to insulate authoritarian regimes from accountability. In this way, military juntas in the Sahel are no different from Vladimir Putin’s oppressive reign in Russia. Never-ending disinformation campaigns mean that there always will be another distraction, another way to deflect criticism, another internal or external enemy to blame. But pushback is inevitable, especially in the Sahel, where insecurity touches nearly every life and is only getting worse. In April, more than 80 political parties and civil groups in Mali issued joint statements calling for presidential elections and an end to military rule. Mali’s junta responded with more oppression, suspending all political activities and barring the media from covering politics — moves it claimed were necessary 'for reasons of public order.' But Malian dissenters are showing that they aren’t going away. On April 24, 2024, a group of political parties and civil society organizations appealed to Mali’s Supreme Court 'with the aim of annulling the decree which they consider tyrannical and oppressive.' The mere existence of resistance is a clear sign that a media ecosystem of disinformation is not invulnerable. By pushing back, people undermine the narrative that their military rulers have popular support. Throughout the Sahel, it is not difficult for Malians, Burkinabe and Nigeriens to see that their so-called transition government leaders have no plans to hold elections any time soon. 'Things aren’t going well in the Sahel under these military regimes,' Duerksen said. 'Security is getting worse. Economies are disintegrating. That’s been one of the great tricks of these disinformation campaigns. They’ve helped create and keep alive this image that the military juntas are popular.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOxcqVr-N_hpY	2024-10-31T17:11:24-07:00	
Shia Militarism Upstages Salafi Jihadism In West Asia – Analysis	By Adil Rasheed It is curious to note that the ‘jihadist’ tag is almost exclusively given to violent Sunni extremists.1 In fact, Western experts usually use the term ‘militias’ when referring to Shia violent non-state actors and just a few journalists like Danny Postel ever employ the term ‘Shia jihad’.2 In fact, the Arabic term of muqawama (resistance) is now replacing jihad across West Asia and the neologism muqawamist is being used by English-speaking Arab commentators while referring to Iran-backed militancy.3 Deriving its resonance from the Shia ideology of resistance against the ‘oppression’ of Islam’s larger Sunni community, the term is now getting applied to rising pan-Islamist opposition towards the US-Israeli sway over the region.4 The recent popularity and support for Iran-backed Shia groups in the Arab world is remarkable, because it seems to have significantly reduced the intense hate and animosity generated by the Syrian civil war and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria’s (ISIS) hostilities over the last decade between the Sunni and Shia communities. Today, Sunni states like Salafi Qatar and the Deobandi Taliban regime are coming closer to Shia Iran and have apparently turned away from their old allies—the Salafi jihadists.5 No wonder, ISIS and its global affiliates are now targeting Iran, Russia and Shia groups out of sheer spite and desperation.6 But perhaps Salafi jihadists are themselves to blame for their present predicament. Al-Qaeda and the ISIS always opposed the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and even Hamas for fighting a nationalist Palestinian cause,7 rather than opposing the Westphalian and democratic nation-state system of the so-called ‘taghut’.8 By resorting to indiscriminate violence against civilians (particularly women and children), targeting the existing international political and economic order, by alienating all Western and Eastern countries (even Hanafi Sunni nations and groups like Turkey, Taliban and Hamas), Salafi jihadists are today seen in West Asia as strategically demented doomsday cultists, perpetually baying for blood.9 On the other hand, Iran has projected itself as a pan-Islamist power, and not just a Shia theocracy. By following this strategy, it has managed to extend its influence up to the Mediterranean, and has successfully brought the Lebanon, Syria and Iraq under its hegemonic sway. Unlike unruly Salafi jihadist groups that often turn on their own patrons, Iran has exercised effective command and control over its regional proxies, equipping them with latest know-how in warfare and weaponry as well as the use of sharp power to infiltrate and attack opponents. It has made them competent militias in their own right, fighting regional wars with greater strategic acumen and self-reliance. In fact, the inability of Salafi-jihadists to establish an enduring Islamic State has denied them the ability to promote proxies around the world and is the main cause of their failures. In comparison to Salafi jihadists and Israel, Iran has also proven to be more adept at running successful media and public relations campaigns that has been able to extinguish the flames of vengeance from its Sunni rivals in the Levant and by targeting mainly military sites in its attacks that has presented it as a more responsible military force to the world thus far. The impact of Iran’s mostly precise intermediate range ballistic missiles and drone attacks—making unprecedented forays into Israeli airspace, undermining its much-vaunted air defence systems and its supposed and still unverified nuclear status—seem to have captured the fancy of demoralised Arab masses, who are blaming Israel and not Iran for the plight of Palestinians, at least for now. Meanwhile, the theocratic state has also promoted its image as a champion of the developing world, voice of the Global South and supporter of humanitarian causes,10 even though it has conveniently ignored the plight of Uyghur Muslims to please the Chinese government and allegedly oppresses minorities and women within its borders. By focusing solely on the so-called ‘Far Enemy’—the West and Israel—Iran has successfully exploited the anti-liberal political discourse presently popular around the world and has upstaged the myopic Near Enemy outlook of Salafi jihadist groups like ISIS by calling them ‘takfiri’ (Muslims who commit the big sin of accusing fellow Muslims ‘kafir’).11 It is noteworthy that Shia theology like traditional Judaism practised political quietism for centuries as the community patiently awaits the manifestation of its promised saviour (the Divinely Guided Mahdi).12 Again like Zionism, Shia thinkers and clergy started advocating militant activism only in modern times, as Red Shiism of Shariati culminated into the Khomeini-led Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979. According to Shia tradition, only the most senior theologians (mujtahids), have the authority to declare a ‘defensive’ jihad, while only the 12th or ‘hidden’ Imam—who the Shia believe is still alive after disappearing 1,100 years ago—will declare an ‘offensive’ jihad on his return.13 Although most orthodox Sunni jurists also advocate defensive jihad, modern-day jihadists like Qutb, Faraj and Zawahiri ridicule the difference between ‘defensive’ and ‘offensive’ warfare,14 with ISIS being particularly notorious in killing the so-called Shia ‘Rafida’ (Rejectors of the First Three Pious Caliphs).15 The moot question here is how long Iran and its three main proxies—Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthis—sustain their ongoing campaign in West Asia? Can the Islamic Republic of Iran depend on Russian and Chinese support for a favourable resolution of the present conflict? Will the highly demoralised and weakened Arab states, that continue to suffer from the so-called Stockholm syndrome, switching loyalties from one regional hegemon to the other—championing the slogans of Abraham Accords and non-sectarian pan-Islamism in the same breath—ever hold their own? However, even in the current context of the beleaguered Arab states, continuing internecine sectarian feud and ever-escalating regional conflicts, the declining Salafi-jihadist threat can be discounted only at one’s own peril.

What Moldova And Georgia Showed Us About Pushback Against Russian...	By Andy Heil (RFE/RL) -- The election outcomes in Moldova and Georgia highlight the starkly differing ways their respective governments and civil society pushed back to resist Russian meddling and other nefarious elements at crucial junctures for both countries. The votes -- a presidential election and an EU constitutional referendum in Moldova and parliamentary elections in Georgia -- packed the potential to dramatically realign both former Soviet republics' geopolitical orientation or harden their current courses, with mounting challenges to both countries' strong public preferences for further EU integration. So the winners and losers matter. But some of the early lessons lie beyond their initial winners and suggest those votes can contribute to the playbook for other embattled societies -- including among more mature democracies as well as other countries on Russia's periphery. Counter Russian Influence Early Moldovan officials had warned for months of threats from Russia that included disinformation and facilitating millions in illicit payments for an informal network of anti-EU organizers. An analyst who spoke with Moldovan officials in the run-up to the voting quoted them to RFE/RL as saying, 'We can follow the money.' And while they couldn't stop the flow of cash from Russia, they saw it and publicly identified it for what it was. Georgia provided a lesson of a different sort. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze insisted as recently as last week that 'Russia has no influence in Georgia.' Caught up in a balancing act to avoid appearing overtly pro-Russian to a Russia-wary public, Georgian Dream simply ignored the problem and cast the choice as one between 'war' and 'peace.' As a result, even with President Salome Zurabishvili warning of Russian interference, it fell to the public to counter Moscow's economic leverage and the mobilization of pro-Russian influencers and media. Georgians and civil society groups were freshly energized by peaceful battles against the 'foreign-agent' law, popularly known as the 'Russian law,' and new curbs on the LGBT community, but experts told RFE/RL that preparations in the form of 'raising the alarm' and 'coalition building' actually began many months earlier. Integrity And Transparency Are Key Moldovan officials went on the offensive to protect the integrity of the country's elections, strengthening institutions and seeking to shut down illegal sources of potentially violent unrest. They also fended off cyberattacks and deepfakes, and publicly confronted what they regarded as false narratives. 'You name it, they did a good job defending against it,' Shelby Magid of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center told RFE/RL. Georgian ruling-party officials appeared less preoccupied with the potential for accusations of a flawed vote. Georgian public groups and civil society were left to pick up the slack. A dozen years into Georgian Dream's political dominance, such independent (and opposition) groups suggested before the vote that they were better prepared than in the past. That showed up in things like long-term observation of procedures, international cooperation, and hotlines for reporting violations. 'You name it, they were doing it,' Magid said. Cope With The Oligarchs In Moldova, officials spent the better part of two years battling the influence of Ilan Shor, a fugitive former oligarch convicted of massive fraud who is seemingly determined to steer the country's course toward Russia. Since banning his party last year, the government has kept up its pressure with public warnings and called out an alleged multimillion-dollar Shor network to organize opposition to the EU path, among other things. 'It's not just a single issue, it's more like a game of whack-a-mole -- you don't just get rid of Shor,' Magid said. In Georgia, the elephant in the room is Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire Georgian Dream founder who made his fortune in Russia. That challenge was far less black-and-white. Ivanishvili seems to be 'looking out for himself and has his own anti-democratic mind-set that aligns more with Russia,' said Magid, adding that those goals 'sometimes go hand-in-hand and other times they don't.' Don't Forget The Diaspora The tiny margin in the EU constitutional referendum and the disparity in perspectives to Chisinau's east and its west underscore the significance of the diaspora in the Moldovan votes. Moldovan officials used a variety of channels to encourage a sense of urgency and consequence to mobilize Moldovan voters abroad, particularly in the West, including through social media, cultural outreach, and increased voting sites. 'You've got to have a fire under you that your vote matters, and that information has to get to you,' Magid said. In Georgia, whose eligible expatriates are heavily concentrated in the West, governing officials appeared less keen on getting out the diaspora vote. It's easy to see why: Georgian Dream garnered just 15 percent support among emigre voters. With the opposition hopelessly fractured and myriad alternatives to Georgian Dream on the ballot, however, that did not translate into a clear mandate elsewhere.

For Iran, This Is A Pivotal US Presidential Election – Analysis	Next week’s US presidential election holds immense significance, particularly for the Iranian government, whose strategic decisions and foreign policies are often shaped by the American leadership. The outcome of this election could either tighten or loosen the complex web of international sanctions, economic constraints and geopolitical dynamics that surround Iran. For Tehran, it is not just another election taking place overseas but a decisive moment that could define its economic future, security posture and regional influence. Every shift in Washington’s power potentially realigns Iran’s ability to maneuver on the global stage and this election could very well set the course for the next crucial chapter in US-Iran relations, especially as tensions between Tehran and Israel have reached a critical point. This heightened volatility only amplifies the stakes of the US election, making it a pivotal moment for the region’s stability. Historically, Iran has paid exceptionally close attention to US presidential elections, far more than it does to any other nation’s electoral process. The reason for this is deeply rooted in the intertwined political and economic fates of both countries since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. In the span of more than four decades, Iran has witnessed the policies of eight US presidents — each bringing varying degrees of pressure, confrontation or negotiation. While some, like Jimmy Carter, saw diplomatic bridges begin to crumble with the hostage crisis, others such as Barack Obama tried to restore ties through agreements like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. Now, with the upcoming election, the stakes are higher than ever. Iran’s future is, in many ways, intricately connected to the decision American voters will make on Nov. 5. The policy divide between the two main candidates running for office, particularly regarding Iran, is vast and striking. On the one hand, Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, has consistently pushed for a return to the 'maximum pressure' campaign that defined his first term. This strategy involved imposing harsh sanctions on Iran’s crucial energy sector, aiming to cripple the country’s economy and force its hand on issues like nuclear development and regional influence. Trump’s policy also targeted countries and corporations that violated US-imposed sanctions on Iran, isolating Tehran even further on the world stage. Under this approach, Iran’s already fragile economy would likely suffer immensely, creating a bleak outlook for its future. On the other hand, Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Democratic presidential nominee, is expected to continue the Biden administration’s policies, which emphasize diplomacy over confrontation. The Biden administration has shown restraint, particularly in its dealings with Iran, seeking to rebuild diplomatic bridges, and Harris is likely to follow suit. When it comes to Iran’s nuclear program, Harris would probably push for a return to the JCPOA, the nuclear deal that Trump famously abandoned. A Harris administration would aim to bring Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement, potentially offering relief from sanctions in exchange for stricter oversight of its nuclear activities. This approach stands in stark contrast to Trump’s confrontational policies. It is also important to point out that the timing of the upcoming US election is crucial, occurring at a moment when tensions between Iran and Israel have reached unprecedented heights. Over the last year, the two nations have edged closer to direct military confrontation, crossing numerous red lines along the way. Both Israeli and Iranian forces have engaged in retaliatory strikes, with the risk of full-scale war looming over the region. The stakes of this election are, therefore, even more significant, as the policies of the next US president could either fuel or quell this explosive situation. A return to Trump’s more aggressive stance might escalate the conflict, while a more diplomatic approach could create opportunities for de-escalation. The current Biden-Harris administration has taken a more measured approach regarding the Iran-Israel conflict, attempting to prevent further escalation. For instance, the White House has urged caution when it comes to Israel’s military actions, especially in relation to Iran’s nuclear sites. The current administration seems to be focused on diplomacy as a key tool for resolving these issues, in contrast to the hawkish rhetoric of the Trump era. However, should Trump return to office, the chances of a more hard-line stance are high. He recently expressedsupport for Israel launching strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, signaling that a second Trump administration would likely ramp up the pressure on Tehran, bringing the region closer to open conflict. It is worth noting that the Iranian government has already endured four years of the Trump administration’s 'maximum pressure' policy and the consequences were severe. Iran’s oil exports, once a major source of revenue, plummeted to record lows. The sanctions crippled the economy, causing the Iranian currency to lose much of its value, which in turn sparked inflation and widespread economic hardships. The government in Tehran struggled to manage these crises, as financial resources dwindled and social unrest grew. Trump’s economic warfare left deep scars on the Iranian economy and a return to such policies would likely exacerbate these challenges, leaving the Iranian government in an even more precarious position. It is also critical to recall the unprecedented actions taken by the Trump administration, such as the targeted killing of Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. This move, which shocked the world, escalated tensions between the US and Iran to new heights. For the first time in recent memory, the two nations stood on the brink of war. The assassination was a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of Trump’s foreign policy, which Iran has not forgotten. The specter of further such confrontations looms if Trump is reelected. In conclusion, as the world watches the US presidential election, the Iranian government is more invested in the outcome than ever before. The stakes for Tehran are incredibly high, as the gap between the two candidates’ policies on Iran is vast. While one candidate may bring renewed pressure and confrontation, the other offers the possibility of diplomacy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOz7gsD9-0jB4	2024-10-31T17:06:42-07:00	
Iran: Growing International Pressure To Designate IRGC As A Terro...	For over forty years, the Iranian opposition has warned about the threat posed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In this regard, the opposition has made extensive efforts through documented disclosures, gatherings, protests, conferences, interviews, books, book tables, and more, to reveal the IRGC’s wide-ranging activities and global terrorism. However, a world inclined towards appeasement did not hear or chose not to hear, turning a blind eye. Now, after a year of warmongering by the clerical regime in the region, the IRGC’s role as the enforcer and arm of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s rule in continuing and expanding conflicts has become more evident. Consequently, international pressure has increased to designate this criminal entity as a terrorist organization. European Parliament Session On October 22, the European Parliament held an official session in Strasbourg dedicated to examining the regime’s state-sponsored terrorism. During this session, European representatives from various parties condemned the regime’s role in violence against women, suppression of dissidents, destabilizing the region, warmongering, terrorism on European soil, threats to Iranian refugees in Europe, cyber attacks, and more. However, their primary demand was for the IRGC to be listed as a terrorist organization. In this context, MEP Javier Zarzalejos stated, 'Can anyone doubt that the Iranian regime sponsors, promotes, and finances terrorism in Europe?' MEP Petras Auštrevičius from Lithuania, stressing the importance of designating the IRGC as a terrorist entity and said, 'We must take concrete action at the EU level to stop the Iranian regime’s terrorism at sea and on land.' In line with this, Francisco Assis, MEP from Portugal, pointed out that Iran’s regime has become a key exporter of terrorism. 'Iran is a society held hostage by religious fundamentalists who are now exporting terror beyond the Middle East to Europe.' Polish MEP Adam Bielan stated that it is essential that all member states unite to recognize the IRGC as a terrorist organization and stressed that this is not merely symbolic but a necessary step to protect citizens and uphold international law. Kristoffer Storm, MEP from Denmark, equated the mullahs’ regime and the IRGC, stressing, that the Iranian regime and the IRGC have conducted terrorist attacks in other EU member states. He stressed that Europe must send a strong message and place the IRGC on the terrorist list. Finally, Helena Dalli, the European Commissioner for Equality, pointed to numerous European Parliament resolutions and various EU sanctions against the IRGC, confirming support for listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization. However, she also reminded the assembly that this step requires a political decision and depends on a unanimous decision by the European Council’s 27 member states. Protests by Opposition Supporters in Strasbourg At the same time as the European Parliament session, Iranian compatriots and freedom-loving Iranians held a rally and protest in front of the institution. They protested the international community’s forty-year delay in condemning the IRGC, and through their fervent slogans, they conveyed the urgent demands of the Iranian people to the European representatives. One of the largest banners at this impressive gathering read: 'Honor the will of the Iranian people and the vote of Europeans by including the IRGC in the terrorist list.' Request for Prominent Figures for IRGC Proscription On the same day (October 22, 2024), an article by several prominent French human rights advocates called for the IRGC’s designation. Former Columbian Presidential Candidate Ingrid Betancourt; Pierre Bercis, president of New Human Rights Foundation; Emile Blessig, head of the former Parliamentarians Group; Yves Bonnet, former director of national intelligence; writer Pascal Bruckner; Jean-François Legaret, head of the Middle East Studies Foundation; and Gilles Paruelle, former president of the Val-d’Oise Bar Association, published a joint article titled 'Why It Is Necessary to Designate the IRGC as a Terrorist Organization' in Journal Du Dimanche. In the article, they criticized the European Union, stating, 'Despite calls from the European Parliament (EP) to add the IRGC to the list of terrorist entities, Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative, blocked the initiative by requiring a judicial decision from an EU member state. However, evidence linking the IRGC to acts of terrorism is plentiful. Tehran does not view the EU’s inaction as wisdom but as weakness.' Comprehensive Blows to the IRGC One year after the regime’s warmongering in Gaza and the actions of its IRGC-backed proxy forces, the regime’s main arm now faces attacks from all angles. The international community has recognized this vulnerability and has increased its pressure. At the same time, Iran’s rebellious youth continue to target IRGC and Basij centers without interruption. The comprehensive weakening and disintegration of the IRGC, which the regime spent decades building up, represents yet another strategic loss for the regime and another indication of its inevitable downfall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO3cf8a9TqVhz	2024-10-31T17:05:26-07:00	
The Battle To Shape Trump’s China Policy – Analysis	By Tanner Greer (FPRI) -- This week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board asked Donald Trump why China would not invade Taiwan on his watch. Trump told the Journal that the Chinese would not dare to invade. As Trump put it: '[Xi Jinping] knows that I am f—ing crazy.' One must pity the Chinese analyst asked to predict what a second Trump administration will mean for U.S.-Chinese relations. Like Richard Nixon before him, Trump is ready to play the lunatic; he clearly believes that the less predictable he is to the Chinese, the better off America will be. Though China occupies a central place in Trump’s campaign rhetoric, his campaign has not published or endorsed any detailed China policy proposals. The actions of the last Trump administration do not provide a better guide. Divided by infighting, its China policy was not consistent. At times, Trump’s foreign policy swung wildly as specific individuals rose or fell from his favor. Things do not get much easier if one looks at the views of the politicians and policy wonks that Trump would call on in a second administration. Their views are varied. Among Trump’s closest allies, we find fundamental disagreements on the proper ends and proper means of American strategy toward China. Given these hurdles. I will not try to predict the path a second Trump administration might tread. It seems more useful to lay out a few observations on the different schools of thought now contending for leadership of that policy. My observations are shaped by the dozens of interviews I have conducted over the last two months with Republican staffers, think tankers, and former officials. A longer and more thorough report of my findings will be published by FPRI later this year. This is a pre-election preview. The questions that divided Republicans in 2017 are not the questions that will divide them in 2025. Trump’s election shattered a policy consensus shared by the leaders of both parties for the better part of four decades. Many of the architects of this consensus were still influential during Trump’s first years in office. On the other hand, many who rejected 'engagement' with China had spent years exiled from power. Others were completely new to service in the executive branch. This was a diverse group who did not all reject engagement for the same reasons. These differences were not initially apparent, as their objections were too marginal to the pre-Trump policy debates for much scrutiny to be given to them. Nor was it immediately apparent to these officials where the new bounds of public opinion or presidential approval lay. Thrust into power quite suddenly, they were forced to improvise as they went—and improvise again as the Chinese reaction to Trump’s trade war changed the context in which they worked. All of these factors gave China policy under Trump 1.0 an unusually chaotic flavor. None of these conditions hold this election season. The architects of engagement are no longer relevant. A tough line on China is now taken as a starting point for all factions involved. Over the last eight years, a new ecosystem of conservative think tanks, policy journals, and Congressional offices has sprouted up to provide Trumpism with the intellectual coherence it lacked in 2017. Policy proposals are now numerous and detailed. Out of power, former Trump officials have had the time to carefully lay out their vision for American strategy in Asia. They have done this in speeches, policy reports, and full-length books. Disagreements between their different schools of thought are formally debated on both panels and podcasts. Points of Consensus and Conflict in Trump World Amid these debates, one finds several points of consensus. The disputing intellectuals, wonks, and politicians all agree that China is the most significant foreign policy problem the United States now faces. They describe China as a challenge that must be met in many dimensions: military, economic, and technological (some would add 'ideological' to this list, but that is a point of debate, not consensus). Republicans agree that the U.S. armed forces are poorly structured and lack the resources needed to counter the military challenge posed by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). They agree that America’s commercial and financial relationship with China underwrote the rise of a powerful rival while undermining America’s own industrial base. They believe that China has taken advantage of the traditional American commitment to globalization and free markets, and that doubling down on this commitment is foolish. To level the playing field, some mix of tariffs, export controls, capital controls, and industrial policy is necessary. They agree that the Biden administration’s China policy—while an improvement on that of the Obama administration—has nonetheless been feckless. They believe that the Biden administration articulates geopolitical goals that it has not resourced, cares too much about perceptions of amity, cares too little about perceptions of strength, and has not sold the American people on its foreign policy priorities. But behind this consensus lie many fundamental disagreements. The debates about China policy can be largely sifted into two buckets: economics and geopolitics. It is common for individuals to be closely allied in the economic sphere but not in the geopolitical sphere, or vice versa. For example, senators Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance are close allies on the economic front; there are few meaningful distinctions between the economic strategy each endorses. Their respective takes on the geopolitical problem posed by China are much harder to reconcile. In theory, one’s position on the CHIPS Act or tariff rates might influence one’s position on military commitments to Taiwan or military aid to Ukraine. In practice, this is rarely so. The economic and geopolitical debates occur on different planes. One way to represent the core principles at play in the geopolitical debate is with a classic two-by-two matrix (popularized on the internet as a 'political compass'). Optimism vs. Pessimism On the x axis I place the single most important difference between the various schools of thought: assessments of American power and state capacity. Where one falls in many of the most prominent debates—such as 'Can the United States can afford to support both Ukraine and Taiwan?' or 'Should the ultimate goal of our China policy be victory over the Communist Party of China, or should it be détente?'—has less to do with one’s assessment of China and more to do with one’s assessment of the United States. What resources can we muster for competition with China? Just how large are our stores of money, talent, and political will? Those on the right quadrants of my diagram provide pessimistic answers to these questions. They buttress their case with measurables: steel produced, ships at sea, interest paid on the federal deficit, or the percentage of an ally’s gross domestic product spent on defense. Against these numbers are placed fearsome statistics of Chinese industrial capacity and PLA power. Changes in technology, which favor shore-based precision munitions at the expense of more costly planes and ships, further erode the American position. This is a new and uncomfortable circumstance. The last time the United States waged war without overwhelming material superiority was in 1812. To those who see American power through this frame, there is only one logical response: the United States must limit its ambitions. This means either radically reprioritizing defense commitments to focus on China or retreating from conflict with China altogether. Those on the left two quadrants see things differently. Where the pessimists see settled facts, the optimists see possibilities. The optimists recognize many of the same trends as the pessimists, but view them as self-inflicted mistakes that can, and should, be reversed. An inadequate defense budget is not a law of the universe but a political choice. If Trump wins, he will choose otherwise. Implicit in the optimist view is a longer time horizon—there is still time to turn things around. But this window will not be open forever. Optimists fear that pessimistic assessments erode the political will needed to make changes while change is still possible. The arguments between pessimists and optimists could be reframed as a matter of risk. The pessimists are most worried about the downside risks of a crisis with China in the near future (c. 2025–28). The optimists balance that possibility against the longer-term risks America will face as it withdraws from other regions of the world or abandons defense capabilities that are not needed in the Pacific theater. Optimists believe this second class of risks is large, and that the United States should not court them. Even an America in desperate need of defense reform has some capacity to 'walk and chew gum at the same time.' This issue is at the crux of their arguments on Ukraine: in material terms, aid to Ukraine is not coming at Taiwan’s expense. It is relatively cheap. What stops America from helping both beleaguered nations? The pessimists do not view that question purely in material terms. In their debates, the pessimists are quick to highlight the few weapons systems being shipped across the Atlantic that might be used in the Pacific, but their critique reaches higher than this. The costs of the war in Ukraine (and the Middle East) are measured not just in bullets, but in attention and effort: There are only so many minutes the National Security Council may meet. Washington can only have a few items on its agenda at any given time. The executive branch is stodgy, slow, and captive to bureaucratic interests; the legislative branch is rancorous, partisan, and captive to public opinion; the American public does not care a whit about the world abroad. Accomplishing anything meaningful in the United States—much less the drastic defense reforms both sides of the debate agree are necessary—requires singular attention and will. If this seems like a pessimistic take on the American system—well, it is one. It is common for people in the optimistic quadrants to argue that the People’s Republic of China is riddled with internal contradictions. In a long-term competition between the two systems, they are confident that these contradictions will eat China from the inside out, and that America’s free and democratic order will eventually emerge victorious. None of the pessimists I interview make similar predictions. If they have anything to say about internal contradictions, it is American contradictions they focus on. Power-Based vs. Values-Based Perspectives So much for the optimist-pessimist divide. What of the y axis? I think of this as a pole, with 'power-based' perspectives on one hand and 'values-based' perspectives on the other. Republicans in the top two quadrants ground their arguments in cold calculations of realpolitik. From this perspective, international politics is first and foremost a competition for power. States seek power. The prosperity, freedom, and happiness of any nation depend on how much power its government can wield on the world stage. While states might compete for power in many domains, military power is the most important. A state frustrated by a trade war might escalate to a real war, but a state locked in deadly combat has no outside recourse. The buck stops with the bullet. From the power-based perspective, then, the goal of American strategy must be the maximization of American power, with military force as the ultimate arbiter of that power. This force does not need to be realized in combat—ideally, its deterrent power will be strong enough that it is never actively used. The ideal means of American strategy is a military posture and alliance system strong enough to deter the Chinese from resorting to war. The left and right quadrants of this perspective disagree on the best way to build that sort of power. The upper right quadrant—the prioritizers—do not believe America will ever possess power sufficient to compel China into submission; a stable détente between the two countries is the best outcome that America can attain. Even this modest aim will only be possible if the United States prioritizes the threat posed by China above all others. Those who argue from the upper left quadrant—the primacists—also speak the language of realpolitik. They maintain, however, that the sacrifices the prioritizers propose will weaken American power. They believe that the existing American alliance system contributes to America’s strength today and will contribute to America’s potential strength in the future. Instead of limiting American aims, the primacists are more concerned with expanding American means. They are confident this can be done if the American people have the confidence to do so. The lower two quadrants, whose arguments I label 'values-based,' operate under a different frame. The people in these quadrants believe that American foreign policy should not be evaluated by a single variable. They see connections between what America does abroad and what America is like at home. They have strong values-based commitments to specific ways of life that are expressed in their vision for American strategy. I have labelled those in the bottom left quadrant 'internationalists' because of how often they invoke the phrase 'liberal international order.' This group believes that America and its allies are knit together not only by shared security interests, but also by shared values. In fact, the values shared by the liberal bloc explain why these countries share security interests in the first place. China is an authoritarian power whose influence operations threaten the integrity of democracies across the world. Many internationalists view this political-ideological threat as the most dangerous that China poses. Those in this quadrant are especially skeptical of détente; they do not believe permanent compromise with China is possible. They attribute Chinese belligerence to the communist political system that governs the country. For them, tensions in U.S.-Chinese relations are less the expected clashes between a rising power and the ruling hegemon than a battle between two incompatible social systems. Pointing to the close cooperation that ties Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China together, the internationalists argue (contra the prioritizers) that the world is gripped in a general contest between liberal order and resurgent authoritarianism whose different parts cannot be disentangled from each other. Those in the bottom right quadrant—the restrainers—also think about foreign affairs through a regime lens, but the belligerent regime in question is their own. Republican restrainers link the liberal international order to the free trade agreements all Trumpists despise and the administrative 'deep state' all Trumpists distrust. They see the liberal international order as an international extension of the progressive order they are trying to tear down at home. There are echoes of the 1960s New Left in the restrainer argument. Both the new left of yesterday and the new right of today are rebellions against 'the establishment.' Both reject the pieties of their day; both see a bloated national security state as a symbol of the dehumanizing values they reject. Both groups correctly point out that there is no natural limit to the quest for primacy. Both argue that a totalizing foreign policy will lead to the bureaucratization of American life. Only the most radical restrainers are ready for a 21st-century march on the Pentagon. Most aim for an easier target: a relatively modest foreign policy. Instead of defending an entire international order, it is enough to defend America. Instead of deterring authoritarianism, it is enough to deter China. China does not need to be defeated—it is enough to convince the Chinese to accept some sort of détente. This is all pretty similar to the ends sought by the prioritizers. Little wonder so many of the primacists and internationalists I interviewed believed the prioritizers were restrainers in disguise! Again and again I heard this accusation made: prioritizer arguments are just an attempt to make isolationism sexy. The prioritizers do not actually believe in realpolitik—realpolitik is just a respectable way to attack the existing international order they despise. There is an irony to this critique. Just as primacists and internationalists condemn the false face of the prioritizers, so the prioritizers and the restrainers condemn the false face of the primacists! Many of those I interviewed insisted that their primacist opponents made such-and-such argument not for the realpolitik reasons they professed, but because of their (hidden) commitment to liberal ideals. Ideals that cannot be defended on their own merits had to be prettied up with talk of hard power. All of these suspicions of subterfuge are overblown. Both primacists and prioritizers believe the arguments they make. Yet their suspicions are revealing! All sides clearly believe there is political advantage in couching one’s arguments in realpolitik logic. That fact alone tells us something about the likely contours of a Trump presidency—and perhaps the beliefs of Trump himself.

The Development Of Global Barter Trade – Analysis	By He Yan Amid shifts in the geopolitical landscape and U.S. financial sanctions, several countries and regions are increasingly turning to barter trade for cross-border transactions. The Ural customs in Russia recently signed its first barter contract with a Chinese company. This transaction was conducted without cash, relying solely on the exchange of equivalent goods. There have been successful examples of barter trade between China and other countries in the past. In 2019, China executed a palm oil trade worth nearly USD 150 million with Malaysia, exchanging it for construction services, natural resource products, and civilian equipment. In 2021, a Chinese company exported USD 2 million in automotive parts to Iran in return for an equivalent value in pistachios. These instances highlight the growing significance of barter trade as a viable option in cross-border commerce. The origins of barter trade can be traced back to the late stages of primitive society. During this period, with the production of surplus goods and the further development of the social division of labor, exchanges of items began to occur both within and between clans and tribes, thus the emergence of the primitive form of barter trade. In ancient China, barter trade also held significant importance. For instance, during the Han Dynasty, barter trade along the Silk Road facilitated the exchange of Chinese silk and silk products for local specialties such as precious furs and fine horses from Central Asia, West Asia, and even Europe. From around the 1950s, modern barter trade began to appear in the United States and gradually gained traction in countries like Canada and Australia. It became an important means of reducing cash transactions, boosting sales, minimizing inventory buildup, expanding new customer bases, and entering new markets. By the 1990s, advancements in internet technology further propelled the development of modern barter trade through the integration of e-commerce. Statistics indicate that 20% to 30% of world trade is conducted through barter. Among the Fortune 500 companies, 80% have established barter departments, and approximately 470,000 companies in the UK actively engage in barter trade. By 2016, contemporary barter trade accounted for 30% of the total global import and export value. The period before the COVID-19 pandemic marked a phase of rapid growth for China’s cross-border barter trade under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The escalation of the pandemic, alongside regional geopolitical conflicts, had severely disrupted global supply chain stability, negatively impacting production and consumption processes and hindering economic recovery. Cross-border barter trade emerged as a means to safeguard material supplies and mitigate supply chain risks. For instance, due to economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries, Russia's traditional foreign trade channels were disrupted. In response, its Ministry of Finance allowed its domestic companies to engage in cross-border barter trade to ensure stable supplies within the country. Additionally, under the economic sanctions led by the U.S., Pakistani companies engaging in financial transactions with Russia faced penalties, resulting in significant difficulties for Pakistan in acquiring essential production materials. To address these issues, in June 2023, Pakistan announced a barter trade agreement with Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and other countries to import products such as crude oil, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, wheat, and steel. This move partially circumvented the economic sanctions and ensured the stability of domestic supplies. Similarly, due to fluctuations in international crude oil prices caused by the Ukraine crisis, the Philippines faced considerable pressure on oil imports. Public sentiment in the Philippines called for the revival of barter trade among ASEAN countries to secure stable oil supplies from nations like Malaysia. Therefore, considering the practical needs of relevant countries, the development of cross-border barter trade is both necessary and urgent. The development of the global economy today is marked by deglobalization, regionalization, and even fragmentation. Previously, many believed that the era of global economic integration was crucial for the growth of barter trade, as friendly relations between countries and cooperation among global economies fostered a conducive environment for barter transactions. However, in light of the changes in the international economic and trade system, the deepening of trade barriers, and the challenges facing regional financial transactions, barter trade has emerged as a powerful avenue for cross-border trade. On one hand, barter trade can alleviate or even resolve issues of cash shortages and excess inventory for businesses. In recent years, various industries have faced significant economic challenges, with small and medium-sized enterprises being particularly affected. Problems such as inventory buildup and tight cash flow have become obstacles to business development, which can be addressed through barter platforms. These platforms aggregate supply and demand information from both domestic and international markets, helping businesses find suitable matches for their needs and resources. The core principle of barter trade is to 'exchange what one has for what is needed'. This allows companies to trade surplus goods for necessary materials, reducing inventory accumulation and reliance on cash flow. In our contemporary world, barter trade leverages the internet to integrate resources, effectively addressing issues of poor information flow and overcoming the conventional constraints of time and geography. On the other hand, barter trade can serve as a temporary solution for economies under sanctions. Direct barter transactions simplify the currency exchange process, mitigate the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, and helps alleviate material shortages, improve resource allocation efficiency, and enhance living standards. For example, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic forced Sri Lanka's tourism industry which was an important source of foreign exchange revenue of the country, to come to a halt. Insufficient foreign exchange reserves prevented Sri Lanka from continuing to purchase crude oil, leading to the shutdown of domestic refineries in 2021 and causing significant difficulties for the public. Additionally, the shortage of foreign exchange reserves hindered Sri Lanka's ability to repay a USD 250 million oil debt owed to Iran since 2012. On the Iranian side, U.S. sanctions that included tea severely reduced its tea import volumes, resulting in tight supplies of related domestic products. Consequently, the two countries signed a 'Tea-for-Oil' barter trade agreement in 2021, stipulating that starting in 2023, Sri Lanka would trade Ceylon tea with Iran to settle its oil debts. This initiative alleviated the economic challenges faced by both sides and achieved a mutually beneficial outcome. In fact, barter trade also has certain limitations, including value assessment, demand matching, and credit risk, among others. Nevertheless, it reflects the willingness of emerging market countries to seek diversified cooperation and collectively face challenges amid changes in the global economic landscape. While the dollar-dominated financial system remains large and stable, it is also true that an increasing number of countries are pursuing diversified trade settlement methods. Therefore, there is potential for the global trading system to become fairer and more equitable through the development of diversified trading methods like barter. Final analysis conclusion: Influenced by changes in geopolitical situations and U.S. financial sanctions, cross-border barter trade is gradually emerging as an important form of international trade. Although barter trade has certain limitations, its necessity and urgency remain significant given the real needs of many economies. Additionally, the widespread adoption of this trade method reflects the willingness of emerging market countries to seek diversified cooperation and collectively face challenges amid changes in the global economic landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO0D2j6aFUYXw	2024-10-31T17:00:42-07:00	
India’s Godmen Cast A Shadow On Society – Analysis	By Balachander Palanisamy In July 2024, 121 people were killed in a stampede in Hathras in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The stampede occurred during a religious congregation led by self-styled godman Narayan Sakar Hari, also known as ‘Bhole Baba’. It was triggered when his followers rushed to touch his feet and collect the coloured powder he had walked on. Aside from administrative failures and crowd-control measures, blame should also be directed at politicians who exploit the godmen’s followers for political gain and the vestiges of the caste system hidden in Hindu society. The political connections of godmen such as Bhole Baba are crucial when they face trouble. After the 2024 stampede, organisers and volunteers were named in the initial police report and several arrests were made, including Bhole Baba’s close aide Dev Prakash Madhukar. Yet despite intense public scrutiny, Bhole Baba was not charged. Gurus have historically made personal financial gains from their quid pro quo relationship with politicians. One such guru with national popularity — Baba Ramdev — has received financial inducements for his controversial company Patanjali. The company has received more than an estimated $US46 million in discounts for land acquisitions in states controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP leaders have also given tacit endorsement to the company, which has seemingly driven the guru’s billion dollar consumer products business. Godmen’s influence over their followers ensures politicians seek their support, hoping to consolidate their votes and use them as mouthpieces for their policies. Politicians across party lines, from the BJP’s Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to the Indian National Congress (INC)’s Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly member Kamal Nath, count themselves among the followers of the self-styled guru Baba Bageshwar. In August 2023, the Indian National Congress even invited Baba Bageshwar — despite his views being contrary to the party’s — to an event during the state’s election season. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also courted popular godmen such as Ravi Shankar, Baba Ramdev and Sadhguru. A deep dive into the Prime Minister’s website, which contains archives of press releases and meetings with these self-styled gurus, reveals that Modi seems to favour Ravi Shankar who is mentioned more than 35 times, compared to Baba Ramdev’s 20 and Sadhguru’s 9 mentions. Both Ravi Shankar and Baba Ramdev had vocally supported Modi’s demonetisation plan, a widely unpopular scheme aimed at rooting out corruption. These cults persist in Indian society because Hindu nationalist groups like the BJP openly support them, as their practices are similar to Hinduism. The godmen often perceive themselves as incarnations of Hindu gods — for example, Bhole Baba has been construed as the Hindu god Shiva and Krishna. The BJP’s governance galvanises existing groups and emboldens new ones to emerge. Some godmen offer their followers a more disciplined and productive path, which appeals to successive governments as they ensure social order. Godmen cults have given their largely lower-caste followers a sense of worth and belonging. Hinduism offers no equality between upper and lower castes, instead practising discrimination against Dalits — members of the lowest caste. The majority of Bhole Baba’s devotees are poor, landless, illiterate, lower caste Jatavs and Dalits deemed outcastes by the social stratification (varna) system of Hinduism. Bhole Baba himself is from the Dalit community. Over time, he became a religious preacher and established a religious retreat (ashram) in his native village. Bhole Baba’s popularity reflects the eagerness of Dalits to claim an alternative religiosity for social and economic mobility. Charismatic godmen, especially from lower caste communities in Punjab and Haryana, hold religious congregations (deras) and have millions of followers. They offer economic opportunities denied by the rigid caste system to the downtrodden — thousands of Dalits earn their living working at deras and their properties, while thousands more receive indirect employment through contracts and general upkeep. Followers become economically and spiritually dependent on the gurus, so when a guru is arrested, their lives are completely upended and they are left with very little alternative but to rally around their leader. In August 2017, more than 30 people died in the riots that followed the conviction and 20-year prison sentence of self-styled guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for rape. Although there are laws protecting Dalits and affirmative action programs, few manage to escape the vicious cycle of poverty and caste. The major political parties — BJP and INC — remain more occupied with political manoeuvring rather than proposing equitable policies. They frequently accuse each other of being ‘anti-Dalit’ while prioritising the interests of the upper castes. Discussions around reservation quotas and upward mobility peak during pre-election season and fade afterwards. The recent incident in Hathras shows that the underclasses in India still lack caste equality, social justice and sufficient economic opportunities. It is little wonder that the void left by the government and politicians is being filled by charismatic gurus offering chances at a better life. There is no doubt whom the oppressed will choose to follow. About the author: Balachander Palanisamy is an independent researcher and intelligence analyst.

Assessing The Political And Military Scope Of Israel’s Strikes On...	By Can Kasapoğlu Israel’s Aerial Assault: An Overview Israel used around 100 combat aircraft, and possibly drone warfare systems, to execute its aerial assault on Iran. Attacking in three waves, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted Tehran’s missile manufacturing capabilities and strategic air defense architecture. Israel’s target set clearly suggests it intended to erode Iran’s critical missile production capacity and facilitate further military action if the conflict escalates. But an examination of what Israel refrained from targeting is equally important for understanding the geopolitical implications of the strikes. Israel’s relative restraint reflects the Biden administration’s unwillingness to retaliate against Iranian aggression in kind and at scale. Assessing the Operational Concepts of Israel’s Strikes Videos released by the Israeli Air Force reveal that F-15 and F-16 tactical military aviation platforms took part in its strikes on Iran. The limited availability of information makes it impossible to confirm whether Israel used F-35 fifth-generation stealth aircraft. But it is plausible that the F-35’s state-of-the-art sensors and command and control capabilities played a role in the campaign. Additional evidence suggests that Israel employed air-launched standoff aeroballistic missiles in the attack. These missiles possess highly destructive warheads and long effective ranges. This allowed Israel’s non-stealth, fourth-generation airframes to stay out of range of Tehran’s air defenses while striking high-priority sites in Iran. In addition, the IDF likely kept multiple combat search-and-rescue teams on high alert while its strike packages were in the skies. Israel’s target set focused on Iran’s missile and drone production hubs and strategic surface-to-air missile (SAM) network. The targets Israel struck at Parchin and Khojir play important roles in the manufacture of solid-propellant missiles like the Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballistic missile that Iran used in its October 1 attack on Israel. Because facilities at Parchin are also involved in Tehran’s nuclear program, this attack sent a strong message about what Israel might strike next if Iran escalates further. Open-source satellite imagery reveals that Israel inflicted significant damage to Iranian solid fuel mixing buildings and storage warehouses. Israeli forces also struck the Shahroud missile complex. This facility is essential for the proliferation of high-end projectiles like the Fattah and Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballistic missiles, as well as for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program. Prior to its strikes, the IDF eliminated air defenses in Syria to pave the way for its attacks on the Islamic Republic. Although press sources also reported a similar action in Iraq, this report could not confirm it. Israel also systematically eliminated Iran’s long-range air defenses, most notably the Russian S-300 strategic SAMs Tehran used to protect its critical energy infrastructure and ports. In the process, the Israeli Air Force killed several Iranian air defense servicemen. Imagery intelligence also suggests that the Israeli Air Force hit several of Iran’s Ghadir radar installations, hosting derivatives of Russian Rezonans-NE radar systems designed to detect stealth aircraft. In recent years, the Islamic Republic has fielded these sensor complexes to augment its air defense architecture. Russian sources claim that Iran has shown particular interest in Rezonans-NE radars to address the threat that F-35 aircraft pose to its airspace. Unless Russia can quickly replace these systems with new S-300s or S-400s and capable radar complexes (while also meeting its own needs in its highly attritional war in Ukraine), Iran will lack any meaningful air defense against Israeli follow-on strikes. Operational Constraints on Israel While Israel’s air raids went beyond mere surgical strikes, the attack carefully avoided Iran’s energy infrastructure and most sites involved in Tehran’s nuclear program. Israel, moreover, did not target high-level members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps or Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s inner circle. The Biden administration was not the only constraint on the scope of Israel’s strikes. Israel’s weapons stockpiles are also a factor. Iran’s large salvos of medium-range ballistic missiles have depleted Israel’s stocks of high-altitude anti-ballistic missile systems with exoatmospheric interception features. Given the offense-dominant characteristics of missile warfare, Israel is quickly running out of interceptors for its Arrow family of anti–ballistic missile systems. While Israel’s defense technological and industrial base has increased its production rates for these systems as security in the Middle East has deteriorated, Israel’s industrial capacity still lags what it needs. Moreover, since the Arrow 3 is designed to prevent nuclear fallout by intercepting ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction at the exoatmospheric level, Israel needs to preserve these interceptors. As a result, Israel has to rely on Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systemssupplied and operated by United States forces even though US stockpiles of these systems are low. What’s Next? Israel’s strikes did considerable damage to Iran’s missile production capabilities and strategic air defenses while avoiding any direct hits on the Islamic Republic’s energy infrastructure or its leaders. Continued restraints from the Biden administration ahead of US elections, as well as the Israeli government’s desire to avoid an extended exchange with Iran that would stress the IDF’s interceptor stockpiles, will likely temper Israel’s actions moving forward. As such, Tehran’s response to Israel will set the near-term trajectory of the conflict. Should Iran repeat its October 1 strikes by launching a barrage of long-range assets, Israel could respond by targeting Iran’s oil facilities, ports, nuclear program, and leadership.

The Great Retreat: How Trump And Harris Are Looking Backward – Op...	By William L. Anderson The Kamala Harris–Tim Walz presidential campaign declares: 'We Won’t Go Back.' They believe that progressivism’s advance should not be reversed, something they claim Donald Trump would do. No one need worry about a second Trump presidency reversing the 'gains' of progressivism, but the Harris-Walz campaign’s chosen slogan is ironic, given that Harris is reaching back a half century for her economic programs. For all the talk of 'new ideas' and the 'freshness' of the Harris candidacy, much of her economic platform echoes the same progressivism that has been driving the US economy toward a repeat of the 1970s stagflation—but with the added 'bonus' of $35 trillion of national debt. The future Harris administration wants to further increase Donald Trump’s economic plans, on the other hand, reach back to the nineteenth century for tariffs, which he mistakenly believes were responsible for American prosperity. This article covers the candidates’ economic platforms to examine their possible effects. Unfortunately, neither candidate has a realistic view of the US economy, in which the government’s programs of borrowing, spending, and using the Federal Reserve System to underwrite vast military expenditures, unwise political schemes, and other wish list items, abound. Kamala Harris We begin with Harris, since she seems to be leading in the polls. If the trends hold, she will be sworn into office in January, and then she will try to make her campaign rhetoric our economic reality. Harris is part of an administration that has an economic track record that can be described by one word: intervention. She has not put forth a single initiative that even a moderate freemarket advocate could endorse. Looking at the proposed policies on her campaign website, there are few, if any, proposals that address the causes and effects of massive inflation, borrowing, and spending. Other than her tax credit proposal—which would require an act of Congress to implement—her agenda is simple campaign rhetoric. Here are some of her plans: a national program of rent controls a national plan to build three million new housing units to 'ease the housing shortage' a '$40 billion innovation fund—doubling a similar pot of money created by the Biden administration—for businesses building affordable rental housing units' $25,000 down payment grants to first-time home buyers preventing investors from purchasing rental housing anti-price-gouging laws that force food producers to lower prices negotiating with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices increasing the Child Tax Credit to $3,600 per child and expanding it to include a $6,000 tax credit for newborn children Harris also has floated new taxes, including a 25 percent tax on unrealized capital gains of more than $100 million. Her tax proposals What is more significant is what she has not said in her campaign. Other than to claim her 'values have not changed,' Harris has not recycled the proposals from her short-lived 2020 primary campaign. In 2019, she called for the elimination of private health insurance (to be replaced by a government 'Medicare for All' plan) and for a ban on fracking, a process used to extract natural gas and oil, which is responsible for making the US a world leader in energy production. The hard Left supported those proposals, and if Harris had her way, Americans would have to deal with mass confusion in medical care and massive energy shortages. If Harris didn’t understand that point then, she probably does now, especially given that almost 5 percent of all employment in Pennsylvania, a swing state, is tied to fracking, but one is left wondering if President Harris would later pursue those disastrous policies anyway. Her most recent public economic declaration came, ironically, on August 15, the same day President Richard Nixon announced wage and price controls and officially disconnected the dollar from gold in 1971. That Harris would call for similar policies should not be lost on Americans that still remember the economic stagnation and inflation of the 1970s. Even though she didn’t call for official price controls, they were implied, and according to the Wall Street Journal, her message 'electrified' her Democratic Party base. That point should be significant because if economists understand one thing, it is that price controls have a disastrous economic impact over time. One would assume that even Harris’s own economic advisers understand that point. But as Ryan McMaken noted: We shouldn’t be surprised that the Harris campaign is planning to enthusiastically announce its plans for price controls. The Harris people can claim she is 'doing something' about the economy. This will all be couched in terms of 'greedflation' and corporate windfalls and other economic myths used to claim that today’s rising prices—fueled by monetary inflation, massive deficit spending, and a runaway regulatory state—are actually the fault of 'too much capitalism.' Then there are the potential devastating effects of the so-called climate policies that a Harris administration would impose. Harris cut her political teeth in California, which has the most draconian CO2 emissions goals in the country, and where the sale of new gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles will be banned after 2035. Her hostility to energy companies is reflected in her actions when she was California’s attorney general: according to ABC, 'Harris investigated Exxon Mobil over concerns that the company misled the public and its shareholders about the risks of climate change and whether its public statements violated securities laws and other statutes.' There was no smoking gun to validate her claims, but Harris showed she would have no problem imposing huge costs on energy firms to further the Green New Deal. One cannot underestimate the importance of oil and gas in the US economy, and there is no way to fully transition to an 'all-renewable' energy economy, especially in the short time windows set by Democratic politicians. Under the Biden-Harris administration, the US has seen the highest rates of inflation since the early 1980s, yet Harris continues to insist that the inflation is due to 'corporate greed,' not the fact that since 2020 monetary policies have vastly expanded the amount of money in circulation. Harris’s 'plan' to reduce inflation can be summed up as follows: increase business costs through regulation, threats, and litigation from 'corporate crackdowns.' As McMaken pointed out, most people on the Harris team, save a few true believers, know that one cannot reduce inflation by using legal threats to force up business production costs or by imposing price controls. While Harris has declared her fealty to Fed 'independence,' the truth is that she will need every dollar the Fed can print to offset the negative effects of the new taxes and regulatory initiatives that will reduce the capital investment that results in real economic growth. The Biden-Harris administration claims that it has revitalized the US economy, but the Fed’s recent rate cut raises questions about what really is happening. If the economy is as good as Harris claims, then why the need for drastic Fed action? Harris’s business initiatives, such as building three million housing units and aiding American companies, are a continuation of the Biden 'Build Back Better' program that supposedly was going to revitalize moribund sections of American manufacturing and create alternative energy sources. Unfortunately, as one can see, the centerpiece of the Biden program, the Inflation Reduction Act, was little more than crony capitalism, in which business owners direct resources to less-than-profitable venues that benefit politically connected investors. Harris’s business policies will bring back stagflation, where people get further behind while prices for housing and consumer goods rise. In the 1970s, Washington laid new burdens on private enterprise, and firms choked under the regulatory environment. There is nothing in Harris’s plan to prevent a repeat of this scenario. Her tax and regulatory plans will force up business costs and then will have to be offset by monetary expansion by the Fed, just as happened a half century ago. There is one important difference between then and now, however. In the late 1970s, the Jimmy Carter administration, with support from a Democratic Congress, went on a huge deregulation program, allowing more competition in transportation, finance, energy, and telecommunications. Contrary to popular belief, Carter, not Ronald Reagan, was the Great Deregulator. But Harris and the Democrats in Congress today are much more to the left than the Democrats in 1980, and, if anything, they favor vastly expanding the regulatory umbrella. Thus, when stagflation grows under a Harris administration, their response will be to impose more government controls. Donald Trump At this writing, Trump will have to fight an uphill battle to win the presidential election—but the odds were against him in 2016 as well. Thus, we should take a hard look at his economic proposals to see if they will help or hurt the US economy. It is not easy to find specific policy proposals from the Trump campaign. His official campaign site exists solely for fundraising, while the Republican Party platform consists of general statements like 'Carry out the largest deportation operation in American History' and 'Stop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse.' Certainly, the biggest negative of Trump’s plan are the tariffs he advocates, which would add to the tariffs he implemented during his presidential administration. He wants to impose a tariff of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods and a 10 percent overall increase for all tariffs. Anyone familiar with Austrian economics knows that no nation ever has built a prosperous economy through tariffs, and Trump’s 2018 tariffs were no exception to that fact. A recent National Bureau of Economic Research paper notes that Trump’s tariffs harmed agricultural interests, benefited only some manufacturing firms, and had no positive net employment effects in the affected industries. On top of that, as noted in the New York Times, the tariffs did incite other countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American products, making them more expensive to sell overseas, and those levies had a negative effect on American jobs, the paper finds. That was particularly true in agriculture: Farmers who exported soybeans, cotton and sorghum to China were hit by Beijing’s decision to raise tariffs on those products to as much as 25 percent. The US government made up some of these agricultural losses by issuing extra subsidies, but that also expanded the economic deficit. However, as the paper also notes, the tariffs were popular, particularly in the areas most hurt by Trump’s policies. While their popularity might seem ironic, McMaken’s point about the popularity of Nixon’s price controls applies here as well: Politically . . . Nixon’s price control scheme was a big success. Following the administration’s announcement on price controls, the Dow went up nearly 33 points, the largest one-day increase up to that time. Naturally, The New York Times showered praise on Nixon’s plan. Moreover, Nixon and his surrogates claimed that Nixon Thus, should Trump be elected, and his tariffs become official policy, we can expect two things to happen: the overall economic effects will be negative, but they will also give Trump a political boost. People will support the policies and blame free markets when they fail. While a strong argument can be made for immigration controls, Trump’s proposal for 'the largest deportation in American history' raises concerns for which neither he nor his supporters have answers. First, this is not a costless endeavor. The administrative portion itself will require hiring thousands of government agents—unless the goal is to stretch out the deportation process over several years. Second, deporting a million or more people will create serious problems in numerous workplaces where—like it or not—illegal aliens make up the bulk of the employees. Third, Americans also hire illegal aliens for home repair work, landscaping, and many other services, and the sudden loss of these workers would have a significant impact upon our economy. Even if one believes mass deportation is a good thing for the US economy, the short-term costs cannot be ignored. Both Trump and Harris support raising the Child Tax Credit to $6,000, although both have also called for ending taxes on tips. These actions would require congressional approval, so the new Congress would have a say in these tax proposals. Regarding energy and climate change, Trump has been much more realistic than Harris, who has been hostile to the gas, oil, and coal industries throughout her career. As president, Trump promoted the oil and gas industries and pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accords, and his position on these issues has not changed. He also opposes the electric vehicle mandates favored by Harris. The media happy talk notwithstanding, it is fantasy to claim that the US can meet the 'renewable' energy goals in the time frame set by US politicians. At least Trump understands that point even if he is inarticulate in expressing his views. The Candidates and the Fed The unhappy truth is that both platforms will need the Federal Reserve System to expand its easy money policies, despite the massive damage the Fed has already done by bringing back inflation. While Harris claims to defer to the 'experts' at the Fed, Trump wants the president to have more power to set interest rates. Obviously, neither candidate is acknowledging the economically perilous situation in which the government ramps up spending, which distorts the markets, and then depends upon the Fed to monetize the resulting federal deficits. As the debt grows and the economy becomes progressively less responsive to financial stimulus, the threat of stagflation grows. The present path of government borrowing and spending all but guarantees this outcome, and the candidates have neither the political will nor the economic understanding to do what needs to be done. Conclusion In summing up the Trump and Harris proposals, we point out again that neither candidate knows how to deal with stagflation. Instead, they call for more government intervention—Trump for tariffs and Harris for more individual and business taxes and for energy policies that will rapidly make life much more difficult for most Americans. The stagflation of the 1970s was ended by Jimmy Carter’s deregulation initiatives, Paul Volcker’s end to inflation, and Ronald Reagan’s income tax rate cuts. The economy rebounded nicely and grew to astounding levels. Unfortunately, the lessons of the early 1980s have been lost, and all of us will pay a price. About the author: William L.

US Secretary Of Defense Austin Is Ready To Fight Nuclear War Over...	Few Americans today would try to justify the United States government taking part in the Korean War in the 1950s. Even most of those who would make such an attempt would ground their argument in asserting there was a special need back then, as part of the Cold War, to prevent the expansion of communism. The Cold War is long over. So, why are still today tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and many more nearby, ready to resume fighting in the long paused Korean War at a moment’s notice? Inertia? Bloodlust? Reluctance of the military bureaucracy to give up any of its size and scope? The desire of the military-industrial complex to wring every possible dollar it can from the American people? None of these reasons seems very persuasive. Instead of preparing to restart the war that wrought enormous death and destruction the first time around, US officials should be preparing for the US military to finally exit Korea. Yet, there was US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Wednesday not just saying he has declared to the South Korea defense minister 'that the United States remains fully committed to the defense' of South Korea. Further, Austin pledged that the US government’s 'extended deterrence commitment' to South Korea 'remains ironclad' and that that commitment 'is backed by the full range of America’s conventional, missile defense, nuclear and advanced non-nuclear capabilities.' There you go, the US secretary of defense is threatening going nuclear in a war for which the now generally rejected reason for the US becoming involved in it disappeared decades ago. The defense secretary is mad for war. In this condition he reflects US government policy.

The Cruelty Of Crowds – OpEd	Twenty years ago, when I first heard about 'dog poop girl,' I thought, 'Well, that’s just South Korea.' In 2005, a young woman took her dog onto the Seoul metro where it promptly did its business. The owner refused to pick up after it. She was scolded by her fellow passengers. In an earlier age, that would have been the end of it. But this was the Internet age, and South Koreans were among the most digitally connected people in the world. Someone had caught the action on their cell phone and posted a picture of the dog owner to a popular website, soliciting others to ferret out her identity. Once identified, the young woman was subjected to so much shame and humiliation that she reportedly dropped out of university. The story caught the attention of the global media, became a meme, and was even turned into a 2021 Romanian film. If it were just a one-off, then the story of 'dog poop girl' would be just another strange digital-era fad that comes and goes, like flash mobs or the mannequin challenge. Alas, the Internet has become like a malign magnifying glass that focuses the anger of anonymous crowds onto individuals. Today, the private information of those targeted—which, as in the cases of 'dog poop girl,' Gamergate, and various 'Karen' controversies, often turn out to be women— is broadcast across the Internet so that they can be 'doxxed' with threatening letters and packages and even the dispatch of SWAT teams. Videos of negative interactions, which often involve confrontations across race, class, or gender, end up ruining reputations and lives. Many of these cases have been scrutinized at great length. Less explored perhaps is the link between this on-line behavior and global politics. Fascist politicians once relied on shock troops to eliminate opponents and their supporters. Today, they are using social media for the same ends. The rise of these far-right figures cannot be understood without reference to the digital frenzy of their supporters. Father Coughlin had radio. Leni Riefenstahl had film. Today, the far right has the Internet. Same hate, different media. A Short History of Collective Cruelty Let’s face it: it used to be worse. When life was considerably harsher and more violent than it is today, cruelty was a more integral part of everyday experience. Stockades were essential tools for public shaming and punishment. Crowds once gathered to watch executions, even particularly gruesome displays like drawing and quartering. Picnickers brought their baskets and opera glasses to watch the first major battle of the Civil War. Lynchings, which often involved drawn-out torture, were also accompanied by food and festivity. The last U.S. public hanging attracted 20,000 people to Kentucky in 1936. Suffice it to say, they didn’t go there to protest the execution. It’s not difficult to find examples of collective cruelty in today’s world. The ancient punishment of public stoning, for instance, continues in Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Mali, and elsewhere as a method to execute adulterers, murderers, and infidels. Here, too, crowds often gather to provide approving witness. So, perhaps Internet 'stonings,' with words substituting for 'sticks and stones,' are a marginal improvement. But that’s cold comfort for the victims. Consider again the case of South Korea where a rash of high-profile suicides were associated with some of the earliest examples of cyberbullying. Between 2000 and 2019, 40 celebrities committed suicide, with hateful messages and malicious comments on social media sites as a leading factor. After two more high-profile suicides in 2022—a male volleyball player upset over the rumor-mongering about his sexuality and a female influencer slandered on-line as a 'man-hater'—150,000 South Koreans signed a petition calling for those responsible for the cyberbullying to be punished. In the United States, meanwhile, social media has fueled an increase in teenage suicide rates and prompted hundreds of lawsuits against platforms like Instagram for amplifying derogatory content. All of that is tragic, to be sure. More consequential perhaps is the way that the cruelty of crowds, expressed digitally, is transforming modern politics. Fanning the Flames Integral to the rise of the MAGA movement in the United States—and to other far-right parties around the world—have been conspiracy theories like QAnon. The far right’s obsession with 'globalists' who supposedly support unlimited migration, undermine sovereignty, and perpetuate 'anti-family' doctrines goes hand in hand with a platform of nationalist renewal that has distinctly fascist overtones. Conspiracy theories certainly existed before the Internet. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the infamous anti-Semitic tract, facilitated the eruption of pogroms throughout Russia in the early twentieth century. However, even as it has provided an unprecedented opportunity to retrieve and verify information, the Internet has not just perpetuated any number of conspiracy theories but has also undermined any collective understanding of the truth. Everyone has their niche on-line, from beach volleyball players to collectors of Malaysian postage stamps. The truth, it seems, has also been divided up into myriad niches. Anti-vaxxers, flatworlders, election deniers, and those original Internet conspiracy hounds the 9-11 Truthers can all find a place on-line that reinforces their particular 'truth.' There is no strength in this kind of diversity, only an epistemological vacuum. The real-world implications of this assault on truth have been enormous. One of the most recent myths in the current U.S. election involves a false claim amplified by J.D. Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate. On line, he supported the notion that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, a town of around 60,000 people, have been eating other people’s pets. Although this myth has been thoroughly debunked—by no less than the Republican mayor of Springfield—it achieved even greater notoriety when cited by Trump in his only debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. The response by the anonymous crowd has been beyond vitriolic. After the one-two punch of Vance and Trump, Springfield had to declare a state of emergency. Neo-Nazi groups have converged on the city to build on the hateful comments made by politicians. Bomb threats forced the evacuation of schools. The Republican mayor has also been besieged. 'There are threats against my family,' he told The New York Times. 'Emails, phone calls. They say they don’t want me around, I’m going to die, I’m a traitor, ‘We’re watching your family.’ All these things that you never want to hear.' Because they don’t have a lot of political or media power to fight back, immigrants are a convenient target for the MAGA crowd. But the far right has waved a variety of red flags to incite violence: against FEMA and its response to the recent hurricanes, Custom and Border Protection officials for their work at the border, even jurors who voted to convict Trump in his New York trial. But it’s the election itself that has attracted the greatest level of manipulation. The aggressive rhetoric is escalating on-line in such corners of the Internet as Telegram. According to the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism: Much like in 2020, violent rhetoric related to election denialism has risen 317 percent over the course of October 2024. Posts made on Telegram include using election denialism to justify an apparent 'inevitable civil war' and a call to 'Shoot to kill any illegal voters.' Throughout the year, Proud Boys online accounts, whose leader and members helped orchestrate the January 6, 2021 insurrection, have been calling for elected officials to be 'arrested, tried for treason, and hanged,' and called for their supporters to 'keep your rifles by your side.' It’s not just domestic politicians who are fanning the flames of hatred in the United States. Other countries, too, are doing their best to push the crowd in certain directions. Although some U.S. politicians pretend to be evenhanded—by suggesting that Russia and Iran somehow balance each other out by each backing a different candidate—the Kremlin has in fact been playing a much more significant role in exploiting dividing lines in the U.S. electorate and promoting greater polarization. Long after its intervention in the 2016 election, Russia is still establishing hundreds of X accounts, multiple websites, and scads of video clips with various types of disinformation. For example, the Kremlin paid alt-right influencer Lauren Chen to publish Russia-friendly videos on her popular channel and, more significantly, funnel millions of dollars into the hands of even more prominent pro-Trump commentators. She is currently under federal indictment. Future Fractiousness South Koreans are petitioning their government to punish those who participate in collective shaming exercises on the Internet. In the more litigious United States, the strategy is to make social media platforms pay for their role in disseminating hate. But this is just tinkering at the margins. Digital companies must institute changes—or be forced to do so by government, public demand, or legal action. One option would be to ban anonymity so that individual malefactors can’t hide in the crowd. But the arguments against such a move are persuasive. So, here are some other possible approaches. First, the chief engineers of hatemongering and disinformation must be brought to account. We shouldn’t have to rely on the courts to bankrupt someone like Alex Jones, who was responsible for spreading so many malicious conspiracy theories. Free speech is a sacred right, but no one should be allowed to yell fire on the Internet when there’s no smoke or flames. Second, distinguish between free speech and 'free reach.' Sure, people can still say noxious things on the Internet. But algorithms should not promote hateful content. To achieve this, social media companies would have to make their algorithms transparent. Third, stop treating message boards like the Wild West. There needs to be professional moderation with clear rules of conduct. Okay, that takes care of the trolls. But what about the politicians who have weaponized the cruelty of crowds? Democratic mechanisms are supposed to weed out the worst offenders, but obviously that’s not working. Deplatforming is an excellent way of reducing their digital power; independent fact-checking can counter their most audacious lies. But still, some politicians manage to throw off these constraints. If they win power like Viktor Orbán in Hungary or Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, they short-circuit democratic mechanisms to stay in office. At some point, the focus has to shift from reducing the cruelty to transforming the crowd itself. Minimizing the political polarization that sustains the cruelty of crowds will require both civic education and a reduction of economic polarization. Transforming the electorate into a civil and civic-minded group that isn’t so easily divided between haves and have-nots is the only real solution. But it’s going to be the hardest lift of all.

Prabowo’s Army-Style Retreat Fuels Debate On Active-Duty Troops S...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus and Arie Firdaus Images of newly inducted Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto wearing jungle-green camouflage fatigues and leading cabinet members in drills has raised concern over whether he is reviving the military’s 'dual function' role in government, as it was under dictator Suharto. Just days after the former army special forces commander took office, the president and similarly dressed members of Team Prabowo were seen marching in formation and pounding the parade ground in their combat boots, during a three-day retreat at a military academy in Central Java. The retreat was touted as a team-building exercise but took place amid plans to revise a law governing the nation’s armed forces. Analysts said Prabowo’s decision to fly ministers on a C-130 Hercules aircraft, have them stay in barracks and wear army uniforms hints at bringing the military back into a central role in government. 'The retreat symbolizes that Prabowo’s regime is prioritizing a militaristic mindset in governing,' Al Araf, a military analyst and human rights advocate at Centra Initiative, told BenarNews. Prabowo, Suharto’s former son-in-law, entered office on Oct. 20 with his past military record blemished by allegations that he had committed human rights abuses as an army commander. A Prabowo spokesman said the retreat at The National Military Academy of Indonesia in Magelang was aimed solely at strengthening unity among ministers from diverse backgrounds. 'It’s about fostering connection and closeness,' Hasan Nasbi, head of the Presidential Communications Office, told BenarNews. A written statement from Prabowo’s communications team said cabinet members were asked to wake up at 4 a.m. for sports activities and marching exercises. Prior to breakfast and lunch, Prabowo rang a bell to signal prayer time, followed by cabinet members shouting 'enjoy the meals' before they ate and 'thank you,' at the end, the Reuters news service reported. Prabowo, in a speech opening the retreat, downplayed the setting. 'I don’t intend to make you all militaristic – that’s not the point. It’s about the military way,' Prabowo said. Al Araf linked Prabowo’s efforts to a planned revision of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) Law that could expand the military’s role in government. A draft of the revision allows active-duty soldiers to hold positions in ministries or institutions needing their expertise, enabling placements beyond those listed in the TNI Law. Efforts by parliament to pass the revision failed under President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, who left office nearly two weeks ago, because of civilian resistance, said Dave Laksono, a lawmaker overseeing the process. 'There has been no further progress on the TNI Law revision discussions,' Dave told BenarNews. Beni Sukadis, a military observer at Merapi Consulting, said assigning active military members to civilian positions could weaken the armed forces’ core role as the nation’s defender. 'Placing military personnel in civilian roles is highly counterproductive to TNI professionalism,' he said. He said Prabowo’s appointment of his personal aide, active-duty Maj. Teddy Indra Wijaya, as cabinet secretary, violated the 2004 TNI law. The analyst said he feared this signaled a revival of the military’s dual function. During Suharto’s New Order era, Indonesia’s military and police played both military and civilian roles, a concept known as the 'dual function.' In 1998, Suharto stepped down after 32 years in power. His fall ushered in a reform era in democracy and ended the dual function. 'Teddy’s appointment may be considered a legal violation or an exploitation of a loophole, as it is not explicitly covered under the TNI Law,' Beni said. 'To hold a civilian role, he should resign or take early retirement.' Prabowo spokesman Hasan said Teddy did not need to leave the military to serve in the government. 'As per the latest presidential regulation, the cabinet secretary is a second-echelon state civil apparatus position under the ministry of state secretary,' Hasan said, adding that, like the military secretary role, it could be held by active military personnel. ‘Softening the language’ Dimas Bagus Arya, coordinator of the human rights organization KontraS, said the retreat signaled that Prabowo aims to normalize civilian-military practices in Indonesia. In addition, Prabowo’s appointment of Teddy, despite his active-duty status with Kopassus, the president’s old army’s special forces unit, signals a move to reintroduce the military’s dual function, Dimas said. 'The term ‘military way’ used by Prabowo is just softening the language. The real intention is a return to a militaristic approach,' he said. He said KontraS expects militaristic practices in the administration will strengthen in the coming years because of the possible revision to the TNI law. Beni, meanwhile, said Prabowo already applied a military approach within his Gerindra Party, including the formation of a semi-military wing. He argued that this approach might not succeed as the military relies on a top-down structure while civilian governments tend to be bottom-up. Beni also expressed concern about a potential return to the military dual function, where career officers could occupy civilian roles without a strong legal basis. 'If this continues, it could lead to authority abuse and instability in the government system,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO3H544SP64FE	2024-10-31T16:52:49-07:00	
California’s Identity Problem – OpEd	California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed Senate Bill 1174, which prohibits local governments from enacting or enforcing identification requirements for voting. The measure was authored by state Sen. David Min, Irvine Democrat, now running for Congress in California’s 47th district. Min’s own background raises questions about the legality and morality of bills making voter identification illegal. Min earned a JD at Harvard, served as an enforcement attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and taught law at the UC Irvine School of Law for eight years. Min is a member of the bar in New York State and the District of Columbia, and in February 2022 he passed the California bar exam. That exam has stringent requirements, including a moral character test. Those taking the test must include fingerprints from a Live Scan Service form completed within the last 90 days. So, to practice law in California, Harvard law alum Dave Min submitted to a mandatory identification check and moral fitness test. Contrast the bar exam with the dynamics of voting. An election makes voters public officials for one day. Voters can decide who becomes president and vice president of the United States, a matter of some importance. Voters can elect members of Congress who will make the laws, and approve or reject various ballot measures that have direct bearing on taxpayers. Min wants voters to be exempt from identification measures, and bans local governments from imposing them. That stands at odds from some of Min’s own materials. For example, contributors to Min’s congressional campaign must certify, 'I am a U.S. citizen or lawfully admitted permanent resident (i.e., green card holder).' As the Harvard law alum must know, by law U.S. citizenship is a requirement for voting, yet the senator and candidate wants to bar identification of voters. Min’s legislation contends that 'voter identification laws place the onus on the voter to prove their identity and right to vote, even after voters have taken the necessary steps to prove their identity and right to vote through the voter registration process.' As the Orange County Democrat should know, this is not true in the Golden State. California automatically registers illegals to vote when they get their driver’s license at the DMV. State officials won’t say how many illegals violated the law by voting in 2016, 2018, 2020, or in the 2021 recall election for Gavin Newsom, who signed Min’s bill. State attorney general Rob Bonta had already filed a lawsuit against Huntington Beach, the Orange County city that sought to require voter identification. Bonta contends that ID requirements could make it harder for poor, non-white, young, elderly and disabled voters to cast ballots. Legitimate citizens and legal immigrants have room for reasonable doubt. All Californians are required to produce identification to board airplanes, apply for a home loan, purchase a firearm, purchase whiskey, become an attorney, and so forth. Californians might think a Harvard law alum, SEC enforcement attorney and law professor would know that. Californians also have to wonder about their attorney general, a Yale law alum As a member of the California Assembly, Bonta was the prime mover of Assembly Bill 2088, the California Wealth Tax, which if passed would have slapped a 0.4 percent tax on the portion of a taxpayer’s net worth that exceeded $30 million. AB-2088 would also have taxed former Californians 90 percent of their in-state levy in the first year after they left the state and 80 percent in the second year, phasing out over a decade. A Yale law alum should know that a state can’t tax non-residents, and that non-citizens can’t vote. In light of Bonta, Min, and Newsom, legitimate citizens and legal immigrants might imagine this scenario. Congress is in session and an unelected imposter poses as a House member and votes to approve an increase in taxes and government spending. That would not be acceptable, but illegal voters essentially pull off the same trick. Anybody who endorses non-citizen voting, regardless of party affiliation or ideological profile, forfeits any claim to support the rule of law, the basis of a free and democratic society.

The US Elections: Campaign, Transition And Inauguration – Analysi...	Which are the various elements –beyond the election itself on 5 November– that need to be taken into account for a new White House Administration to get under way. By Carlota García Encina There are only a few days to go before a decisive election is held in the US; but the electoral cycle goes beyond 5 November. The primary stage, which enables the presidential and their vice-presidential candidates to be chosen, ended at the start of summer and culminated in the Republican and Democrat conventions in July and August respectively. Now two more phases draw to a close: the electoral campaign, which culminates on 5 November, centred on the so-called swing statesand attention focused on elections to the Senate and House of Representatives; and the transition period, when the votes are counted and certified, and the transfer of powers takes place. This will conclude on 20 January with the inauguration of the new occupant of the White House, as stipulated in the 20th amendment to the US Constitution. Analysis 1. The campaign The electoral campaign in the US formally began on 3 September 2024, one day after the Labor Dayholiday. But the reality is that the starting pistol was fired when Donald Trump announced his intention to run in the Republican primaries. Now there are only a few weeks remaining a closely contested campaign, with an unexpected new Democrat candidate. Since entering the race at the end of July, Vice-president Harris has been able to improve the position of President Biden in the polls both nationally and in the battleground states. Harris has managed to control the terms of the debate and Trump’s campaign has failed in its attempts to link it to a still unpopular President. But although Harris is gaining ground, Trump is not losing support. Not everything is decided on 5 November. Voting has already begun in some states, with Alabama the first to send out its postal votes on 11 September, followed by another nine that started to do so 45 days prior to the elections. These were gradually joined by the remaining states (voting papers for the armed forces and residents abroad were also sent out 45 days prior to polling day). Voting in person also began five weeks before polling day, with Virginia the first state to begin in-person voting, followed by South Dakota and Minnesota. In the US it is necessary to register in order to vote, making voting a two-step process that sometimes has the effect of disincentivising the electorate. Formerly, the complicated voting procedures each of the states established, together with a range of other restrictive measures, erected a set of obstacles between voters and ballot boxes, too frequently designed to impede the participation of certain groups of citizens, often identifiable by their ethnicity, race, class, literacy rates or party allegiances. The registration processes have changed considerably and are less openly discriminatory, extending the deadlines and making the process almost automatic, but they continue to impede some citizens’ participation. This is one of the reasons why the turnout in presidential elections has generally been very low, typically hovering around the 50% mark. The 2020 election, however, had the highest turnout of a national election since 1900, with 66% of the population taking part. A new Democrat candidate could once again drive turnout in a tight race and it is expected to match the percentage of previous elections. The end goal of the two major parties is to amass 270 electors, a simple majority of the Electoral College comprising 538 members. The Electoral College is a venerable and arcane institution –and by extension, process– which is used only for presidential elections (the popular vote is used to decide all Congressional, state and local elections). This model emerged for the first time in the constitution of 1787. At that time, the idea of using the popular vote to choose the President was explicitly rejected because the founding fathers did not trust voters’ ability to make a wise choice. The Electoral College was thus agreed as a compromise between those who thought that Congress should choose the President and others who advocated a direct popular nationwide vote. In its place, state legislatures were charged with appointing electors to form the Electoral College. The electors are therefore a group of intermediaries appointed by the US Constitution to choose the country’s President and Vice-president, and they usually hold an elected office or are significant members of a party. Each of the 50 states is assigned a number of Electoral College members to match its total number of representatives in the Lower House plus its senators. Ratification of the 23rd amendment in 1961 enabled citizens of the District of Columbia to take part in presidential elections too, since when they have had three electors. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia use a system in which the winner of the popular vote in each of the state elections wins all the electors who have been assigned to the said state. Maine and Nebraska have adopted a different approach. These states assign two electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in the state and then one electoral college vote to the winner of the popular vote in each Congressional district (two in Maine, three in Nebraska). The US Constitution created the Electoral College, but did not explain how the votes would be assigned to the presidential candidates, an ambiguity that allowed these two states this exception. By casting their vote on the election day or beforehand, voters play their role in the formal process of ‘selecting’ the electors in their state. In most presidential elections in the course of history, the Electoral College has operated without any problem. On five occasions however the winner of the Electoral College has not been the winner of the popular vote. Three of these occurred in the 19th century, none in the 20th century and two in the 21stcentury. The main problem is that having a President who loses the popular vote despite having won the Electoral College undermines his electoral legitimacy. In 2000 Vice-president Al Gore won the popular vote against Governor George W. Bush by slightly more than 500,000 votes. In 2016 the results were even more dramatic, with Clinton winning the popular vote by more than 2,800,000 and losing the Electoral College. In the 2020 presidential election, a switch of only 45,000 votes in three states –Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona– could have created a tie in the Electoral College and forced a contingent election to be held in the House of Representatives. This would have happened even though Joe Biden had won the popular vote by more than seven million votes. This discrepancy between the Electoral College and the popular vote is generating growing controversy about the electoral system. Moreover, reports of voting irregularities have done nothing to help the electorate feel particularly secure about the integrity of the process. And here another threat must be added. At a time of major income inequality and significant geographical differences between the states, there is a risk of the Electoral College systematically overrepresenting the opinions of a relatively small number of people owing to the structure of the Electoral College itself. As it is currently constituted, each state has two votes in the Electoral College, regardless of the size of its population, plus the additional votes matching its number of members of the House of Representatives. This format overrepresents the small and medium-sized states to the detriment of the large ones. All these objections have led US citizens to increasingly oppose the Electoral College. Six out of 10 would prefer the winner to be the candidate who attracts most votes at the national level, with increasing division along party lines, with Democrats declaring themselves mostly in favour and the Republicans more divided. The US voting system is therefore structured around the states, which are the important jurisdictional unit of the presidential elections. This causes the political campaigns to focus on a relatively small number of pivotal swing states. These are highly sought-after states that have historically swung between voting for one party or the other in the presidential elections, whereas most states vote systematically for the same party (between 2000 and 2020, 36 states voted for the same party). For this reason, these states receive a disproportionate amount of attention from polling companies and candidates, who spend more than 75% of their campaign budgets on them, and the claim that ‘every vote counts’ becomes especially apposite in these cases. If no candidate wins a majority of Electoral College votes (they are tied on 269) the presidential election passes to the House of Representatives for a second round. However, in contrast to the usual practice of the House, each state would only receive one vote, decided by the party that controls the state’s delegation to the House of Representatives. The current electoral cycle will once again be determined by the decisive swing states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin (known as the Rust Belt); and Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina (known as the Sun Belt). When Joe Biden was the Democrat candidate after winning the primaries, his victory required winning the Rust Belt, while the Sun Belt was virtually written off as lost. With Kamala Harris, the party is once again competitive in all seven states and the possible combinations for winning the 270 electoral college votes have risen, while the possibilities of the Republican remain almost unchanged. Various scenarios have been mentioned depending on the campaign strategy. One possibility is that Harris flips the Biden plan of taking the Rust Belt and claims victory by concentrating on the Sun Belt. This would mean not relying on gaining ground among non-university educated white voters –reducing the possibility of victory in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin– but winning an even higher percentage of white university graduates and ethnically Asian voters than in 2020. She would also need to match the previous election’s results among Black and Latino voters, which would enable her to retain Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, enough to secure a majority of electoral college votes. A second scenario involves the materialisation of Trump’s supposed gains among Black, Latino and ethnically Asian voters, propelling his return to the White House. Although he would lose the national popular vote, he would win the presidency if he increased his percentage of support among these minorities, gaining Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Another possibility is that Harris secures a good result among voters aged 65 and over, which would enable her to retain Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, accumulating 276 electoral college votes. If this were the case, it would be the first time a Democrat candidate managed to win the support of this group since Al Gore, and would come at a time in which Harris is gaining ground among young voters, albeit not enough. Although neither campaign wants to lose votes, the replacement of young voters by their older counterparts is potentially positive for Harris given that there are more older people in the US than young people under 30 and they are more likely to sign up to the electoral register and cast their ballot. And although the exact figures differ according to state, older voters constitute a much larger part of the electorate than younger voters in some of the swing states. Another possible scenario is a chaotic electoral result –with few patterns or consistent tendencies in the battleground states– which could lead to a narrow victory for Trump. A case in point would be the mid-term elections of 2022, which produced very different results from one state to another, with the Democrats doing well in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Colorado and the Republicans dominating in New York, California and Florida. Finally, it is important not to overlook what is normally referred to as the ‘October surprise’, an event, whether deliberate or spontaneous, that can influence the result in November. Some believe that it has already taken place and it could be the dockers’ strike on the East Coast, or Iran’s attack on Israel, which threatens an even wider war, or the most recent 165-page filing by Special Counsel Jack Smith in the federal case against Donald Trump for subverting the 2020 presidential election. Or perhaps the surprise is still to come. Most commentators tend to believe that such a surprise no longer applies, however. The 2016 presidential race was influenced a month before the election by the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mails which, according to some, cost her the election. The distinctive characteristic of the current presidential election, however, is immobility. In fact, the only thing that has seriously shifted the polls was Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race and his replacement by Kamala Harris as the Democrat candidate. But neither Biden’s poor debating performance, nor the first assassination attempt on Trump, nor the second caused a major change in the polls. This stability reflects the calcified state of current US politics, with US citizens politically split down the middle and deeply polarised in their opinions. The conclusion is that everything remains up for grabs in a tight presidential race, although Kamala Harris has clearly increased her possible combinations for securing 270 electors. But as well as the presidential campaign, it is important not to lose sight of what is at stake in the Senate and the House of Representatives, which is by no means trivial. Regardless of who wins the election, if one of the two chambers falls into the hands of the opposing party, it will change the victor’s options when it comes to governing. 2. Congress The 435 seats of the House of Representatives are also up for re-election in November –Representatives’ terms last for two years– as well as a third of the 100 Senate seats –Senators’ terms last for six years–. This difference in the duration of terms means that the House of Representatives tends to reflect popular passions and passing enthusiasms, whereas the Senate tempers the enthusiasm with wisdom and experience. Congress is the branch closest to the ground. It is the point of entry through which ordinary citizens try to influence politics and unlikely as it may seem, congressmen and women devote considerable time to finding out what their voters want. Congress is also the place where the contradictory opinions and priorities of a large, diverse and energetic country come together and frequently collide. It forces its members to find enough points in common to be able to pass laws in their own chamber, in the other chamber, and subsequently obtain the President’s signature. It requires negotiation and compromise, and when Congress works well, it produces legislation capable of garnering widespread support throughout the country. Lastly, part of the work of Congress consists of controlling and supervising the executive branch. There can be no doubt that this function can be used to pursue partisan ends, but also to ensure that the institutions and bureaucrats are truly serving the US people as they should. It would be no surprise if a Republican majority were to constitute a partner less willing to arrive at compromises with a Democrat White House, with a legislative blockade and an aggressive use of Congressional tools to attack and goad the new Administration. The same may be expected if the opposite holds true, although the Biden Administration has shown that it still believes in bipartisan politics, because during its mandate it has managed to push through three major legislative packages with the help of Republican votes. Among the powers wielded by the upper chamber is the ability to institute dismissal procedures against senior federal officers (impeachment), but it is also charged with exercising the power of evaluation and approval in matters of treaties and plays an important role in the confirmation (or rejection) of certain nominations (around 1,200 of the President’s 4,000 political nominations), such as ambassadors and senior judges. It also proposes legislation, draws up and amends draft bills, oversees the federal budget and approves the treaties with foreign nations negotiated by the executive power. Everything seems to indicate that the Senate could revert to Republican hands. But the Senate usually requires a majority of 60 out of 100 to get most legislative initiatives over the hurdle of delaying tactics, known as the filibuster, making it essential to find consensus with the other side. And if this cannot be achieved, government is fundamentally done through executive orders. Recent forecasts suggest that whoever wins it will be a chamber almost as evenly split as the current one (49 Republican senators and 51 Democrats). In the event of a tie in the number of senators, majority control will depend on the candidate who wins the presidential race (the Vice-president has the casting vote, if necessary). A practically tied Senate would therefore limit the ambitions of both the Republican and the Democrat agendas and the only bearing they would be able to exert on the fiscal domain would rely on a procedure known as ‘reconciliation’, which enables the Senate to use a simple majority to modify income and expenditure. This is particularly important for next year, when many of the cuts imposed during the first Trump Administration come to an end. For its part, the House of Representatives can initiate impeachment against federal office-holders by voting for articles of dismissal that are then sent to the Senate; it is also empowered to approve and reject presidential nominations and international treaties. But it also has the power to investigate specific cases and matters related to the executive, judicial and other branches of the state, which includes the authority to summon witnesses and documents, hold public hearings and send the results to committees for review and create specific committees for this purpose. This power of oversight has been used aggressively by the Republicans in the last two years, for example against the head of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the son of the incumbent President, Hunter Biden. The lower chamber also holds the purse strings. On its own the House of Representatives cannot pass bills into law, but it can refuse to endorse them, or to grant them money, and it can threaten to shut down government. The current Republican majority has sought to hold the debt limit hostage in an attempt to force spending cuts and has frozen additional funding of Ukraine for months, and could do so again in the future. More spending aimed at countries such as Ukraine and Taiwan, or to confront the world’s authoritarian regimes, could prove even more difficult if the lower chamber is in Republican hands, because they seem to be determined to go ahead with cutting what they deem to be superfluous expenditure. It is not clear who is going to control the 435 seats of the House of Representatives, which is a toss-up between the two parties, albeit with a narrow advantage for the Democrats. Securing a majority is in any event crucial for both parties. 3. Transition After the election is held on 5 November, the 538 electors travel to the capitals of their respective states –on the Monday following the second Wednesday of December– to elect the President of the US. These citizens, chosen for their loyalty to their political party, will vote for the presidential candidate who has won the popular vote in their state. Here something comes into play that until recently had remained in relative obscurity: the counting and certification of the ballot. Immediately after the 2020 presidential election, at least 17 election officers from the counties of six swing states tried to block the certification of the total votes cast in their respective counties, alleging electoral fraud. Such an attempt to block certification was hitherto unprecedented. Although all the attempts foundered, the contested certifications might potentially have derailed the election. In 2022, during the mid-term elections, at least 22 county election officials voted in favour of delaying certification in key battleground states, an increase of almost 30% compared with 2020. In some cases the officials managed to stall –although ultimately not block– the certification. In the first eight months of 2024, at least eight county officials have already voted against certifying primary or special election results. Everything suggests that interference in certification could return after the 2024 presidential election, given that the trend that has been evident since 2020. It is possible that there will once again be a degree of chaos and confusion in the certifications at the local level –less so at the state level– but dozens of local officials are already lined up and prepared to ensure that the certification process goes ahead with the changes instituted since 2020 to prevent political interference in the process. If a local entity refuses to certify, the courts will intervene to force certification. Despite misgivings it is therefore necessary to trust the process. When the electors have voted for the presidential candidate who has won the popular vote in their respective states, the next step is a joint session of Congress held at the Capitol building to count the electoral votes and declare the result of the election. Since the mid-20thcentury, this joints session has been held on 6 January at 13:00. The incumbent Vice-president chairs the meeting and opens the votes of each state in alphabetical order. At the end of the count, the Vice-president announces the name of the next President. At this point the presidential race will have officially ended, paving the way to the presidential inauguration on 20 January. The states expect that their electors will respect the will of their voters in the Capitol. In other words, the electors pledge to vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state. However, the constitution does not oblige them to do so, which enables there to be ‘faithless electors’. In 1796 Samuel Miles was the first to cast his vote in favour of a candidate who had not won the popular vote in his state. In the 2016 election, seven electors ignored the dictates of the popular vote in their state, this being the highest number in any modern election. In a highly polarised political context in which people harbour strong feelings towards particular candidates, it is possible –but still rather unlikely– that future faithless electors could tip the presidency in one direction or another. However, 38 states and Washington DC have laws in place that force the electors to vote for their party’s official candidate. A 2020 Supreme Court decision ruled that the states are authorised to impose sanctions –including fines, replacement as an elector and a possible trial– against ‘faithless electors’ or those who vote against the popular vote in their state. Moreover, after the assault on the Capitol on 6 January 2021, Congress approved a series of reforms that would make it more difficult for partisan actors to manipulate the results of future presidential elections. In 2022 the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act gave even greater clarity to the specific functions and duties of the Congress and Vice-president in counting the Electoral College certificates and ensures that the Congress receives and considers the electoral votes that truly reflect the election results. It is said that if Kamala Harris wins the election on 5 November, she will need to defend her victory until January precisely due to the uncertainties surrounding the count and certification of the votes, above all in light of the Republican candidate’s declarations and the fear that he is already manoeuvring in advance of what may take place. The institutions have taken steps to ensure that the final results are a true reflection of the votes cast. There may be episodes of chaos and confusion mainly at a local level and, in particular, pre-meditated news stories about electoral fraud and doubts about the results. But nobody doubts that whoever finally takes possession of the White House will be the winner of the contest. 4. Transfer of powers The constitution has virtually nothing to say about presidential transitions, apart from the fact that the next President will take up office on 20 January. But there is a federal law, the Presidential Transition Act, originally approved in 1963, which establishes certain processes and requirements that apply both before and after elections, in the event of a new President coming to power. It does not say anything about the outgoing President having to invite his successor to the White House or personally cooperate with him in any way. This is only a tradition, but a tradition that no outgoing Administration had ever failed to observe until it was broken in 2020 with Donald Trump as outgoing President, who also decided not to attend his successor’s inauguration. A peaceful handover of power –above all from one political party to another– is arguably the ultimate expression of the rule of law. It was George Washington’s great contribution to the US political tradition when he voluntarily gave up the presidency. The spectacle of an outgoing President –Donald Trump– behaving in a way that had never been seen before was profoundly corrosive to US democracy. The process of presidential transition therefore exists in a symbolic way, with the ritual of one President yielding power to another displaying a society that respects the law, where the will of the electorate holds sway. But there is also a practical level. The federal government of the US is one of the largest organisations in the world and the process of transferring control from one group of political actors to another is extraordinarily complex. The presidential transition is therefore also a process of planning a new presidential mandate. And the presidential candidates achieve this by establishing transition teams, organisations that are legally separate from the presidential campaigns. The transition teams are responsible, among other things, for investigating the backgrounds of personnel, for planning policies and management programmes for turning campaign promises into governance. There are thousands of real-time decisions that have to be taken from the moment the future President takes office. And a longstanding tradition has developed whereby, as soon as the result of the election is known, the outgoing Administration –if the Administration is changing– undertakes to help the incoming Administration take up the reins. The key is that whoever occupies the White House should be ready to govern from the very first day of taking up residence. An incoming President is responsible for making more than 4,000 political nominations, overseeing a budget of approximately US$6 trillion and managing an enormous organisation that employs more than two million federal workers and more than two million service personnel and reserve forces. If the process is delayed or is not completed effectively, it could even have implications for national security. In the elections that took place in 2000, when the Supreme Court took 35 days to rule on the electoral dispute in Florida between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the Clinton Administration decided not to give access to either of the two teams and wait until the final resolution of the dispute. This led to a truncated transition that had a negative impact on national security, as the Commission on the 9/11 attacks on the US found, concluding that the shortened transition from the Clinton to the Bush Administration was a factor that contributed to the country’s vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Conclusions Only a few days remain before the 5 November polling day in the US, thereby bringing to an end a tight race that will be decided by a handful of states and relatively few votes. But it is not only the presidency that is at stake; the result in the Senate and the House of Representatives will determine the future Administration’s room for manoeuvre. But the contest will not end there. If Trump wins, the US should prepare for a transfer of power to a new Administration that is shaping up to be disruptive, especially on the domestic stage. If Harris wins, she will also need to defend her victory over Donald Trump until the day of her inauguration. However, the institutions have taken sufficient steps to ensure that there is a peaceful transition of power in spite of the narratives being advanced by Trump and the suspicion that he could try to repeat what happened between November 2020 and January 2021. Even if the transfer passes off smoothly, the narratives of the Republican Party are already having a tremendously corrosive effect. In addition, there is the damage being inflicted on the position of the US in the world and the trust that citizens may have in their government. There is a significant difference between wanting US democracy to work, while acknowledging severe problems, and a widespread effort to undermine people’s fundamental faith in the democratic process.

Saudi-US Bilateral Accords ‘Not That Connected’ To Israel Normali...	By Nour El-Shaeri Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on Thursday that some of the bilateral agreements the kingdom has been negotiating with Washington are 'not that tied' to the normalization of Saudi relations with Israel and are 'moving ahead.' He noted that potential US-Saudi agreements on trade and artificial intelligence are 'not tied to any third parties' and 'can progress probably quite quickly.' 'Some of the more significant defense cooperation agreements are much more complicated. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to finalize them before the end of the Biden administration's term, but that’s reliant on factors outside of our control,' he said. 'The other work streams are not that connected, and some of them are progressing quite quickly, and we hope to see movement forward.' Ruling out the possibility of Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel without the establishment of a Palestinian state, Prince Faisal stated that this remains the only viable solution, regardless of Israel’s acceptance. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative summit in Riyadh, he emphasized that the creation of a Palestinian state is rooted in international law and UN resolutions. 'In reality, the establishment of a Palestinian state is not tied to whether or not Israel accepts it; it’s tied to the principles of international law,' he said. 'The UN resolutions that led to the establishment of the state of Israel clearly envisioned a Palestinian state as well, so we need to make that happen.' Prince Faisal asserted that normalization of Saudi-Israeli ties is 'off the table' until there is a resolution regarding Palestinian statehood. He further highlighted the broader implications, stating, 'The security of the region as a whole is at risk if we do not address the rights of the Palestinians.' Addressing the ongoing crisis in Gaza, he called for a cease-fire, emphasizing the dangers of an Israeli overreaction following the events of October 7th. 'We have seen the reality that Israel’s reaction and its continuing military assault have led to a humanitarian catastrophe,' he remarked. He described the situation in northern Gaza as dire, with blockades and no safe zones for civilians, stating, 'That can only be described as a form of genocide. It is certainly against humanitarian law, and that is feeding a continuing cycle of violence.' On the prospects of an immediate cease-fire, Prince Faisal expressed caution, saying, 'I hope it’s the case that we can see a cease-fire in the immediate hours, in the immediate short term. I’m not sure that that’s the case. I don’t have the details.' He acknowledged US efforts to facilitate negotiations, adding, 'We are not part of the direct negotiations, but we certainly support the efforts that the US has undertaken to find a pathway to a ceasefire. I hope it comes to fruition.' He noted that previous attempts at cease-fire negotiations had failed due to new demands from Israel. 'In most of those instances where the talks collapsed, it has been because new requirements or demands were added on the part of Israel,' he explained. Prince Faisal also addressed Saudi Arabia’s position on Lebanon, emphasizing a hands-off approach. 'We have never fully disengaged. But we believe it’s up to the Lebanese politicians to seek a direction that puts Lebanon on the right track,' he stated. He added: 'It’s not up to any outside influence, any outside countries, or any outside powers to tell the Lebanese what to do or to influence the political process in Lebanon. That is our opinion.' Regarding relations with Iran, Prince Faisal indicated that recent discussions focused on regional de-escalation. 'I hope that Iran, like us, is working toward regional de-escalation on all fronts, not just in Lebanon. That’s very much the focus of my conversations with my Iranian counterpart,' he said. While he could not be 'confident of anything that is in the control of other parties,' he emphasized the importance of avoiding further escalation. 'I have made it clear to our Iranian counterparts that it is important to avoid any further escalation. My sense is that they realize the risks of escalation and would prefer to avoid it. But, of course, they have their own strategic calculations.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOxnsMDxGLWvH	2024-10-31T16:47:58-07:00	
Daylight Saving Time Remains A Nightmare – OpEd	Daylight saving time this year ends at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 3, after being in effect for nearly eight months. Standard time will resume in most of the United States for the next four months, reverting again to daylight saving time, or DST, on March 10 next year. 'Springing forward' and 'falling back' every year is not just among the many irritations of modern life. Studies show that mandatory clock resetting also reduces workplace productivity, at least temporarily, and is harmful to your health, even deadly. The adverse effects appear to increase with age, a serious concern with our graying population. It has been said that Benjamin Franklin invented DST to save candlepower at the end of the working day. But he was joking. Burning fewer candles on a summer’s evening means burning more in the darker hours of an early summer’s morning. Similarly, any explanation for DST that claims support from farmers and ranchers (as if chickens, cows and other livestock wear watches) is historically inapt: Many opposed it because it disrupts farmworkers’ schedules. The most prominent explanations center on supposed summertime energy savings. If the sun is shining when most people return home from their day jobs, less interior lighting is needed and less electricity needs to be generated. That argument was prompted by the 'oil shocks' of the 1970s when global fuel prices spiked twice owing to embargoes of crude oil exports from the Middle East. DST may have made sense before the widespread adoption of air conditioning in the Sun Belt. Nowadays, however, DST’s energy savings are highly doubtful. The lengths of days year-round do not vary with changes in the times displayed on clocks and watches. The number of sunlight hours at any point on the globe depends mainly on latitude (arc distance from the equator, where days and nights are always 12 hours long) and season (the Earth’s poles tip away from and toward the sun as our planet follows its 365-day elliptical orbit around Old Sol). The Northern Hemisphere begins tipping away from the sun at the summer solstice (on or about June 21). The days shorten until winter begins on Dec. 21, when they start lengthening again. And so it goes. DST does not save anything. Its onset requires most Americans (except those living in Hawaii, the outlying U.S. territories and most of Arizona) to lose an hour of sleep in the spring, time that is retrieved only when standard time resumes in the fall. Depending on when you rise and head to work or school, it is dark in the morning in the Northern Hemisphere in late fall and early winter, no matter what time regime is in effect. The days are shorter then; clocks can do nothing to change the Earth’s seasonal polar tilt away from the sun. But because DST 'shifts' sunlight toward the day’s end, it would be even darker in the morning in the months surrounding the winter solstice if DST were made permanent (as some voters and their elected representatives seem to want). Permanent DST triggers objections from parents who resist sending their children to school on pitch-black early winter mornings. Such a policy change also runs afoul of the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which allows states to remain on—or revert to—standard time year-round, but prohibits the adoption of endless daylight saving time without congressional approval. Evidence of the adverse health consequences of DST has been mounting for decades; it may take up to one month for body clocks to 'reset' after a change in the prevailing time regime. Heart attacks, strokes, car crashes and emergency room visits rise significantly in the days following a one-hour time shift in either direction. Who benefits from DST? Retailers, perhaps. The owners of golf courses, the builders of swimming pools and the manufacturers of charcoal briquettes and gas grills, certainly. Those benefits come at considerable cost to everyone else. It’s time to end the madness of springing forward and falling back. Making standard time permanent is the solution.

Austin Says North Korean Soldiers Likely To Enter Russian War On ...	By Jim Garmone It appears that North Korean troops will enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said Thursday at the conclusion of 2+2 meetings with South Korean officials at the State Department. Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and National Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun also spoke of the ironclad alliance between the United States and South Korea and steps to strengthen that alliance. 'We now assess that North Korea has sent around 10,000 of its soldiers to train in eastern Russia,' Austin said. 'Our most recent information indicates that about 8,000 of those [North Korean] soldiers are now in the Kursk Oblast. Now, we've not yet seen these soldiers deploy into combat against Ukraine's forces, but we expect that these North Korean soldiers will join the fight against Ukraine in the coming days.' Austin said Russian forces have trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery operations, unmanned aerial vehicle operations and basic infantry tactics to include trench clearing. 'The Kremlin has also provided these [North Korean] troops with Russian uniforms and equipment, and all of that strongly indicates that Russia intends to use these foreign forces in frontline operations in its war of choice against Ukraine,' Austin said. 'Make no mistake, if these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would make themselves legitimate military targets,' the secretary said. The United States is consulting closely with allies and partners on these developments. 'As I discussed last week in Kyiv, Ukraine's military continues to perform admirably on the battlefield, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's forces have suffered serious losses in recent months,' Austin said. 'Ukrainian forces have caused more than 1,200 Russian casualties per day, more than at any other time during Putin's war. By 'tin-cupping' to North Korea for manpower, Putin is showing the world another clear sign of weakness. The Kremlin's North Korean gambit just underscores how badly Putin's war has gone and how much trouble he is in.' Austin and Blinken both noted it is the first time in more than a century that Russia has welcomed foreign troops on its soil. 'The United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine, and so will our allies and partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group,' the secretary said. This assistance includes artillery, anti-air defense, armored vehicles, munitions and other crucial capabilities. The secretary said the U.S. will announce additional security assistance for Ukraine in the coming days. The U.S.-South Korea alliance is evolving into a comprehensive global partnership. 'We agreed today to further enhance our interoperability and strengthen our extended deterrence,' Austin said. 'Our countries are deepening our nuclear and strategic planning efforts through the Nuclear Consultative Group, and we're increasing the regular deployments of U.S. strategic assets on the Korean Peninsula.' The two countries agreed that attacks in space or cyberspace 'that clearly challenge the security of the alliance could lead us to invoke Article III of the Mutual Defense Treaty,' the secretary said. 'So, to improve our awareness of threats in the space and cyber domains, we're enhancing our interoperability and information sharing.' The United States and South Korea will continue to advance defense ties with regional allies and partners, especially the historic growth of trilateral security cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the United States, Austin said. 'Our robust partnerships, especially with Japan and the ROK, let us share information, assess threats and craft thoughtful responses, just like last night when [North Korea] conducted its latest irresponsible missile test, and across the Indo-Pacific,' the secretary said. 'We're working to strengthen maritime security and to bolster interoperability through multilateral exercises.' The United States and South Korea are working with partner countries to tackle shared security challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOx8w23QCkPP1	2024-10-31T16:44:02-07:00	
ABS Sees Potential For Nuclear-Powered LNG Carriers	The American Bureau of Shipping has released its latest report into the potential of advanced nuclear technology for maritime applications, with a study of a small modular reactor on a standard liquefied natural gas carrier. The report notes that large liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier vessels are increasing in demand as the international LNG trade remains important for global energy security. LNG is stored on board in large cryogenic tanks that maintain natural gas (primarily methane) in a liquid state around -165°C. The typical energy demand for LNG carriers is between 30 to 75 MW. The scope of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) study - titled Pathways to a low carbon future: LNG carrier nuclear ship concept design - was to consider and discuss a standard LNG carrier design using nuclear power for propulsion and other primary energy needs. A conceptual future zero-emissions LNG carrier is presented to illustrate how one type of advanced nuclear fission technology may be applied for shipboard power in the future, with an emphasis on what aspects of ship and reactor design may require further investigation to guide the development of the integrated technology and regulatory framework. The transformational impact of a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) on the design, operation and emissions of a 145,000-cubic-metre LNG carrier design was modeled by ABS and Herbert Engineering Corporation. ABS said the study was designed to help industry 'better understand the feasibility and safety implications of nuclear propulsion and to support future development projects'. The study shows a nuclear-propelled LNG carrier would have specific design features, with reactors placed at the rear of the vessel (to shield the cryogenic cargo from the thermal load of the reactor compartment) and batteries forward of the location occupied by fuel tanks on current vessels and a reinforced hull. Given design constraints, the HTGR technology would only be suitable for larger LNG carriers. ABS / Herbert Engineering) 'The study provides ABS and the industry important information on heat and energy management, shielding, weight distribution, and other design features for an LNG carrier with nuclear propulsion,' ABS said. 'This will assist the identification of design issues that will inform future Rules development. The study also found the HTGR technology allowed faster transit speeds and offers zero-emission operations. There would also be no requirement to refuel, although the HTGR technology would need replacing approximately every six years.' ABS said the benefits from nuclear propulsion include decarbonised high-power availability, reduced or eliminated bunker costs, and associated reduced bunker time in port. 'Nuclear power would be an ideal means of drastically abating shipping emissions, but significant hurdles remain inpublic perception and international regulations before this can be achieved,' it adds. 'While this technology is well understood on land, adapting it for marine application is in its infancy,' noted ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Patrick Ryan. 'However, this study and the other research we have carried out clearly highlight its significant potential to address not only shipping's emissions challenge but to deliver a range of other operational advantages to the industry. ABS is committed to helping the industry evaluate its suitability for use in a range of use cases and LNG carriers is just one of a range of potential applications we are exploring.' In August 2022, ABS announced it had been awarded a contract by the US Department of Energy (DOE) to research barriers to the adoption of advanced nuclear propulsion on commercial vessels. Working with support from DOE's National Reactor Innovation Center, based at Idaho National Laboratory, ABS is developing models of different advanced reactor technologies for maritime applications and developing an industry advisory on the commercial use of modern nuclear power. In July last year, a study commissioned by ABS explored the potential of advanced nuclear reactor technology for commercial marine propulsion. ABS commissioned Herbert Engineering Corporation to carry out a study designed to help the shipping industry better understand the feasibility and safety implications of nuclear propulsion and to support future development projects. The study modelled the impact of nuclear propulsion on the design, operation and emissions of a container vessel and a Suezmax tanker.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO-3Vkp6vYVr0	2024-10-31T16:40:38-07:00	
Japan Enters A New Phase Of Political Instability – Analysis	Japanese politics has entered into an uncertain terrain following the worst performance by the long-time ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner the Komeito, in 15 years in the snap polls on 27 October called by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba barely a month after coming to office. As it transpired, it was an ill-conceived move and showed that Ishiba failed to judge the public mood. Now Ishiba is under pressure to resign. The most worrying aspect is that Japan is feared to have entered into a phase of political instability. That shall have impact in both domestic and foreign policy of Japan, though sector wise, the impact shall is minimal. As no party has secured a majority, a lot of negotiations, bargaining and compromises are going to be seen in the next 30 days which is mandated by the rules to cobble up coalition partners to form a government. Ishiba who won the LDP presidential race on 27 September and thereby became the Prime Minister hoped to consolidate his position amid public outrage over a political funding scandal and rising living costs. As it transpired, his gamble backfired. The ruling coalition won just 215 seats, far short of the 233 needed for a majority. The LDP’s seats in the lower chamber plunged from 247 before the election to 191, a staggering loss of 56 seats. For the LDP, which has dominated Japan's post-war politics, it was the worst showing since 2009, when the party lost power for four years. Japanese political system is indeed entering a new and uncertain period. Its coalition partner Komeito did not fare better either. Komeito also incurred a significant loss of eight seats, down to 24, making the combined total for both parties 215, which are 18 seats short of the majority threshold of 233. This dramatic loss of majority in the lower house, first time in 15 years, did not deter Ishiba from declaring his intention to remain in office. While admitting the severe security and economic environment that the country faces, he was unprepared to accept 'any stagnation in national politics'. But continuing the administration without regaining the public’s trust would be a tall order. The political volatility and spectre of instability can be foreseen as the opposition despite making considerable inroads is too divided to form a government. Many opposition parties ranging from Communists to far-right groups have ruled out joining a coalition with the LDP and Komeito. This complicates the path forward. The LDP and Komeito may try to form a minority government, relying on smaller, center-right parties like the Democratic Party for the People and the Innovation Party, to pass legislation on a case-by-case basis. Such ad-hoc arrangement does not guarantee political stability and the government would always be vulnerable to collapse if it fails to meet opposition demands. Ishiba suddenly has become politically weak as many from the Ishiba and Abe allies lost their seats after being implicated in the slush fund scandal. Even if Ishiba becomes the Prime Minister, his stay at office could be short-lived. The elections to the Upper House is due in July 2025 and that would make Ishiba’s position more vulnerable as he may have to make many compromises to meet the demands of the Opposition, thereby raising the spectre of political instability. Then situation looks too messy. LDP’s coalition partner, the Komeito fared no better, with leader Keiichi Ishii, who replaced long-time party leader Natsuo Yamaguchi as party president on 28 September and deputy leader Shigeki Sato losing their elections. In the western Kansai region around Osaka, Komeito’s traditional stronghold, where the party had seldom lost elections due to its powerful organizational base, it faced challenges from candidates of Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party) in four Osaka districts and was defeated in all of them. The first political fallout of the electoral loss bearing responsibility was when Shinjiro Koizumi, chairman of the LDP’s Election Strategy Committee resigned to take responsibility for the electoral pasting, as a matter of principle. Out of 46 lawmakers who became mired in the scandal over political funds amassed and distributed by LDP factions, 28 failed to be re-elected, and only three of the candidates who were not endorsed by the party as punishment for their implications in the scandal managed to win. These outcomes point to the deep anger and malaise centring on distrust the scandal had generated among the voters. Ishiba remains undeterred. While committing himself to heartfelt soul-searching and be reborn, he promised to spearhead hard-hitting reforms in the party, eliminating everything that the public thought logic of party insiders. But the people remember that Ishiba has a history of contradicting his own previous vows and now see contradicting his own promise of political fund reforms after he won the LDP leadership race in September. The point of scrutiny by the people centres on the dark clouds of policy activity expenses, which the LDP currently distributes to individual party executives and the disclosure of how Diet members spend their fixed monthly allowances to cover research, travel and communications expenses, which were formerly known as 'buntsu-hi' for short. Ishiba was also found wanting on his promise of the early establishment of a third-party institution for monitoring political funds. The backlash against the LDP certainly influenced Komeito’s poor performance. Komeito’s poor show demonstrated that it failed to play an effective role in pushing the LDP toward political funding reforms as a ruling coalition partner. With the drubbing it received, the party will now find it difficult to recover its strength. It was not just the slush fund issue that damaged trust in politics. The LDP’s link with the former Unification Church, formally called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification that had consumed Abe’s life by an assassin who suspected Abe’s hand and which led to his family’s financial ruin also played its part in LDP’s poor show in the elections. For example, Justice Minister Hideki Makihara and former education minister Masahito Moriyama, two lawmakers whose relationships with the former Unification Church, were questioned, lost in a single-seat constituency. In addition, they also failed to gain seats in a proportional representation bloc under a system of double candidacy. This is a clear manifestation of deep-rooted distrust related to this issue. Having lost the majority in the Lower House, if Ishiba cobbles up a coalition government with smaller opposition parties, the LDP-Komeito coalition cannot pass the budgets or other bills without the cooperation of the opposition. This would mean concessions, compromises and ultimately policy paralysis. The government could then be seen as recuperating in the intensive-care-unit, counting days for its survival. The domestic political turbulence does not necessarily mean that Japan’s foreign policy shall be dramatically recast, though some priorities may shift. Ishiba, a former defense minister who became the prime minister, had embraced several controversial proposals, such as forming an Asian version of NATO and a nuclear-sharing arrangement with the US. His weakened position now would mean these plans are unlikely to gain traction. Instead, if he survives, Ishiba will likely focus on areas with broader political consensus on domestic issues rather than tinkering with foreign policy issues. It is to be seen how the Japanese leadership shall deal with growing threats from North Korea and pressure from China. It major treaty ally, the US, is bogged down on the presidential election and shall have little time to focus on foreign policy issues. This does not mean that Japan is going to undermine its alliance relationship with the US, its principal ally. Though a policy paralysis is not likely immediately, the opposition shall be emboldened to oppose if Ishiba can cobble up a majority to form a government and decide to boost Japan’s military capabilities. Any decision or move to raise tax revenue to help support the growing necessity for Japan to rearm itself more fundamentally is likely to be fiercely opposed. If Donald Trump wins the US Presidential election in November, it would be tough for Ishiba or whoever becomes the Prime Minister to negotiate with Trump on foreign policy and security issues. To deal successfully with Trump, Japan’s prime minister needs to be strong and for that he/she needs to be endowed with strong political capital. In the present scenario, no Japanese leader possesses that. Japan’s vulnerability shall remain for quite some time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9scw14dW4RKXCQ	2024-10-31T09:47:19-07:00	
America’s Containment Foreign Policy No Longer Works – OpEd	Forget the ‘Grand Schemes,’ he said, the world was now too complex. Try, instead, he suggested, 'for a thoughtful paragraph or two.' – George F. Kennan (1994) Why is it that American foreign policy experts continue to reiterate (perhaps regurgitate would be more apt) a seemingly inherited trait that has lost its relevance? Moreover, this trait perpetuates a widespread belief that protecting vital U.S. interests abroad depends on the perception that America is willing to intervene irrespective of the magnitude of the interests, the power of the perceived adversary, or on whose territory the engagement might occur. This mantra of the foreign policy elite sounds suspiciously like something George F. Kennan might have uttered back when I was old enough to fight in Vietnam – but too consumed with Cold War propaganda to know better (and this continues today with many young Americans). Ed Hermann and Noam Chomsky would later call this propaganda effect ‘manufactured consent’ in their 1988 seminal text, Manufacturing Consent. Containment The narrative and its attendant propaganda have their genesis in a Cold War era initiative called ‘Containment.’ The latter was a geopolitical strategic foreign policy pursued by the United States during the post-World War II era – ostensibly to prevent the spread of communism. The theory asserted that if any country in a region fell to communism, other and potentially more strategically significant states would soon follow. The experience of the Vietnam War and its aftermath should have dissuaded American policymakers today from accepting this principle. The latter, after years of ineffectiveness (and afraid politically to lose face by admitting victory was impossible) pointlessly wreaked destruction on Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Laos Vietnam ultimately fell to communist Hanoi in 1975 after a 10-year US military campaign fought mostly from the Pentagon with 50,000+ American soldiers dead and millions of Vietnamese. The overarching result was a somewhat humbled US and a foreign policy based on 'containment' that would eventually reveal its ‘non universal applicability.’ Unfortunately, this predisposition towards the 'containment theory' remains deeply entrenched amongst the 'deep state,' foreign policy elite and op-ed sections of conservative magazines and newspapers that (by now) should know better. No real effort is needed to illustrate its persistence. Take for instance the Afghanistan war and its withdrawal debacle. Many, including former president Trump, have called it 'the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country,' and claimed the withdrawal was 'why Russia attacked Ukraine.' A further example comes from another 'authority,' Vice President Harris. She recently claimed that 'Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine,' and that if it had not been for the Biden administration, 'Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe…starting with Poland.' Today, there is little appreciation for foreign policy more sophisticated than aphorisms scribbled on a 'sticky note,' like 'peace through strength.' Yet, these often get more of a hearing than merits the energy to utter them. The other half of the story is that media personalities and those that grace op-ed pages take literary license with these 'sticky-note aphorisms' repeating them incessantly until they become accepted as 'conventional wisdom.' The effect is to promote American foreign policy based solely on economic, political and military hegemony (sanctions, etc.) – not strategic leadership. Dissenting views are increasingly either crowded out, ridiculed as uninformed or simply canceled by providing no avenue for their public dissemination. The most developed post-Cold War strategy for continuing the idea of containment was articulated by Dick Cheney’s Pentagon in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, which was leaked to the New York Times. 'Our first objective,' an early draft read, 'is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union.' The White House disavowed the Cheney document, and George H.W. Bush’s national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, later described the Pentagon’s approach at the time as just plain 'nutty.' What continues to get the US into geopolitical difficulty is that flawed assumptions (for various reasons) about three countries in particular (China, Russia and India) are taken for granted, and foreign policy initiatives are pursued simultaneously with often shortsighted partisan political agendas without placing limits on what constitutes too high a price if failure occurs. And since Vietnam, the latter has occurred all too frequently. In short, US foreign policy is in need of greater correlation between level headed ambition (what we want or should want) and ability (what we actually can do without overreaching and overstaying our 'welcome'). US Foreign Policy Today US foreign policy today – briefly stated – is focused on three countries: China and Russia as adversaries and India as a 'potential partner.' This foreign policy remains essentially an extension of the Cold War 'containment' mentality. The three countries at the summit of America’s foreign policy agenda have several things in common which the US must understand and consider in developing its geopolitical response to them: history, trust and coercion Each country has an unfavorable history with the West. China experienced its 'century of humiliation' for over a hundred years at the hands of the West. Russia was lied to about any further encroachment by NATO at its most vulnerable time after the fall of the wall in ‘89. India was colonized and, therefore, coerced into political and economic acquiescence dating back over 100 years to the era of the British East India Company. China. Today, US foreign policy designed to contain China is implemented economically via sanctions, restricting access to critical resources to prevent technological innovation and aligning with Southeast Asian countries (in South China Sea disputes) to impede China's open seas access. The US assumptions taken for granted about China are flawed. It does not seem to understand China from a historical perspective -- which is imperative to understanding it at all. Beijing operates from a historical mindset such that actions by the West are perceived to be designed to take away more of China’s sovereign territory (e.g. Taiwan, South China Sea etc.). The US needs to learn China does not want war; rather, it wants and needs prosperity to build an economy to foster a military to protect its sovereignty – just like the US. China wants and needs the existing Western institutional infrastructure to remain intact to profit from it. Russia. US foreign policy of containment directed against Russia recently took on the characteristics of a US-led proxy war with Ukraine as the vehicle to achieve its aim of destroying the Russian economy and preventing the rise of the BRICS+ as a potential threat and competitor to Western economic and political hegemony. Massive deaths from substantial military aid and sanctions by the US and its allies for over two years have failed to produce the desired results. The BBC reported in April of this year, 'Russia to grow faster than all advanced economies, says IMF.' The Ukraine conversely is already economically and militarily totally dependent on its Western backers to sustain itself as a nation-state. The US operates from outdated Cold War logic about Moscow. Russia is on record via Vladimir Putin that the Russian military is no match for NATO. That is why one hears so much saber-rattling about the 'nuclear card,' which Putin has also said is an insane idea and would only be employed against an existential threat to Russia. India. The US has failed in its attempts to draw New Delhi away from Moscow. India refuses to yield to US pressure regarding Western sanctions against Russia. Moreover, a recent Modi-Putin Summit clearly reiterated the strong seemingly unbreakable trust between these two leaders and their countries. The US recently threatened India with sanctions for the Chabahar port deal with Iran. US assumptions about New Delhi are questionable at best. It still does not seem to understand or believe India’s position relative to the West: India is non-Western but not anti-Western – she is non-aligned. And although New Delhi may be a potential partner with the US – to be a countervailing influence to help 'contain' China -- it is unlikely to be that vis-a-vis Russia. Given the extent of America's present foreign military engagements, it appears that containment remains the foreign policy of choice. Any issues the ‘war hawks’ may have about an ‘America First’ foreign policy or the fear of 'isolationism' – apparently such concerns are patently unwarranted. The US and its NATO allies continue their attempt to contain Russia by isolating it and encroaching upon its borders. Since such behavior risks a potential direct conflict with Moscow over Ukraine, isn't it time to jettison our 60-year national preoccupation with 'containment' of our perceived adversaries. US foreign policy must cohere with what is in America's best interest rather than partisan political agendas so characteristic of each new administration inside the Beltway – adventures that put us all in jeopardy – but so far, looks like it's still…just plain 'nutty.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc-unRMKy5lIt	2024-10-31T09:46:05-07:00	
One Year On Operation 1027: Its Impact On Myanmar And Beyond – Op...	As we marked the first anniversary of Operation 1027, initiated by the Three Brotherhood Alliance (3BHA) on October 27, 2023, it is essential to evaluate its successes and implications for Myanmar's political landscape and regional stability, particularly concerning Bangladesh. This operation, involving the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and Arakan Army (AA), has transformed the conflict dynamics in Myanmar. A Year of Strategic Gains Operation 1027 has been characterized by remarkable military successes that have reshaped the balance of power in Myanmar. Within weeks, the 3BA captured over 130 military outposts and strategic bases in northern Shan State, including Laukkai, a key border town. The junta suffered significant losses, with reports indicating the deaths of hundreds of soldiers and the surrender of over 4,000 troops, including high-ranking officers. The capture of advanced military equipment further underscored the effectiveness of this coordinated offensive. A pivotal moment was the fall of Ann Township in Rakhine State to the AA in early 2024. This victory not only solidified the AA's influence but also demonstrated increased coordination among various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs). The capture of Ann Township marked a critical victory for the AA, allowing it to establish greater control over Rakhine State and disrupt junta operations significantly. Such developments have galvanized resistance factions across Myanmar, leading to a resurgence of anti-junta activities. The operational successes achieved by the 3BA have also led to a notable shift in public sentiment within Myanmar. Many citizens, disillusioned by the junta's inability to provide security or basic services, have begun to view EAOs as viable alternatives. This change in perception is crucial for the long-term sustainability of resistance movements as they seek to establish governance structures in areas under their control. Implications for Myanmar’s Future The operational achievements of Operation 1027 have exposed severe vulnerabilities within the Myanmar military regime. The State Administration Council (SAC) is grappling with declining troop morale and public support, leading to recruitment challenges. Many battalions are now severely understaffed as soldiers face burnout from prolonged deployments amidst escalating violence. As resistance groups gain ground, there is a growing likelihood that internal dissent within the junta could lead to its eventual collapse. Observers note that if this trend continues, we may witness a domino effect similar to historical regime collapses seen in Saigon or Kabul. The junta's inability to effectively counter these insurgent movements has led to a crisis of legitimacy, raising questions about its future viability. However, while Operation 1027 has yielded significant territorial gains for resistance forces, it also raises concerns about potential escalation. The junta's response has included intensified airstrikes and artillery bombardments targeting civilian areas in an attempt to regain control. This escalation poses serious humanitarian risks for civilians caught in conflict zones. What does it mean for Bangladesh? The ongoing conflict in Myanmar has profound implications for Bangladesh, which has been directly affected by the instability. As violence escalates in Rakhine State, Bangladesh faces several challenges. First, the conflict has stalled the repatriation process for over 1.3 million Rohingya refugees already residing in Bangladesh. The renewed fighting has created uncertainty about their future and prolonged their stay in refugee camps under increasingly dire conditions. Reports indicate that food allocations for these refugees have been cut significantly due to diminishing international aid. Added to that a surge of around 40,000 Rohingyas crossed the border and took shelter in Bangladesh in the last couple of months. For Bangladesh, the number is becoming a headache day by day. Second, the escalation of violence has led to direct security threats along Bangladesh's border. Incidents of cross-border gunfire and mortar attacks from Myanmar forces have already resulted in casualties among Bangladeshi citizens and damaged infrastructure. Such incursions threaten national sovereignty and create instability in southeastern Bangladesh. Several Bangladeshi fishermen were also been kidnapped from Bangladesh's water territory of the Bay of Bengal and even at least two of them have been killed recently. Besides, the chaos resulting from Operation 1027 may also exacerbate issues related to drug trafficking and organized crime. Increased instability could lead to a surge in smuggling operations across porous borders, further complicating law enforcement efforts in Bangladesh. All these issues are questioning the security and stability at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Finally, If the AA succeeds in establishing control over Rakhine State, Bangladesh could share a border with an unrecognized statelet, raising concerns about regional security dynamics and potential support for insurgent activities within its territory. The situation poses diplomatic challenges for Bangladesh as it navigates relations with both Myanmar and international stakeholders concerned about human rights violations and regional stability. Balancing humanitarian assistance with political pressures will require careful diplomacy. Looking Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty As we reflect on one year since Operation 1027 commenced, it is clear that this initiative has significantly altered Myanmar's conflict landscape. Resistance groups must navigate complex strategic landscapes; while initial successes have emboldened them, they must also consider how to maintain momentum without overextending their capabilities. External influences will play a crucial role in shaping outcomes. China’s response is particularly noteworthy; while it initially appeared supportive of Operation 1027 due to concerns over border security and criminal activities linked to junta-controlled areas, Beijing has since expressed apprehensions about escalating violence along its border. China’s strategic interests may lead it to recalibrate its support based on how events unfold. As Myanmar navigates this turbulent period in its history, supporting democratic movements while ensuring regional stability will be essential for international observers and stakeholders alike. The coming months will be critical as both resistance forces and the junta reassess their strategies amidst evolving dynamics on the ground. For Bangladesh, proactive measures will be necessary to mitigate humanitarian crises and security threats arising from its neighbor’s instability. As we move forward into another year marked by uncertainty and potential upheaval, it is imperative that both local actors and international stakeholders work collaboratively towards sustainable solutions that prioritize human rights and regional stability while addressing the complex realities on the ground in Myanmar and its impact on neighboring countries like Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sczgprljQ2JmD	2024-10-31T09:44:07-07:00	
Global Security At Risk: North Korea’s Involvement In The Ukraine...	North Korea’s decision to dispatch troops to support Russia in its conflict against Ukraine signifies a profound and concerning shift in global security dynamics. The involvement of approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers indicates an intensifying military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow, thus reinforcing Russia’s reliance on foreign allies amidst considerable troop losses. This development complicates the Ukraine conflict and raises serious concerns for the international community, particularly regarding relations among Russia, the United States, South Korea, and the European Union. The central thesis of this analysis posits that North Korea's military involvement in Ukraine serves as a destabilising factor in global geopolitics, exacerbating existing tensions and threatening both regional and global security. It underscores the burgeoning partnership between Russia and North Korea, challenges the prevailing global order, and necessitates a coordinated response from the West to mitigate the dangers posed by this alliance. North Korea’s participation in the Ukraine conflict represents a pivotal moment for its military and diplomatic relations with Russia. Historically, the ties between the two nations have fluctuated; however, the recent summit between Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin, during which they signed a partnership treaty, signifies a new level of cooperation. This includes military support, with North Korea’s elite troops now being directly integrated with Russian forces. The National Intelligence Service of South Korea confirmed the initial deployment of approximately 1,500 soldiers who were transported from North Korea to the Far East of Russia via naval vessels. These soldiers, disguised in Russian military uniforms and equipped with false identifications, are anticipated to be deployed to the front lines in Ukraine following the completion of adaptation training. These developments not only underscore the strategic significance of North Korean military assistance to Russia but also raise broader questions regarding global security implications. The strengthening of military ties between Russia and North Korea raises considerable concerns for the United States, South Korea, and the European Union. For Russia, North Korean troops provide essential manpower as it grapples with battlefield losses and escalating domestic challenges in maintaining troop levels. This reliance on Pyongyang’s forces illustrates Moscow’s desperation in light of the war’s human and material costs. North Korea’s direct involvement with Russia establishes a new front in the broader geopolitical competition involving the United States, Russia, and North Korea. In response, Washington is expected to increase military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, intensify sanctions on both North Korea and Russia, and enhance diplomatic initiatives aimed at isolating the two nations on the international stage. South Korea faces a pronounced security dilemma in light of these developments. The deepening military alignment between North Korea and Russia amplifies the security threat to South Korea and exacerbates tensions throughout the Asia-Pacific region. President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration has reacted by convening emergency security meetings and closely coordinating with allies, including the United States and NATO, to monitor and mitigate the risks posed by Pyongyang’s engagement in Ukraine. The potential for North Korean troops to acquire battlefield experience and augment their military capabilities through this conflict presents a long-term strategic challenge for Seoul. Similarly, the European Union has articulated substantial concerns regarding North Korea’s military support for Russia. EU leaders have cautioned that any verified North Korean involvement in the Ukraine war would lead to additional sanctions directed at both Russia and Pyongyang. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has underscored that the alliance is vigilantly monitoring the situation and maintaining communication with partners, particularly South Korea. There is also a broader apprehension that North Korea’s participation in the conflict might establish a precedent for other rogue states to engage in future international conflicts, further undermining the global order. The primary challenge posed by North Korea’s involvement in the Ukraine war lies in the potential for escalation. By contributing to Russia’s military efforts, Pyongyang risks provoking a broader conflict that could entangle additional global powers. The deployment of North Korean troops introduces a new and perilous dimension to the conflict, complicating efforts aimed at de-escalation and prolonging violence. Furthermore, North Korea’s engagement raises significant ethical and humanitarian concerns. North Korean soldiers are likely to confront severe conditions, exacerbating the already devastating humanitarian toll of the war, while their government benefits from enhanced ties with Moscow in contravention of international law. The resolution to this escalating crisis necessitates a coordinated response from the global community. It is imperative to intensify diplomatic pressure on North Korea and Russia, leveraging multilateral institutions such as the United Nations to ensure accountability for both nations. Furthermore, economic sanctions should be broadened to focus on critical sectors of North Korea’s economy, particularly its military industries, to diminish Pyongyang’s capacity to provide support to Russia in the ongoing conflict. Additionally, military support for Ukraine must be augmented, with NATO and its allies supplying increased financial assistance and training to empower Kyiv in defending against the influx of foreign mercenaries. Concurrently, it is essential to maintain open diplomatic channels to avert further escalation, prioritising negotiations for a ceasefire and a future peace settlement. In conclusion, North Korea's deployment of troops to assist Russia in Ukraine signifies a troubling realignment in global geopolitics. This expanding military alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang threatens the international order and exacerbates tensions among major global powers. The international community, particularly the United States, South Korea, and the European Union, must adopt a decisive response that integrates diplomatic, economic, and military strategies to mitigate the risks associated with this emergent cooperation. Without a robust and coordinated response, the conflict in Ukraine risks escalating further, potentially leading to a more protracted and devastating situation with significant long-term implications for global security.

US Army Advances Human-Machine Integration Tests To Enhance, Figh...	By Joe Lacdan, Army News Service Robots integrated into Army formations can help protect Soldiers and revolutionize warfare in multiple domains. Human-machine integration forces can take on dangerous battlefield operations, including overwatch, or movement of troops to a point of tactical advantage, and the suppression of the enemy, said Brig. Gen. Chad Chalfont, commandant of the Army Armor School at Fort Moore, Georgia. Those capabilities could help achieve the Secretary of the Army’s goal of 'no blood for first contact,' where human machine integrated formations make platoons and companies better at maneuvering, communicating and surviving on a transparent battlefield. HMIF could shoulder risk normally assumed by Soldiers. Army Futures Command, headquartered in Austin, Texas, is scheduled to host the Human-Machine Integration Summit IV at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, on Nov. 6-7, 2024, to inform academic, industry and government partners on HMI development and explore cost-cutting solutions. The Army has been working with prototypes and performing exercises with the new technology including robotic combat vehicles, or RCVs. On July 24, the Comanche Troop of 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Division, completed training exercises with the RCVs as part of Army Futures Command’s RCV Pilot-24 exercise. During the July exercises, Soldiers performed reconnaissance and security missions with the platoon using two control vehicles to navigate four robots, Chalfont said. Chalfont said they learned they needed a third control vehicle for that platoon to operate effectively and to operate across different nets. They also learned techniques to better communicate within their platoon while also reporting up and out to their company commander. The 1-7 Cavalry Troop, based out of Fort Cavazos, Texas, performed the exercise during a National Training Center rotation in September, but restructured the unit to use three control vehicles to control four RCVs. The robotic combat vehicles were designed to act as scouts and combat escorts with a Soldier controlling the vehicle remotely. Those vehicles can also serve as decoys to protect Soldiers from enemy fire and assist the execution of multi-domain strikes. The Army originally had three RCV models in development but has since decided to focus on a single, lightweight variant. Brig. Gen. Phillip Kiniery, Infantry School commandant at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Moore, said he wants to be able to take that infantry squad and maximize the cognitive and physical capabilities of that squad by putting the burden on the robot. He wants to increase the depth and duration by which an infantry squad can maintain contact with the enemy so that infantry squad leader can bring everything they have to bear as a system and overwhelm the enemy. Col. Kevin Bradley, director of the Next Generation Vehicle Cross Functional Team at Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, said the Army has reached a pivotal time in its history where robotic technology could give U.S. forces a competitive advantage in maneuverability, like the period between World War I and World War II. Bradley said just as the airplane, radio and tank were critical to unlocking maneuver in World War II, human-machine integration forces — the combination of robots, autonomy and their ability to reduce or offset risk — is the key to unlocking expanded maneuver in a transparent battlefield. Chalfont cited the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as an example of the evolution of warfare, where Ukrainian forces have developed capabilities to fight against the Russian army. He said a cycle of adaptation is occurring in that conflict. The next question is what will forces do with that information and where does the adaptation occur? Bradley said the Army will need to test to see if RCVs and other robotics platforms can keep pace or fight with a brigade combat team or an infantry brigade combat team. Col. Scott Shaw, director of Maneuver Capabilities Development Directorate at Fort Moore, said the service absolutely wants Soldiers controlling multiple robots in the air and on the ground using the same device. Shaw said the Army in some cases has a 'two Soldiers to one robot' ratio and is very much working toward one Soldier controlling many robotic platforms. He said that robots used in combat must have true maneuverability, be able to traverse different environments and be able to withstand some damage from enemy fires. Col. Ken Bernier, project manager for future battle platforms at Detroit Arsenal said the Army will continue experiments integrating HMIF into its formations, eventually conducting a full operational test. Bradley said that after building the base platforms of the RCVs, the focus will shift toward technology and common control, including a focus on software.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc49NN1UtASiM	2024-10-31T09:39:08-07:00	
Russia Revisits Business Opportunities With Tanzania – OpEd	With geopolitical changes at its height, Russia now considers Africa as its indispensable partner, reviewing and revisiting unfulfilled pledges made decades ago. Even as its interest is seemingly rising, Russia is not practically investing as expected across Africa. Anti-western criticisms dominate its rhetoric at business meetings, summits and conferences. Official travels have become frequent between the first and second Russia-Africa summits held respectively in late October 2019 (Sochi) and in July 2023 (St.Petersburg). Several agreements were signed at both summits with African countries. In late October, the Russian-Tanzanian intergovernmental commission, headed by Russian Economic Development Minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, was in Dar es Salaam, aiming at opening new business horizons for cooperation in Tanzania and throughout East African region. The objectives of achieving genuine economic growth and development for the majority of East Africa's impoverished population. As always, Russia looks forward to strengthen economic cooperation with Tanzania, specific spheres include broadening trade, raising tourism and reviewing the possibility of engaging in energy and exports. 'We stand ready to increase exports of agricultural machinery, construction materials, pharmaceutical products, natural gas, LNG. We view interaction in the energy field as promising. We know about Tanzania's interest in exports of gas, LNG. Apart from that, our companies are willing to work on extracting fossil fuels and implementing major pipeline projects. One of oil and gas institutes that specializes in standardizing and assessing compliance of oil and gas equipment is interested in cooperation with the Tanzanian state oil and gas company,' Reshetnikov said after an exclusive meeting with the Prime Minister of Tanzania Kassim Majaliwa, according local media reports. 'Considering the pace at which electricity consumption is growing in Tanzania and the necessity of commissioning new power generating facilities, we're prepared to build wind and solar power plants of any capacity and complexity,' he said. The advantageous geographic position of Tanzania on the coast of the Indian Ocean and connection to other African countries unlocks great opportunities for Russia. 'Bearing in mind that Tanzania is located on the Indian Ocean's coast and is a member of regional integration associations, therefore country can serve as the sole window through which Russian products could enter the Eastern African market. Russia could play an analogous role for exporters on the Eurasian Economic Union's markets,' Reshetnikov said. The agricultural sector is yet another priority. 'To maintain the agricultural sector's brisk development, Tanzania needs new technology, fertilizers, and the production of animal feedstuffs. Our companies are willing to supply them, cooperate in organizing the efficient use of fertilizers for plants, and share best agronomic practices. And also invest in joint projects to grow produce to be supplied to Russia and third countries,' Reshetnikov said. 'We expect to be able to intensify cooperation between veterinary and phytosanitary oversight agencies. Russian businesses are willing to supply animal products. We've offered a list of such companies to the Tanzanian side and asked them to issue permits for such supplies as soon as possible,' he said. Some of the other highlights embodied FESCO Transportation Group, the flagship of which is the Far Eastern Shipping Company (FESCO), planning to launch shipping services between Russian ports and Tanzania. According to the Group's vice president Dmitry Pankov, Tanzania could serve as a major transport and logistics hub for shipping goods to other countries in the East African Community (EAC) and Central African region. On tourism at the Russia-Tanzania business forum, Tanzania offered to organize a familiarization tour for Russian tourism industry representatives in order to build business relations in tourism and to eventually begin direct flights. In turn, Russia offered to promote Tanzanian tourism products on its market, to organize business meetings with Russian tour operators, and to present the tourism potential at Russia's tourism forums. Russia is also interested in joint social projects, including those in education, science and healthcare. Political and diplomatic mutual understanding between Russia and Tanzania creates good conditions for increasing trade and economic cooperation. 'Tanzanian business shows great interest in Russia. Russian business, in turn, is ready to enter new markets, invest in joint projects and share technologies. We are ready to help the Tanzanian economy maintain the high growth rates in energy, agriculture, infrastructure development and tourism,' the minister finally added. The parties discussed the nature of current interaction and promising areas of future cooperation. Reshetnikov highlighted the reliable and historically established relations between the governments, business, and people of Russia and Tanzania. After Soviet's collapse, Russia maintain an excellent diplomatic relations over these three decades with Republic of Tanzania in East Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sczlM4tpF5u0R	2024-10-31T09:37:01-07:00	
‘The Fall Of Israel: The Degradation Of Israel’s Politics, Econom...	I am always leery of hubris. It may be true that all people of good now want 'the fall' of Israel, after a century of lies, deceit, killing and more killing, first by the British and European Jews, then by the US and European Jews, now by Britain-US-EU-Israel and European and Arab Jews. But compassion does not pay the bills. The stakes keep mounting, along with high tech death toys, and it's very hard to image Israel on the verge of collapse. It, and world Jewry, have never been so rich, so powerful in all history. The major world powers – the 'collective West', China, India, Russia – provide it with most of the death toys and the fuel to run them. None of these hard-nosed political schemers want to see Israel collapse, nor do any of them lose much sleep over the plight of the Palestinians. I, like many others today, am devoting my life to help free Palestine and really, really don't want to be disappointed, so I'll temper my enthusiasm, hold off on celebrating the end of the monstrosity. I am not counting any chickens yet. It's a long way till the final act when the fat lady belts out her last hava nagila. Steinbock is a leading international economic expert who has put his chips on the side of BRICS and multipolarism. That's where the future is and the 'collective West' better wake up soon as it is being left behind. And that includes Israel, as the West's swan song to 19th c imperial glory. He is CEO and founder of Difference Group (Paul Krugman is a member of the board), its purpose: In the past, the West drove the global economic prospects. Today, that role belongs to the Global South. We help governments, institutions, businesses, and NGOs navigate in the new and complex, multipolar environment. The thesis of The Fall is simple: Aiming to turn a secular democracy into a Jewish autocracy/ theocracy, the most far-right government in the history of Israel has continued to push this judicial coup amid the fog of war. These cleavages in the Israeli society figure large in its political disintegration. Most analysis of the dilemmas Israel faces looks to the occupation of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 War and the subsequent expansion of Jewish settlements as the chief problem. They are its proximate effect; following directly on the ethnic expulsions of the Palestinian Arabs in 1948. Steinbock makes it clear the Israelis never had any interest in anything but one Jews-only state, which was sort of achieved in the 1950s. Everything thereafter is footnotes.i A pro-forma future two-state solution with present de facto one-state realities.ii The US is both the problem, having encouraged Israel in its expansion from 1948 on, feeding it with lethal weapons, financing settlements condoning ethnic cleansing and murder on a daily basis, and the solution, as the current genocidal monster Israel would indeed 'fall' at the 'twinkling of an eye' if the US closed the spigot. The last US president to try that was Bush I, whose feeble attempt to stop the settlement expansion led to his humiliating defeat from a vengeful Israel lobby a few months later in 1992. The penultimate protest, JFK's stand against Israel acquiring nukes, led to his assassination and replacement by Israel sycophant LBJ. With both Republican and Democratic parties in lockstep today, supporting Israel's textbook genocide, the only hope is public opinion, anti-apartheid activism, which is increasingly criminalized in the 'collective West'. Steinbock points to the mid-50s as the moment of truth, though we can go back to Jabotinsky in the 1920s, or Ben Gurion in the fateful 1948, when the slaughter began in earnest and was clear, certainly to the Palestinians, if not to a still naive collective West. The 'bilateral' ties with Washington and massive US military aid kicked in then and have reached staggering proportions now, a virtual blank cheque to reak havoc, no end in sight. These ties led to such new-old doctrines as the Dahiya (suburb) doctrine of carpet bombing civilians, the Hannibal directive to murder Israelis stupid enough to be taken hostage, and mass assassination factories, backed by pioneering artificial intelligence. The socialism of labor Zionism was replaced by the hard-right coalitions driven by revisionist Zionism, thanks to US neoliberal economic policies, assertive neoconservatism and Jewish-American donors. It also explains the rise of the Messianic far-right, centrist parties, and the failure of the Left. The Fall of Israel covers the country’s political and ethnic divides, economic polarization, social and military changes, the shifts in the Palestinian struggle for sovereignty, the apartheid regime in the occupied territories, the genocidal atrocities, the regional and global reverberations, and the ensuing human and economic costs, both prior and subsequent to Israel’s fatal war on Gaza. Not to mention the domestic hell – the economic polarization, the collapse of innovative, high tech start-ups, the talent brain drain, the undermined welfare state, rising poverty and the subsidized religious sector. Steinbock documents the three waves of settlers from 1948, the last following the 1993 Oslo Accords, which should have ended the settlements, but was so flawed that it allowed their acceleration, now under policing by the Palestinian Authority, even as Hamas was elected in Gaza, and the PA totally discredited, but still the de facto 'authority', now just a fig leaf for creeping genocide. Israeli attacks on Palestinians increased, killing Palestinians on a daily basis, with occasional massive bombings of Gaza (2008, 2009, 2014, 2023) killing thousands each time. Steinbock documents the atrocities, the complicity of the US. His many charts show the massive increase in West Bank land seizures in 2023, clearly part of a push to fully steal all the West Bank, even as there is no 'exit strategy' for the millions of Palestinians still alive. We know what Netanyahu would like to do to each and every one of those vermin, and at this point US politicians are more or less united on letting him 'finish the job'. Steinbock (and all of us) pin our hopes on world mass opinion. None of the world leaders apart from the Axis of Resistance can be counted on. Arab leaders loathe the pesky Palestinians almost as much as US-Israel does. It is only the revolting masses that stand between them and the Palestinians. Tactics? Strategy? Duh ... Their only strategy to achieve Apartheid 2.0 is denial of the facts on the ground, starting from 1948, denying the ethnic 'cleansing', the mass slaughter, the erasure of hundreds of Palestinian villages. Israelis pay no attention to the current slaughter, most hoping that the IDF and settlers kill all Palestinians still breathing. Israelis tactics are violence, murder, theft. In short, terrorism. But this is also its strategy since 1948, along with 'divide and conquer' of its Arab neighbors. Steinbock doesn't take seriously the option of total erasure of the Palestinians, though that is the stated goal of Israeli leaders. The victory of the dead. But even if they could dump the Palestinians in Sinai, that is not a strategy which can bring peace, which would require negotiating with your own dispossessed citizens, and neighbors. In good faith. Which is impossible for Israel, as it is terrorizing its own Arab and its neighbors. In short, Israel can only survive through 24/7 terror, which is very expensive and means 24/7 US military aid. This can continue only as long as the US can keep printing dollars to cover its own massive debt. 18% of government spending is just to pay interest on this debt. As this continues to increase, eventually the US will be bankrupt, unable to function under the mountain of debt. This inevitable bankruptcy of the US will finally hit Israel, bringing to an end the blank cheque on its daily horrors, but I keep reminding myself, it took Rome four centuries to finally collapse collapse. What is particularly creepy is how Israel has used Palestinians as guinea pigs for testing its weapons of crowd control, now touting itself as the leader in the technology of totalitarian mind-body control. The only growth industry now for Israel is producing weapons, spyware, i.e., anything disgusting and lethal. This also began in the 1950s as Israel settled in to its schizoid de facto one-state- Jews-only state. The Israel Military Industry (IMI) began collaboration with the IDF, aiming to develop the most technologically advanced small arms systems for troops fighting in urban areas and harsh environments. The state-owned IMI (i.e., socialized death toys) was privatized in 2018, when it was taken over by Elbit Systems. (Poor Elbit is now the victim of western activists, who forced it to close up shop in Britain. Elbit has become our calling card for smashing windows and splashing red paint.) Israel has had to work very hard to overcome its notoriety as terrorist and mass killer. And it worked! By the early 1980s, more than 50 countries on five continents had become customers for Israeli killing technology. Israel added some sugar to its military toys, famously bragging about its agricultural successes in 'making the desert bloom,' and uses that as PR abroad about how nice Israel really is. That and weapons, 'butter and guns', though its 'butter' is all milked from stolen land, and its guns are used not to defend, but to suppress popular uprisings in oppressive Israel-like regimes around the world. Yes, Dahiya and Hannibal, but these 'doctrines' are merely (disgusting, inhuman) tactics rather than winning long run strategies. Israel's tactics/ strategy have been violence, denial, theft with the goal of a Jews-only state, ignoring the natives who lived there, and then more violence. Which apparently works for world elites, including not just the US, but Chinese, Indian and Russian. No one besides plucky South Africa, Colombia and Bolivia have broken relations with the monster, despite rivers of crocodile tears. The Palestinian strategy is primarily nonviolent resistance with a militant wing occasionally fighting back, which is fully legal for a nation under occupation but condemned as terrorism. Funny how the real terrorists call the shots. The militants address the egregious crimes of the occupiers; they do not target civilians, even medevac helicopters.iii This strategy of compassion for the wounded is based on Islam, where rules of engagement with the enemy are nonnegotiable. Another religious principle rejects assassination of enemy leaders. Such ethical behavior is alien to Israel, which has assassinated hundreds of Palestinian, Lebanese, etc leaders, 'rationally' reasoning that the enemy will collapse without them. When Israel assassinates Palestinian leaders, they are mourned, they become martyrs, inspiring the next generation. Whatever personal flaws Nasrallah may have had, he is now a saint, an inspiration to all freedom-loving people. His body parts were gathered and temporarily hidden to prevent Israel from bombing them, and eventually will be buried probably in Karbala. Sinwar's body was captured by Israel and most likely will not be returned (maybe dumped from a plane over the ocean like Bin Laden) as it will be a potent sword hanging over Israel's head. Israel's mass murderers, such as Meir Kahane are gruesomely worshipped, but only by nutcase settlers. Israel has few such martyr-heroes, but then neither the Palestinians nor their Muslim allies target Israelis for assassination, not believing that it is a useful tactic or strategy, rather giving a romantic aura of martyrdom to any victim as indeed is the case when Israelis target Palestinians. The Palestinians' goal is jannah, the path/ strategy is moral and ethical living, prayer, jihad, martyrdom. Tactics are waging war to the death against the enemy, picking up unexploded Israeli bombs and reusing them. All the time, appealing to humanity, to the basic decency of the outside world, calling on world opinion, boycotting, bringing criminal charges to bring peace. Steinbock introduces necrotization, which seeks to transform a world of life into a world of death, because that is what displacement, dispossession and devastation ultimately require. It is the collective psychological obliteration of those who have nothing to lose, and therefore fight for their homes, refuse to move away, risk nothingness for being.iv Is this a strategy, or again just a tactic meant to kill or so disillusion Palestinians, so that whoever remains alive will be glad to leave. Whatever. It ignores the 'last stand' psychology of the dispossessed, who prefer to die fighting for their homes than to flee to a desolate refugee camp, so it really just amounts to genocide. It just occurred to me that a crude policy of terror, dispossession and genocide doesn't need any subtleties like tactics vs strategy. The victory of the dead. Jew vs Jew, Arab turmoil The real showdown should be between the more universalist Jewish diaspora and the nationalist, racist Israeli Jews. Even as Trump is showered with Adelson's millions to complete the Israeli dream of total control of the Middle East, some Jews are protesting, but have made zero difference politicly as the Democrats and Republicans are still in lockstep. So much for that strategy. What's left? The brain drain and increased emigration of Jews from Israel as the crisis deepens. But that leaves the Kahane-ites in control. So much for that strategy. He considers the rise of Islamic movements in particular the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under al-Banna, which spread to all the Arab world, rivaled by Arab nationalism under Nasser and Hafez Assad. In all cases, the MBs were crushed by neocolonial regimes, and then attempts to promote Arab nationalism failed, descending into personal dictatorships. Muslims make poor nationalists. Islam rejects ideologies that interfere with being good Muslims. In Iraq the Baath party reformers finally ending in the humiliating defeat of atheistic Saddam Hussein (who called on Allah in a panic at the end). Though battered, the MBs remain the only survivors of a century of anti-imperialist struggle, still determined to face off against the Zionist occupiers. With Israel commanding everyone's undivided attention, the Arab world remains shamefully 'divided and conquered', resentful, even hostile to Shia Iran's lifeline to Gaza and Lebanon. Jordan and Saudi assistance to US-Israel to shoot down Iran's missiles will never be erased. Jordan and Saudi leaders have a lot to account for before their people. Only when Israel is eventually brought to justice, can the Middle East develop more naturally. Islam remains the bedrock, and Islamic reforms will be the way forward, based now on the experience of the past century, including Egypti's MB, Islamic Iran and Afghanistan. The Saudis and Gulf emirates are remnants of 19th c British imperialism and do not represent the future of the Egyptian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Jordanian, etc masses. But until the enemy is defeated, we must stand shoulder to shoulder (though the Saudis et al should keep a look out over theirs). Russia, China Steinbock doesn't make predictions on their account. He puts his hopes on BRICS, especially China's hint at engagement, its brokering Saudi-Iranian reconciliation, and Palestinian factions uniting. The latter was called the Beijing Declaration, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a timetable to implement a two-state solution. I think it is a mistake to be too hopeful. Russia and Chinese have highly developed economic relations with Israel; Russia provides it will the oil to use to bomb Palestinians; China is Israel's largest trade partner – 18% of trade vs 10% for US and 2.5% for Russia. Chinese investment is more than US$15b, spawning seed capital in Israeli startup companies, as well as the acquisition of Israeli companies by major Chinese corporations that incorporate Israel's know how to help invigorate the development of the modern Chinese economy more efficiently. China ranked second in 2015 after the US on collaboration with Israeli high-tech firms that are backed by Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist. Neither Russia nor China want to see Israel collapse. BRICS is not a coherent economic force. We are stuck with US-Israel, the Axis of Resistance, the Palestinian now scattered around the world, working with the handful of anti-Zionist diaspora Jews, until the US itself collapses. That seems to be our strategy. All countries listen to China, Israel included. It would be lost if China made an serious move to threaten its economic ties. China's recent two-state proposals prompted Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to move forward with plans to present a joint political vision for rehabilitating the Gaza Strip and establishing a Palestinian state after the Israel-Hamas war. To preempt such schemes, Netanyahu’s office presented its own vision of 'Gaza 2035' in May. The Israeli proposal labels Gaza as an 'Iranian outpost', taunting the quisling Arab leaders as ineffectual, traitors, allies of the hated Israel. So Gaza can be taken, as it isn't really part of the Arab world, but an Iranian outpost which must be destroyed. More tactic than strategy and very silly. Israel would mobilize the emirates and Saudis to divvy out aid to Gazans and hunt down and eliminate Hamas, much like the Oslo Accords got the PA to police Palestinians as settlements proceeded. After 15 years, if things go well, some limited autonomy would be allowed, all the while under Israeli hegemony. Steinbock puts his eggs in China's basket in his vision of any future Middle East peace. At each step, China is filling in where the US fears (or is too lazy) to tread. Re Egypt, in the absence of Israel’s full withdrawal from the occupied territories, the bilateral trust with Israel has been eroding for decades. Today it is sustained mainly by US aid, which is vital to bottomless-pit Cairo. Meanwhile China’s multibillion-dollar economic cooperation initiatives are fostering rather than undermining Egyptian development. Ditto Jordan, where China is building a national railway network, an oil pipeline to link Iraq and Jordan, and a new Jordan-China university. Egypt and Jordan, weak and corrupt, are throwing themselves at China's feet, much like Iran did over the past decade. China is waging a positive-sum war against/ with the world, promising prosperity and Chinese hegemony as a package deal. (At least this is not the subtle Bretton Woods 'prosperity and US imperialism'.) China's Belt Road Initiative has reached around the world, despite US attempts to sabotage China with its own rail-ship road from India through the Middle East to Europe, but that assumes Saudi compliance, which is dead-on-arrival now. One can only laugh in disbelief as US hegemony is being K-Oed by the Chinese economic fist – everywhere. Unlike US-Israel, China has a clear strategy of nonzero sum cooperation with all, promising advantages where past 'aid' meant corruption, misuse of funds, more debt. The US-China economic rivalry is providing lots of brainstorming by potential participants in both hopeful outcomes, but China remains cautious, more or less abiding by US sanctions on Russia. BRICS at least has raised the profile of the South, given them collective clout though still much less than the collective West. With the Ukraine war unending, Russia is now unofficially joining all anti-US efforts, probably providing Iran and the Houthis with satellite information to keep the Suez Canal out of commission and for accurate bombing, possibly even providing a few missiles and drones. Why not? The world really is going to Hell in a handbasket, and the ride is rocky but exciting and even hopeful, considering the bad guys seem to be doing everything wrong, pushing Putin into the hands of enemy. Nuke time? The ongoing war on multiple fronts from the Axis of Resistance, with 100,000s of Hezbollah bombs ready, could push Israel to use its nukes.v The Begin 'doctrine' was 'formulated' to justify bombing Iraq's nuclear facilities and is still in play against Iran. Several nuclear sites were bombed in October, though not the main sites, and were accompanied by a promise to bombing Iran's nuclear facilities after the election. Trump has already voiced his approval. But Iran's success in bombing Israel twice in 2024 shows it has jumped ahead of Israel (and the US) in hypersonic missiles, which can be mobilized to really destroy little sitting-duck Israel. Israel is still loudly threatening Iran but my gut reaction is to imagine hundreds of hypersonic missiles reining down on Israel. Israelis are uniformly racist monsters now, so the civilian-military distinction is moot. When the whole world feels that way about you, all the king's horse and all the king's lackeys won't be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again. In the West, Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), and the Abraham Accords (2020–2021) with some Gulf states are often portrayed as steps toward a two-state solution. In Israel, they are seen more as bilateral 'normalization' deals with individual Arab countries that will over time marginalize or exclude Palestinians from a final peace solution. The Gaza War has jeopardized the future of such normalization agreements, while severely shuttering the existing deals. The trouble is neither the US nor Israel ever took the negotiations seriously. No one believed then or now that the two-state solution is possible. Meanwhile even US presidents don't control things, as congress is completely in thrall to Israel and will not allow any pressure to be put on Israel to negotiate. The Knesset voted unanimously against a Palestinian state for the nth time (68, 9 Arab Israelis voting for a Palestinian state). Given the likely Trump second term, funded by Adelson, probably none of this matters at all. Trump's Project 2025 includes Project Esther, which plans to crush all anti-Israel dissent in the US and Europe and to create a Potemkin villlage of acceptable Palestinians, to be kept in line by Arab sheikhs with Israeli puppet masters. Netanyahu couldn't have said it better. Steinbock is hopeful re Russia, with its offer to Iran of S-400 anti-missile defense (a decade after Iran paid for them), showing the US that it is not the only kid on the block with nukes. But Steinbock's only real hope is that world opinion, backed by a Jewish diaspora, will somehow click in and bring the US to its senses. I would add the Palestinian diaspora, which is already larger (in 2003 9.6m) than the Jewish one (8.5m), working together, will be the driving force of change. And Islam. It is the fastest growing religion (always has been) and the Middle East is now multiple-birthing Ziophobia and Islamophilia. It's never been a better time to be a Muslim. We have a huge diaspora in the House of War. And we have Boycott Divest Sanction as the secular version of jihad. When Jews, Christians* and Muslims can join forces, we can do anything. The first real sign that South African apartheid would be dismantled was when (Jewish) MP Harry Schwarz met with ANC's Mangosuthu Buthelezi to sign the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first such agreement by black and white political leaders in South Africa. But it took another 2 decades of struggle until de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government. It seems we have reached that first stage today. Ehud Olmert, who served as the Israeli prime minister from 2006 to 2009, and Nasser al-Kidwa, the Palestinian foreign minister from 2005 to 2006, met Pope Francis October 17, 2024, to promote a peace plan that would see a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel 'on the basis of 1967 borders' with a few territorial adjustments. Their plan calls for the city of Jerusalem to be the capital of both Israel and Palestine, with the Old City being 'administered by a trusteeship of five states of which Israel and Palestine are part.' Praise be to God הלל לאלוהים الحمد لله i Dan Steinbock, The Fall of Israel: The Degradation of Israel’s Politics, Economy & Military, 2025, p362. ii Israel has been in complete control of all lands since 1948.

US Presidential Election: Key Policy Differences Between Kamala H...	As the U.S. presidential election on November 5 approaches, the policy differences between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are becoming increasingly evident. Kamala Harris takes a more moderate stance on immigration, while Trump aims to deport all undocumented immigrants. Harris pledges to continue social spending on NGOs, whereas Trump plans to cut social aid. Regarding the Ukraine war, Trump seeks to engage in dialogue with Russia, while Harris adopts a more cautious approach. Both candidates have Jewish family ties; Harris's husband is of Jewish descent, as is Trump's son-in-law. Harris has expressed her intent to maintain U.S. support for Israel, while Trump is rumored to have unexpected moves planned for Iran. Their approaches to U.S.-Turkey relations also differ. Harris appears likely to keep communications with Turkey limited, whereas Trump aims for a more active relationship. The candidates' educational and career backgrounds reflect distinct differences: Harris is a well-educated lawyer and former state prosecutor with a strong commitment to ethics, while Trump is known as a profit-driven figure in the business world. Kamala Harris is expected to continue Joe Biden's economic and foreign policy trajectory, which could result in rising inflation and unemployment, along with ongoing arms support for Ukraine and the Middle East. Trump, in contrast, aims to cut spending to curb inflation and reduce unemployment. In his campaign, Trump employs populist tactics, bringing celebrities to the stage and criticizing minorities and immigrants. Harris is expected to work with experienced advisors, while Trump tends toward loyalty-based, nepotistic appointments. Trump lacks the support of key Republican figures, while Harris has open backing from Democratic members, including former President Barack Obama, who speaks on her behalf. Polls show the candidates are closely matched, with a narrow margin expected to determine the outcome. Votes from low-income voters and turnout rates are likely to be significant factors. If Trump loses, it's anticipated he may contest the results, as he did previously, potentially leading to political tension. The above assessment reflects the perspective of an average observer outside the U.S. who is not a voter. The choice made by American voters will impact not only the U.S. but everyone around the globe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc0XW-_SfuINs	2024-10-31T09:33:22-07:00	
Allah’s Relationships With Three Different Religious Communities ...	For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations all over the earth, and not one of them could establish an ongoing, imageless, monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with one small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for centuries with the people of this tribe, until they were able to establish an ongoing, imageless, monotheistic community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal to the covenant believers. Allah selected Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) and the descendants of Prophets Ishmael, Issac, and Jacob to be the first, but not the last monotheistic community. 'There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him.' [Qur'an 60:4] and 'Indeed Ibrahim was a nation obedient to Allah, a Hanif, he was not one of the polytheists.' [Qur'an 16:120]. A major misunderstanding of the Biblical concept of God choosing a people or a prophet is caused by the use of the word 'the' chosen when a better translation would be 'a' chosen prophet or people. Relationships are always unique and exclusive, but just as a parent can and should have a loving relationship with several different children; God can and does have unique and exclusive relationships with many different prophets and many different religious communities. Before Prophets Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus, 'We (God) sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they call Allah in humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not call Allah in humility? On the contrary, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them.'(Qur'an 6:42-43) The Banu Israel (Jewish People) became the first ongoing, imageless, monotheistic community to last to the present because God made a special covenant with all the Banu Israel which; according to the Bible, was similar to a marital partnership, as can be seen from the following Biblical verses: 1. God proposes a marriage covenant at Sinai: God said to Moses 'Speak thus to the house of Jacob, and tell this to the children of Israel... Now if you listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the peoples, for the whole earth is mine. You will be my kingdom of priests, my holy nation. These words you shall speak to the people of Israel' (this is the proposal) 'Moses came and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these proposals as God had commanded him. All the people answered together, 'All that God has proposed, we will do.' (like 'I do' at a wedding). Moses brought this answer back to the Lord.' (Exodus 19:5-8). 2. Why the Jews? Because God loved their ancestors. 'The Lord cared for your ancestors, loving them and chose their descendants after them from all nations, as you are this day.' (Deuteronomy 10:15) 'I will fulfill my covenant between myself and you (Abraham) and your descendants after you, generation after generation, an everlasting covenant, to be your God, yours and your descendants after you.' (Genesis 17:7)' 'All the families of the earth shall be blessed through you (Jacob) and your descendants.' (Genesis 28:14) 3. Why the Jews? Divine love isn't based on popularity or large numbers. 'It was not because you were more numerous than any other nation that the Lord cared about you and chose you, for you are the smallest of nations; it was because of the Lord's love for you, and his oath to your ancestors.' (Deuteronomy 7:7-8) 4. Does being chosen and special make you better? No. A committed loving relationship results in more giving (Mitsvot), more receiving (Torah, Prophets and sages) and more grief (because each cares about the other). 'For you alone have I cared among all the nations of the world, therefore I will castigate you for all your iniquities.' (Amos 3:2) 5. Israel can't adore any other God, but God can and does redeem other nations. 'Are not Israelites like Ethiopians to me? Says the Lord. Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Crete and the Aramaeans from Kir?' (Amos 9:7) 6. Jews are not THE chosen people; they are A chosen people, the first of several ongoing monotheistic religions. A parent can have many children but only one is the firstborn. 'These are the words of the Lord, Israel is my first-born son.' (Exodus 4:22) The Jewish people was the first community to enter into a sacred relationship with the one God but they are not the only ones to do so. In later centuries other communities were formed to spread monotheism worldwide. That process will continue until all nations have a sacred relationship to the one God of Israel. 'Each nation will walk in the name of its God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' (Micah 4:5) Even in the Messianic Age the other nations will be free to faithfully follow their vision of the One God. As the Qur'an states: 'For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in prayer). So hasten towards all that is good. Wheresoever you may be, Allâh will bring you together. Truly, Allâh is able to do all things.' (2:148) The commentary/Tafsir of al-Jalalayn states: 'Every person, of every community, has his direction/qibla, to which he turns in prayer, so compete with one another in good works; strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together, gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.' And as Prophet Isaiah states: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5) 7. What is Israel chosen for? To be an agent of holiness and enlightenment. 'You are the children of the Lord your God...You are a people holy to the Lord your God.' (Leviticus 19). 'The Lord has chosen you out of all the nations on earth to be his special possession.' (Deuteronomy 14:1-2) 'I will make you a light for the nations' (Isaiah 49:6) Thus, other nations will also be blessed through their own religions that were connected by Israel's covenant with God at Sinai, thus fulfilling the promise to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth. As a Rabbi, I believe that the many prophets Allah/God sends to the Children of Israel is a sign of the ongoing covenant between Allah and the Children of Israel. I know Muslim interpreters interpret 2:63-64 to mean that the favors mentioned in those verses were conditional with a certain period of time when the Divine trust—the representation and promotion of God's eternal religion—rested on the shoulders of the Children of Israel. The biblical religious tradition claims this trust is an 'ongoing covenant' between God and the Children of Israel. Clearly, not all Jews live up to this trust, but God's commitment is ongoing for the whole Jewish Umma of those who do. For Jews, the ongoing continuity of God's covenant with the Jewish People is achieved through the faithful linked chain connection of endless successive loyal generations. This is why the Jewish Umma is both a religious and an ethnic community. Although many Christians claim the new covenant replaces the old covenant for all Jews (1), and some Muslims say the Jewish covenant has expired for all Jews, faithful Jews remain loyal to their spiritual relationship with God. I believe wisdom dictates that we follow the Qur'an's (22:67) advice: 'For every community We have appointed a whole system of worship which they are to observe. So do not let them draw you into disputes concerning this matter.' The Qur'an relates God's ongoing concern for faithful Jews when Prophet Moses speaks to his people as follows: 'O my people! Remember God's favor upon you, for He appointed among you Prophets, and rulers, and He granted to you favors such as He had not granted to anyone else in the worlds' (5:20). This is one reason why Jews in Sunni Muslim lands have rarely been forcibly converted; as frequently happened in Christian lands. The principle that God can make a covenant with a whole people, and not just with those who are faithful believers, also helps me understand a powerful verse where the Qur'an narrates that at Sinai, before Allah gives the Torah to the Children of Israel, He makes a covenant with them. Allah raises the mountain above the whole people saying: 'Hold firmly to what We have given you (the Torah) and remember what is in it' (Qur'an 2:63). The whole nation's fate stands under the shadow of mount Sinai, and this explains the miracle of all Israel agreeing to the covenant. This may be the reason why Moses/Musa is the only prophet whose book comes not from an angel but directly from Allah. Individuals who hear a prophet may choose to believe or disbelieve, but in this case God Almighty makes 'an offer that you can't refuse,' so, as far as Judaism is concerned, everyone of the Children of Israel has to struggle for all generations to come, with living up to the covenant their ancestors chose to enter into at Mount Sinai. This concept, of a chosen (by being pressed into being a) choosing people, can and among many ultra-orthodox Jews has led to exaggerated and self-righteous feelings of pride. Thus, when the Qur'an (7:171) mentions another time the same event, when the Mount was moved above the Children of Israel, this verse is followed by a reminder in 7:172 that 'children of Adam' were all made bear witness against their own souls: ''Am I not your Lord?' They said 'Yes, we do bear witness.' God Almighty made a covenant with all individuals 'lest [they] should say on the Day of Resurrection, 'We were indeed unaware of this'.' Thus, while loyalty to the commitment one's ancestors made at Mount Sinai may inspire greater effort for Jews in following God's will, when Jews, like Muslims, Christians and everyone else on earth face judgement on the Day of Resurrection, we are all judged as individuals. As Prophet Abraham says: 'Do not forsake me on the Day of Resurrection, a day where neither money nor children will benefit except whoever meets Allah with a sound heart' (26:87-89). The Qur'an thus makes clear that, every person Jew or non-Jew, also has a opportunity as an individual to choose and be chosen, by choosing wisdom over gold and understanding over silver as the Biblical Book of Proverbs (16:16) states: 'Acquiring wisdom is better than gold; and acquiring understanding is being chosen over silver.' This reminder by the Qur'an that no religious community should be self-righteous is similar to that of prophet Amos who tells the Children of Israel: 'Are you not like the Children of Ethiopia to me, O Children of Israel? says God. Did I not redeem Israel from Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?' (Amos 9:7) I myself see the Torah's description of the descendants of Prophet Abraham as destined to become the first chosen people, as a testimony about the significance of Prophet Abraham himself. Islamic tradition asserts that there have been tens of thousands of prophets who were sent to all the various tribes and nations of the world. Messengers however, number only 313. Of the 313, we only know the names of five who brought a sacred scripture. The first one of the five is Abraham as the Qur'an states: 'Indeed, this is in the former scriptures; the scriptures of Abraham and Moses. (87:19), and: 'Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses and Abraham. (53:36). For many centuries Abraham's faithful descendants within the Children of Israel were the only monotheistic community that survived as the Qur'an states: 'Those who disbelieve are steeped in arrogance and defiance. How many generations have We destroyed before them? They cried out when it was too late to escape. And they marveled that a warner had come to them from among them. The disbelievers said, 'This is a lying magician.' 'Did he turn all the gods into one God? This is something strange.' The notables among them announced: 'Go on, and hold fast to your gods. This is something planned. We never heard of this in the former faith. This is nothing but a fabrication. (Qur'an 38:2-7) Jews could have credited this situation to their own spiritual qualities. But the Torah teaches Jews not to be proud of themselves for being the first monotheistic community to survive long after their messenger was gone; because it was God's choice to choose them. Their only choice was to always be conscious of, and obligated by, God's choice; to always choose remaining loyal to their ancestors pledge at Mount Sinai: 'We will do.' Note (1): This is the concept of supersessionism , a.k.a. replacement theology or fulfillment theology. Many early Christian believed that the Christian Church succeeded the Israelites as 'the' chosen people of God. This was a common belief in the Church until the Nazi Holocaust, which triggered theological thought after World War II. The Roman Catholic Church largely abandoned the concept starting in the mid-1970''s. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), United Church of Christ, and Episcopal Church (USA) followed in the 1980's. Some denominations still retain the belief.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc_wqh5Ir64hJ	2024-10-31T09:32:20-07:00	
Khawariji Terrorism: The TTP And ISKP Threat To Pakistan’s Stabil...	Pakistan, a country with a rich cultural tapestry and a strategic geopolitical location, has been grappling with various security challenges. Among the most pressing of these challenges is the rise of Khawariji terrorists, a term used to describe extremist groups like the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). Both TTP and ISKP share a common Khawariji ideology; encompassing un-Islamic, inhuman, immoral and barbaric practices based upon misinterpretation of Islamic teachings. For the past two decades, Pakistan has been grappling with the menace of Khawariji terrorists, a term used to describe groups like TTP and ISKP that engage in extremist activities under the guise of Islamic righteousness. These groups justify their acts of violence through a distorted interpretation of Islamic teachings, which has been consistently condemned by Islamic scholars. Religious leaders in Pakistan have declared these organizations’ activities as un-Islamic and 'haram' (forbidden), noting that their actions are driven by a desire for power and destruction, rather than any genuine religious or moral cause. The nexus between the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) is a significant threat to the security and stability of Pakistan. Both groups have been involved in numerous terrorist activities, targeting civilians, security forces, and government officials. The TTP is a Pakistani Taliban group that seeks to overthrow the Pakistani government and establish an Islamic state, while the ISKP is a branch of the Islamic State that operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both TTP and ISKP are also widely regarded as foreign proxies, working in service of external enemies of Pakistan. These groups are funded and supported by outside actors who have an interest in destabilizing the region. Their acts of violence serve the interests of their foreign masters, making them tools in a larger geopolitical game aimed at undermining Pakistan’s sovereignty. By creating chaos and terror, TTP and ISKP advance the agenda of those who seek to weaken Pakistan from within. While ISKP is known for its hostility towards the Afghan Taliban—physically fighting them and condemning them in propaganda campaigns—its stance towards the TTP is noticeably softer. There has never been a reported clash between TTP and ISKP, despite their presence in the same regions of Afghanistan. This strange lack of conflict between two seemingly opposed factions further strengthens the perception that the two groups are collaborating on some level. It suggests that ISKP may be serving as a cover for TTP’s operations, allowing TTP to use ISKP as a tool for deflection. The Khawariji TTP is known to perpetrate attacks on civilian targets, often using ISKP as a front to shield itself from public backlash. ISKP, on the other hand, is infamous for launching suicide bombers on religious gatherings, mosques, and scholars. This division of labor, where ISKP handles particularly heinous attacks on civilians while TTP claims responsibility only for assaults on security forces, is a strategy to manage public opinion and deflect blame from TTP’s operations. The calculated nature of these attacks reveals the strategic collaboration between the two groups. Another sinister aspect of TTP and ISKP’s operations is their method of radicalizing youth. Both organizations prey on vulnerable teenagers, coercing them into carrying out suicide attacks. While they exploit young minds for these barbaric purposes, it is worth noting that no high-ranking terrorist leader has ever sacrificed himself in such a manner. This highlights the hypocrisy of their leadership, who manipulate others to die for a cause they themselves do not genuinely believe in. The presence of Khawariji TTP and ISKP in Afghanistan is not a secret, as it has been well-documented by various international security organizations and media outlets, including reports by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and Western think tanks. These reports affirm that both TTP and ISKP enjoy safe havens in Afghanistan, where they plot and launch attacks on Pakistan without facing significant opposition from the Afghan government. This reality further reinforces the idea that the two groups are working in tandem, using Afghanistan as a base of operations to destabilize Pakistan. Pakistani religious scholars have long condemned the actions of these terrorist groups, collectively issuing a ‘fatwa’ (religious decree) through the Paigham-e-Pakistan initiative. This decree explicitly declares the activities of TTP and ISKP as haram, stating that their so-called armed struggle is not only un-Islamic but also a direct affront to the teachings of Islam. The fatwa emphasizes that killing innocent civilians, targeting religious figures, and promoting violence under the guise of religion is forbidden in Islam. TTP and ISKP may operate under different banners and claim different allegiances, but they are ultimately two sides of the same coin. Both groups share a common Khawariji ideology that distorts Islamic teachings to justify their inhuman and immoral acts. Their collaboration in terrorism, manipulation of youth, and use as foreign proxies to destabilize Pakistan all point to a coordinated effort that threatens the peace and security of the region. The fight against these Khawariji terrorists will continue, as Pakistan remains resolute in its determination to rid the country of this menace, with the support of religious scholars who have unequivocally declared these groups as enemies of Islam and humanity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc9kCJXkaxXTv	2024-10-31T09:30:45-07:00	
Bangladesh: Bold Steps Needed To Boost Garment Sector – OpEd	BGMEA had demanded a massive production disruption due to recent labor unrest. Apart from this, there have been various incidents including factory closures and labor protests. And when it is known that in the first eight months of the year, the export of clothing made in the United States, along with the European Union (EU) countries, has seen a decline. And in this, the export income of various countries, including Bangladesh, China, Vietnam and India has decreased, so it appears that it is necessary to take the overall situation into consideration. It is known that in other years, the growth in ready-made clothing business has decreased in January-August this year. According to the data, the exports of China, the world's largest exporter of ready-made garments, Vietnam, which is second, and Bangladesh, which is third, have decreased. We think that it is the duty of the concerned parties of the country to take this initiative and continue efforts in implementation. Notably, these data on the decline in exports have emerged in the January-August report of Eurostat and the US Department of Commerce's Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA). According to the data, exports to the European Union (EU), the largest market for ready-made garments, fell by 3.63 percent in the eight months from January to August this year. At the same time, the US market fell by 4.04 percent. The export income of two major trade circles decreased by 223 crore 63 lakh dollars and 215 crore 48 lakh 90 thousand dollars respectively. The concerns need to be taken into account, exporters and economists consider the situation to be the effect of economic recession around the world. They say, the Russia-Ukraine war, instability in the Middle East is affecting the global economy. It is worth noting that, in January-August, 5 thousand 932 million 14 million 70 thousand dollars worth of ready-made clothes were exported to Europe. And last year at the same time the export was 6 thousand 155 crore 77 lakh 70 thousand dollars. In January-August, China's exports decreased by 3.63 percent, Vietnam by 4.10 percent and Bangladesh by 3.53 percent. Apart from this, Turkey decreased by 7.52 percent and Cambodia decreased by 2.73 percent. On the other hand, the US, the second largest market for ready-made garments, exported $5,132,210,000 worth of ready-made garments in the first eight months of the year. During the same period in the previous year, exports were worth 5,345,700,000 dollars. In January-August, China's exports decreased by 2.70 percent, Vietnam by 1.03 percent and Bangladesh by 9.17 percent. It needs to be mentioned that the country's stakeholders need to take this into account, as a single country, Bangladesh's exports of garments to the US market have decreased significantly. According to the data, Bangladesh is the country with the second highest export decline among the notable countries in the export of manufactured garments to the US market. In the eight months of January-August, Bangladesh exported 4.7 billion 9.8 million dollars worth of ready-made garments to that country. During the same period of the previous year, exports of ready-made garments were worth 518.51 million dollars. Notably, exporters say that the exports of ready-made garments decreased from the beginning of the year to August, but the positive trend has returned to exports from September. It is expected that when the next report comes, it will be seen that the demand for ready-made garments has increased. All in all, we would like to say that a decline in apparel exports is naturally a cause for concern. As a result, taking into account the overall situation, the relevant people have to work on determining what to do and its proper implementation. According to the director of the Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the economy of the United States and European Union countries was bad. Slowly the economy is turning around, now it will increase. In addition, exports have not only decreased in our country. Pointing out that the exports of almost all the countries have decreased, he expressed hope to increase the exports to these countries by increasing the capacity. It is reasonable to expect that effective initiatives to increase exports will continue taking into account the overall situation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc4t1sus-mdLf	2024-10-31T09:28:50-07:00	
Indonesia’s Gutsy Response To Chinese Incursion Shows Ex-General ...	By Tria Dianti Jakarta’s feisty response last week to the Chinese coast guard 'disrupting' Indonesian survey activities in the North Natuna Sea appears to show that new President Prabowo Subianto has shed his 'cuddly grandpa' election persona in favor of his familiar disposition as an ex-general, analysts said. On three occasions during the first week of Prabowo’s presidency, Indonesian coast guard and navy ships chased and expelled the Chinese vessel from South China Sea waters in Jakarta’s exclusive economic zone, which Beijing said was 'under the jurisdiction of China.' The measures taken by Indonesia were calculated, according to Arie Afriansyah, an expert in international maritime law at the University of Indonesia. 'The actions are a positive sign, not only sending a message to the Indonesian people but also to the international community that the Natuna Sea is now being guarded more closely,' Arie told BenarNews. 'I believe the maneuvers of the China Coast Guard are part of a strategy to test the waters and see if the new government under Prabowo is lenient.' Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, an international relations researcher, concurred. 'Prabowo’s preference is to be more assertive in protecting assets and upholding sovereignty,' said Waffaa, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta. 'However, this should be balanced with good neighborly diplomacy. It remains to be seen how this will play out.' The Indonesian coast guard (Bakamla) said that when a China Coast Guard ship identified itself over radio as patrolling 'in Chinese waters,' it responded by affirming Indonesia’s sovereign rights under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). China Coast Guard ship 5402 'disrupted the Arwana 3D Seismic Data Survey and Processing activities being carried out by PT Pertamina East Natuna using the MV Geo Coral ship,' Bakamla said in a weekend statement about the Oct. 21 incident involving a vessel from the Indonesian state-owned oil firm. Two Indonesian Navy patrol ships and a Bakamla air patrol aircraft 'carried out shadowing and succeeded in driving the CCG 5402 ship out of Indonesia's jurisdiction in the North Natuna Sea,' it added. 'Bakamla’s expulsion of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel from the North Natuna Sea’s continental shelf is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguarding our maritime domain,' Bakamla said. Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said the CCG vessel’s operations were legitimate and within Chinese jurisdiction. 'China stands ready to enhance communication and consultation with Indonesia through diplomatic channels and properly handle maritime issues between the two countries,' he said during a daily press conference Oct. 24. Indonesian presidential spokesman Hasan Nasbi and the foreign ministry declined to comment about the three Chinese encroachments, the first of which occurred a day after Prabowo met with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng on Oct. 20. Han was in Jakarta to attend Prabowo’s inauguration. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s new Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin had what appeared to be a cordial meeting mid-week with Chinese Ambassador Wang Lutong, who paid him a courtesy call. 'In the meeting, the two hope[d] to create new opportunities in bilateral relations that are not only limited to defense cooperation, but also to increasing the stability and prosperity of the region,' the ministry said via X. 'In addition, the Minister of Defense also expressed his desire to continue to increase cooperation in the defense sector, in the form of joint exercises between Indonesia and China.' The South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest maritime regions, has long been a geopolitical flashpoint, with China claiming much of the sea that overlaps with territories also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Although Indonesia does not consider itself a claimant in the territorial dispute, Beijing’s maritime assertions often infringe upon Indonesia’s EEZ, which Jakarta in July 2017 renamed North Natuna Sea. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China’s claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected. Under President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo (2014-24), similar confrontations with Chinese coast guard ships were not uncommon. However, Prabowo’s background as a military leader has led some to expect a firmer stance from his administration, said Khairul Fahmi, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and Security Studies. The incident in the Natuna Sea may align Indonesia more closely with Southeast Asian neighbors such as the Philippines and Vietnam advocating for a rules-based order in the waterway, he added. 'I believe the Prabowo administration is demonstrating a more assertive stance towards maritime sovereignty issues, especially in the Natuna Sea,' Khairul told BenarNews. For years, ASEAN and China have been negotiating a Code of Conduct to manage the South China Sea dispute, yet a final agreement remains elusive. 'By positioning itself as a firm but open country for dialogue, Indonesia can strengthen its position in the region without causing unnecessary conflict,' Khairul said. Yet Indonesia’s challenge remains balancing its sovereignty with its economic ties to China, which is Indonesia’s largest trading partner and a key investor in its infrastructure and energy sectors, analysts said. 'Indonesia can assert territorial integrity while maintaining constructive relations with China,' said Arie of the University of Indonesia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc1mRQJ6_F6vh	2024-10-30T18:26:55-07:00	
They Are Scrubbing The Internet Right Now – OpEd	Instances of censorship are growing to the point of normalization. Despite ongoing litigation and more public attention, mainstream social media has been more ferocious in recent months than ever before. Podcasters know for sure what will be instantly deleted and debate among themselves over content in gray areas. Some like Brownstone have given up on YouTube in favor of Rumble, sacrificing vast audiences if only to see their content survive to see the light of day. It’s not always about being censored or not. Today’s algorithms include a range of tools that affect searchability and findability. For example, the Joe Rogan interview with Donald Trump racked up an astonishing 34 million views before YouTube and Google tweaked their search engines to make it hard to discover, while even presiding over a technical malfunction that disabled viewing for many people. Faced with this, Rogan went to the platform X to post all three hours. Navigating this thicket of censorship and quasi-censorship has become part of the business model of alternative media. Those are just the headline cases. Beneath the headlines, there are technical events taking place that are fundamentally affecting the ability of any historian even to look back and tell what is happening. Incredibly, the service Archive.org which has been around since 1994 has stopped taking images of content on all platforms. For the first time in 30 years, we have gone a long swath of time – since October 8-10 – since this service has chronicled the life of the Internet in real time. As of this writing, we have no way to verify content that has been posted for three weeks of October leading to the days of the most contentious and consequential election of our lifetimes. Crucially, this is not about partisanship or ideological discrimination. No websites on the Internet are being archived in ways that are available to users. In effect, the whole memory of our main information system is just a big black hole right now. The trouble on Archive.org began on October 8, 2024, when the service was suddenly hit with a massive Denial of Service attack (DDOS) that not only took down the service but introduced a level of failure that nearly took it out completely. Working around the clock, Archive.org came back as a read-only service where it stands today. However, you can only read content that was posted before the attack. The service has yet to resume any public display of mirroring of any sites on the Internet. In other words, the only source on the entire World Wide Web that mirrors content in real time has been disabled. For the first time since the invention of the web browser itself, researchers have been robbed of the ability to compare past with future content, an action that is a staple of researchers looking into government and corporate actions. It was using this service, for example, that enabled Brownstone researchers to discover precisely what the CDC had said about Plexiglas, filtration systems, mail-in ballots, and rental moratoriums. That content was all later scrubbed off the live Internet, so accessing archive copies was the only way we could know and verify what was true. It was the same with the World Health Organization and its disparagement of natural immunity which was later changed. We were able to document the shifting definitions thanks only to this tool which is now disabled. What this means is the following: Any website can post anything today and take it down tomorrow and leave no record of what they posted unless some user somewhere happened to take a screenshot. Even then there is no way to verify its authenticity. The standard approach to know who said what and when is now gone. That is to say that the whole Internet is already being censored in real time so that during these crucial weeks, when vast swaths of the public fully expect foul play, anyone in the information industry can get away with anything and not get caught. We know what you are thinking. Surely this DDOS attack was not a coincidence. The time was just too perfect. And maybe that is right. We just do not know. Does Archive.org suspect something along those lines? Here is what they say: Last week, along with a DDOS attack and exposure of patron email addresses and encrypted passwords, the Internet Archive’s website javascript was defaced, leading us to bring the site down to access and improve our security. The stored data of the Internet Archive is safe and we are working on resuming services safely. This new reality requires heightened attention to cyber security and we are responding. We apologize for the impact of these library services being unavailable. Deep state? As with all these things, there is no way to know, but the effort to blast away the ability of the Internet to have a verified history fits neatly into the stakeholder model of information distribution that has clearly been prioritized on a global level. The Declaration of the Future of the Internet makes that very clear: the Internet should be 'governed through the multi-stakeholder approach, whereby governments and relevant authorities partner with academics, civil society, the private sector, technical community and others.' All of these stakeholders benefit from the ability to act online without leaving a trace. To be sure, a librarian at Archive.org has written that 'While the Wayback Machine has been in read-only mode, web crawling and archiving have continued. Those materials will be available via the Wayback Machine as services are secured.' When? We do not know. Before the election? In five years? There might be some technical reasons but it might seem that if web crawling is continuing behind the scenes, as the note suggests, that too could be available in read-only mode now. It is not. Disturbingly, this erasure of Internet memory is happening in more than one place. For many years, Google offered a cached version of the link you were seeking just below the live version. They have plenty of server space to enable that now, but no: that service is now completely gone. In fact, the Google cache service officially ended just a week or two before the Archive.org crash, at the end of September 2024. Thus the two available tools for searching cached pages on the Internet disappeared within weeks of each other and within weeks of the November 5th election. Other disturbing trends are also turning Internet search results increasingly into AI-controlled lists of establishment-approved narratives. The web standard used to be for search result rankings to be governed by user behavior, links, citations, and so forth. These were more or less organic metrics, based on an aggregation of data indicating how useful a search result was to Internet users. Put very simply, the more people found a search result useful, the higher it would rank. Google now uses very different metrics to rank search results, including what it considers 'trusted sources' and other opaque, subjective determinations. Furthermore, the most widely used service that once ranked websites based on traffic is now gone. That service was called Alexa. The company that created it was independent. Then one day in 1999, it was bought by Amazon. That seemed encouraging because Amazon was well-heeled. The acquisition seemed to codify the tool that everyone was using as a kind of metric of status on the web. It was common back in the day to take note of an article somewhere on the web and then look it up on Alexa to see its reach. If it was important, one would take notice, but if it was not, no one particularly cared. This is how an entire generation of web technicians functioned. The system worked as well as one could possibly expect. Then, in 2014, years after acquiring the ranking service Alexa, Amazon did a strange thing. It released its home assistant (and surveillance device) with the same name. Suddenly, everyone had them in their homes and would find out anything by saying 'Hey Alexa.' Something seemed strange about Amazon naming its new product after an unrelated business it had acquired years earlier. No doubt there was some confusion caused by the naming overlap. Here’s what happened next. In 2022, Amazon actively took down the web ranking tool. It didn’t sell it. It didn’t raise the prices. It didn’t do anything with it. It suddenly made it go completely dark. No one could figure out why. It was the industry standard, and suddenly it was gone. Not sold, just blasted away. No longer could anyone figure out the traffic-based website rankings of anything without paying very high prices for hard-to-use proprietary products. All of these data points that might seem unrelated when considered individually, are actually part of a long trajectory that has shifted our information landscape into unrecognizable territory. The Covid events of 2020-2023, with massive global censorship and propaganda efforts, greatly accelerated these trends. One wonders if anyone will remember what it was once like. The hacking and hobbling of Archive.org underscores the point: there will be no more memory. As of this writing, fully three weeks of web content have not been archived. What we are missing and what has changed is anyone’s guess. And we have no idea when the service will come back. It is entirely possible that it will not come back, that the only real history to which we can take recourse will be pre-October 8, 2024, the date on which everything changed. The Internet was founded to be free and democratic. It will require herculean efforts at this point to restore that vision, because something else is quickly replacing it.

The Cold War’s Strategic Significance Today: Is China A Sea Power...	China has a pivotal decision to make soon. Will it continue to back the continentalist Putin? Or will Xi Jinping take advantage of Russia's sudden weakness to reclaim China's 'lost territories,' thereby deescalating rising maritime tensions with the Anglo-American-led sea powers? *** It is often overlooked that during the Cold War China was the biggest prize for the West, tying up as it did a quarter of the Soviet armed forces. To defeat the USSR, the U.S. and UK even helped build the modern Chinese Navy. This created new threats to the West, however, including encouraging the emergence of an imperialist China intent on satisfying its historical ambitions to dominate Southeast Asia. Interestingly, on 10 April 1974, Deng Xiaoping foresaw this possible danger when he told a special session of the United Nations General Assembly: 'If one day China should change her colour and turn into a Superpower, if she too should play the tyrant in the world, and everywhere subject others to her bullying, aggression and exploitation, the peoples of the world should identify her as social-imperialist, expose it and work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it.'1 A half-century later, America and its sea power allies are even now facing just such a resurgent China. But China is torn by competing land and sea interests. Among these, its historical tensions with Russia are the most critical. The West took full advantage of these tensions to win the first Cold War. *** Competition over winning China was at the heart of the Cold War. Presidents Truman and Eisenhower used the Nationalist blockade, the Taiwan Patrol Force, the strategic embargo, and a China 'differential'—maximizing transportation costs of Chinese imported goods via the Trans-Siberian Railway—to push Russia and China closer together and thus create a split. It was then President Johnson's strategy to use the Vietnam War to break apart the Sino-Soviet alliance completely, which resulted in war between Russia and China on 2 March 1969. After President Nixon 'flipped' China in 1972 and President Carter and Deng Xiaoping allied more closely by opening full diplomatic relations on 1 January 1979, the U.S. government used high-technology dual-use transfers to help build up a strong China, both economically and militarily. This technology transfer strategy put additional pressure on an already overextended Soviet military. As James Lilly noted in 1981, China tied up '25% of Soviet armed forces.'2 With American technical assistance, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) was able to make enormous strides during the 1980s. But after the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, Beijing had no choice but to transition away from buying Western military equipment to purchasing Soviet-era military technology. In 1992, China bought the Varyag aircraft carrier from the newly independent Ukraine; renamed Liaoning, it became the first of what would become a small fleet of Chinese aircraft carriers. But as the Russian-Ukrainian War has shown, the Soviet-era military technology that China so eagerly purchased is far inferior to those Western high-tech exports. Furthermore, a new era of cheap anti-ship missiles could soon make China's 400-ship surface fleet obsolete. *** China has long been considered to be one of the world's greatest continental powers. The Great Wall is often cited as proof of China's traditional focus on land power. Chinese warfare was also mainly land warfare; Sun Tzu's Art of War discussed how river currents could impact military strategy, but there was no mention of warfare on oceans. Throughout China's long history, previous attempts to become a sea power all failed. During 1405–1435, Ming China ruled as the supreme sea power over Asia. Ming Treasure Fleets reached as far as East Africa. But in 1449, the Ming suffered a disastrous land defeat at the hands of their erstwhile enemies, the Mongols. This forced a reallocation of military resources away from the sea to the land. In a similar manner to the early Ming, China's shift from being a land power to a rising sea power could well be short-lived. In response to Beijing's aggression, many of China's maritime neighbors are increasing cooperation with Japan, India, Australia, and the United States—the so-called 'Quad'—to act as a potent counterweight to Beijing. Plus, with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and possible knock-on effects of Western sanctions against Russia throughout Central Asia, military pressure on China's western borders might soon increase, which could then force Beijing to shift away from the sea and back to the land. *** The world's attention is currently focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but on the horizon it is still China that looms as potentially the most important, as well as perhaps the most dangerous, rising power. But China is facing a monumental decision: should it continue to help Russia or take advantage of Russia's unexpected weakness? If Xi Jinping backs Putin fully, Western sanctions, tariffs, and even a commercial blockade might be in China's near-term future. This could derail Beijing's hope of becoming perhaps the most important member of the twenty-first century global economy. It could also disrupt critical oil and food supplies, both of which China is now dependent on for its sheer survival. Furthermore, Beijing leaders say they want to retake Taiwan, but China's 'territorial integrity' claim is a lie, as Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has now pointed out by daring Xi Jinping to take back Russian lands lost by China during the 19th century. Lai recently stated: 'If it is for the sake of territorial integrity, why doesn't [the PRC] take back the lands occupied by Russia that were signed over in the treaty of Aigun?' Putin desperately needs trade with China to fight the war in Ukraine, so this could be Beijing's last best chance to reclaim China's 'lost territories' in Outer Mongolia, Tannu Tuva, Central Asia, and especially Russia's Far Eastern province in Siberia. Just last year, PRC maps of the Russian far east called Vladivostok and Khabarovsk by their Chinese names, which are 'Haishenwai' (海參崴) and 'Boli' (玻璃). This suggests territorial revanchism is still alive and well among certain groups in China. *** Xi Jinping must decide whether to back Putin fully or to become more deeply integrated into a maritime global order based on multinational organizations upholding international legal norms. Russia and China have never had a sustainable relationship. Their cooperation has always been opportunistic, and therefore temporary. China's economic and strategic interests lie with the West as they did under Deng Xiaoping, not hooking its wagon to a failing Russia as Mao Zedong did, only to end up going to war when the thieve's bargain very predictably unraveled.

The Flying Molotov Cocktails Burning The Enemy In Chasiv Yar – Op...	In the pitch-black night along the Ukrainian front, soldiers from the 23rd Mechanized Brigade's drone unit, Yasni Ochi ('Clear Eyes'), engage in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. Their weapon of choice is a first-person view (FPV) drone, used to hunt Russian soldiers who dare to venture into the open around Chasiv Yar. As dusk settles, intelligence gathered by DJI Mavic drones and reconnaissance drones helps guide the night bombing missions. These aerial scouts have tracked Russian troop movements, pinpointing their attempts to establish new positions and dig protective trenches. With nightfall, the Russians hide in their dugouts, unaware that shortly, Ukrainian drones will drop bombs on their positions. As the soldiers drive to their position on the front, the driver turns off all the vehicle’s lights. Without night vision, he drives in complete darkness. Nothing is visible around us. At some point, it seems like we will crash into something, but it feels as if the driver is navigating solely from memory of the roads. As the van gets closer to the drop-off point, houses in the area are burning, recently shelled by the Russians. In a flurry of movement, they disembark, unload their gear, and dash for cover amidst active enemy fire. The van quickly speeds away, leaving us in the heart of the front.

Source: David Kirichenko Once underground, the soldiers wait for things to quiet down before taking their gear outside, using red lights as they begin setting up their operations. When the moment is right, they emerge, bathed in the soft red glow of their lights, to establish their operational lifeline—a Starlink connection and antenna. Once established, they receive their night’s objectives: a list of targets identified by reconnaissance teams. The soldiers begin equipping the FPV drone with night vision and then attach the first batch of explosives to the drone. One of the soldiers in the dugout takes the drone outside to deploy it. Yevhenii, whose callsign is 'Bird,' dons his immersive goggles and takes control. 'We can only stop their assaults and hold our lines with our drones,' said Yevhenii. With a gentle hum, the drone takes flight, becoming an extension of Yevhenii's will as it races toward Russian positions. The assault is relentless. The drone flies back and forth, attacking with precision. Volodymyr, known by his callsign 'Panda,' rushes to retrieve the drone once it lands, reloading it with fresh projectiles. The team quickly transitions to attaching bottles of flammable liquid to the drone. The drone drops a bottle, creating what looks like a 'flying Molotov cocktail,' forcing Russian soldiers from their hideouts. Within an hour, five enemy soldiers scatter in panic across Chasiv Yar. Quickly, the team rearms the drone with mini-bombs. Yevhenii, displaying remarkable skill, pursues the fleeing Russians. With a slight touch on the controller, he releases a bomb, scoring a direct hit. The dugout erupts in cheers of 'Yes, yes!' as they witness the effectiveness of their operation. One Russian soldier, after being hit, stood up and kept running for a while longer, prompting the Ukrainian soldiers to comment that he was running on adrenaline, like a headless chicken. They continued to fly back and forth, loading more bombs on the FPV drone and hitting Russian positions. Yevhenii from Yasni Ochi flying an FPV drone conducting combat operations. Source: David Kirichenko Between drone flights, I asked Yevhenii to share a few words for the American public. 'We are trying our best. We cherish and value the help that America is giving us. We are still holding on,' he said. As morning breaks, it's time for me to leave. A supply van arrives with a fresh stock of bombs, food, and water for the soldiers. The driver, hyper-alert, speeds around the corner. Before I can fully board, we're already in reverse, racing away from the front. The landscape we speed through is apocalyptic. Smoke rises from houses still smoldering from the night’s artillery barrage. Explosions punctuate the air. The driver, hunched forward, his face nearly touching the steering wheel, navigates a deadly obstacle course—watching for land mines and enemy FPV drones as we drive toward safety. As we speed through the bumpy roads, the driver says, 'driving so fast means we destroy our vehicles quickly.' The drone unit commander Heorhii Volkov of Yasni Ochi praised Yevhenii's abilities the following day to me: 'He is always critical of himself, trying to learn from his mistakes and improve with each mission. He is eager to grow as a pilot.' The demands of war push these soldiers to their limits. Due to personnel shortages, they often remain in position for days without relief. One soldier, known as 'Joker,' holds the unit record: eight consecutive days of FPV drone combat, snatching brief moments of sleep between missions. Tragically, I was recently informed that Joker was killed in action. He was only 20 years old. His commander, Heorhii Volkov commented that in the last 8 months of his work, Joker was responsible for killing or injuring more than 200 Russian soldiers. For now, Ukraine holds the line in Chasiv Yar largely due to the work of drone units like Yasni Ochi, whose efforts prevent relentless Russian assaults from breaking through. Yet, relying solely on the bravery and ingenuity of its soldiers can sustain the defense only for so long without the raw firepower and weaponry that Ukraine needs from the West. Back at base, Serhii—known by his callsign 'Fly' and the leader of the nighttime drone bombing operations—shared his perspective on the uphill battle they face: 'The Russians have significantly more artillery and effective aviation,' he explained, frustration clear in his voice. 'Chasiv Yar has many buildings, and the Russians charge in waves every day. They come, gather their men, and dig deep into the basements. Slowly, they take more and more ground,' Serhii emphasized. Serhii firmly believes that with enough shells and rockets, Ukraine could change the course of the war. 'The West only gives us enough supplies and weapons to remain on the defensive,' he said, pointing out that their current resources allow them to hold the line but not to push forward. Rising from his chair, as if to underscore his point, Serhii made his message clear: 'Europe and the U.S. must give us what we need to win. We're protecting them from Russia too.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9scxsfXy0ZSQNY	2024-10-30T18:18:15-07:00	
What ‘Capitalism’ Really Means – OpEd	By Owen Ashworth Grace Blakeley is a self-described socialist economist and author in the UK, appearing on shows like Politics Live, JOE Politics, and Novara Media. Grace throws down the proverbial gauntlet to self-described capitalists who often find themselves falling over their own logic. This should not be surprising since the 'capitalists' that she often debates usually have a conservative worldview that is littered with its own inconsistencies, so socialists tend to have a field day. It’s worth noting to an American audience that 'conservative' in the UK is wildly different to conservative in the US; UK conservatives tend to be even more statist than US conservatives so when a socialist argues with them, you can visibly witness conservatives realize that they are being inconsistent and flail. Unless Austrian economics is embraced by more conservatives, they risk the very real growth of a radically socialist movement as individuals like Grace gain momentum. Grace comments in a recent video: Capitalism is not, as we’re often led to believe, a free-market system. We have this view of capitalism that is nice, decentralized system where markets decide who gets what… Capitalism means more markets… Capitalism is actually a highly centralized system that rests not just on markets but also on centralized planning—an authoritarian, hierarchical, oligarchic system where a few people at the very top of society decide who gets what. This definition is a thoroughly incoherent way of defining capitalism. Grace believes that the system we have right now is actual capitalism but parts of her definition could easily be applied to other systems that are resolutely different. Nazi Germany was extremely oligarchic and authoritarian with a few people at the top deciding for the rest of their society how they conduct their lives. The Soviet Union was a highly centralized system that rested on central planning accompanied by a veneer of markets as they attempted to use Western prices in their own planning system. The fact that you can use her definition to describe multiple different countries with very different shades of centralized planning should be a red flag indicating the dubious nature of the definition. There must be a characteristic of capitalism that makes it unique. Ludwig von Mises says this about the term 'capitalism' in Human Action: The system of free enterprise has been dubbed capitalism in order to deprecate and to smear it. However, this term can be considered very pertinent. It refers to the most characteristic feature of the system, its main eminence, viz. the role the notion of capital plays in its conduct. (emphasis added) Capitalism is an appropriate name because it gives the reader a very big hint as to how it is unique. It is characterized by the private ownership of capital and private ownership, coming from Lockean homesteading principles, not from state coercion and force. Accompany that with a monetary unit that is valued because others subjectively value it (like gold), not because the state backs it, then you have the formula for economic calculation. Economic calculation involves the entrepreneur arranging resources towards the production of goods that either will be used in production of consumer goods or consumer goods themselves (i.e., the arrangement of scarce resources to socially-valuable ends). Rothbard writes in Man, Economy and State: With the nature-given elements limited by his environment, and his labor restricted both by its available supply and its disutility, there is only one way by which man can increase his production of consumers’ goods per unit of time—by increasing the quantity of capital goods. Individuals realized—within this environment that was fostered in the late 1700s—that by accumulating capital, they could produce vastly more quantities of food and other goods than ever before which, in turn, released them to pursue other ends like an adventure into the innovation of transportation and manufacturing that further reduced the amount of time people had to spend in agriculture. This development of innovation and the realization that one need not spend all your time working on food and shelter can be found at the feet of capital accumulation and that is what defines capitalism. This is the uniqueness of capitalism. Grace may quibble that these features of capitalism exist in almost every nation around the world, which is true to varying extents, but that does not equal a factual statement that it is a capitalist system. There is one massive elephant in the room—the state. The state necessarily disrupts this delicate process of capital accumulation, the division of labor, and the workings of a common medium of exchange. This disruption prevents the accumulation of wealth by individuals who have never before had the opportunity to acquire such wealth, thus creating many of the social ills and centralization that Grace correctly identifies. Using one of Grace’s examples may be illustrative—Boeing. Grace uses Boeing as a shining example of the worst aspects of capitalism. She says, 'They were on a drive to increase profits, minimize their costs, making big planes was going to be more profitable… pushed it through without following the safety protocols.' Generally, individuals or firms want to make the most profit they can as they think that the service or good they provide is valuable to other people subjectively, otherwise they would not sell it, so this is not abnormal in a capitalist system, but here’s where Grace correctly highlights the problem: 'Boeing was being regulated by a unit of the FAA that sat inside Boeing.' The difference between a capitalist system in the way described by Mises and Rothbard and the real situation for this example is that there was zero respect for the ultimate property right—life. Capitalism is built upon private property rights and they stem from the individual. No one owns anyone else and it is objective that the individual owns himself. In the case of Boeing, the state intervened, completely disregarded property rights, and made sure that Boeing avoided any criminal charges directly from the families of the victims. It is absurd to claim that Boeing could only attempt to avoid responsibility in a capitalist society built on private property. In a truly capitalistic system, there would be harsh consequences for the decision to disregard consumer safety, the state prevented these consequences. 'These catastrophes were a joint venture between the US government and this company, Boeing.' I agree with Grace, but this is statism, cronyism, or interventionism, not capitalism. The latter respects everyone’s private property rights, the former desecrates them. Grace does admit that this came from a toxic fusion of big government and a private company so we can lay the blame at big government just as much as Boeing. However, her conclusion is that we cannot trust those at the top (i.e., those at the top of the hierarchy in companies) to be held accountable by the market or the government. She proposes a supposed third way like that of the Lucas plan for Lucas Aerospace in 1976. This plan involved the management of the company asking workers for suggestions on what they should do to prevent layoffs like switching production to more socially-beneficial products that perhaps would have been more profitable, thus preventing layoffs and even growing the company. This was rejected by management and the government. Would it have provided more value for people? There is no way of knowing; it was never implemented. However, one can admit that the government has been intervening so much in the economy since the end of World War II, diverting resources away from potentially socially-beneficial ends, did harm workers. The government created a situation where it would eventually start running out of funds since it fostered an environment that would collapse the economy, while building up huge companies by subsidizing them, and creating harm to workers when the house of cards caved in. This is an example of statism, not capitalism. A third way is not needed when government has wrecked a route that already exists. Grace’s critique of capitalism is based on a definition that is incoherent. The rot sets in from there as the rest of the logic she walks through is based on wobbly foundations. There seems to be a false dichotomy existing within Grace’s thinking where the state and private interests collude to rig the political system, resulting in a lack of responsibility for the actions that these crony capitalists consciously take. This would mean we cannot trust the state, but more importantly, that we cannot trust the market, to provide this accountability. The elephant in the room here is the state itself. Grace decries centralization, which is a product of the state, but blames capitalism. She also argues that the state fails to hold capitalists accountable, but seems to prefer more statism as opposed to a free market. The existence of the state itself invites those parts of human nature that manifest corruption, immorality, and profligacy. Smashing the leviathan state takes away much of the potential for corrupt laws and regulations to be hoisted upon us. Grace’s diagnosis of social ills is not too objectionable, but her medicine leaves a lot to be desired.

How Effective Is The Latest China-India Border Patrol Agreement? ...	By Zhou Chao Indian media has recently reported that the Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that China and India have reached an agreement on issues concerning border areas. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on October 21 that Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other, reaching the agreement 'on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020'. On the same day, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also stated in an interview with New Delhi Television that the situation along the China-India border has returned to its 2020 status and that both sides have completed the disengagement. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has also confirmed at a regular press conference that the two countries have reached a solution regarding border issues and that China will work with India to implement the agreement. In response, some commentaries in China pointed out that the achievement of this agreement signifies a major improvement in China-India relations. Relevant analyses suggest that India has a high economic dependence on China, and since 2020, a series of measures targeting Chinese companies and capital have harmed India’s own economic interests. Additionally, India faces various disputes and conflicts with the West on issues such as human rights, and it needs to improve its relationship with China and strengthen cooperation to cope with Western pressure. While these analyses have their merits, their projection of the effectiveness of the latest China-India border patrol agreement may be overly optimistic, as the actual impact of it is likely to be relatively limited. First of all, from India's perspective, its basic positioning as a regional hegemon means that it is unlikely to see substantial easing in its relationship with China. In previous analyses, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan noted that the future world will exhibit a situation of coexisting regional hegemons, with India being the undisputed dominant power in the South Asian subcontinent. In terms of India’s strategic understanding and positioning, it seeks to maintain decisive authority over South Asian affairs (primarily involving India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.), comprehensively strengthen its influence over Southeast Asian matters (including Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam), gradually expand its voice in Central Asian affairs, and, on this basis, enhance its control over global issues. This has been India's consistent strategic positioning and aspiration. However, in key interest regions such as the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, China maintains considerable influence. Furthermore, in the Indian Ocean region, after years of sustained efforts, China has significantly expanded its influence in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, which has made India feel increasingly uncomfortable. To consolidate and strengthen its position as a regional hegemon, India feels that it must effectively diminish or even expel China's actual influence in order to feel truly secure. This necessity also determines that, in the long term (10-15 years), Indian nationalism will primarily target China rather than other countries. The border issue is one of the focal points of the structural conflict in China-India relations, but not the entirety of it. Thus, a reduction in border tensions may not necessarily lead to sustained improvement in bilateral relations. Additionally, in recent years, India has increasingly intervened in territorial and maritime sovereignty disputes surrounding China to strengthen its position in the confrontation with it. This has been achieved through military cooperation, equipment transfers, and other means, as well as through escalating its involvement in Taiwan-related matters. Recently, India also allowed the Taiwanese authorities to establish a third representative office in India. Based on India's understanding of its strategic position and its persistent strategic aspirations, these actions that challenge China's core national interests are unlikely to see substantial changes in the future. This further complicates the possibility of a meaningful easing in China-India relations. Secondly, strengthening cooperation with the West will be a long-term focus of India's foreign relations. In the lead-up to and following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western countries have made significant investments to draw India into their efforts against China and Russia, and the conflict has further accelerated this process. Through exchanges between governments and businesses, the West has continuously enhanced cooperation with India in various areas, including technology transfer, scientific collaboration, and financial support, with the U.S. government even greenlighting the transfer of crucial aircraft engine technology. The U.S. has also led a group of Western countries in gradually strengthening cooperation with India in key mineral sectors. As India deepens its collaboration with the West, even in military areas where India has long relied on Russia, U.S. and French military equipment is beginning to gradually replace Russian-made equipment in the Indian armed forces. The influx of Western technology, businesses, and capital has provided tangible benefits to India, evident in several surges in the Indian stock market. While U.S. and Canadian politicians do exert pressure on India regarding human rights, the West generally downplays significant incidents, such as the Sikh assassination incidents. This situation is underpinned by India's insistence on a confrontational stance against China, which aligns with its strategic positioning and needs. As India continues to strengthen its cooperation with the West, this dynamic makes substantial improvement in India-China relations unlikely. Thirdly, India's economic and trade dependence on China should not be overstated. In recent years, Western economic and trade cooperation with India has become increasingly prominent. According to a report from the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) published in August, while China remains India's largest trading partner for the 2023-2024 fiscal year, the United States has surpassed China as India’s top trading partner from January to June 2024, with total trade reaching USD 62.5 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.3%. Furthermore to the significant and growing trade deficit with China, India continues to express strong criticism of its economic and trade relations with China. India's economic ties with China are not solely advantageous for Chinese companies. As the degree of competition in China’s domestic market deepens and profit growth slows, particularly amid weakening economic and consumption trends in China, the Indian market with its younger demographic and increasing consumption capacity, has become increasingly attractive to Chinese firms. Notably, despite facing multiple challenges since 2020, companies like Xiaomi have remained committed to the Indian market. While Indian businesses rely on China for raw materials, parts, and certain technologies, Chinese companies also recognize the value and necessity of the Indian market. Final analysis conclusion: The recent agreement and implementation of the China-India border patrol protocol will indeed help to ease tensions along the border and improve bilateral relations. However, based on the various reasons mentioned earlier, the extent of this improvement is limited, and its duration may not be long-lasting. For Chinese companies and capital, there may be a window of opportunity in the Indian market. However, for trade and economic projects that require long-term commitment and significant investment, the Chinese side will still need to remain cautious.

Virtuous, Smug And Venal: British Electoral Interference In The U...	The British cannot help themselves. They are a meddling island people who conquered huge swathes of the earth in a fictional fit of absentmindedness and remain haughty for having done so. They have fought more countries they can name, engaged in more wars they care to remember. They have overthrown elected rulers and sabotaged incipient democracies. In the twilight of empire, Britain sought, with heavy hearted reluctance, to become wise Greek advisors to their clumsy Roman replacement: the US Imperium. US politics, to that end, remain a matter of enormous importance to the UK. Interfering in US elections is a habit that dies hardest of all. In 1940, with the relentless march of Nazi Germany’s war machine across Europe, British intelligence officers based in New York and Washington had one primary objective: to aid the election of politicians favouring US intervention on the side of Britain. As Steven Usdin noted in 2017, they also had two other attached goals: 'defeat those who advocated neutrality, and silence or destroy the reputations of American isolationists they deemed a menace to British security.' Much of this is also covered in Thomas E. Mahl’s 1998 study Desperate Deception: British Covert Operations in the United States, 1939-44, which was initially scoffed at for giving much credence to Britain’s role in creating the office of Coordinator of Information, an entity that became the forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services, itself the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency. Mahl was, it was revealed in 1999, on to something. In a dull yet revealing study written at the end of World War II documenting the activities of the British Security Coordination office, an outfit established by Canadian spymaster Sir William S. Stephenson with the approval of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, activities of interference are described on a scale to make any modern Russian operative sigh with longing envy. Those roped into the endeavour were a rather colourful lot: the classicist Gilbert Highet, future novelist of dark children’s novels extraordinaire Roald Dahl, and editor of the trade journal Western Hemisphere Weekly Bulletin, Tom Hill. During Stephenson’s tenure, the office used subversion, sabotage, disinformation and blackmail with relish to influence political outcomes and malign the America Firsters. (How marvellous contemporary.) It cultivated relations with such figures as the 1940 Republican nominee for president, Wendell Willkie. It also offered gobbets of slanted information to media outlets, often produced verbatim, by suborned pro-interventionist hacks. In October 1941, BSC provided FDR a map purporting to detail a plan by Nazi Germany to seize South America, a document the president gratefully waved at a news conference. (The study claims its authenticity, though doubts remain.) The Democrats are currently receiving the moral and physical aid of volunteers from the British Labour Party, who are throwing in hours and tears for a Kamala Harris victory in various battleground states. Their presence was revealed in a now deleted social media post from Labour’s head of operations, Sofia Patel, noting that somewhere in the order of 100 current and former party staff were heading to the US prior to polling day to campaign in North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. On the other side of the political aisle, Nigel Farage, now Reform UK leader and member for Clacton-on-Sea, has spent much time openly campaigning for Donald Trump. Hardly surprising that he should complain about UK Labour doing what he has been doing habitually since 2016. Walking political disaster and former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss, historically the shortest occupant in that office, also put in an appearance at the 2024 Republican National Convention to offer what limited support she could. Trump’s campaign team has taken umbrage at the efforts of Labour Party staffers, enough to file a complaint with the US Federal Election Commission (FEC). This is not small beer: any opportunity to allege an unfavourable distortion in votes will be pounced upon. In an October 21 letter to the FEC’s acting general counsel, Lisa J. Stevenson, Trump’s attorney sought 'an immediate investigation into blatant foreign interference in the 2024 Presidential Election'. This took 'the form of apparent illegal foreign national contributions made by the Labour Party of the United Kingdom and accepted by Harris for President, the principal campaign committee of Vice President Kamala Harris.' The claim makes mention of another effort in the 2016 elections, when the Australian Labor Party furnished the Bernie 2016 campaign representing Senator Bernie Sanders with 'delegates to be placed with the campaign'. The ALP covered flights and provided participants with a daily stipend. The FEC subsequently found this to be a provision of campaign services to the Sanders campaign, and determined that it, and the ALP, had violated the foreign national prohibitions. Each received civil penalties of $14,500. Patel’s announcement, the claim goes on to argue, seems to emulate the overly enthusiastic ALP model. As head of operations, 'her LinkedIn posts indicate that she is speaking as a representative of the party.' Her posts supported 'a reasonable inference that the Labour Party will finance at least travel and facilitate room and board.' As regulations stand, FEC rules permit the participation of foreign nationals in campaign activities as long as they remain uncompensated volunteers. If one accepts the narrow reading of the laws according to the US District Court for the District of Columbia in Bluman v FEC, contributions must be of a non-financial nature. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that party staff have travelled to the US to campaign for Harris 'in their own spare time', staying with other volunteers in the process. By no means is it clear that this did not involve a financial contribution. Previous public efforts to sway election results in the US by British well-wishers hoping to test the waters have not ended well. In 2004, The Guardian newspaper launched Operation Clark County, a smug and foolish effort to dissuade undecided voters in the swing state of Ohio from voting for the Republican incumbent, George W. Bush. The response was one of unmitigated, volcanic fury. A letter from Wading River, NY captured the mood: 'I don’t give a rat’s ass if our election is going to have an effect on your worthless little life. If you want to have a meaningful election in your crappy little island full of shitty food and yellow teeth, then maybe you should try not to sell your sovereignty out to Brussels and Berlin, dipshit.' The letter is coarsening in its finality. 'Oh yeah – and brush your goddamned teeth, you filthy animals.' Starmer, beware.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9scx-Jwg1rdqYt	2024-10-30T18:08:55-07:00	
Will Tuesday’s Vote Counts Be Another Sham Biden-Harris Statistic...	If Kamala Harris wins the presidential election on Tuesday, Americans will be told that the final vote count is a sacred number that was practically handed down from Mt. Sinai engraved on a stone tablet. Any American who casts doubt on Harris’s victory will be vilified like one of those January 6, 2021 protestors sent to prison for 'parading without a permit' in the US Capitol. Actually, anyone who doubted the 2020 election results was being prominently denounced as 'traitors' even before the Capitol Clash. But is there any reason to expect the final vote count in next week’s presidential election to be more honest than any other number that the Biden-Harris administration jiggered in the last four years? Biden, Harris, and their media allies endlessly assured Americans that the national crime rate had fallen sharply since Biden took office. That statistical scam was produced by the equivalent of disregarding all the votes in California and New York. FBI crime data simply excluded many of the nation’s largest cities until a revision earlier this month revealed that violent crime had risen nationwide. Deceitful national crime data helped cover-up the disastrous impact of open border policies. The Biden-Harris administration did backflips to avoid disclosing the true size of the surge of illegal immigrants from early 2021 onwards. Kamala Harris did zombie-like face plants in recent interviews when elbowed for honest answers. In the same way that another surge of unverified mail-in ballots may determine the 2024 election, Biden manipulated the number of illegal aliens by using his presidential parole power to entitle more than a million people from Haiti, Venezuela, Cubans, and other countries to legally enter and stay in America on his own decree. The Biden administration even provided a vast secretive program to fly favored foreign nationals into select airports late at night where their arrival would occur under the radar. Some states will officially count mail-in ballots that arrive well after Election Day even if the envelopes have no postmark. This is the same 'late doesn’t matter' standard that Biden used to vindicate the $42 billion provided by his 2021 infrastructure law to boost broadband access in rural America—which Uncle Joe said was 'not unlike what Roosevelt did with electricity.' Unlike the Tennessee Valley Authority, Biden’s broadband program has nothing to show since it delivered faster internet access to almost no one. The same default occurred with the Inflation Reduction Act’s alleged showpiece achievement—42,000 new charging stations around the nation for electric vehicles. But that program produced more presidential applause lines than EV refills. As of March, $7.5 billion in federal spending had only produced seven new charging stations nationwide. How many votes will Harris lose on Tuesday because Americans remain outraged at the inflation that has slashed the dollar’s value by more than 20 percent since Biden took office? There would be far more popular fury if the feds had not deceived Americans about the full financial damage that Washington inflicted. The official inflation statistic doesn’t count soaring mortgage and housing costs—which is akin to excluding any state south of the Mason-Dixon Line from the national vote tally. Larry Summers, Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary, said that if the feds today used the same inflation gauges used in the 1970s, Biden’s peak inflation would have been 18 percent, twice as high as the reported number. Tens of millions of voters will not be obliged to show any identification before voting in this election: they are presumed trustworthy regardless of zero verification. But this is the same standard that the Biden-Harris administration uses for not disclosing its most controversial policies to American citizens. People will vote next week without knowing the facts behind whistleblower allegations on Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz’s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, to Secret Service failures to prevent Trump assassination attempts, and the brazen details of the Censorship Industrial Complex. In Washington, politicians feel entitled to applause for any grandiose promise—regardless of their failure to deliver. Similarly, politicians and election officials promising that the presidential vote count will be accurate and reflect 'the will of the people' is far more important than tabulating the actual ballots. Will the unmanned ballot boxes in big cities be stuffed with bogus ballots the same way a politician jams endless balderdash into his campaign speeches? As pundit Stephen Kruiser quipped, 'the clothing donation boxes that were all over my old neighborhood in Los Angeles were probably more secure than the ballot drop boxes.' Of course, if Trump wins, then all the forces of decency must instantly shift to the other side of the barricades. Any electoral victory by Trump will be illegitimate because of politically incorrect comments made by speakers at Trump campaign rallies. As in 2017, if Trump wins, every 'true patriot'—or at least every true progressive—will be honor-bound to join The Resistance™.

Singapore Stuck Between A Shipping Hub And A Hard Place – Analysi...	By Jean-Paul Rodrigue Singapore’s prominence in global maritime shipping is no accident. Located at the entrance to the Strait of Malacca, Singapore’s geographical advantages were just as critical during the days of the British Empire as they are now — allowing it to be a significant trade platform along major shipping routes. For over half a century, Singapore has remained economically open and politically stable, despite changing economic and geopolitical conditions. This stability enabled the growth of substantial port activity, with over 95 per cent of traffic involving cargo transiting through, rather than being destined for, Singapore. Over decades, Singapore has become Southeast Asia’s dominant transshipment hub — a small yet crucial link in global maritime networks. The growth in container port traffic clearly reflects this trend. In 1990, Singapore handled 5.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units, a volume that increased to 17 million in 2000, 28.4 million in 2010 and 39 million in 2023, making it the second busiest port in the world. During this period, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) became the world’s largest container terminal operator. Starting its international expansion in 1996, PSA now operates 60 terminals in 2024. From 2018 to 2022, container traffic barely changed, suggesting that Singapore may have reached its potential as a hub. During this period, transshipment activities handled by the Port of Singapore faced growing competition from nearby hubs like Tanjung Pelepas in Johor, Malaysia, which has effectively competed and gained a share of the business. Transshipment is a footloose activity driven by the decisions of carriers and terminal operators. While operating as a terminal operator offers competitive advantages, Singapore remains vulnerable to the vagaries of global economic and political events as it generates limited local traffic. During the financial crisis of 2008–2009, Singapore experienced an annual decline of 13.5 per cent in container traffic as global demand slowed due to financial stress, largely caused by asset inflation in North American real estate. Singapore faced further challenges in 2015 and 2016 as East Asia became a more mature hub for offshoring and more direct shipping services emerged. This led to an 8.7 per cent decline in transshipment traffic between 2014 and 2015, with limited recovery in 2016. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in a decline in activity in Singapore, but the surge in traffic in 2021 and 2022 did not significantly impact activity in the city-state. The focus has now shifted to direct services, prioritising movement of full containers from East Asia to Europe and North America while returning empty containers back to East Asia as soon as possible. The Red Sea crisis in 2023 marked a shift in container transshipment for Singapore. As ships got hijacked or damaged along the Red Sea, many shipping lines decided to bypass the area, choosing the Cape Route around Africa instead. While the Suez Route between Shanghai and Western Europe takes about 27 sailing days, the Cape Route requires about 10 additional sailing days. The additional containership capacity ordered in 2021 and 2022 was utilised to offset the longer travel times caused by the detour, rather than for expanding operations. Though the crisis was far from Singapore, its consequences are coming closer to home. The Cape deviation undermined transshipment activities in major hubs such as Dubai, Port Said and Gioia Tauro, which suddenly found themselves in a more peripheral location. The outcome was a partial shift in transshipment activities downstream to hubs such as Tanger Med and Algeciras — at the entrance of the Mediterranean — and upstream to hubs such as Singapore. For the latter, traffic surged 6.1 per cent between January and July 2024 compared to the previous year, adding 1.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units. In this new but temporary context, Singapore became one of the last Asian transshipment hubs with low deviation on the Cape-expanded East Asia–Europe route. This geopolitically derived situation conveys a temporary advantage for Singapore, increasing its centrality and container traffic. But this short-term benefit involves a long-term economic challenge. From a maritime supply chain perspective, East Asia is now significantly further away from Europe. A similar event happened between 1967 and 1975 when the Suez Canal was closed after the onset of the Six-Day War. At that time, supply chains were less integrated and China played a marginal role in global trade. Currently, longer lead times and geopolitical instability are prompting large retailers and manufacturers to reassess their sourcing and procurement strategies. The trend toward ‘friendshoring’ could also reduce trade and transshipment activity for Singapore. There remains significant inertia, particularly concerning European supply chains involving Chinese trade. China has strong incentives to maintain its export-oriented manufacturing sector and related trade routes, which benefits Singapore. Although the current port congestion may be temporary, Singapore’s prospects as a transshipment hub remain solid — provided the Red Sea crisis is resolved in a way that secures the long-term stability of this shipping lane. But if instability persists, a global shift may unfold, one where East and Southeast Asia are further away from major European and Mediterranean markets. Singapore’s geographical advantages remain significant and the recent development of its Tuas mega container port facility is a strong indication of the city-state’s goal of capturing growth and retaining its role as a major transshipment hub.

Kremlin Backs Revival Of Tsarist-Era Anti-Semitic Union Of The Ru...	In October, two developments on the extreme right of the Russian political spectrum occurred that cast a dark shadow on the country’s future. In the first, the Russian Community, an extreme right-wing Russian ethno-nationalist group (see EDM, October 15) has assumed a leading role in a pogrom against Roma people, sometimes known as gypsies, that began in the city of Chelyabinsk in advance of National Unity Day on November 4. The Russian Community has intimidated local officials, who appear to be afraid of taking concerted action against the perpetrators (Kavkaz, October 27). Secondly, the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church (MP ROC) have made the fateful decision to support the revival of the Union of the Russian People, a radical monarchist party notorious for organizing the Black Hundreds and their anti-Semitic pogroms in the last years of the Russian Empire (Tsargrad, October 24). By once again lending credibility to Russian nationalist extremism in this way, the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate have made it more likely that Russians will join such groups, convinced that they have are doing precisely what the Putin regime wants. To the extent that this happens—and there is already evidence that this is occurring—said Russian groups are likely to launch ever more violent attacks on minorities. In the absence of state protection, members of these victimized groups are likely to take measures in self-defense, with the collective result being a further destabilization of the situation in Russia (Window on Eurasia, September 27; EDM, October 3; Kavkaz, October 9). At a congress on October 24, more than 1,000 activists, Orthodox churchmen, and prominent government officials met in Moscow’s prominent Christ the Savior Cathedral to announce the 'restoration' of the Union of the Russian People (Tsargrad, October24,26;rusk.ru, October 25). Among the most distinguished speakers were Duma deputy head Pyotr Tolstoy, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova, Duma deputy Aleksandr Borodai, and prominent actor (and former ROC MP priest) Ivan Okhlobystin. Their participation underscores the extent to which this revived party enjoys support of both the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate, as none of these individuals would have taken part if that were not the case. Konstantin Malofeyev delivered the keynote address. He has frequently been referred to as the 'Orthodox oligarch' for his support of Russian Orthodox and nationalist causes and is considered to be the main force behind the Union of the Russian People. Malofeyev told the congress that, Our ideals and values are simple: Russia is a great Orthodox state-civilization. The Russian people [are] the state-forming [people; this phrase is used to denote ethnic Russians as the core of any Russian state] and on its well-being depends the well-being of all the citizens of our country. The foundation of the people is a strong, traditional, multi-child family, the support of which is the most important obligation of the state (Telegram/@kvmalofeev, October 24). Malofeyev further suggested that 'the overwhelming majority of Russian people' support these ideas. 'We are the voice of the Russian Orthodox majority. The revived Union of the Russian People. All who are not indifferent to the future of Russia should join the Society and its Russian Militia' (for more on these 'self-defense squads,' which also partook in the October 24 session, see Telegram/@russian_druzhina, October 29). Both Malofeyev and the most prominent speakers from the Russian government devoted most of their attention to combatting the West and defeating Ukraine. Other speakers, including the governors of Kurgan and Kaluga oblasts, Vadim Shumkov and Vladislav Shapsha, respectively, focused on domestic affairs, specifically the handling of minorities—the area in which the Union of the Russian People is most likely to impact (Stoletie, October 28). Shumkov and Shapsha called for concerted efforts to Russify immigrants and minorities and the expel immigrants that fail to do so. These calls leave little room for the rights, linguistic or otherwise, nominally enjoyed by the quarter of the Russian Federation’s population that is not ethnically Russian. Unsurprisingly, many non-Russians living in the Federation view such attitudes as a threat to their existence and are being radicalized as a result. This trend has intensified since Putin began his expanded invasion of Ukraine, though it reached new heights after the terrorist attack on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall last April (see Svoboda, September 6; Idel Realii, September 8; Telegram/@Free Nations League, September 6; Indigenous Russia, September 9 [1], [2]). More thoughtful Russians, such as Moscow commentator Viktor Frolinsky, are also alarmed by what the revival of the Union of the Russian People means. Commenting on the October 24 meeting, Frolinsky argued that Malofeyev’s Union 'is designed to inherit all the worst in the Black Hundred movement of pre-revolutionary Russia: Ideological obscurantism, aggression and servility to those in power' (v Krizis, October 25). Frolinsky points out that the word 'Tsargrad' that the revived Union of Russian People has chosen to attach to its name is indicative of dangers ahead. According to Frolinsky, Tsargrad 'refers to imperial dreams of [Russian conquest of] Constantinople and the chauvinistic organization' of Aleksandr Dubrovin, an anti-Semite who organized pogroms and led the predecessor of today’s Union of the Russian People. Before he was executed by the Soviets, Dubrovin identified himself as 'a monarchist-communist,' the kind of fusion of principles favored by the Putin regime. People like Malofeyev and his ilk, Frolinsky says, can—and do—claim they are following in these footsteps. Many in Western governments and elsewhere assume that individuals like Malofeyev are on the margins of the Russian state, rather than the part of a dangerous trend that must be opposed. Conversely, now that senior Russian officials and churchmen have come out in favor of the explicit revival of a Black Hundreds organization—amid an ongoing pogrom against the Roma in Chelyabinsk—there should be no illusions about the direction of the Union of the Russian People and its ideological ilk, such as the Russian Community. German pastorMartin Niemöller famously warned that the Nazis attacked society piecemeal, allowing many to blind themselves to oppression that did not directly affect them, until 'there was no one left' to speak in their defense. Moscow’s endorsement of extreme right-wing groups’ rising power in Russia bodes ill for the Russian Federation’s minorities as the long war drags on.

Hezbollah’s Military Tactics In The Post-Nasrallah Era – Analysis	By Dr. Mohamed ELDoh The Iran-led 'Axis of Resistance,' composed of a coalition of armed and political groups across Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, has been striving to play a significant role over the past year amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The military operations, tactics, and strategies ofHezbollah, a key player in this axis, are critical in shaping the future of the conflict in Lebanon and beyond. Such strategies are currently dominated by one overriding imperative: the rapid restoration of command, control, and combat capabilities in Lebanon and Syria, given that Israel has successively eliminated key figures within Hezbollah over the past few weeks,notably the group’s longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. Beyond the restoration of its core command structures, Hezbollah will be seeking to realize the following objectives over the short-term: Deterring Israel from expanding its ground operations in Lebanon. Israel has shown a relentless will to escalate and expand its military operations, particularly in southern Lebanon and Syria, a region whereHezbollahhas maintained a significant influence for decades. Despite the group’s recent setbacks, Hezbollah still views it as imperative to prevent Israel from launching a large-scale ground invasion in southern Lebanon. Such an operation would significantly shift the long-termgeopoliticsof the region and weaken Hezbollah’s strategic foothold. It would also afford Israel a chance to expand operations beyond Lebanon and target Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq, and possibly even Iran itself. As a result, one of the primary military objectives of Hezbollah and the wider Axis is to establish deterrence and demonstrate that any Israeli attempt to expand its operations will still be met with resistance. Preparing for a prolonged conflict with Israel. Beyond immediate deterrence, it can be assumed that Hezbollah and other parts of the Axis of Resistance are actively preparing for a wider and more prolonged conflict with Israel. This preparation extends beyond short-term armed confrontations, incorporating a long-term strategy that acknowledges the possibility of prolonged hostilities.Hezbollah, with its decades-long experience fighting Israeli forces, understands the importance of preparing for a drawn-out confrontation, one that could involve urban warfare, asymmetric combat, leveraging missile capabilities, and protracted skirmishes along the border. The capacity for endurance in such a type of conflict is seen as crucial, and Hezbollah’s focus on maintaining combat readiness and a capacity for rapid flexibility in deployment remain key pillars of this strategic preparation. Forcing the United States to withdraw from Syria. Another strategic objective is to pressure the United States to fully withdraw its forces from Syria—a goal shared by Russia and Iran, as well as extremist groups like Islamic State. In this respect, the US militarypresencein Syria, particularly in strategic geographical locations, remains a source of contention for anti-US regional players. Hezbollah’s Current Combat Operations Following the elimination of most of Hezbollah’s leadership and senior commanders from the elite RadwanForceduring recent strikes in Beirut, Hezbollah has escalated its operations, likely in an attempt to prove that it still has the capacity to do so. In response to mounting Israeli military operations in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has launched a series of precisionattacksusing anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), with one such attacktargetingIsraeli air defense systems in Ramot Naftali in northern Israel. The attacks indicate an enduring capacity on the part of Hezbollah to strike with precision from significant distances, an important aspect of the group’s asymmetric warfare capabilities. Furthermore, it demonstrates that Hezbollah’s missile capabilities can still at times circumvent Israel’s Iron Dome defenses. In addition to ATGM attacks, Hezbollah has also utilizeddrone warfareto target Israeli positions. Such has beenevidentin the combined missile and drone attacks on Israeli military installations in Haifa. The Haifa attacks underscore Hezbollah’s growing dependence on drones in their overall combat strategy, a tactic also employed by the Houthis in Yemen in most of their maritime attacks.As in other battlefields around the world, drones remain a cost-effective way to perform precision strikes from a distance. Hezbollah maintains a capacity for rocket strikes as well, recently launching a barrage of rockets against Israeli forces positioned nearYarounand on the outskirts of Blida. Such attacks aim not only to inflict damage on Israeli forces, but also prevent them from gaining control of key areas in southern Lebanon, thereby halting Israel’s military progress in southern Lebanon. Fighting around Blida is particularlysignificant, as Israel has yet to succeed in cutting the town’s connection to nearby villages, suggesting an ability on the part of Hezbollah to maintain pressure on these positions. Hezbollah’s rocket attacks offer several tactical and ideological benefits. Firstly, they disrupt Israeli ground operations and force the IDF to remain in a defensive posture. Secondly, they showcase Hezbollah’s ongoing capacity to maintain high-intensity attacks, thereby reinforcing the message that any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon will encounter resolute resistance despite the recent removal of the group’s top leadership. Drone warfareand rocket attacks reflect a core component of Hezbollah’s military strategy: an emphasis on indirect and remote combat. Rather than engaging Israeli forces in direct confrontations, Hezbollah focuses on long-range attacks that minimize the exposure of its fighters to enemy fire. In doing so,Hezbollahis able to inflict significant damage on Israeli forces while maintaining a low casualty rate among its own fighters on the ground. The strategy evolved from Hezbollah’s experience in previous conflicts, where direct engagements with a technologically superior Israeli military resulted in heavy losses. Looking ahead, the group’s wider strategy will be to prolong the conflict and maximize Israeli losses. Despite Israel’s advanced military capabilities, Hezbollah is fully aware that Israeli forces, if left unchecked, will attempt to push deeper into Lebanon, thus becoming vulnerable to a war of attrition that Hezbollah appears well prepared to engage in, particularly in light of the possibility of further reinforcements from other segments of Iran’s Axis of Resistance, such as from Iraq and Syria. Under this scenario, it is unlikely that Hezbollah’s forces will be able to defend individual villages or positions in the south at all costs. Instead, and much like in the the past, the group will adopt a more flexible defense strategy, targeting advancing Israeli forces from a distance rather than attempting to hold ground.

Powder Keg In The Pacific – Analysis	By Alfred W. McCoy While the world looks on with trepidation at regional wars in Israel and Ukraine, a far more dangerous global crisis is quietly building at the other end of Eurasia, along an island chain that has served as the front line for the United States’s national defense for endless decades. Just as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has revitalized the NATO alliance, so China’s increasingly aggressive behavior and a sustained US military buildup in the region have strengthened Washington’s position on the Pacific littoral, bringing several wavering allies back into the Western fold. Yet such seeming strength contains both a heightened risk of great power conflict and possible political pressures that could fracture the US’s Asia–Pacific alliance relatively soon. Recent events illustrate the rising tensions of the new Cold War in the Pacific. From June to September of this year, the Chinese and Russian militaries conducted joint maneuvers that ranged from live-firenaval drillsin the South China Sea to air patrols circling Japan and evenpenetratingUS airspace inAlaska. To respond to what Moscowcalled'rising geopolitical tension around the world,' such actions culminated last month in a joint Chinese–Russian'Ocean-24' exercisethat mobilized 400 ships, 120 aircraft and 90,000 troops in a vast arc from the Baltic Sea across the Arctic to the northern Pacific Ocean. While kicking off such monumental maneuvers with China, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the US of 'trying to maintain its global military and political dominance at any cost' by 'increasing [its] military presence… in the Asia-Pacific region.' 'China is not a future threat,' US Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendallrespondedin September. 'China is a threat today.' Over the past 15 years, Beijing’s ability to project power in the Western Pacific, he claimed, had risen to alarming levels. He said the likelihood of war was 'increasing' and, he predicted, it will only 'continue to do so.' An anonymous senior Pentagon officialaddedthat China 'continues to be the only U.S. competitor with the intent and… the capability to overturn the rules-based infrastructure that has kept peace in the Indo-Pacific since the end of the Second World War.' Indeed, regional tensions in the Pacific have profound global implications. For the past 80 years, an island chain of military bastions running from Japan to Australia has served as a crucial fulcrum for US global power. To ensure that it will be able to continue to anchor its 'defense' on that strategic shoal, Washington has recently added new overlapping alliances while encouraging a massive militarization of the Indo–Pacific region. Though bristling with armaments and seemingly strong, this ad hoc Western coalition may yet prove, like NATO in Europe, vulnerable to sudden setbacks from rising partisan pressures, both in the US and among its allies. Building a Pacific bastion For well over a century, the US has struggled to secure its vulnerable western frontier from Pacific threats. During the early decades of the 20th century, Washington maneuvered against a rising Japanese presence in the region. These actions produced geopolitical tensions that led to Tokyo’s attack on the US naval bastion at Pearl Harbor that began World War II in the Pacific. After fighting for four years and suffering nearly 300,000 casualties, the US defeated Japan and won unchallenged control of the entire region. Aware that the advent of the long-range bomber and the future possibility of atomic warfare had rendered the historic concept of coastal defense irrelevant, in the post-war years Washington extended its North American 'defenses' deep into the Western Pacific. Starting with the expropriation of 100 Japanese military bases, the US built its initial postwar Pacific naval bastions at Okinawa and, thanks to a 1947 agreement, at Subic Bay in the Philippines. As the Cold War engulfed Asia in 1950 with the beginning of the Korean conflict, the US extended those bases for 5,000 miles along the entire Pacific littoral through mutual-defense agreements with five Asia–Pacific allies: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Australia. For the next 40 years to the very end of the Cold War, the Pacific littoral remained the geopolitical fulcrum of US global power, allowing it to defend North America and dominate Eurasia. In many ways, the US geopolitical position astride the axial ends of Eurasia would prove the key to its ultimate victory in the Cold War. After the Cold War Once the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the Cold War ended, Washington cashed in its peace dividend, weakening that once-strong island chain. Between 1998 and 2014, the US Navydeclinedfrom 333 ships to 271. That 20% reduction, combined with a shift to long-term deployments in the Middle East, degraded the Navy’s position in the Pacific. Even so, for the 20 years following the Cold War, the US would enjoy what the Pentagoncalled'uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. We could generally deploy our forces when we wanted, assemble them where we wanted, operate how we wanted.' After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, Washington turned from heavy-metal strategic forces to mobile infantry readily deployed for counterterror operations against lightly armed guerrillas. After a decade of fighting misbegotten wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Washington was stunned when a rising China began to turn its economic gains into a serious bid for global power. As its opening gambit, Beijing startedbuilding basesin the South China Sea, where oil and natural gas deposits arerife. It also began expanding its navy, an unexpected challenge that the once-all-powerful US Pacific command was remarkably ill-prepared to meet. In response, in 2011, President Barack Obamaproclaimeda strategic 'pivot to Asia' before the Australian parliament and began rebuilding the US military position on the Pacific littoral. After withdrawing some forces from Iraq in 2012 and refusing to commit significant numbers of troops for regime change in Syria, the Obama White Housedeployeda battalion of Marines to Darwin in northern Australia in 2014. In quick succession, Washington gained access to fivePhilippine basesnear the South China Sea and a new South Korean naval base atJeju Islandon the Yellow Sea. According to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, to operate those installations, the Pentagonplannedto 'forward base 60 percent of our naval assets in the Pacific by 2020.' Nonetheless, the unending insurgency in Iraq continued to slow the pace of that strategic pivot to the Pacific. Despite such setbacks, senior diplomatic and military officials, working under three different administrations, launched a long-term effort to slowly rebuild the US military posture in the Asia–Pacific region. Afterproclaiming'a return to great power competition' in 2016, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardsonreportedthat China’s 'growing and modernized fleet' was 'shrinking' the traditional US advantage in the region. 'The competition is on,' the admiral warned, adding, 'We must shake off any vestiges of comfort or complacency.' Responding to such pressure, the administration of President Donald Trump added the construction of 46 new ships to the Pentagonbudget, which was to raise the total fleet to 326 vessels by 2023. Support ships aside, when it came to an actual 'fighting force,' by 2024 China had the world’slargest navywith 234 'warships.' The US deployed only 219, with Chinese combat capacity, according to US Naval Intelligence, 'increasingly of comparable quality to U.S. ships.' Paralleling the military build-up, the State Department reinforced the US position on the Pacific littoral by negotiating three relatively new diplomatic agreements with Asia–Pacific allies Australia, Britain, India and the Philippines. Though those ententes added some depth and resilience to the US posture, the truth is that this Pacific network may ultimately prove more susceptible to political rupture than a formal multilateral alliance like NATO. Military cooperation with the Philippines After nearly a century as close allies through decades of colonial rule, two world wars and the Cold War, US relations with the Philippines suffered a severe setback in 1991. That country’s senate refused to renew a long-term military bases agreement, forcing the US 7th Fleet out of its massive naval base at Subic Bay. After just three years, however, China occupied some shoals also claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea during a raging typhoon. Within a decade, the Chinese had started transforming them into a network of military bases, while pressing their claims to most of the rest of the South China Sea. Manila’s only response was togrounda rusting World War II naval vessel on Ayungin shoal in the Spratly Islands, where Filipino soldiers had to fish for their supper. With its external defense in tatters, in April 2014 the Philippinessignedan Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with Washington. This allowed the US military quasi-permanent facilities at five Filipino bases, including two on the shores of the South China Sea. Although Manila won aunanimous rulingfrom the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague that Beijing’s claims to the South China Sea were 'without lawful effect,' China dismissed that decision and continued to build its bases there. And when Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines in 2016, he revealed a new policy that included a 'separation' from the US and astrategic tilttoward China. That country rewarded the policy with promises of massive developmental aid. By 2018, however, China’s army wasoperatinganti-aircraft missiles, mobile missile launchers and military radar on five artificial 'islands' in the Spratly archipelago that it had built from sand its dredgers sucked from the seabed. Once Duterte left office, as China’s Coast Guard harassed Filipino fishermen and blasted Philippine naval vessels with water cannons in their own territory, Manila once again started calling on Washington for help. Soon, US Navy vessels were conducting 'freedom of navigation' patrols in Philippine waters and the two nations had staged their biggestmilitary maneuversever. In the April 2024 edition of that exercise, the US deployed its mobile Typhon Mid-RangeMissile Launchercapable of hitting China’s coast, sparking a bittercomplaintfrom Beijing that such weaponry 'intensifies geopolitical confrontation.' Manila has matched its new commitment to the US alliance with an unprecedented rearmament program of its own. Just last spring, it signed a $400 million deal with Tokyo topurchasefive new Coast Guard cutters, started receiving Brahmoscruise missilesfrom India under a $375 million contract and continued a billion-dollar deal with South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries that will produce ten new naval vessels. After the governmentannounceda $35 billion military modernization plan, Manila has been negotiating with Koreansuppliersto procure40modern jet fighters. This is a far cry from a decade earlier when it had no operationaljets. Showing the scope of the country’s reintegration into the Western alliance, just last month Manila hosted joint freedom of navigationmaneuversin the South China Sea with ships from five allied nations: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines and the US. Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and the AUKUS alliance While the Philippine Defense Agreement renewed US relations with an old Pacific ally, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving Australia, India, Japan and the US, first launched in 2007, has now extended US military power into the Indian Ocean. At the 2017 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Manila, four conservative national leaders led by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump decided torevivethe 'Quad' entente (after a decade-long hiatus while Australia’s Labour Party governments cozied up to China). Just last month, President Joe Biden hosted a 'Quad Summit' where the four leaders agreed to expand joint air operations. In a hot-mike moment, Biden bluntlysaid: 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region. It is true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South Asia, and the Taiwan Straits.' China’s Foreign Ministryreplied: 'The U.S. is lying through its teeth' and needs to 'get rid of its obsession with perpetuating its supremacy and containing China.' Since 2020, however, the Quad has made the annual Malabarnaval exercisein India into an elaborate four-power drill in which aircraft carrier battle groups maneuver in waters ranging from the Arabian Sea to the East China Sea. To contest 'China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region,' Indiaannouncedthat the latest exercise this October would feature live-fire maneuvers in the Bay of Bengal, led by its flagship aircraft carrier and a complement of MiG-29K all-weather jet fighters. Clearly, as Modiputit, the Quad is 'here to stay.' While the Trump administration revived the Quad, the Biden White House has promoted a complementary and controversial AUKUS defense compact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the US (part of what Michael Klare has called the 'Anglo-Saxonization' of US foreign and military policy). After months of secret negotiations, their leadersannouncedthat agreement in September 2021 as a way to fulfill 'a shared ambition to support Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy.' Such a goal sparked howls of diplomatic protests. Angry over the sudden loss of a $90 billion contract to supply 12 French submarines to Australia, Francecalledthe decision 'a stab in the back' and immediatelyrecalledits ambassadors from both Canberra and Washington. With equal speed, China’s Foreign Ministrycondemnedthe new alliance for 'severely damaging regional peace… and intensifying the arms race.' In a pointed remark, Beijing’s official Global Times newspaper said Australia had now 'turned itself into an adversary of China.' To achieve extraordinary prosperity, thanks in significant part to its iron ore and other exports to China, Australia had exited the Quad entente for nearly a decade. Through this single defense decision, Australia has allied itself firmly with the US. It willgain accessto British submarine designs and top-secret US nuclear propulsion, joining the elite ranks of just six powers with such complex technology. Australia will spend a monumental$360 billionto build eight nuclear submarines at its Adelaide shipyards over a decade. Additionally, it will host four US Virginia-class nuclear subs at a naval base in Western Australia and buy as many as five of those stealthy submarines from the US in the early 2030s. Under the tripartite alliance with the US and Britain, Canberra will also face additional costs for the joint development of undersea drones, hypersonic missiles and quantum sensing. Through that stealthy arms deal, Washington has seemingly won a major geopolitical and military ally in any future conflict with China. Stand-off along the Pacific littoral Just as Russia’s aggression in Ukraine strengthened the NATO alliance, so China’s challenge in the fossil-fuel-rich South China Sea and elsewhere has helped the US rebuild its island bastions along the Pacific littoral. Through a sedulous courtship under three successive administrations, Washington has won back two wayward allies: Australia and the Philippines. They are once again anchors for an island chain that remains the geopolitical fulcrum for US global power in the Pacific. Still, with more than 200 times the ship-building capacity of the US, China’sadvantagein warships will almost certainly continue to grow. In compensating for such a future deficit, the US’s four active allies along the Pacific littoral will likely play a critical role. (Japan’s navy has more than 50 warships and South Korea’s 30 more.) Despite such renewed strength in what is distinctly becoming a new cold war, the US’s Asia–Pacific alliances face both immediate challenges and a fraught future. Beijing is already putting relentless pressure on Taiwan’s sovereignty, breaching that island’s airspace and crossing the median line in the Taiwan Straitshundreds of timesmonthly. If Beijing turns those breaches into a crippling embargo of Taiwan, the US Navy will face a hard choice between losing a carrier or two in a confrontation with China or backing off. Either way, the loss of Taiwan would sever the US’s island chain in the Pacific littoral, pushing it back to a 'second island chain' in the mid-Pacific. As for that fraught future, the maintenance of such alliances requires a kind of national political will that is by no means assured in an age of populist nationalism. In the Philippines, the anti-US nationalism that Duterte personified retains its appeal and may well be adopted by some future leader. More immediately in Australia, the currentLabour Party governmenthas already faced strong dissent from members blasting the AUKUS entente as a dangerous transgression of their country’s sovereignty. And in the US, Republican populism, whether Trump’s or that of a future leader like J.D. Vance could curtail cooperation with such Asia–Pacific allies, simply walk away from a costly conflict over Taiwan or deal directly with China in a way that would undercut that web of hard-won alliances. And that, of course, might be the good news given the possibility that growing Chinese aggressiveness in the region and a US urge to strengthen a military alliance ominously encircling that country could threaten to turn the latest Cold War ever hotter. This would transform the Pacific into a genuine powder keg and could lead to a war that would, in our present world, be almost unimaginably destructive.

Data Shows Chinese Government Less Popular Than State Media Makes...	By Erin Baggott Carter, Brett Carter, and Stephen Schick The White Paper protests, which spread across China in November 2022, were triggered by the death of ten people during a fire in a quarantined apartment building in Urumqi. The protests reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the Chinese government’s COVID-19 policies, which forced observers of Chinese politics to question whether the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) really enjoys widespread popular support. In contrast with the majority of protests in China driven by discontent with local governments, the White Paper demonstrations offered critiques of the central government and the CCP’s rule more generally. The CCP’s legitimacy—resting on the party’s achievements indeveloping China’s economyand reducing poverty, maintaining social stability through censorship and repression, and, increasingly, promoting a nationalist vision of China’s future—depends to a great extent on public perceptions of the regime. Popular political attitudes in China have shaped the regime’s domestic stability, the reception of its policies, and constrainedits foreign policy decisions.These pillars of CCP legitimacy appear to be shifting beneath the regime’s monolithic facade, as demonstrated bythe White Paper protests. Whether due to China’s slowing economy, the concentration of power under Xi Jinping or the heavy-handedness of the country’s COVID-19 response, researchers and policymakers must carefully analyse these changes in popular attitudes or risk greatly misunderstanding state-society dynamics. For scholars of Chinese politics, the most common tool applied to gauge public opinion is adirect survey, in which respondents are asked about their attitudes towards the Chinese government via in-person enumerators or online forms. Oneprominent study, published by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance at Harvard University, has traced popular attitudes toward the Chinese government since 2003. Their surveysplace regime support above 90 per cent, suggesting that favourable views of the Chinese government are as ubiquitous as party propaganda might suggest. These results have been covered by China Central Television,Xinhua, China Global Television Network, China Dailyand other CCP propaganda outlets, becoming part of the state’s efforts to substantiate its legitimacy — both at home and abroad. But does the CCP really enjoy such widespread support? Or do survey respondents conceal their opposition to the regime due to the threat of repression? And if so, what share of Chinese citizens really support the CCP? To answer these questions, we employed a survey technique known as a list experiment. In a list experiment, respondents are provided with a short list of nonsensitive statements, such as ‘I consider myself a sports fan’,and are asked to tally up the number of statements they agree with. Respondentswererandomly assigned to either a control group or a treatment group, with treated individuals receiving an additional sensitive statement, like ‘I support comrade Xi Jinping’or ‘the CCP government works for the people’. The results, which werepublishedintheChina Quarterly, reveal widespread preference falsification. With direct questions, individuals reported their support for Xi, the CCP and the Chinese government at rates similar to those found in prior direct survey research, reaching upwards of 90 per cent support for the regime. With list experiments, support for the regime dropped to between 50 per cent to 70 per cent. Since list experiments may not fully obviate respondents’ concerns about online surveillance, this is more likelyan upper bound on regime support. Respondents were more willing to express opposition to ‘the system of government’ than to Xi or the CCP directly. Across questions and survey waves, support for the regime varied consistently across three characteristics.Ethnic Han respondents supported Xi about 20 percentage points more than minority respondents.College-educated respondents were between 10–20 percentage points more supportive of the CCP than respondents who completed early middle school. This may be because the CCP’s efforts to shape educational curricula have succeeded,or because college-educated Han perform considerably better inthe labour market. CCP members are about 10 percentage points more supportive of the regime. This makes sense, since they elected to join the Party and benefit from its rents. The difference between regime support under direct questioning and regime support under list experiments is known as the preference falsification rate.Thesurvey experiments reveal a preference falsification rate in Xi’s China of around 25 percentage points. A recent meta-analysis examined all known list experiments in autocratic contexts and found an average preference falsification rate of around 14 percentage points. This makes Xi’s China a clear outlier and demonstrates its citizens are far more fearful of expressing opposition to the regime. These results suggestobservers should be sceptical about public opinion surveys in China that rely on direct questioning. The CCP’s sprawling internal security apparatus compels citizens to engage in widespread self-censorship, at a rate nearly three times higher than inVladamirPutin’s Russia. The pervasiveness of self-censorship has caused observers to overstate the amount of legitimacythatthe CCP enjoys. This legitimacy, the conventional wisdom goes, is born of its record of economic growth and a propaganda and censorship apparatus that persuades citizens of the regime’s merits. Theresults, most broadly, suggest the CCP confronts widespread frustration. Its recent policies, including the increase in repressionand sabre-rattling over Taiwan, should be seen as an effort to contain this frustration.

Argentina: Nine Months Of Javier Milei As President – Analysis	By Antony P. Mueller In office for just over nine months, Argentine President Javier Milei continues to face enormous economic and political challenges. His support from Congress and the Senate is fragile, and the president’s opponents are trying to mobilize the masses against his policies. This makes success in the economic sphere all the more urgent. The aim here is to find a way out of stagflation—the simultaneous occurrence of stagnation or recession and inflation—in which the Argentine economy currently finds itself as quickly as possible. The signs are not good. When the Western industrialized nations fell into stagnation in the 1970s, it took almost a decade for price inflation to be defeated to some extent and for economic growth to pick up again. Milei doesn’t have that much time, even though a lot has already been achieved. Since taking office on December 10, 2023, Javier Milei has the following advantages: Surplus since January 2024 Restriction of money creation by the central bank since April 2024 Reduction of the inflation rate since April 2024 Abolition of various price regulations (e.g., on the housing market) Reduction of various price subsidies Abolition of eight ministries, partly with complete closure and dismissal of around 30,000 state employees However, the negative side still has a heavy impact: Price inflation remains high (237 percent per year) Unemployment rises (7.6 percent) Labor force participation is very low (48 percent) Industrial production is negative (-5.4percent annual) External debt rises to around $290 billion Insufficient level of foreign exchange reserves (currently $21.7 billion) Devaluation to 975 pesos from 322 to the dollar when he took office In presenting the budget in September, the Milei government announced the following expectations for 2025: 5 percent increase in gross domestic product Reduce price inflation to 18 percent per year by the end of 2025 Devaluation of the currency to 1207 per dollar by the end of 2025 Achieve a primary budget surplus of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product If you take a closer look at the current figures, doubts grow whether these goals can be achieved. Worrying indicators are that the central bank money supply is not falling further and that the so-called M1 money supply is even increasing. Inflation expectations fell sharply in the first half of the year but have remained steady at 50 percent per year since then. With price inflation remaining high, the central bank may have cut interest rates too much and will be forced to reverse them when the rate of inflation picks up again. This, in turn, would further delay the recovery of industrial production. In addition, high payments for the interest on foreign debt are due in January next year. 2025 will be the critical year for Javier Milei, also because midterm elections are due in October 2025. By then, the president will have to whip his electoral alliance into shape to have enough votes in the legislature for the next stage of his policy. To understand why Milei—an avowed 'anarcho-capitalist'—came to power in the first place, it is enough to point out that Argentina has experienced a loss of prosperity for more than fifty years. While many other emerging markets have achieved massive gains in prosperity, the level in Argentina has fallen. But this is not the only reason why frustration is so widespread. One trigger to try something completely new is price inflation. This was already very high in all the previous decades, but in the past two years, it has risen rapidly. While the annual inflation rate was still around 50 percent at the beginning of 2022, it had risen to over two hundred percent when Javier Milei took office in December 2023. It was above all the promise to finally put an end to inflation that brought Milei into office. Now the task for him is whether he can keep his promise without the recession deepening. In a nutshell, the task is that the reduction in the money supply and the reduction in government spending will be compensated for by a corresponding increase in private sector activity so that unemployment does not rise too much. Thus, much depends on the extent to which the government succeeds in strengthening the private sector through deregulation and privatization. In addition to the domestic political problem areas, foreign trade is a decisive factor. Argentina is almost completely cut off from private foreign financing. New loans can only be expected from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but Argentina is already the country most indebted to the IMF with $42 billion in outstanding loans. Regarding the foreign debt of currently $287 billion US dollars, an estimated $15 billion US dollars are due to interest and partial amortizations starting in January of next year. Financially, Argentina will be very dependent on foreign exchange income. These can hardly be provided by the country’s export industry. Compensation would have to be made by foreign direct investment. There are already some positive signals here. But it remains to be seen whether the announcements will be followed by action because the economic climate is getting cloudy in the industrialized countries. Argentina belongs to the large group of countries that have been systematically ruined by their own governments. Whether more 'right' or more 'left,' these politicians had in common a deep penchant for interventionism. What distinguishes Javier Milei is that he offers an alternative to the Argentine people. He calls himself an 'anarcho-capitalist,' but what he promises and wants to implement is essentially a sound economic policy. Therefore, one should not expect too much anarcho-capitalism from the president. Even if he wanted to, he could not push it through politically. However, much would already be gained if he prevails in macroeconomic matters and succeeds in taming inflation and bringing about an economic upswing. This alone would have a signal effect worldwide, but especially for Latin America, where the tendency towards socialism is still widespread. Where is Milei’s anarcho-capitalism, one wonders? There is little to see of this. He is pursuing a policy that the International Monetary Fund has already prescribed for many debtor countries. Governments have often followed the IMF’s requirements rather reluctantly. The Argentinian president does it voluntarily and to an even harsher extent. To reform an entire country abruptly in an anarcho-capitalist way is an impossibility. It would probably be better if Milei took a different path: that of private free cities or special economic zones. This concept states that the government of a country designates certain territories, and the state largely withdraws administratively and leaves most of it to the private sector. Low or no taxes and almost no regulations are the incentives for companies and private investors to settle there. The labor market in these zones is almost completely free of regulation, and people come there voluntarily to work and do business. Argentina’s location, in particular, is ideal for such a strategy because of its many almost completely uninhabited regions. The Argentine government could designate areas the size of Holland and lease these selected territories to a private company, the amount of which would vary according to the economic success achieved there. A comparison of the circumstances with the already existing administrative special zones in other parts of the world indicates that the chances of success in Argentina seem very favorable. This would be particularly the case if a libertarian government, such as that of Milei, undertook to extend the absence of state rule in such a special zone as far as possible, and accordingly to create a comprehensive space for a private legal system. Such a project could have a signal function for the whole world and provide practical proof that and how anarcho-capitalism works. About the author: Dr. Antony P.

Bulgaria: Will Borisov Be Able To Form A Government? – Analysis	By Ivan Bedrov (RFE/RL) -- Bulgaria is back in very familiar territory. The October 27 parliamentary elections gave former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov's center-right GERB party the most votes, but not enough to form a government on its own. Borisov will certainly try. But despite winning five out of seven parliamentary elections since 2021, GERB has failed to form a coalition. Will Borisov Be Able To Form A Government? To form a governing coalition, Borisov -- Bulgaria's most notable and powerful politician, who has been prime minister three times since 2009 -- needs the support of at least half the deputies in the National Assembly, the country's 240-seat unicameral parliament. Looking at the breakdown of votes in the increasingly fragmented parliament, three or four parties will be needed to form a majority. So far, Borisov has only ruled out working with the far-right, pro-Kremlin Revival party, which came in third with 13 percent of the vote. Speaking on election night, Borisov said: 'We will govern with anyone who supports our program.' Enter Delyan Peevski... Much of it comes down to one man: Delyan Peevski, a controversial media tycoon with incredible sway over public opinion. He has been accused of corruption and influence peddling and sanctioned by the United States and Britain for corruption. And most Bulgarian politicians would probably agree that Peevski is the person most responsible for Bulgaria's ongoing political crisis. In a move that would likely end the political impasse, Borisov has said he would work with the second-place pro-Western reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria (PP-DB) coalition, which polled 14 percent. However, PP-DB has insisted that it will only work with GERB if Peevski has no influence on the future administration. Borisov has been repeatedly accused of having close ties to Peevski, who for many Bulgarians is emblematic of the country's corruption and organized crime. It's also unlikely that Borisov will be able to scrape together enough seats from the smaller parties in parliament, many of whom also refuse to be in bed with Peevski. So, essentially, it comes down to Borisov having to choose between the PP-DB or Peevski. After the last elections in June, GERB and Peevski's previous party could have formed a government with the support of a few independent lawmakers, but Borisov refused to make a deal. Why Can't Borisov Cut Ties With Peevski? This is the $1 million question in Bulgaria, and no one really knows the answer. PP-DB has said that Peevski de facto owns GERB through mutual business concerns. Plus, Peevski is widely thought to control Bulgaria's powerful Prosecutor-General's Office, which oversees both criminal investigations and prosecutorial decisions. In the past, investigations against Borisov have been closed and the former prime minister has received immunity from prosecution. What Are The Consequences Of This Continuing Impasse? Bulgaria is stagnating. Money from the European Union has almost dried up, and it will stay that way until the country carries out EU-mandated reforms and anti-corruption measures. Not to mention that without a functioning administration, the EU doesn't really have anyone to work with. Efforts to push reforms and anti-corruption measures, notably by PP-DB, have continually hit a brick wall. With the country in limbo, progress has stalled on Bulgaria adopting the euro and fully joining the EU's borderless Schengen zone. Are Bulgarians Losing Their Faith In The Democratic Process? While public faith in the electoral process is certainly not high, partial results have shown that the turnout for these elections might be slightly higher than the 34 percent of voters who voted in June. There were fears before the vote that widespread disillusionment with mainstream parties could result in the rise of smaller extreme parties such as Revival. However, the latest elections don't show any clear evidence of that. While fringe parties have increased their vote share, so, too, have the major parties. Could This Election Affect Bulgaria's International Course? While there are four pro-Russia parties in parliament, they have a smaller number of deputies than the pro-Western parties. Moreover, the fact that the pro-Western GERB and PP-DB parties came first and second is an indication that support for Bulgaria's EU and NATO membership remains strong. And while PP-DB's support and vote-share isn't huge, the party's constant pressure for reform is a defining feature of Bulgaria's political landscape.

Canada Must Reject Extremism In Dispute With India – OpEd	For generations, Canada's vibrant Indian diaspora has been an integral part of our society. From starting businesses to advancing our workforce, Indian immigrants have significantly contributed to Canada's growth and prosperity—just as they are doing in the U.S. Today, Canada and India share a solid international trade relationship, with bilateral trade reaching USD $9.36 billion in 2023. Canadian Pension Funds have cumulatively invested over USD $75 billion in India, viewing it as an increasingly favourable investment destination. With a growing Indian diaspora of over 2 million people in Canada, the potential for future growth is immense. Yet, despite these encouraging figures, the current trade numbers fall short of the true potential between these two vibrant democracies. A Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement has been a shared dream for many in both nations. A decade and a half in the making, this agreement would have greatly boosted economic ties. Yet, time and again, we've seen potential agreements halted by domestic political tensions, bringing us back to square one. Recent events have pushed this relationship to an all-time low. Allegations from the Canadian government, still awaiting court verification, have cast doubt on these strong economic and social ties. Over a year ago, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen wanted in India for various crimes, was killed in British Columbia. Canada's defence of Nijjar without acknowledging his criminal background or his questionable path to permanent residency raises critical questions: How are individuals with criminal records gaining access to Canada, and how are they passing background checks? Canadians want, above all, to live in safety, and it is the duty of our government to ensure that those who seek asylum and security here pose no threat to our way of life. For Canada to continue as a haven for a better life, we cannot allow individuals with questionable backgrounds to undermine the vision of peace and security that new Canadians seek. This moment calls for a larger reset in our political priorities, shifting focus from diaspora appeasement to Canadian national interests. Diversity is Canada's strength—one that should unite us in a shared Canadian dream, not divide us for short-term political gain. This atmosphere of mistrust risks the enormous potential for cultural, social, and economic cooperation between Canada and India. India, currently experiencing rapid growth with an 8.2% economic rise in FY 2023-24, boasts booming sectors in manufacturing, technology, and healthcare. Canada's advanced technology, resources, and world-renowned agro-processing industry stand to gain from a more robust partnership with India. Yet, today's trade figures don't reflect the vast possibilities of a truly collaborative relationship. Experts suggest that with ambitious agreements, we could double or even triple our bilateral trade. But this requires a strong, trusting partnership built on mutual respect, sincerity, and continued positive engagement. In a time when democracies like the U.S. and its allies are striving to counterbalance global challenges, conflict between Canada and India creates an unnecessary wedge. Instead of fostering unity, Canada's stance forces the U.S. to mediate between two of its closest allies, distracting from broader global priorities. It's essential to clarify that the vast majority of the Indo-Canadian community are peace-loving and loyal to Canadian values. A small, extremist faction within the community may seek headlines, rallying vulnerable politicians to support their divisive agenda. Open, aggressive advocacy for the Khalistan cause has instilled fear across Sikh and Hindu populations. For those who remember the horrors of the 1980s, including the Air India tragedy that took 329 lives, these renewed calls for division are a painful reminder of dark times that no one wants to revisit. Today, hate-filled slogans like 'Hindus Go Back' and the vandalizing of Hindu temples are unacceptable in Canada. All members of the Indo-Canadian community—across religious and cultural backgrounds—deserve to live free from extremist narratives that do not reflect their values. It's tragic that in pursuing short-term political aims, the legitimate voices of the broader Sikh community, proud Canadians, have been overlooked. Most Sikhs have no ill-will towards anyone and continue to lead lives that contribute to Canada's economy and cultural fabric. We honour their heritage and contributions, and so do the people of India. As Chair of the Canada India Foundation and a proud Indo-Canadian, I've witnessed the shared values of the Indo-Canadian community—peace, prosperity, freedom, and cooperation—that have historically brought Canada and India together. The current diplomatic standoff and its consequences are deeply regrettable. However, it is not too late to restore calm and pursue constructive dialogue. Together, Canada and India can strengthen not only their bilateral relationship but also their partnerships with the U.S. and other democracies, driving a global vision where democratic values thrive. I urge Canada's leaders to listen to the voices of the broader Indo-Canadian community, reject extremism in all forms, and rebuild the bonds that unite us all. It's time to prioritize unity, respect, and shared progress, ensuring that Canada's diverse society thrives and our partnership with India remains a model for mutual benefit and understanding.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz29efoag2gj0	2024-10-29T16:50:57-07:00	
US At The Crossroads As Voters Clamor For Change – OpEd	By Dr. Turki Faisal Al-Rasheed As the 2024 US elections approach, the atmosphere is charged with intensity reminiscent of the Cold War era. Since 2016, American society has become increasingly polarized, exemplified by the ongoing rivalry between Donald Trump and his Democratic counterparts. Joe Biden’s ascension to the presidency was largely fueled by public dissatisfaction with the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, a sentiment that has led many to question his effectiveness in crisis management, mirroring critiques faced by his predecessor, Trump. While the media emphasizes domestic issues such as abortion, immigration, inflation, and taxes, it is crucial not to overlook how foreign policy may sway swing voters, particularly within significant communities such as Arab Americans. The geopolitical landscape, especially the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, will likely play a pivotal role in shaping voter sentiment as we move closer to the elections. Under Biden’s leadership, US policy has thrust Ukraine into a precarious situation against Russia, with the Ukrainian populace bearing the brunt of the conflict. Nearly three years in, Russia remains resolute in its stance against NATO’s perceived encroachment on its borders. Following recent BRICS meetings, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that more than 30 countries have expressed interest in joining the group, indicating a desire to challenge Western 'hegemony' and shape a 'multipolar world order.' In Europe, allies are grappling with the fallout of the conflict, facing unprecedented fuel prices, and a refugee crisis that burdens their economies. The lack of a clear military or political resolution exacerbates these challenges, leaving Europe reliant on US directives regarding potential ceasefires in Ukraine and the broader implications for regional stability. In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to exploit a perception of a US administration as weak and disengaged, as ongoing conflicts draw in regional powers aligned with Iran. This situation raises the specter of a direct confrontation between Israel and its adversaries, a scenario fraught with peril not only for the region but also for international relations. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris finds herself in a precarious position navigating these complicated foreign policy issues. Her commitment to continue Biden’s foreign policy, which has not yielded success in Ukraine or Gaza, leaves her vulnerable to criticism. Her attempts to resonate with Michigan’s significant Arab community, such as her assertion to 'end the suffering' in Gaza, stand in contrast to her unwavering support for military aid to Israel, highlighting the fractures within the Democratic Party on foreign policy. Exploring the nuances of this crisis reveals that financial interests often take precedence over political ideologies. Corporations and state institutions have historically wielded power, sometimes leading to decisions driven more by economic gains than by the well-being of constituents. Wars are often justified through grand rhetoric, but underneath lies a stark reality of 'savage capitalism' benefitting arms dealers and the military-industrial complex. The political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once noted: 'The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values... but by its superiority in applying organized violence.' While this may prompt reflection on the past, it also suggests the need for a balanced approach in the future. Regardless of the election’s outcome, the implications for Europe are significant. Europe must develop a new strategy that navigates its relationship with the US, accounting for shifting dynamics in global politics. The need for a clear articulation of collective interests has never been more pressing as competition from China and ongoing instability in the Middle East create challenges that demand a cohesive response. In the Arab world, particularly the Gulf states, collaboration among nations will be vital in prioritizing sustainable development and avoiding conflicts. Analysts predict an inevitable and potentially swift American withdrawal from the region, necessitating a reassessment of how Arab nations work together, especially with the Biden administration’s evident desire for reduced US involvement. This transitory phase in American foreign policy could call into question whether it is the US that is leaving or merely redefining its strategy in a complex landscape. The fallout from military engagement often leaves a legacy of instability, a sentiment echoed by foreign affairs analysts. Joseph Roth’s poignant reflections in 'The Emperor’s Tomb' on the decline of powerful civilizations resonate with present-day realities, where moral decay and ineffective leadership raise urgent concerns about the future of American democracy. As the country prepares for the elections, it is clear that the American populace itself may emerge as the greatest loser. With divisions deepening and trust in leadership eroding, many yearn for a time when the presidency symbolized national unity and strength. The upcoming elections will determine not only the future of US leadership but also the implications for global politics. As the US stands at this crossroads, a calculated examination of the interplay between domestic issues and foreign policy will be vital for voters seeking meaningful change in a complex world. Ultimately, navigating the turbulent waters of the 2024 elections requires a balanced approach that considers both domestic priorities and the intricate web of global relations. As the political landscape evolves, the US public and policymakers must be vigilant and informed, ensuring they champion a vision that promotes unity, moral clarity, and sustainable progress both at home and abroad.

The Biden-Harris Administration Wasted Nearly One Billion On Misi...	The party of 'Science' apparently misled hundreds of millions of people on the actual science surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. Stop the presses. Starting in early 2020, the combined efforts ofDr. Anthony Fauci, the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, and their partners in the media caused an untold amount of damage to society and public health and might have even created conditions forincreased Covid spread. How? By repeatedly, profoundly, and often purposefully communicating inaccurate information while spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get their preferred messages across. Now, a new, massive113-page reportfrom the US House of Representatives Energy & Commerce Committee has detailed the remarkable abuses from the Biden-Harris administration and the manner in which they communicated during Covid. Biden, CDC Partners Literally Wasted a Fortune to Lie to the American People The report details a number of unbelievable inaccuracies in 2021 coming from the Biden administration’s communications team and the CDC’s messaging apparatus. Fauci and Francis Collins’ National Institutes of Health were also responsible, creating guidance using taxpayer money, nearly $1 billion per the report, that misled millions of people and caused unimaginable harm in the process. While the Biden-Harris administration’s public health guidance led to prolonged closures of schools and businesses, the NIH was spending nearly a billion dollars of taxpayer money trying to manipulate Americans with advertisements—sometimes containing erroneous or unproven information. By overpromising what the Covid-19 vaccines could do—in direct contradiction of the FDA’s authorizations—and over emphasizing the virus’s risk to children and young adults, the Biden-Harris administration caused Americans to lose trust in the public health system,' Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said after the report’s release. 'Our investigation also uncovered the extent to which public funding went to Big Tech companies to track and monitor Americans, underscoring the need for stronger online data privacy protections.' One of the most damaging, and woefully incorrect messaging campaigns centered on vaccine efficacy against infection. As the report details, Biden’s 'Stop the Spread' campaign was a pervasive marketing effort in conjunction with the CDC that claimed vaccines would end the pandemic by reducing infections. That had enormous knock-on effects, including decreasing trust in all vaccinations and ultimately harming public health. 'The entire premise of the Biden-Harris ‘Stop the Spread’ campaign was that if you got vaccinated for COVID-19, you could resume daily activities because they said vaccinated people would not spread the disease,' said Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith (R-VA). 'Despite lacking scientific basis, the administration bought into this CDC claim and misled the American public. As a result, vaccination coverage with other vaccines appears to have declined, I believe because of a growing distrust of information coming from our public health institutions.' This campaign was even more disingenuous and purposefully misleading than previously realized. The 'Stop the Spread' publicity blitz hid in plain sight a message from the CDC that even they didn’t know whether the vaccines actually stopped infection or transmission. The report shared a screenshot of a page from the Biden administration’s marketing that specifically said 'science' wasn’t sure how well the vaccines worked against infection. Yet the Biden administration made life-altering policy decisions such as vaccine mandates, discriminatory entry processes, and military vaccination requirements regardless. And that was in addition to the less quantifiable impacts like nudging millions of people to follow their preferred course of action. CDC Guidance Exacerbated Existing Problems The report also explains how the Biden administration relied heavily on guidance from the CDC, an organization that thoroughly disgraced itself during the pandemic. There were several examples highlighted, chief among them that CDC 'experts' went far beyond what even the FDA claimed Covid vaccines could do. Without evidence, the report says Biden’s marketing claimed that 'COVID vaccines were highly effective against transmission.' Within just a few months, it was clear that all the available evidence pointed towards the exact opposite direction. Per the report, this had a 'negative impact on vaccine confidence and the CDC’s credibility when proven untrue.' The CDC also had 'inconsistent and flawed messaging about the effectiveness of masks,' which created seemingly endless mandates and, again, overconfidence in an ineffective policy. Some of those mandates even continue to this day. That’s just the tip of their misinformation. A wealth of data and public embarrassments for the CDC confirmed that the organization 'consistently overstated the risk of COVID-19 to children,' the report states. That fear-mongering had disastrous consequences, from unnecessarily terrifying parents to prolonged school closures and lack of socialization—setting an entire generation of children back in the process. Still, after being repeatedly and profoundly proven wrong, the CDC has demonstrated they’ve yet to learn their lesson. In late 2024, the CDC continues to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for babies starting at six months old. That makes the US a global outlier compared to European nations that have maintained at least some level of intellectual honesty. How Do We Fix CDC Abuses? The report detailed several recommendations to fix these organizations after their disastrous work during the pandemic. Even implementing just a select few, listed below, would do wonders for fixing the institutional rot that influenced these mistakes. Congress should consider clarifying responsibility for evaluating the safety of vaccines and streamlining existing reporting systems for capturing vaccine injuries and adverse reactions. HHS and its agencies should embrace a culture of transparency and accountability. The CDC and federal public health officials should not attempt to silence dissenting scientific opinions. Also highlighted in the report is how the CDC and NIH used their weight in their attempts to censor scientists who dissented from their preferred narratives. Beyond their mistakes, profound inaccuracies, and nearly unlimited spending, their censorship efforts are equally concerning. As we learned during Covid, if there’s one thing 'experts' hate, it’s being told that they were proven wrong. Instead of learning, adjusting, and apologizing, they move to censor, criticize and mislead. This new report is the latest confirmation of these unacceptable 'mistakes.' And reaffirms the importance of ensuring they never happen again.

Scary National Debt Numbers – OpEd	Ready for a pre-Halloween scare? The U.S.government’stotal public debt outstanding surpassed$35.465 trillionat the end of its 2024 fiscal yearon September 30, 2024. That massive number is the equivalent of $268,265 of national debt for each household in the United States. This figure is above and beyond theamount ofdebt each household hasaccumulatedthrough their mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. It’salso an underestimate because the national debt has kept growing. As of October 24, the national debt increased by another $334 billion, or by about $2,647 per household. Altogether, the national debt has grown by $54,862 per household during the Biden-Harris administration’s tenure. There is a good chance the Biden-Harris administration will beat the $57,989 per household figure run up during Donald Trump’s term in office before President Biden leaves the White House on January 20, 2025. Who has the U.S. government borrowed so much from? Screenshot That’sa pretty reasonable question to ask. Political Calculations took asnapshotof the U.S.government’smajorcreditors as of September 30, 2024. The chart below reveals themajorcreditors to whom the U.S. government owes money and how much of that debt eachis owed. Here’s their overall picture of who owns the U.S. national debt: The U.S. Federal Reserve is once again the U.S. government’s single largest creditor holding U.S. government-issued debt securities worth 12.4% of the U.S. government’s entire total public debt outstanding. However, its share of the national debt is down from the 18.3% it held in 2022 and the 15% recorded last year as the Federal Reserve has continued reducing its holdings. In doing so, the Fed is still following the monetary policy of shrinking its balance sheet that it initiated in March 2022 when it began hiking interest rates to combatinflationunleashed by President Biden’s policies. Speaking of interest rates, on 19 September 2024, the Federal Reserveinitiateda new series of interest rate reductions after holding them steady at an elevated level for over a year. Those higher rates have attracted U.S. individuals and institutions such as banks, insurance companies, investment funds, corporations, and individuals to collectively increase their share of the national debt from 47.1% in 2023 to 48.8% in 2024. Social Security’s share of the national debt plunged from 8.1% in 2023 to 7.3% in 2024. This decline coincides with theongoing depletionof its Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund, which has run in the red in every year since 2009. The combined share of the U.S. national debt held by the government’s military (4.5%) and civilian (3.0%) employee retirement trust funds swelled from 7.2% to 7.5% from FY 2023 to FY 2024. Altogether, the portion of the U.S. national debt held by U.S. entities in 2024 is 76.0%, a small dip from the 77.4% in 2023, but up slightly from 75.7% share in 2022…. The portion of the U.S. total public debt outstanding held by foreign individuals and institutions is 24.0%. During the last few years, interest on the national debt has become thefastest-growingcategory of government spending. That money comes straight out of the U.S. government’s tax collections without ever doing anything U.S. taxpayers expect tobe donewith their tax dollars. Ready for the real scare? Unless something dramatic changes things, these numbers will be bigger and scarier next year.

A ‘Heroic’ Preference For Self-Destruction Is Taking Hold In Isra...	Centuries ago a boy was born. His parents understood that he had a remarkable fate before him which reflected the Will of the Great Shaman. His hair was light, his eyes were light green, and his skin was pale. It seemed obvious that he enjoyed divine favour. But then, one day, the boy’s father – a figure of standing – was killed. The family thus became unprotected, and nomads smashed the remains of his home. They made him a slave. They put wooden stocks over his legs so that he could not walk. He lived like a dog, and grew up like a dog, chained outside, eating rotten food, freezing on winter nights, wishing for death. Death however spared him. When finally he did escape, his psyche was tortured. The voices inside his head; the screams of his father; the scorching fire; his mother being tortured and killed; All whispered, just destroy everything that is in your way, and these memories will be purged. But they weren’t. His army killed millions. Nonetheless, he founded a nation of more than one million vassals. He expurgated all concepts of tribal loyalty and old identities for obedience to his State. He did all this with a tiny army; no more than 100,000. His name comes down to us today as Genghis Khan. What has this to do with today’s war in the Middle East? Well, firstly we have moved – in thisAmerican-facilitatedIsraeli war – to ‘war without limits’. The rules of war have been evicted; human rights have been discarded; international law has been shed; and the UN Charter is no more. And, as it expands, anything goes – children in Gaza decapitated by bombs, Gaza’s hospitals bombed, and the continuous displacement and massacre of civilians. The roots to this shift are complex. In part, they spring from the western postmodern zeitgeist. But also they reflect the same dilemma that faced a tormented, twisted Genghis Khan: How would he control the world without a big army; in fact, with only a tiny one. 'Everything that’s happened today was planned out just 50 years ago – back in 1974 and 1973'. I want to describe how the whole strategy that led to the United States today, not wanting peace, but wanting Israel to take over the whole Near East took shape gradually',Professor Hudson has explained (hereandhere). Hudson relates: 'I met many [neocons] at the Hudson Institute, where [I] had worked for five years in the mid ‘70s; some of them, or their fathers, were Trotskyists.They picked up Trotsky’s idea of permanent revolution. That is, an unfolding revolution – whereas Trotsky said what began in Soviet Russia was going to spread around the world: The neocons adapted this and said, No, the permanent Revolution is the American Empire. It’s going to expand, and expand, and nothing can stop us – to the entire world'. In their ambition, they were another Genghis Khan: the U.S., lacking the military means, would seize the Middle East using Israel as its proxy on the one hand, and Saudi-facilitated Sunni fundamentalism on the other. TheHudson Institute, under Herman Khan, persuaded the dominant political figure Scoop Jackson that Zionism could be America’s battering ram in the Middle East. That was in the early 1970s. By 1996, Scoop Jackson’s former Senate aides had crafted –specifically for Netanyahu – itsClean Break Strategy. Explicitly, it was the blueprint for ‘a new Middle East’. It argued that the Israel proxy would be served best by regime change in surrounding countries. In March 2003, Patrick J. Buchanan, referring to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wrote, 'Their [Clean Break] plan urged Israel to [pursue regime change through] ‘the principle of preemption''. Professor Michael Hudson points out the design’s fatal flaw: The Vietnam War had shown that any attempted conscription by western democracies was not viable. Lyndon Johnson in 1968 had to withdraw from running for election precisely because everywhere he’d go, there would be nonstop stop-the-war demonstrations. So what then was left to the United States and Israel? Well, what is available – if your objective is to found Greater Israel – is ‘war without limits’ [i.e positively seeking huge collateral deaths] – a war without limits such as that which Genghis Khan practised: the total annihilation of other peoples and the suppression of their separate identities. A single power – the Hobbesian ‘Leviathan’ – achieved through disarming everyone. The ultimate aim being to suppress any plurality of wills. The flaw is that the Israelis, as the U.S. proxy force, have limited forces, both by numbers (it is a small army, dependent on reservists), and by being constrained by its ranks being drawn from a westernised, postmodern culture. 'Postmodern thinking has swept God, Nature, and Reason away. The individual replaces everything. Facts are only what he wants them to be… There are only fictions left—but these fictions are also all of reality. Western society thus begins to look very much like an insane asylum. Of course, this is only a collective paranoia: one bomb falls somewhere in our country, and very real realities, which mock our discourses, are destroyed and this philosophy collapses',warnsDr Henri Hude. This statement, directed more broadly at the West, however summarizes Israel exactly. The latter tries to substitute the Talmud as the epistemological basis of its society, yet young Israel is largely the same TikTok generation of individualists as in the West, whose ‘facts’ come only from what the government tells them to be. And as the bombs fall on Tel Aviv, the country sinks into collective paranoia and events mock the state panglossian discourses. At bottom, postmodernism places the highest priority on Life and individual freedom. The capacity to adapt to the brutalities of this style of limitless war therefore hangs very much on culture. To successfully adapt to the horror of death and destruction, one must accept the very idea of sacrifice and suffering – the spilling of blood to feed the earth towards new growth. Israel does not have a culture of sacrifice, but its adversaries do. If culture is unable to offer a meaning to the notion of sacrifice and loss, it does not put man in a position to face the tragedy of his condition. The war without limits ideology – purely theoretically – could be a thinkable solution: Ron Dermer, a former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. and confidant of Netanyahu,was askeda few months earlier what he saw as the solution to the Palestinian conflict. He replied that both the West Bank and Gaza must be totally dis-armed – 'yes'. Yet more important than disarmament, Dermer said, was the absolute necessity that all Palestinians be 'de-radicalised'. (This has now been extended to the whole region that must be ‘de-radicalised’). When asked to expand, Dermer pointed approvingly to the outcome of WW2: The Germans were defeated, but more plainly the Japanese were fully ‘de-radicalised’ at the end of the war. ‘De-radicalisation’ therefore means installing a Leviathan-esque 'despotism that reduces the majority to total powerlessness, including spiritual, intellectual and moral powerlessness. The total Leviathan is a unique, absolute and unlimited power, spiritual and temporal, over other humans', as Dr Henri Hude hasobserved. Thus, as postmodern culture sinks into the inhuman and favours the Leviathan – with the total annihilation of other peoples and the suppression of their separate identities – the question arises, could ‘war without limits’ work? Could such terror impose on the Middle East an unconditional surrender 'that would allow it to change profoundly, militarily, politically and culturally, and to transform as a satellite within Pax Americana?' Hude goes on to note, 'The conditions demanded of Japan by the USA were exorbitant, and it was to be expected that Japan would put up a tremendous resistance. The atrocious use of the bomb broke this resistance'. The clear response that Dr Hude gives in his bookPhilosophie de laGuerreis that war without limits cannot be the solution, because it cannot deliver long-lasting ‘deterrence’ or de-radicalisation.'On the contrary, it is the most certain cause of war. Ceasing to be rational, despising opponents who are more rational than it is, arousing opponents who are even less rational than it is.The Leviathan will fall; and even before its fall, no security is assured'. The latter gives two insights as to how Hude’s analysis might apply to today’s wars: One is that whenever postmodern culture capsizes into ‘necessary’ violence (which it hyper-culpabilises, since it prioritises life, rather than suffering), it can only justify the violence through evoking a more than absolute evil – the demonized enemy. Secondly, Hude identifies such extreme ‘will to power’ – without limits – as necessarily containing the psyche of self-destruction within it too. For the Leviathan to function, it must remain rational and powerful. Ceasing to be rational, despising opponents who are more rational, and angering opponents who are less rational than itis itself, the Leviathan then must fall. One respected military observer – Maj. Gen. (Res.) Itzhak Brik, a former senior IDF commander and a former long-serving IDF ombudsman – haswarnedagain of Israel’s looming fall: Netanyahu,Gallant and Halevi are gambling with Israel’s very existence… they never think for a moment about the day after.They are disconnected from reality and exercise no judgment…When the catastrophe strikes, it will already be too late…These three megalomaniacs imagine that they are capable of destroying both Hamas and Hizbullahand ending the ayatollahs’ regime in Iran…They want to accomplish everything through military pressure, but in the end, they won’t accomplish anything. They have put Israel on the brink of two impossible situations[–]the outbreak of a full-fledged war in the Middle East, [and secondly]continuing the war of attrition.In either situation, Israel won’t be able to survive for long. Only a diplomatic agreement has the power to extricate us from the quagmire into which these three men have dragged us. Israel teeters at the edge: It doesn’t have thenecessary forces; it doesn’t have a culture of tolerating persistent suffering; and it will not be able to impose itself over the plurality of resistance that it faces. Reason already is cast aside, its opponents are ridiculed: a ‘heroic’ preference for self-destruction has taken hold. ‘Masada’ is being spoken of.

Trump And The GOP Feeling It: Can They Win The Trifecta? – OpEd	By Tim Donner There are many ways to judge the state of a presidential or Senate race beyond the tsunami of polls we attempt to process in the run-up to Election Day. While the trajectory of national and swing-state polling appears to favor the former president with just days to go until all votes are cast, the behavior of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, and down-ballot candidates on both sides is arguably even more revealing. Trumpwas pumped up as he put it all on the line in a much-ballyhooed rally on Sunday night at New York’s Madison Square Garden. To the strains of a live version of God Bless the USA, the 45th president strode onto the stage of the world’s most famous arena, after being introduced to the overflow audience by his wife for the last major speech of his third and final presidential campaign of an era he has largely defined. He channeled Ronald Reagan by kicking off his speech with that oft-repeated rhetorical question: Are you better off than you were four years ago? He spoke of a new golden age and reprised his most famous phrase prior to entering the political stage: 'Kamala, you’re fired.' He accused Vice President Harris of 'shattering the middle class,' while promising to 'make America affordable again.' He promised to end inflation and stop the invasion of criminals on the southern border, and to 'build the greatest economy in the history of the world.' He reiterated his proposals to do away with taxes on tips, overtime, and social security benefits, and announced a new tax credit for caregivers, and making interest on car loans tax-deductible – but only for cars made in America. He reiterated his enthusiastic support for tariffs and used video clips about a vicious Venezuelan gang that has seized control of apartment complexes in Colorado and Texas, promising to reinstitute the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He called for the death penalty for killing a police officer and for making sanctuary cities illegal. The speech covered the waterfront, and – as most close observers say – Trump is in the zone, appearing happier than at any other time since he strode onto the political stage. And since we know the Donald loves nothing more than winning, that tells you something by itself. His speeches have become loftier, more uplifting, his rhetoric centering more around prospects for the future instead of grievances about the past. He has clearly adopted the stance of a Reagan-style happy warrior more than during his previous two campaigns for the White House. His recent maneuver atMcDonald’s,designed to embarrass Harris and her unverifiable claim that she worked at America’s favorite restaurant, revealed a comfortable and enduring connection between the New York billionaire and everyday Americans. A Contrasting Vision In the starkest of contrasts, Harris’s campaign of joy and vibes has transformed to pure dystopia. Unable to present a clear or compelling vision of what her presidency would look like or how she can reverse the economic and cultural decline of her own current administration, she has been reduced to scaring the bejesus out of the American people by projecting dark images of a fallen democracy if Trump returns to the Oval Office. That did not work for Hillary Clinton and her immensely damaging characterization of Trump voters as a basket of deplorables and irredeemables. It is likely to be even less effective this time around since Trump already served for four years without becoming the dictator Harris says he would be if he becomes the 47th president. Even many prominent Democrats have observed that Harris’ decline in October coincided with her pivot from a positive campaign to panicking voters about her opponent. Joe Biden finally let the cat out of the bag with his recent remark about Trump, saying that 'we need to lock him up.' The left has expended countless time and treasure trying to do exactly that. And while the fast-fading president tried to backtrack and say he didn’t mean what he had just said, it presented as what many call a Washington-style gaffe, meaning he was accidentally telling the truth. It is clear now, if it wasn’t before, that the Harris campaign has become convinced their candidate cannot win on her own merits. A remarkable reality is that, unlike the relentless legal warfare conducted on the watch of Biden and Harris, Trump as president did not target or attempt to imprison any of his numerous sworn enemies. So Harris is engaging in projection, a specialty on the left, meaning that she is projecting onto her opponent the very things encouraged by her own administration. But just in time for the final stage of the campaign, prompted by a savage hit piece inThe Atlantic, Harris has taken to calling Trump a fascist. And true to form, the scurrilous piece became news by itself, enabling other left-wing platforms to double down by referring to it in their naked pursuit of a Harris presidency. Richard Nixon, nothing if not an astute politician, once opined that when a campaign is focused solely on stopping a particular candidate, the person they are trying to stop will win. Essentially, the 37th president suggested that, if the only thing a candidate can do to win is warn about the horrors of their opponent, they will fail. Hillary Clinton learned that the hard way in 2016. But Harris appears to have nothing else left in her quiver. Exhibit A in her now singularly dystopian campaign is that she will make her final pitch to voters on Tuesday at the same venue where Trump famously spoke on 1/6/21, the Washington Ellipse, presumably in a last-ditch effort to frighten the electorate out of pulling the lever for her opponent. How effective will her 'threat to democracy'strategyprove to be? We can’t be sure, but it appears that ship has sailed, with even the most left-wing newspaper in the nation’s capital releasing a poll showing Trump outdistancing Harris on the question of who would do a better job handling threats to democracy in the US. If that’s true, the Harris tank is all but empty. The Schedule Tells All A candidate’s schedule is always the most revealing about how their campaign views the race. If Trump was insecure about winning, he would not have expended valuable campaign time to visit deep-blue California to boost the prospects of a Republican House candidate. He would not spend time in the reliably blue Bronx or New Jersey – or hold Sunday’s rally at Madison Square Garden. He would not show up at bodegas, barber shops, and union meetings pressing the flesh with small groups of voters. With his seemingly bottomless cup of energy, he is still crisscrossing the critical Rust Belt and Sun Belt states, but if he appeared to be losing, he would spend every waking moment there, which, outside of mostly friendly interviews, is exactly what Harris is doing. It should not be surprising that the campaign has come to this for Harris. She bombed out and never made it to the starting line in her own generously funded presidential campaign in 2019 because she had no coherent message. Four years later, her lack of clarity and propensity for dodging direct questions with indecipherable word salads is typified by her recent response to a question from CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Asked why her proposed programs to boost the economy and lower prices with taxpayer-funded schemes to give money to new homeowners and small businesses, and using the federal government to stop 'price-gouging,' were not accomplished in the almost four years of her current administration, she replied, 'Well there was a lot that was done but there’s more to do, Anderson. I’m pointing out things that need to be done that haven’t been done that need to be done.' A Trump and Congressional Trifecta? The consequences of Harris’s wavering campaign are not limited to the presidential race. As usual, the down-ballot effect is unmistakable. By most accounts, the VP has received multiple appeals – 'thanks, but no thanks' – not to appear alongside candidates in competitive House races or swing-state Senate contests. To further accentuate the point, as their once-comfortable leads tighten to the point of turning into toss-ups, incumbent Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, plus Ellissa Slotkin, vying for an open seat in Michigan, have actually run ads highlighting their agreement with Trump on issues where Democrats fear any connection to Harris or Biden. Casey brags that 'he bucked Biden to protect fracking and he’s fighting with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating.' Baldwin’s ad boasts that 'Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill,' while Slotkin proclaims that she 'wrote a law signed by President Trump forcing drug companies to show their actual prices.' For Harris operatives, the reaction to these Senate candidates tying themselves to Trump – while not once mentioning Harris – must have been something along the lines of … ugh. With West Virginia all but certain to go red after incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin retired, and GOP challenger Tim Sheehy holding a big lead over Jon Tester in Montana (eight points in theReal Clear Politicsaverage), the barn door already appears closed on Democrats sustaining their current slim majority in the Senate. Now it has become a matter of how many seats the Democrats can protect. The possibility of a 53- or 54-seat Republican majority appears realistic. The GOP already holds a narrow majority in the House, and while limited polling is available in the 30 or so races considered competitive, 'ticket-splitting' by voters who support Trump but also the Democratic House candidate would appear to be their best hope for winning control of the lower chamber. But as PBS has reported, 'Split-ticket voters —people who vote for candidates from different parties — are increasingly rare in modern American politics.' For what it’s worth, according toPolitico, some seven weeks ago, when Trump was trailing, 'House Speaker Mike Johnson told other Republicans … that he is ‘100 percent’ convinced the GOP will win both chambers of Congress and the White House.' If Kamala Harris cannot change the current trajectory of the presidential race, Donald Trump and Republicans stand a better-than-even shot of winning the trifecta – control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Should that come to pass, a Trump second-term agenda will have a relatively unobstructed path to achieving the major change a majority of Americans say they desire.

Georgia’s Crisis: Disputed Election Reveals Putin’s Power Struggl...	Georgia is at the center of a political and geopolitical confrontation, with allegations of electoral fraud fueled by suspicions of pro-Russian interference. While President Salome Zurabishvili denounces vote rigging, imprisoned pro-European former President Mikheil Saakashvili calls for mobilization to protect the country’s European future. This crisis raises crucial questions for Europe and its eastern borders. It’s a 'stolen election' and a 'constitutional coup,' the opposition claims. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, pro-Western and at odds with the government but without real power, protested against the 'total falsification' of the election by a 'Russian operation.' Imprisoned for three years after a sham trial, the pro-European reformist former president Mikheil Saakashvili calls from his cell for 'massive demonstrations' to 'show the world that we are fighting for freedom.' Ballot-box stuffing, vote-buying, voter intimidation and, above all, a profoundly unfair campaign, the Georgian Dream, the misnamed state party created by pro-Russian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose personal fortune accounts for at least a quarter of the gross domestic product (GDP) of this small trans-Caucasian ex-Soviet republic of 3.7 million people, spared no expense to ensure victory. Throughout the campaign, he denounced what he called 'the world war party,' meaning the West. Voting for the pro-European opposition is to risk ending up like Ukraine,' hammered the party that has ruled Georgia unchallenged for twelve years. Its posters showed the ruins of Ukrainian cities to suggest what might happen if the pro-Europeans won. They made every effort to make voting difficult, if not impossible, for a diaspora largely supportive of joining the EU. The results of the vote are all the more surprising because in the early hours of the morning, the projections gave a large lead to the opposition, whose four components had finally managed to form a united front after years of division. Putin Accused of Stealing Georgia’s Future 'Europe can and must prevent the Putinists from robbing the Georgians of their European future, because this vote will also have consequences for the Western world,' stresses Thornike Gordadzé, lecturer at Sciences-Po, associate researcher at the Jacques Delors Institute and former Georgian Minister for European Integration (2010-2012). What is at stake in Tbilisi directly affects Europeans because it could determine the eastern borders of the European Union. And Russia is on the offensive. In Moldova, a week earlier, the choice of Europe came down to a handful of votes in a referendum that polls had shown to be a foregone conclusion. In Georgia, the ruling party won, officially with 53%, but with obvious fraud. Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), NATO, and EU bodies described the vote as 'marred by inequalities [between candidates], pressure, and tension. Georgians, especially the youngest and most dynamic segments of society, starting with the cities, where two-thirds of Georgians live, dream of Europe. The tens of thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets of the capital a week before the vote bear witness to this. The government is well aware of this desire for Europe and has long maintained an ambiguous stance, with statements such as 'We want Europe, but at our own pace and with respect for Georgian specifics, with the very conservative, illiberal and pro-Russian Hungarian leader Viktor Orban as our model'. EU Accession Process Blocked Despite Georgia’s recognition as a candidate country last spring, a year after Ukraine and Moldova, the authorities are making every effort to obstruct the process. In May, the country was rocked by mass demonstrations against a law on 'foreign influence,' inspired by Russia’s 'foreign agents' legislation, which has been used to crush civil society. Brussels immediately froze the country’s accession to the European Union (EU), and the United States imposed sanctions on Georgian officials. With these largely rigged elections in favor of Ivanishvili and his party, the Kremlin appears poised to achieve in Georgia what it is trying to impose by force of arms in Ukraine. There are many similarities between the fates of these two former Soviet republics. Georgians and Ukrainians swept away pro-Russian governments with the 'Rose Revolution' in Tbilisi in 2003 and the 'Orange Revolution' in Kyiv in 2004. Both represented an open challenge to Vladimir Putin in what Russia considers its 'near abroad' and zone of influence. Kyiv and Tbilisi jointly applied for NATO membership at the Bucharest Summit in June 2008, with the support of George W. Bush, who even visited Georgia in 2005. Opposition from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel derailed the attempt. Moscow Still Controls 20% of Georgia’s Territory The 2008 compromise stated in official documents that Ukraine and Georgia would join 'one day,' without setting dates or detailed commitments. This was the worst-case scenario, as it gave Putin a direct incentive to act preemptively, which he did two months later by attacking recalcitrant Georgian regions in August 2008. Since then, Moscow still controls 20% of Georgian territory in the hands of the self-proclaimed separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Bidzina Ivanishvili’s party finally defeated reformist leader Mikheil Saakashvili in the 2012 elections. In Ukraine, too, the pro-Russian government regained power before being swept aside by the Maidan Revolution in 2014 because it refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union and was preparing to sign one with Putin. The Georgian issue has an obvious geopolitical dimension for Russia and the European Union. With its gateway to the Black Sea, Georgia is an essential link in the corridor that allows Central Asia and Azerbaijan to transport their exports—including hydrocarbons—to European markets without depending on Moscow. Georgia’s connection to Europe is also vital to Armenia and its government, which is attempting a bold pivot to the West after losing the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. On September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan wiped the Republic of Artsakh off the map in a lightning military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter battle for control of Nagorno-Karabakh. While Armenia triumphed in the first war, Azerbaijan, like a shrewd strategist, has patiently consolidated its position, gaining strength and influence on the international stage. Last year, Armenia lost its ultimate geopolitical leverage, leaving it completely at the mercy of Turkey and Azerbaijan. For Moscow, control of the Trans-Caucasus is all the more strategic because it provides territorial continuity with its Iranian ally. Orban’s Support The Europeans have little room for maneuver. Closing the door on Georgia’s accession would be a victory for Moscow’s strategy of intimidation. Sanctions would only punish the Georgian population, which lives from hand to mouth. Nevertheless, it is possible to imagine personal sanctions against Ivanishvili, who has considerable assets in Europe and holds a French passport. One thing is certain: the indecisiveness and ambiguity of Western messages can only encourage Moscow to interfere more and more in Georgia, and a clear, coherent voice is urgently needed. All the more so since the pro-Russian regime also enjoys support within the European Union, starting with Hungary’s illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who hailed the 'crushing victory of the Georgian dream.' His country holds the EU presidency this semester, and he was in Tbilisi on October 28 for a two-day visit. This provocation comes at a time when the President of the European Council is urging the Georgian election authorities to 'investigate' 'irregularities.' Washington is also calling for an investigation into fraud. But these responses remain inadequate. Georgia is a test case for the West. On November 3, Moldovan voters go to the polls for the second round of a presidential election that promises to be very close, and Russia is on the offensive, notably through a relentless information war denounced in Moldova by outgoing President Maia Sandu and in Georgia by Salome Zourabichvili.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz_nYK1so0SVc	2024-10-29T16:42:58-07:00	
Mali And Algeria Feud Over How To Handle Tuareg Rebellion	Tensions between Algeria and Mali are growing over how to resolve Mali’s ongoing Tuareg rebellion, which has continued for more than a decade. Algeria supports a negotiated settlement that addresses the rebels’ concerns and builds off a 2015 agreement. Mali’s ruling junta favors a military response. 'Algeria fears that these escalating tensions could lead to a successful Tuareg separatist movement, which would inspire marginalized ethnic groups across Algeria, Niger and Libya to pursue autonomy,' analyst Assala Khettache wrote recently for the Royal United Services Institute. 'A Tuareg breakaway in Mali could potentially destabilize an already fragile Sahel region, with Algeria’s southern borders especially vulnerable.' The Algeria-Mali relationship has degraded over the past year as Mali’s junta has accused Algeria of interfering in its internal affairs by meeting with rebels. In December 2023, both countries recalled their ambassadors. Algeria has led efforts to mediate peace between Malian leaders and the Tuareg groups. This mediation produced the 2015 Algiers Accords between the former Malian government and the Tuareg Coordination of Azawad Movements. 'Algeria strongly supported the 2015 peace agreement and attempted to salvage the deal in December 2023 due to fears that renewed hostilities in Mali would mobilize the Tuareg population in Algeria and cause refugees to flee into Algeria,' analyst Liam Karr wrote recently for the Institute for the Study of War. Mali’s ruling junta has accused Algeria of harboring rebels. In January 2024, the junta ended Mali’s participation in the Algiers Accords as it ramped up attacks on rebels. In July, Mali’s military, backed by Russian mercenaries with Africa Corps (formerly the Wagner Group), were ambushed by Tuareg rebels while en route to attack the Malian side of Tinzaouaten, a community that straddles the border with Algeria. The ambush by the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security and Development killed dozens of Malian soldiers and Russian mercenaries. Although the exact number of dead remains in dispute, observers consider the fight to be the deadliest encounter for Russia’s mercenary group since it arrived in Mali in 2021. 'The ambush brought Algeria’s security concerns to the forefront, exposing the fragility of its borders and deepening its diplomatic dilemma over how to counter Russian-backed forces in the Sahel without jeopardizing its crucial relationship with Moscow,' Khettache wrote. Mali and its Russian allies followed up a month later with a drone attack on the community that killed 20 civilians and prompted a war of words between Algeria and Mali at the United Nations. Tinzaouaten has been a base for both Tuareg rebels and Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, the Sahelien branch of al-Qaida, since the two groups expelled the Malian military in 2012. The Tinzaouaten ambush and follow-up drone attack became another flashpoint in the relationship between the two nations even as they have both welcomed Russian influence — Algeria directly through long-standing ties with Moscow; Mali through its 2021 invitation to Africa Corps. Despite their common ties with Russia, Algeria’s opposition to the Africa Corps means it is unlikely to help Mali put down its rebellion by force, Karr noted. That enables rebels to retreat across the porous border with Algeria to outlast and outmaneuver Malian forces, he added. Algeria has called on the U.N. to demand an end to mercenary presence in Mali. However, Russia is unlikely to remove them because they have become a key tool for exerting influence in the Sahel, according to Karr. 'Mali is a vital piece in the Kremlin’s strategic ambitions in Africa,' he added. 'Mali is also a crucial partner for Russia’s broader political project in the Sahel.' Moscow’s continued support for Africa Corps in Mali could strain its ties with Algeria and force Algeria to rethink its preference for settling conflicts with diplomacy, according to observers. 'As tensions rise, Algeria faces the delicate task of balancing its critical partnership with Russia while considering whether military intervention in Mali is necessary to safeguard its interests,' Khettache wrote.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz0ZWHIOukhKO	2024-10-29T16:41:33-07:00	
Houthis Attack Ashkelon, Ships Off Yemeni Coast	By Saeed Al-Batati Yemen’s Houthi militia said on Tuesday it launched drones at the Israeli city of Ashkelon a day after claiming to have attacked several ships in international waters off Yemen. In a statement, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said drones were launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, claiming they 'successfully' struck their target, and vowing to carry out more attacks until Israel ends its military operations in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Israeli media reported explosions in Ashkelon and in Nahariya caused by another drone fired from Lebanon. The Israeli military said the drone launched from Yemen landed in a 'open area' in Ashkelon. 'Following an initial examination regarding the UAV that fell in an open area in Ashkelon in southern Israel earlier today, it was determined that the UAV was launched from Yemen,' it said in a statement. Previous Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israel triggered two waves of retaliatory airstrikes by Israeli warplanes, which struck power stations, ports, and fuel storage facilities in the western city of Hodeidah, which the Houthis control, in July and September. Sarea said in a broadcast on Monday night the Houthis also attacked three ships in the Arabian Sea, Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait, the latest in a series of attacks on maritime trade in a campaign the group claims is in support of the people of Palestine and Lebanon. He identified the ships as the SC Montreal, which was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea, the Maersk Kowloon, which was attacked with a cruise missile while sailing in the Red Sea, and the Motaro, which was attacked in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait with multiple ballistic missiles. The three ships were targeted because their parent companies violated a ban on sailing to Israeli ports, Sarea said. All three ships are Liberian-flagged vessels. The SC Montreal is sailing from the Seychelles to Oman. The Maersk Kowloon is sailing from Oman to an unknown destination, and the Motaro from Russia to China. The Houthi statement came hours after the UK Maritime Trade Operations, an agency that documents ship attacks, reported on Monday that the master of the Motaro, sailing 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha town on the Red Sea, reported three explosions at various intervals near the ship, but that the vessel and its crew were safe. The Joint Maritime Information Center identified the attacked ship as the M/V Motaro, 'on transit' from Ust Luga in Russia to Shanghai, adding that the ship had no connection to Israel, the US, or the UK, and it could have been attacked because another ship owned by the same company visited Israel. 'Indirectly (through multiple layers), within the ownership structure, JMIC has discovered a subsidiary linkage to a vessel visiting an Israeli port in the recent past,' the JMIC said. Since November, the Houthis have seized a commercial ship — the Galaxy Leader — and its crew, sunk two others, and set fire to several more, firing hundreds of ballistic missiles, drones, and drone boats at civilian and naval ships in the group’s campaign. Critics dispute the Houthi claims of support for the Palestinians or Lebanon, arguing that the beleaguered militia used the conflict to recruit new fighters, increase public support, deploy forces in contested areas, and silence voices calling on the Houthis to repair crumbling services and pay public employees.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz_Vg2C1-Hqi8	2024-10-29T16:40:39-07:00	
Inside The CIA’s (Largely) Secret Role In The Tibetan Resistance ...	By Tenzin Pema, Dorjee Damdul, Passang Dhonden, and Lobsang Gelek High up in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, at 9,200 feet, lies Camp Hale – widely known as the birthplace of backcountry skiing and the training grounds of the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division soldiers who fought the Nazis in World War II. Lesser known, however, is the camp’s storied past as the CIA-operated secret training facility for Tibetan resistance fighters in the early 1960’s. The Tibetan fighters who trained there – from 1958 to 1964 – were a part of a nationwide armed resistance movement in Tibet against Communist China. Sixty years after the end of the operation, Camp Hale has yielded a new secret. Called 'The Ranch' by the CIA and fondly referred to as 'Dumra,' or garden, by the Tibetans, it was the training ground for at least 259 Tibetan fighters who were then parachuted back into Tibet and what is today Nepal to aid the Tibetan resistance against China. Yet, until recently the exact location of the CIA’s training facility for Tibetans was lost to history. Quite like the story of Tibet’s armed resistance against China and the CIA’s role in it, it had remained shrouded in secrecy for many decades. Decades after the CIA dismantled Camp Hale, leaving no trace of the site— save for a few ruins of bunkers— the original footprint of the Tibetan training camp was finally identified in 2024 within the 53,804-acre expanse of alpine valley, thanks to the work of a dogged academic, a local hiker, and a former CIA trainer. In June, the families of former fighters, their supporters, and the Central Tibetan Administration’s Cabinet Minister for Security, Gyari Dolma, gathered to honor the resistance movement. Bruce Walker, now 91, is the last surviving CIA case officer out of about 30 officers who trained the Tibetan fighters at Camp Hale. 'I’m the last speaking CIA officer who can tell the story,' Walker told Radio Free Asia in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the June commemoration ceremony. His tale of the time spent there reveals the spirit of a people deeply committed to their cause who drew on a wellspring of grit, ingenuity and ability to learn the skills Camp Hale had to offer. Finding Dumra Following the People’s Liberation Army’s invasion of Tibet in 1949, thousands of ordinary Tibetans rose up in a series of independent uprisings in the 1950s to defend their country and religion against Chinese troops. In 1958, the Chushi Gangdruk army, a unified resistance force, was formally established. Led by Gompo Tashi Andrugtsang, a charismatic trader living in Lhasa, it later became known as the Chushi Gangdruk Tensung Danglang Magar or Tibetan National Volunteer Defence Army, a name it was given by a tutor to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In 1960, they set up a base in Mustang, then a small kingdom in Nepal, where they were exiled, until they were eventually forced to lay down their arms in 1974. For a large part of this period, the movement received covert financial support and training from the CIA, with four contingents of Tibetan troops flown in to train at Camp Hale from 1958 to 1964. Yet it was a secret even to those who lived nearby the Colorado training grounds. 'The local community here in Colorado still don’t know the Tibetan history of Camp Hale – much in the same way that the Tibetan community still don’t know much of the history of Chushi Gangdruk or CIA in Camp Hale,' said Carole McGranahan, an anthropologist and scholar of Tibet who spent years working to locate the site. Indeed, a false story was circulated at the time to maintain the secrecy of the training site and keep the locals at bay. 'Atom Unit Making Tests Near Leadville,' read a headline from the Denver Post in July 1959, after the press was informed that the Defense Atomic Support Agency would soon be conducting atomic testing programs at Camp Hale. 'I like to think of it now as that it was hidden in plain sight,' said McGranahan, noting how the CIA maintained the secrecy of the camp for over four decades. Word of the camp and the CIA’s role in training Tibetan fighters there only began to trickle out in the early 2000s following the declassification ofa 1964-dated CIA memorandum. A documentary released just before, titled Shadow Circus: The CIA in Tibet, by filmmakers Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin, also drew attention to the Tibetan resistance movement, even as additional details began to emerge from books, such McGranahan’s Arrested Histories, and interviews of former CIA trainers. Still, the site itself continued to remain hidden. In 2010, a plaque was installed to mark the U.S. government’s first public acknowledgment of the CIA-Tibet training camp. But even then, the exact location of the training site was unknown. Following a ceremony to mark its installation, retired CIA officers and former Tibetan fighters went looking for the original Camp Hale training grounds. The group included Roger McCarthy and Ken Knauss, the two CIA officers who had worked on the original campaign. But they came back frustrated and dismayed that they couldn’t locate the site where they had lived and worked for several years, McGranahan said. She promised to make it her mission to locate the original site. It would take years, but true to her word, McGranahan, with the help of Vail Valley local resident and hiker Tracy Walters, took on the mission. The duo took with them old photographs of Camp Hale and, while snowshoeing, matched the 1963-1964 photos to the current landscape by carefully aligning specific ridgelines to locate Dumra. In February 2024, they found the first location – rather easily, McGranahan says. 'The second one was more difficult,' she added, explaining that it required matching up the visual angles of old photographs to the physical topography of the land until they hit on the right spot. 'But we found it,' she said. She then turned to Walker and to filmmakers Sonam and Sarin for final confirmation on whether the site they had located was indeed Dumra. Walker, who was the only Tibetan-speaking CIA trainer from 1960 until the CIA shut the site in 1964, responded the very next day. 'You nailed it,' he wrote. 'You found the site. And I’m the one who took those photographs.' An operation misunderstood? Along with his wife and few friends, Walker came to Camp Hale from California in June to honor the Tibetan soldiers who he trained in the covert operation which the CIA code-named ST Circus. Now an elegant white-haired nonagenarian, Walker lit up as he recalled his time working on ST Circus, his voice filled with energy as he explained the backstory of the secret mission and smiling fondly as he recalled the commitment of the Tibetan fighters whom he had trained. 'The covert operation was misunderstood in some respects… [there’s] the impression that the Americans in the CIA were taking advantage of the Tibetans. We were not,' Walker told RFA Tibetan. 'Tibetans in the 1950s and 60s had very few international friends… in the late 1950s, the American government and the CIA were the few from the international community that were willing to come to the aid of the Tibetans,' he said. Indeed, the CIA would support the movement with training, aid, and arms until the early 1970s. 'We did what we could to get them their aid. We were not going to send an army and we were not going to send tanks, but we tried to send help to Chushi Gangdruk to fight and to make progress in the rest of the country,' said Walker. At Camp Hale, over a dozen CIA case officers trained Tibetan fighters on a full range of combat and operations skills. 'This site was specifically used for the purpose of training radio teams who would be parachuted back to Tibet to join the resistance forces and to send back messages about the situation – the resistance inside Tibet – on a real-time basis,' Walker told RFA Tibetan. Over the years, the soldiers who trained there were air dropped into Tibet and in Mustang, Nepal, where they aided and trained the thousands of resistance fighters stationed at those locations. It was actually not the first site for ST Circus. Earlier, the CIA had piloted the project with a group of fighters who were trained at Saipan, Northern Mariana Island. The first radio team to be dropped back into Tibet by Operations St Circus took place in September, 1957 – but the training grounds were moved to Camp Hale when it became apparent that the Tibetans were not used to the hot weather conditions of the island, and Colorado was selected because its terrain and weather conditions resembled that of Tibet. Life at Camp Hale Walker’s first assignment with the Tibetan project had been as a caretaker and cook for six weeks for the small contingent of Tibetans who trained at Saipan. He first arrived in Camp Hale as a case officer in April 1960, but he would not be at the camp on a permanent basis until two years later, after the CIA sent him for periods of more language training. Sporting a red beard and looking like an 'adventurous American', Walker returned to Camp Hale in September 1962, where he found the site had been renovated with new quarters added and ready to open its doors to the fourth and final batch of trainees who arrived in October that year. The camp had four classrooms, one recreation room, one staff barracks, one administration office, a gym, a mess hall, and a storage room. The Tibetan fighters had a rigorous training program there. 'It was a very busy campus,' Walker recalled, with the trainees always 'practicing one thing or another, or they were in the classrooms.' It was a huge time of learning for Walker too. 'I started out as a case officer who was not speaking Tibetan, giving instruction and compass reading to find locations on a very special map made by the CIA,' he said. He eventually gained enough proficiency to communicate directly with the trainees. 'It was a very different career change in speaking a different language to an entirely different people who I had never met before,' he reflected. The Tibetans were trained in radio operation; surveillance and combat maneuvers; parachuting at Fort Carson, another military base in Colorado; intelligence collecting; clandestine exchange of written material and film; world history and geography; and small armament training with bazookas, grenades and rifles. 'All were given training with the M1-Garand rifle, and the old 10th mountain division rifle range. Two marine sharpshooters were seconded to this project and they also gave the Tibetans instructions in self defense and jiu jitsu,' Walker said. Walker and the other CIA officers admired the Tibetan fighters, who had volunteered for the movement and had been recruited as exiles in India. They represented Tibetans from all over Tibet and came with varying backgrounds; they even included monks who had temporarily given up their vows to fight for the Tibet cause. 'They were not paid. They were simply willing and able… And boy, were they able,' said Walker. They were also quick learners, he recalled. 'They were enthusiastic, they listened, and they took to the training immediately. Above all, they were happy to be here... And it was a real pleasure to work with them in that respect because they made it easier for us to get to know them and to try to accomplish through the training,' he added. Tibetan curiosity, resilience The CIA officers were amazed by the Tibetan curiosity and ability to invent solutions to problems with the materials at hand, said Walker. There was one instance, where the fighters had reportedly made a portable rocket, apparently out of a wooden trough, using gunpowder, homemade napalm, and a small warhead, he said, citing a local Vail Daily report. The Tibetans also had a natural gift for volleyball and engaged in highly competitive tournaments. On weekends, movies would be projected in the recreation room and headquarters would send new movies on a rotation basis. The Tibetans, without any surprise, liked western movies. But their favorite was The King and I. 'Their response was a pure delight to watch,' Walker said. They also had a 'remarkable talent' for drawing, Walker said. Crayons and colored pens were made available for drawing and few of their drawings became collectibles, including an illustration that a Tibetan fighter had made representing Chinese desecration of Tibetan culture and religion which was used in CIA material. On Saturday nights, the Tibetans took over the kitchen from the CIA cooks Joe and Bill, and would make Tibetan dishes like momo and shabaley. But they didn’t (strictly) stick to this routine. One day, a shepherd from the area — who had a longstanding agreement with the government for him to traverse Camp Hale with his sheep as he led them to summer pastureland — found one sheep missing when he returned with the sheep after a month of their grazing. 'His route happened to go directly past the Tibetan compound. Not wanting to cause suspicion by denying the shepherd his annual drive, we arranged for the compound to close up tightly, presumably with everyone inside the compound and out of sight,' said Walker. Upon his return, having led his herd through the compound and out of Camp Hale, the herder soon counted his sheep and found he was missing one. 'He reported his loss to army authorities and the situation was brought to our attention. We had no recourse but to suggest the sheep must have drifted from the herd, gone astray and could not be found,' Walker said. 'Somehow we found out that two Tibetans had waylaid the sheep and later roasted it and brought it into the compound for the fellow Tibetans to eat. The herder was angry and unsatisfied but as far as we were concerned, it was out of sight, out of mind.' Best and bravest In 1960, part of the training was to practice parachute landing in advance of being airdropped in Tibet. However, aftera U.S. civilian pilot was shot down over Russiain May 1960, President Eisenhower banned further overflights into Tibet. Thereafter, the radio teams and the support teams were flown back to Thailand, and over land to border posts in India and Nepal, including Mustang. Walker acknowledged the grim reality that awaited these men upon their return to Tibet. 'They knew what would be the consequences if they were parachuted to Tibet,' Walker said somberly. 'A lot of the Tibetans who were trained on the radio teams that were parachuted in gave their lives. They were captured. Some of them went to jail, and a few of them were released, in time,' he said. 'But there were a lot of heroes — as this will attest — who sacrificed their lives as Tibetans.' An important legacy The training program at Camp Hale was closed in 1964 as the U.S. began to take a more conciliatory approach to China. CIA support for the Tibetan resistance movement ended altogether in the early 1970s as the Nixon administration took an approach of engagement with Mao’s Communist regime. Along with increased pressure from the Nepali government, which also began to cultivate warmer ties with China and internal fissures that emerged within the movement itself, the Chushi Gangdruk was forced to lay down its arms by 1974. Though the program wound down, a legacy, including crucial successes, came from the Operation ST Circus trainings that has significance today, even if the resistance movement ultimately did not achieve independence. For example, the first radio team ever trained as part of the CIA operation at Saipan – two fighters, Athar Norbu and Gatsetsang Lotse (codenamed Tom and Luke, respectively) – were airdropped in September 1957. The team, known as Team A, were able to contact local Chushi Gangdruk members in Kham, eastern Tibet, and reach Lhasa, making contact with Tibetan leaders such as the Lord Chamberlain, Thupten Phalha. As explained by Gyolo Thondup in his book The Noodle Maker of Kalimpong, the Dalai Lama was not directly involved in the CIA operations, as it was impossible for him to condone any use of violence when his entire life was committed to nonviolent Buddhist practice. But some high-ranking officials such as Lord Chamberlain Phalha knew about the resistance from the beginning and were sympathetic to its cause. 'It was Phalha who organized the Dalai Lama’s escape... Team A accompanied the Dalai Lama on his journey to the Indian border from where they radioed CIA Langley that the Dalai Lama had arrived safely,' said Walker. In the Dalai Lama’s personal autobiography titled My Land, My People, the spiritual leader acknowledged the bravery of the Tibetan freedom fighters who accompanied him undercover into exile in 1959. 'In spite of my beliefs, I very much admired their courage and their determination to carry on the grim battle they had started for our freedom, culture, and religion,' he wrote. 'I thanked them for their strength and bravery, and also, more personally, for the protection they had given me.' The Dalai Lama’s escape into exile and the role the Chushi Gangdruk played in his safe escort from Lhasa to India is till today regarded as the movement’s most significant achievement.Today, plans are afoot to build a memorial on the now-rediscovered exact training ground. The plaque that was installed in 2010 stands not too far away, its inscription attesting to the bravery of those involved: From 1958 to 1964, Camp Hale played an important role as a training site for Tibetan Freedom Fighters. Trained by the CIA, many of these brave men lost their lives in the struggle for freedom. ‘They were the best and bravest of their generation, and we wept together when they were killed fighting alongside their countrymen.’ (Orphans of the Cold War, by John Kenneth Knaus). This plaque is dedicated to their memory. Standing by the plaque, at the site he’d played a part in re-discovering and which brought back so many memories, Walker mused over the friendships gained and lost to history. 'It was an emotional parting because we became very good friends with the Tibetans and they with us. We bonded, and we were sorry that we had to break it up the way we did,' he said.

Voiceless Guam Feels ‘Injustice’ Of US Presidential Non-Vote	By Mar-Vic Cagurangan Voters in the U.S. territory of Guam will be the country’s first to cast their choice for president on Nov. 5 but it will be a symbolic and democratically meaningless exercise. As the mainland gets to have its say on who will be president, an anomaly in U.S. law means Guamanians are among the four million disenfranchised Americans living in U.S. territories whose vote doesn’t count. Politics is a hot topic on the streets of the capital Haganta – which lies 8,000 miles from Washington and 2,500 miles from Beijing – as they will pick a governor, local legislature and a non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives next week. Right at the bottom of their two-page ballot form, residents can also mark a box for their preferred presidential candidate. Sample ballot paper for Haganta for the Nov. 5 election with the straw poll question on presidential candidates at the end. [Guam Election Commission] Bearing the slogan 'Where America’s Day Begins,' Guam is 14 hours ahead of Washington time and this straw poll is considered a strong indicator of how the rest of the nation will vote. Guamanians who relocate to the mainland automatically acquire full-fledged American status in a perplexing political anomaly that creates two classes of U.S citizenship. 'Compared to only doing a mock vote back home, I feel it’s a privilege to actually be able to vote,' said Zita T. Winemiller, a retired journalist who moved to Jonesboro, Arkansas in 2017. 'Guam and all the other U.S. territories should really be a part of the voting process and included in decisions affecting all U.S. citizens,' she told BenarNews. Since the first presidential straw poll in 1980, when Guam voted for Jimmy Carter over the winner Ronald Reagan, it has reflected the mainland result, except again in2016 when they voted forHillary Clintonahead ofDonald Trump. Seven presidents have visited the territory, but mostly as a pitstop en-route to Asia, including Richard Nixon during his historic trip to China in 1972. People who live on the mainland and move back to Guam again become disenfranchised. 'I have always felt the emotional injustice,' said Ginger Cruz, the Democrats' candidate for Guam’s non-voting delegate in Washington. She returned in 2019 after living in the mainland for many years and is campaigning for Guam to have greater oversight from the White House. 'Presidential elections have a major impact on Guam. Given that two of the three legs of our economy are federally funded and everything we dois subject to federal law, we are highly impacted by presidential policies,' Cruz said. While territorial delegates can introduce bills and advocate for their territory in the U.S. Congress, they have no voice on the floor. Guam was colonized by the Spanish 1688 and ceded to the U.S. in 1898. Efforts since the 1990s to hold a non-binding plebiscite for Guamanians to choose between independence, statehood or free association with the U.S. have been struck down by the courts.It is one of 17 non-self-governing territories on the U.N.’s decolonization list. While Guam is exempted from paying the U.S. federal income tax, many argue that such a waiver does not make up for what the tiny island brings to the table. The territory is a lynchpin in the superpower’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region and the population of 153,000 has one of the nation’s highest military enlistment rates per capita. Often referred to as the 'tip of the U.S. military spear', due to its proximity to China, the Department of Defence owns one-third of Guam lands. The territory is home to major air force, naval and army bases, five fast-attack submarines, and is awaiting about 5,000 Marines being relocated from Okinawa in Japan. Another legal contradiction is mainland Americans – including military personnel – who live in foreign countries can cast presidential absentee ballots, but not if they reside in a U.S. territory. Joyce McClure, a former New York State resident, relocated to Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2015 and voted by absentee ballot in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. national elections. 'I am proud to say I have never missed an election in 56 years, a period during which I have lived in seven different states, one foreign country and one territory,' McClure told BenarNews. She relocated to the U.S. territory and 'as a Guam resident, I voted in the 2022 Guam elections.' McClure moved back to the states last year and has just cast her mail-in ballot for president from her current home in Virginia. Guamanians who live abroad are able to cast absentee votes in their local elections. 'My son, grandchildren and sisters, nieces and nephews are still in Guam. I will always be interested in what goes on there,' said Berni Penaflor, now a resident of Washington State voting for president for the third time since moving in 2014. Other U.S. territories also affected by the law in the Pacific include neighboring Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa, along with U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean. Voter participation in Guam’s elections has dropped from above 70 percent in 2014 to 40 percent in the 2022 poll for the delegate to the House of Representatives.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHzwWlBfkq6SaY	2024-10-29T16:37:27-07:00	
US Reiterates ‘One China’ Policy Amid Reports Of Xi’s Request On ...	By Patsy Widakuswara Resisting pressure from Beijing to publicly reject independence for Taiwan, the Biden administration underscores there is no change in its 'one China' policy which takes no stand on the issue. 'We do not support Taiwan independence. We expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion,' a senior administration official told VOA Tuesday, underscoring long-standing U.S. policy on the thorny issue. 'We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.' The confirmation followed reports thatduring their last in-person meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden to change the language the administration uses when discussing its position on Taiwan independence. On the sidelines of the APEC meeting near San Francisco last November, Xi reportedly told Biden he wants the U.S. to use language stating it 'opposes' instead of 'does not support' independence for Taiwan, the current phrase used in U.S. official statements. The administration has been 'consistent on our long-standing one China policy,' the official said. Under the policy, the U.S. acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan. It considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. Beijing’s push for stronger language is not new. Ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting last year, VOA reported that Foreign Minister Wang Yi also made the request in his meetings with U.S. counterparts. The Chinese have been asking for this shift, and in some instances falsely asserting that the U.S. position is to oppose Taiwanese independence, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'I find it unlikely that the United States will take this advice without some substantial concession from China on its own position about Taiwan,' Cooper told VOA. 'I doubt this will get any traction in Washington unless it is part of a longer-term conversation about de-escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.' Biden and Xi likely to meet again in person next month in South America, where both are expected to attend an APEC meeting in Lima, Peru, and a G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It will likely be Biden’s last meeting with the Chinese leader before leaving office in January. 'It will probably be an opportunity for the two leaders to say goodbye and for their teams to wrap up a couple of loose ends, perhaps including an announcement or two on people-to-people issues,' said Cooper. Beijing is no doubt gearing up for a change in U.S. administration ahead of the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Both have vowed to be tough on China, with Trump saying he would impose '150% to 200%' tariffs on China if it sought to blockade Taiwan. Flared tensions Cross-strait tensions have flared many times in recent years. On Sunday, Taiwan's defense ministry said Chinese warplanes and warships carried out another 'combat patrol' near the island, following Beijing’s threat to respond with countermeasures to a $2 billion arms sale by the United States. The administration announced it approved the package last week, which includes its first delivery of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, advanced weapons that have been battle-tested in Ukraine. Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and Washington is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself.

Can America’s ‘Self-Made’ Men Make A President? – OpEd	UBS, the giant Swiss private bank, has been tracking newcomers to the ranks of the world’s billionaire class for going on a decade now. The latest annual UBS count of the world’s new billionaires, released last November, announced a bit of history. For the first time ever, UBS noted, more people are now becoming billionaires via inheritance than through their own 'entrepreneurship.' This UBS revelation didn’t attract much public attention. But you can bet that plenty of billionaires noticed. The legitimacy of billionaire fortunes has always rested on the entrepreneurial myth our super rich invoke at every opportunity. Our brilliance, that myth goes, made us our billions. How dare any government make any move to tax away any significant chunk of our 'self-made' riches! The Biden administration has so dared, most notably by proposing a 'billionaire’s tax,' a levy that would have the holders of fortunes worth over $100 millionpaying taxesannually on the growth in the value of their financial assets, the bedrock of billionaire wealth. For the billionaire venture capitalist — and one-time Democrat — Marc Andreessen, that Biden tax proposal would be 'the final straw.' Andreessen has since thenjoinedthe pro-Trump ranks. But more than taxes have been driving high-tech movers and shakers to Trump. America’s tech-related fortunes all 'grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment,'notesJohn Naughton, a wealth analyst at the UK’s Open University. But activist regulators like Lina Kahn at the Biden administration’s Federal Trade Commission have of late beencancelingthe blank checks Big Tech has so enjoyed cashing. This new Biden-era federal refusal to automatically do Big Tech’s bidding has energized billionaires once content to pay relatively little attention to politics. Elon Musk has come to symbolize that new energy — and stands to gain the most from it. Trump has alreadypromisedto name Musk the head of a new 'government efficiency commission' he plans to create once back in the White House. That perch could easily give Musk the leverage he needs to swat away federal probes into his operations already underway in agencies ranging from theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administrationto theSecurities and Exchange Commission. Just how much are Donald Trump’s high-tech boosters now funneling into his campaign? We may never know for sure, given our contemporary 'dark money' scene. But we do havesome numberson the broader billionaire scene that can help us understand the overall political impact of fortunes built on everything from computer chips to poker chips. We know, for instance, that billionaire heiress Miriam Adelman, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has deposited $100 million into her Preserve America super PAC. Railroad heir Timothy Mellon has bestowed an even more stunning$150 millionupon his Make America Great Again PAC operation. Elon Musk — before October — had dumped some $75 million into his America PAC. Just-released filingsshowthat Musk added an additional $44 million into that PAC over the first half of October and another $2.3 million into the pro-Trump Sentinel Action Fund. What do all those millions buy? Plenty of ad time, of course, on TV and computer screens. But billionaires like Musk aren’t just buying eyeballs. They’re also doing their best to return America to the good old original Gilded Age days when our super rich couldsimply buywhatever votes they needed. Elon Musk has been leading the way to this brazen new vote-buying era. A little over two weeks before Election Day, Musk — 'thequintessentialrobber baron of America’s second Gilded Age' — began running daily lotteries open only to registered swing-state voters who signed a petition in support of free speech and the right to bear arms. The daily prize: $1 million. Paying people to induce them to vote or get registered,USA Todaypoints out, just happens to be 'an offense punishable by prison time,' and that legal prohibition holds for 'anything of monetary value like liquor or lottery chances,'holdsa U.S. Justice Department election-crimes manual. After four daily winners — and a warning from the Justice Department — Musk put his daily lottery prizeon hold. But if he should resume his lottery, the daily million-dollar prizes certainly won’t make much of a dent on Musk’s personal fortune. Musk ended October 23worth$237billion. Other pro-Trump billionaires, meanwhile, are devoting millions to the dayafterNovember 5. TheWall Street Journalearlier this weekrevealedthat a 'secretive network of GOP donors and conservative billionaires' has spent the years since the 2020 presidential election 'laying the groundwork for a more organized, better funded and far broader effort to contest the outcome.' Groups linked to billionaires like the Wisconsin shipping magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein and Hobby Lobby founder David Green, theJournalreports, 'have been scrutinizing voter registrations on an industrial scale and working to slow down the vote count' and 'bury local election officials in paperwork and lawsuits.' To add to the post-election chaos, theJournaladds, one of these billionaire-backed groups is even offering monetary rewards to 'anyone reporting election fraud or abuse.' Another Trump-boosting group, the EagleAI Network, is bombarding election officials with long lists of registered voters that it claims need investigating. These lists, charges Ben Hovland, the chair of the bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission, amount to a 'weaponization' of open-records laws, a 'resource drain' that has 'real-world consequences' for the work of local election offices that administer America’s elections. We may well end up this election year with a broken election system. Who will deserve the blame? That will ultimately belong to the billionaires who assure us, at every opportunity, that they wish nothing more than to make America great again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz6U-lJ8DL3np	2024-10-29T16:34:20-07:00	
Will America Go To War Under Trump? – OpEd	By Jonathan Power A speech of General George Patton, a famous World War II warrior, has an uncanny resemblance to the philosophy of Donald Trump. 'All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser—Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win—all the time. That’s why Americans have never lost, not ever will lose a war, for the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.' Then came the Korean War (a stalemate), Vietnam (a loss), Afghanistan (mired in unconquerable mountains), Iraq 2 (a quagmire), Ukraine versus Russia (a proxy unwinnable war). Never mind the failures, with Trump in the saddle again, if that happens, a new toughness will be apparent—or so he says, in his usual muddled way. When president he experienced conflicts with North Korea, Russia, Iran, Syria, China, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and in Niger and Mali. 'Fire and Fury', aimed at North Korea, is in danger down the road of becoming his mantra. Recall that the US commander in Korea, General Douglas MacArthur, advocated using 34 nuclear weapons on targets in Korea and China. Polls today show that a majority of Americans think it would be right to use them if America were attacked. Obama and Biden would never press the button. I would not be so sure about Trump sometime over the next few years. Russia—Trump has pushed for a fast build-up of America’s military might, including nuclear weapons, even though America has a military expenditure as high as the combined total of Russia, China, Japan, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and India. He has no plan to discuss arms cuts, to take missiles off hair-trigger alert nor to take up ex-president Dmitri Medvedev’s important proposal for a new European Security Treaty. This would deal with Russia’s anger at the expansion of NATO up to its borders, while getting Russia’s soldiers out of Ukraine and ending its military manoeuvres in and around the Baltic. China—Trump has provoked China unnecessarily over Taiwan. This small island which has provided much of China’s investment is claimed by Beijing to be part of China. It is not. But it should not, as a counter move, declare independence, a policy that Trump seems to lean to. Rather it should realise the quiet status quo is the only policy worth its weight. Trump is aggravated by Chinese claims to islands in the South and East China seas. US warplanes already cross the borders of China’s Air Defence Identification Zones. In the 1950s, the US nearly went to war with China over the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu, owned by Taiwan. President Dwight Eisenhower considered using nuclear weapons. Eventually China did pull back. These days, no one in their right mind wants to provoke a major war fought over tiny uninhabited islands. If this be true, then the Pentagon should be ordered to take its military far away, so war cannot happen. On the economic front, there is a danger that Trump will initiate another trade war, which in the long run will lead to a US defeat. China has most of the cards. The total size of its economy is fast catching up with the US. It could buy its planes from Airbus rather than Boeing etc. It can start selling its vast savings in US Treasury bonds. Iran—Iran is the source of many of the problems of the Middle East: 'From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and train terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region.' Trump has gone to great lengths to make sure Saudi Arabia benefits politically and militarily from his views. Such an attitude undermines the job of making ISIS and Al Qaeda the primary target, as they should be. It is Iran, Iran, Iran, even though Iran is a force for defeating extremists. Yet, Iran can be negotiated with, as the US discovered when it succeeded in sealing a highly important denuclearisation agreement. Trump ripped that accord open, even though he should have known that North Korea will never trust a US deal if that’s what happens two years later. North Korea—If Trump wins, negotiations soon will be under way between the North and the US. If they work then that should be an example for how to deal with other problems. If they fail, then we should worry that Trump might lead us into a nuclear war. With Obama and Joe Biden, even though they made grave mistakes, one felt there was a momentum towards peace. With Trump, it just seems to be a momentum to war.

Denmark: TotalEnergies Discovers New Gas Condensate Resources In ...	TotalEnergies said Tuesday that the Harald East Middle Jurassic nearby exploration well (HEMJ-1X) has discovered additional gas condensate resources in the Harald field, in the Danish North Sea. Located in shallow waters, 250 km off the west coast of Denmark, the HEMJ-1X well was drilled in the Eastern part of Harald field and encountered 48 meters of net gas condensate pay in a good quality reservoir. The HEMJ-1X well will be immediately connected to the Harald platform and is expected to start producing before the end of the year through the existing Harald and Tyra facilities. 'The success of the Harald East Middle Jurassic well, nearby our Harald facilities in Denmark, demonstrates the strength of our Exploration strategy. This additional discovery at the Harald field will contribute to Danish energy supply by boosting our existing production in the North Sea in line with the Danish National Compromise', said Kevin McLachlan, Senior Vice President Exploration at TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies is the operator of the Danish Underground Consortium with a 43,2% working interest, alongside Joint Venture partners BlueNord (36,8%) and Nordsøfonden (20%).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdIoKSuLgXwbrwVIRwe573-	2024-10-29T09:45:01-07:00	
Cattle Dog Gusto: How Bluey Conquered The United States – OpEd	For decades, the cultural phenomenon known as Americanisation has taken place with diffusing ease. Momentum was gained with the retreat of communism from Europe’s eastern states with the end of the Cold War and the eventual termination of the Soviet Union in 1991. Global brands of Americana from fizzy drinks to Dallas became pervasive cultural presences. Not even children’s programming was exempt. Converts and devotees would mimic accents, adopt terms of reference, and emulate patterns of behaviour. In terms of children’s programming, Sesame Street, the work of the non-profit organisation Sesame Workshop, has been the global standard bearer. Jenny Perlman Robinson and Daniela Petrova, writing for Brookings in 2015, delved into its significance as an informal educating tool, reaching millions of children across 150 countries. 'What had started as an educational television program more than 40 years ago is now a multimedia platform that uses everything from radio, video, and books to the latest in interactive media and technology.' In 2018, Australia made its own contribution in the field. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation released an animated series that has since become a giddying global phenomenon. The US has not been spared, suggesting that Americanisation, at least in some areas, can also be given hearty doses of its own medicine. The series in question, Bluey, features an Australian dog of the Blue Heeler variety: one Bluey, a six-year-old cattle dog who lives in the Queensland city of Brisbane with sister Bingo, and parents Bandit and Chilli. By the end of March 2020, the series had won an International Emmy in the children’s preschool category, something no doubt helped by the enforced isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2023, Bluey became the second most popular streaming show in the US, logging 731 million hours. In 2024, the series became the most viewed show in the United States. Such success was due, in no small part, to a distribution deal struck between the BBC and Disney in 2019. 'The warmth and authenticity of Bluey’s family dynamic is what first captured our interest in the show,' explained Jane Gould, senior vice president of Disney Channels Worldwide. 'Bluey reminds us all of our own families, and it plays out in the small but emotionally epic dramas of day-to-day life in surprising, heartfelt and very funny ways that will engage children and parents alike.' The fascinating aspect about Bluey is its central premise: neither the viewing parents nor their engaged children are treated like passive imbeciles. Both groups can partake in the themes of the series without feeling infantilised. 'It trusts,' wrote David Sim in The Atlantic in August last year, 'that its young audience will be able to understand stories that are about the foibles and insecurities of parents too.' The web traffic site, Similarweb.com, yields an interesting statistic: the largest demographic of visitors to the official Bluey website (Bluey.tv) are those between 25-34, coming in at 28.86%. Fantasy and imagination mingle with testing, even potentially contentious issues. There are questions about premature birth ('Early Baby'); the appearance of friends who proceed to vanish ('Camping'); even questions about the fine line between full blooded banter and unacceptable teasing. In a Father’s Day episode, Bluey’s dad, Bandit, openly wonders about the merits of getting a vasectomy. Given such a format, it was bound to interest academics keen to tell us the obvious after generating the usual quantitative quarry of data. In a survey of 700 adults – part of a research project called Australian Children’s Television Cultures – we are told that Bluey was most keenly enjoyed by parents wishing to view a series with their children. Those behind the research project were keen to note the words of one of the respondents in describing the series. Bluey was 'representative of an idealised Australian ethos – relaxed, curious, and hard-working.' The influence of Bluey has also been noted in another respect. In 2022, a father in Massachusetts revealed that his child had begun using the term 'dunny' instead of 'toilet'. This brought much pleasure to ABC Sydney radio presenter, Richard Glover. 'Finally,' he chortled in The Washington Post, 'we have our revenge.' According to Glover, US popular culture had ensured that Australians of his generation had 'enrolled in a PhD program' on the subject. 'We paid the price for our enthusiasm, regularly scolded by our parents for ‘using those terrible American words.’ These included ‘sidewalk’ instead of ‘footpath’ and ‘trash’ instead of ‘rubbish’.' Now, it was time for those in the US, notably children, to learn that breakfast could be called 'brekkie', a chicken a 'chook', and 'tradie' a skilled tradesperson. Little wonder that we can find a Master of Arts thesis dedicated to the adult fandom phenomenon around Bluey, including its appeal to those millennials who show 'higher rates of anxiety, a greater distrust in the American government, and disbelief in American excellence than those of previous generations.' Anthropomorphised cattle dogs had become saviours of a sort. Something else is at play here. If Bluey is naturalistic, touching on the raw end of life in parenting and children’s lives, it functions in a digital world that is less adult, increasingly infantile and increasingly disabling. Children and adults are becoming increasingly estranged from relations through technological parting and an addiction to the screen. Funny that it should fall to a family of animated Australian cattle dogs to tie parents and children in a gentle knot of play and accommodation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdIoKSuLgXwbruofv7p8eIb	2024-10-29T09:43:25-07:00	
Robert Reich: Why Harris’s Closing Message Must Center On Anti-El...	I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling more anxious about the outcome of the upcoming election. I’m still nauseously optimistic, but the nausea is growing. I’m as skeptical of polls as any of you, but when all of them show the same thing — that Kamala Harris’s campaign stalled several weeks ago, yet Trump’s continues to surge — it’s important to take the polls seriously. Harris will give her closing message to the American people tomorrow at a rally on the National Mall’s Ellipse in Washington. Over the last several weeks, she’s focused on Trump’s threats to a woman’s right over her body and to the rights of all Americans to a democracy. Tomorrow night, though, she needs to respond forcefully to the one issue that continues to be highest on the minds of most Americans: the economy. She must tell Americans simply and clearly why they continue to have such a hard time despite all the official economic indicators to the contrary: It’s because of the power of large corporations and a handful of wealthy individuals to siphon off most economic gains for themselves. Most Americans are outraged that they continue to struggle economically at the same time billionaires are pulling in ever more wealth. Most know they’re paying too much for housing, gas, groceries, and the medicines they need. They also know that a major cause is the market power of big corporations. They want someone who’ll stand up to big corporations and the politicians in Washington who serve them. They want a president who’ll be on their side. A president who will crack down on price gouging, who will bust up the monopolies and restore competition, who will fight to cap prescription drug costs, who will get big money out of politics and stop the legalized bribery that rigs the market for the rich, and who will make sure corporations pay their fair share and end tax breaks for billionaire crooks. A president who will put working families first —beforebig corporations and the wealthy. Harris needs to sayshewill be this president. Her policy proposals support this. She’s committed to strong antitrust enforcement — cracking down on mergers and acquisitions that give big food corporations the power to jack up food and grocery prices, prosecuting price-fixing, and banning price gouging. She needs to remind voters of this. She also says she’ll raise taxes on the rich, provide $25,000 in down-payment assistance to help Americans buy their first home, restore the Expanded Child Tax Credit to $3,600 to help more than 100 million working Americans, and introduce a new $6,000 tax cut to help families pay for the high costs of a child’s first year of life. All should be parts of her speech tomorrow about why she will be the champion of working people. She wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, make stock buybacks more expensive, and expand Medicare to cover home health care — paid for with savings from the expansion of Medicare price negotiations with drug manufacturers. She needs to frame all of this as a response to the power of big corporations and the wealthy — and say in no uncertain terms that she’s on the side of the people, not the powerful. If she fails to do this in her closing argument, Trump’s demagogic response will be the only one the public hears — that average working people are struggling because of undocumented workers and the 'enemy within,' including Democrats, socialists, Marxists, and the 'deep state.' Harris should fit her message about democracy inside this economic message. If our democracy weren’t dominated by the rich and big corporations, fewer of the economy’s gains would be siphoned off to them. Average working people would have better pay and more secure jobs and be able to afford to homes, food, fuel, medicine, child care, and eldercare. A large portion of the public no longer thinks American democracy is working. According toa newNew York Times/Siena College poll, only 45 percent believe our democracy does a good job representing ordinary people. An astounding 62 percent say the government is mostly working to benefit itself and elites rather than the common good. In her closing argument, Harris should commit herself to reversing this, so government works for the common good. Harris started her campaign in July and early August by emphasizing these themes about the economy and democracy. But in more recent weeks, she’s focused mostly on Trump’s particular threat to democracy. Her campaign seems to have decided that she can draw additional voters from moderate Republican suburban women upset by Trump’s role in fomenting the attack on the U.S. Capitol. That’s why she’s been campaigning with Liz Cheney and gathering Republican officials as supporters. And why she has chosen to give her closing message on the Ellipse — where Trump summoned his followers to march on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Yet when she shifted gears from the economy to Trump’s attacks on democracy, Harris’s campaign stalled. I think that’s because Americans continue to focus on the economy and want an answer to why they are still struggling economically. If Trump gives them an answer — although baseless and demagogic — but Harris does not, he may sail to victory on November 5. Hence in her closing message she must talk clearly and frankly about the misallocation of economic power in America — lodged with big corporations and the wealthy instead of average Americans — and her commitment to rectify this.

Brig Rajinder Singh: Kashmir’s ‘Captain Of The Gate’ – OpEd	A Sinister Plan Unfolds Immediately after the British left Indian shores in 1947, both Independent India and the newly created state of Pakistan undertook a flurry of consolidation related activities. While the Indian leadership concentrated on shaping a unified India by negotiating terms of accession with the more than 500 erstwhile princely states, the Pakistanis unfortunately seemed to be more concerned about expanding the nascent nation’s boundaries through devious means. On August 18, Pakistan army’s Commander-in-Chief [C-in-C] Gen Frank Walter Messervy issued written orders outlining details of a covert military campaign [codenamed Operation Gulmarg] in garb of a tribal ‘invasion’ to annex J&K. That the army of a newly created nation would issue a war directive within 96 hours or so after its birth may sound bizarre, this is exactly what happened and Pakistan’s perfidy would have gone unreported had Maj [Later Maj Gen] OS Kalkat not stumbled upon this crucial document. Warning Ignored Serving as Brigade Major of the Bannu Frontier Force Brigade being commanded by Brig CP Murry, Maj Kalkat was authorised to open official communications addressed to the Brigade Commander in his absence. As Brig Murry was away on August 20, 1947, Maj Kalkat opened a demi-official top secret letter written by Pakistan army C-in-C that was addressed to the Brigade Commander. This document that had been signed just two days ago contained war plans for Operation Gulmarg and mentioned October 22, 1947, as the day of its commencement. Though Maj Kalkat managed to escape to India and on reaching army headquarters at New Delhi narrated details about the imminent invasion of J&K to senior military officers, unfortunately, his warning wasn’t taken seriously. Probably it was opined that a newly created nation with a host of national issues required to be urgently addressed was unlikely to take such a drastic step. In Srinagar, the ruler of J&K Maharaja Hari Singh was also oblivious of Pakistan’s sinister designs. He refused to exercise his option for accession and appeared confident that Pakistan wouldn’t resort to annexing his kingdom through force and subterfuge. The reason for his optimism was probably the ‘standstill agreement’ which Pakistan had entered into with the princely state of J&K. The ‘standstill agreement’ ensured that after Independence, all existing administrative arrangements between the British Crown and princely states would continue unaltered between the signatory dominion [India/Pakistan] and concerned princely states until new arrangements were made. Hence, any move by Pakistan to change the status quo through use of force was tantamount to brazen violation of this agreement and hence extremely unlikely. An Agreement Dishonoured Recognition of the British Crown’s suzerainty by the royalty of undivided India ruled out the scope of local skirmishes or any clash of arms between principalities. Furthermore, the British rulers ensured that state forces maintained by princely states posed no threat to the British Crown and as such, these armies were largely ceremonial in nature with negligible combat experience, and J&K was no exception. Being numerically far inferior and equipped with obsolete weapons, J&K state forces were no match for the World War 2 battle hardened regulars of the Pakistan army providing command elements as well as bolstering the strength of tribal lashkars [militias] as foot soldiers. As this force approached Muzaffarabad on the night of October 21/22, Muslim soldiers of J&K Princely State Forces stationed there mutinied, murdering their commanding officer and Dogra comrades-in-arms as they slept. With the mutineers joining the invaders, the entire 180 km route to Srinagar was left completely unguarded. The situation, to say the least, was utterly hopeless as all seemed lost! J&K’s ‘Horatius’ Emerges On October 22, the beleaguered Maharaja summoned his army chief Brigadier Rajinder Singh and ordered him to defend J&K 'till the last man and last bullet.' The Maharaja’s son Dr Karan Singh who was present in the room recalls that on receiving this order, Brig Rajinder Singh 'just saluted and walked away.' Mustering about 150- 260 men including some officers armed with obsolete weapons and limited ammunition, he set out for Uri in private transport and reached there at about 2 AM on the night of October 22/23. Taking a small body of soldiers with him, Brig Rajinder Singh moved forward and encountered the invaders in Garhi. Though it offered stiff resistance, his small detachment was greatly outnumbered as well as outgunned. Despite the overwhelming odds, Brig Rajinder Singh remained steadfast and continued rallying his troops through personal example, carrying out retrograde operations to slow down the advance of the invaders. This included blowing up the Uri bridge and fighting delaying actions from a series of defensive positions at Mahura, Rampur and finally at Baramulla. The fact that Brig Rajinder Singh was able to delay the more than 20,000-strong invading force with less than 300 men speaks volumes about his professional acumen and dedication. Despite having had several brushes with death, Brig Rajinder Singh continued leading from the front and when his driver was killed in an ambush, he took control of the wheel himself. On being grievously injured subsequently, Brig Rajinder Singh refused evacuation as it would further deplete the already miniscule strength of the defenders. Instead he ordered his men to proceed and execute the defensive battle plan as time was at a premium, leaving him where he was. Inspired by Brig Rajinder Singh’s selflessness and sacrifice, his men engaged the invaders in a tough fight during which most of them laid down their lives. Nothing is known what happened to Brig Rajinder Singh as his mortal remains were never found. However, those who fell while defending J&K from invaders didn’t die in vain- they were able to delay a much larger and better armed enemy for four days, creating a window that enabled J&K’s accession to India and facilitated the Indian army to land its troops at Srinagar airport for evicting the intruders. Brig Rajindir Singh was posthumously awarded Maha Vir Chakra, India’s second highest gallantry award. By living up to the exacting 'last man last bullet' credo, Brig Rajinder Singh has epitomised the core professional value revered by every thoroughbred military person and reminds one of Thomas Babington Macaulay’s famous lines- 'Then out spake brave Horatius,The Captain of the Gate:'To every man upon this earthDeath cometh soon or late.And how can man die betterThan facing fearful odds,For the ashes of his fathers,And the temples of his Gods?'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdIoKSuLgXwbtMnMhfkJSMi	2024-10-29T09:40:21-07:00	
Developing Countries Are Leading The Movement Toward Nuclear Gene...	Developing countries are spearheading the shift towards nuclear power in a world where reliable and sustainable electricity sources are crucial, while wealthier nations focus on weather dependant wind and solar for so-called renewable electricity. The choice of nuclear power generation ahead of unreliable renewables is driven by their need for dependable, low emissions electricity to meet their growing demand for industrial, mining and agricultural goods producing growth. The Nuclear Landscape Countries like France have embraced nuclear power since the 1960s and have for 6 decades been safely producing electricity with 56 reactors that generate 361 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Nuclear accounts for 68% of the country’s annual electricity generation, the highest nuclear generation share in the world. The French strategy includes building at least six new reactors by 2050, with construction starting in 2028 and commissioning by 2035. Nuclear energy also significantly contributes to France’s economy, supporting approximately 457,200 jobs directly and indirectly,apart from the millions employed by the industries its electricity supplies. France is also the largest net exporter of electricity in Europe. The Department of Energy (DOE) advocates for nuclear power as a cost-effective and reliable source of electricity through various reactor designs, including large reactors for bulk electricity production, and Smaller Modular Reactors (SMRs) for flexible deployment. This has recently been proven in the newly updated Pathways to Commercial Liftoff report, where advanced nuclear (small and micro modular reactors) have been cited as having a differentiated value proposition that extends to thermal industrial heat required by the oil, coal and gas industries to produce the products that the world wants and needs. The US Navy has a longstanding success with nuclear-powered vessels, emphasizing the safety and reliability of nuclear technology over decades. Nuclear power also stands out as one of the most cost-effective options for electricity generation. Filmmaker Oliver Stone's documentary, 'Nuclear Now,' sheds light on the benefits of nuclear power, showcasing its safety record, efficiency, and minimal environmental impact compared to other electricity sources. Developing Countries Leading the Charge Developing countries are leading the charge towards nuclear-generated electricity and include China, India, Korea, Indonesia, and South Africa amongst others. South Africa was the first in the world to start work on a commercial SMR in the early 2000s, which manifested into the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) project that was unfortunately politically halted in favour of green agendas in 2010. The history of the South African nuclear sector traces back to the mid-1940s, with the formation of the forerunner to the Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC). In 1959, the government greenlit the development of a local nuclear industry. Subsequently, plans commenced in the following year for the construction of a research reactor, in collaboration with the US Atoms for Peace initiative. South Africa is also leading the charge with SMR development, as nuclear expertise moved to the private sector after the PBMR project was shut down in 2010. South Africa is an exporter of nuclear expertise, as evidenced in the Barakah Nuclear facility build in the UAE where it had over 160 South African professionals working on the project that has successfully proven that nuclear power plants are both bankable and efficient. There are numerous reasons why developing nations are leading the charge in embracing nuclear energy: Electricity poverty leaves people less likely to be responsible custodians of the environment, as people in poorer developing countries brutally survive in a world with inadequate access to goods, services and economic freedoms that are abundantly available in developed economies that were built on the products made from fossil fuels. In 2019, about 759 million people could not access electricity, nearly 75% of them (570 million) from Sub-Saharan Africa, which represents about half of the region’s population. In 2022 and 2023 some countries placed the phasing in or expansion of nuclear power at the centre of their strategies to reach climate policy objectives for electricity emissions that were reliable and safe, sparking a significant revival of global interest in nuclear energy and high-efficiency low-emission (HELE) coal energy. The IEA’s updated Net Zero Roadmap shows nuclear generated electricity more than doubling by 2050, complementing renewable deployment, and easing the pressure on critical mineral supply. The only operating Small Modular Reactor in operation in the world, including the Continental United States, is the High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor - Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) in Shidao Bay in China. The foundation for this technology stems from a collaboration with the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor program in South Africa. Based on economic research by Dr Rob Jeffrey, South Africa and many other poor developing economies need to join the movement toward 'reliable and emissions-free electricity' from nuclear, mixed with High-efficiency Low emission (HELE) coal gas or oil energy as the only long-term solution for their sustained economic growth. These poor developing countries face the choice between a dark future of slow economic growth and rising unemployment or the potential of achieving high sustainable economic growth and achieving the only key objectives that matter, namely reducing poverty, unemployment and inequality. Sustainable economic growth can only be achieved through the rapid development of proven technologies with high-capacity factors like nuclear, (HELE) coal, gas and oil for affordable, reliable, continuous, and low emissions electricity that will benefit billions on this planet. It is imperative for countries, including the United States, to lead the way in adopting nuclear power to ensure electricity security and alleviate energy poverty effectively. The UK, European Union, Germany, Spain, California and South Australia are examples where the renewable transition to solar and wind has led to higher energy prices, slower growth and declines in their industrial and mining sectors. Access to electricity, infrastructure, and financial inclusion through economic development in a manner that respects both people and the environment is fundamental to human progress as a species. There is no other way to long-term prosperity. Activism without the measure of an outcome leads to entropy, which is the natural inclination of universal order towards chaos. 'Renewables', like wind and solar, only exist to generate intermittent electricity, as they CANNOT make any products or fuels! The demands for material to build wind and solar and EV batteries inflict substantial environmental degradation and humanity atrocities in China, Africa, Turkey, Democratic Republic of Congo, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. The materials for EV batteries and to. produce electricity from wind turbines and solar panels, require large-scale mining and refining of critical minerals and metals. The short life of renewables means toxic waste is an increasing problem with them Russia and China are currently leading the world in nuclear electricity generation and account for 70 per cent of new nuclear plants. Currently, there are about 440 nuclear power reactors operating in 32 countries. Today, about 60 reactors are under construction across the world. A further 110 are planned. The Path Forward The path is clear, there are no shortcuts and there is no skirting around the elephant in the room that Policymakers refuse to discuss-the path to reliable and sustainable electricity sources. Any sort of 'Just Transition' needs to result in a proportionate increase in units of production that the World needs, to live to the standards that those imposing the standards would like to live. This is the only way to a true 'Just energy transition'. One where the billions of impoverished people are given a light to shine whatever talent they have into the world. And for that, they need a spark. Astonishingly, while hungry countries are pursuing reliable and emissions-free electricity from nuclear and low-emission technologies for their electricity supply from coal, oil and gas, the wealthier countries with ample goods and services produced by fossil fuel derivatives are focusing on continuously subsidizing wind and solar for occasional and unreliable electricity.

France Applauds Morocco’s Bold Vision In Water And Energy: A Mode...	In a compelling address to Morocco's Parliament, French President Emmanuel Macron commended Morocco's forward-thinking approach to tackling critical water and energy challenges. Highlighting the country's visionary 'water highways' and urban desalination efforts, Macron praised Morocco's commitment to securing sustainable access to potable water and irrigation solutions for its growing population. His remarks placed Morocco at the forefront of innovation in resource management, with initiatives that aim not only to meet the present needs but to secure a resilient future. Few nations, Macron emphasized, have confronted the challenges of water scarcity with such determination and ingenuity. 'I believe few countries have addressed this issue with as much vigor and innovation,' he remarked, adding that France is honored to be a partner in Morocco's unprecedented policies. From the development of water highways—an impressive infrastructure designed to deliver water efficiently across vast distances—to city desalination projects that will meet the demands of expanding urban centers and agricultural areas, Macron's speech recognized Morocco's leadership in sustainable water solutions. Macron's vision for Morocco's water strategy extends beyond national borders. He expressed hope that Morocco's water highways would be a focal point at the upcoming One Water Summit, an international platform where Morocco's innovative practices could inspire similar efforts globally. France stands ready to support Morocco's journey toward 'adaptation and sovereignty,' a phrase underscoring Morocco's independence in addressing climate challenges and resource management. In the energy sector, Macron lauded Morocco as a pivotal player with vast potential to supply Europe with green hydrogen and renewable energy. 'Morocco has unique resources,' he noted, referencing the country's longstanding hydroelectric projects—an initiative dating back to the era of King Hassan II—and its extensive solar farms and wind installations, some of the largest in Africa. These projects are laying the groundwork for Morocco's emergence as a renewable energy leader, capable of delivering not only sustainable power domestically but also stable, low-carbon energy for Europe. Macron's vision for the Mediterranean's future is intrinsically tied to these new energy corridors, particularly those dedicated to green hydrogen and electricity. He affirmed, 'Yes, I am convinced that the Mediterranean's future will also be written through these green hydrogen corridors and electric routes that will bind our two countries.' These new pathways, he noted, are set to become decisive axes of growth for both Morocco and Europe, fostering a partnership that promises mutual resilience and prosperity. With this commitment to innovative water and energy strategies, Morocco is setting an example for the world. Its leadership reflects an understanding that sustainability is not merely a national goal but a shared responsibility. In Macron's words, Morocco's approach shows the world that it is possible to forge a future built on adaptation, resourcefulness, and partnership. As Europe and Morocco move forward together, these efforts underscore a new era of collaboration, one in which Morocco's bold strategies are not only a testament to its own resilience but a beacon of hope for global sustainability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSYMXdG79ILyVDYOUiYon8	2024-10-29T09:36:08-07:00	
North Korean Troops In Russia: Implications For The Ukraine Confl...	The Pentagon has confirmed that approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to eastern Russia, ostensibly to undergo military training. However, intelligence suggests that many of these troops will ultimately join the Russian forces in Ukraine. With rumors circulating that North Korea could dispatch an additional 10,000 troops by year's end, this support marks a significant shift in the dynamics of the nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine. If NATO and Europe fail to respond effectively, North Korea's troop deployment could expand even further, potentially reaching 30,000–40,000 soldiers on Ukrainian soil within six months. This would represent a substantial foreign presence in Ukraine, complicating the conflict and heightening the international stakes. According to reports, North Korean soldiers sent to Russia will begin combat operations in Ukraine by November 1. Their leader, Kim Jong-Un, has effectively condemned these soldiers to a one-way mission; they are unlikely ever to return. North Korea's strict policies dictate that soldiers interacting with foreigners may face severe consequences, possibly being held in gulag-like conditions for life. This echoes Stalin's treatment of Soviet POWs after World War II, who were punished upon returning home for their exposure to foreign influences. This deployment raises critical questions: What has Russia offered in return for North Korea's support? Some analysts believe it may involve nuclear technology, signaling a potentially dangerous escalation. With North Korea's growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict, the international community is now faced with a pressing dilemma. The presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine adds a new layer of complexity, underscoring the urgent need for a coordinated response from NATO and Europe to prevent further destabilization.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWbSe0CECQbPGulsZuxtn_	2024-10-29T09:34:44-07:00	
Myths And Reality About ISKP – OpEd	The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an affiliate of ISIS, was formed in Afghanistan in 2015 and has since been responsible for numerous acts of terrorism across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asian Republics (CARs), and even Russia. While Afghanistan remains ISKP's primary base; as has been affirmed by various UN reports, the Afghan media outlets (affiliated with the Interim Government) regularly adopt a deflective stance, redirecting blame to other nations—particularly Pakistan, which has been a significant target of ISKP and TTP terrorism. This article examines the historical context, formation, alliances and activities of ISKP in the region. In 2013, ISIS began a calculated expansion by dispatching emissaries to regions beyond Iraq and Syria, including Afghanistan. Although ISIS suffered a significant setback with its retreat from Iraq in 2014, its plans in Afghanistan were already well underway. By engaging individuals from existing terrorist factions within the country, ISIS began to consolidate its presence. Key figures disillusioned with their former allegiances, such as ex-Taliban (TTA) commanders Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost and Abdul Qahir Khorasani, played pivotal roles in establishing ISKP. In 2015, the group formalized its presence in Afghanistan, appointing Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former TTP commander who had split from TTP leader Fazalullah, as ISKP's first emir. Over the following years, ISKP continued to build alliances and bolster its ranks. In 2017, it linked up with additional extremist factions, including Jaish-ul-Adl and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami, further expanding its militant base. Most ISKP fighters today are either former TTP or TTA members who orchestrate terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other regional countries. While the core of ISKP’s fighters comprises defectors from the Afghan Taliban (TTA) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), interestingly, the group has also drawn recruits from India. For instance, during the U.S. MOAB strike on Tora Bora in April 2017, 13 Indian militants affiliated with ISKP were killed. Similarly, in 2020, further evidence emerged as Indian nationals, including Mohammed Muhasin and Abu Rawaha al-Muhajir from Kerala, carried out attacks in Afghanistan, underscoring a broader network. The regional security experts also hint at a complex connivance involving Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies to infiltrate Indian nationals into ISKP for their vested interest against Pakistan. An interesting fact is that Indian media has even provided platforms to known terrorists for propaganda against Pakistan regarding its support to ISKP. Media outlets like Sunday Guardian have been publishing such materials - repeated articles by known terrorist Ehsanullah Ehsan is a case in point. This echoes the EU DisinfoLab's findings in 2019-20 on Indian dis-info campaign against Pakistan. Pakistan is worst victim of terrorism and has been actively fighting terrorist groups including ISKP. Relating Pakistan to rendering any support to ISKP amounts to intellectual dishonesty and orchestrated media campaigns. The need of the hour is collectively counter the menace of terrorism instead of using it as proxies. As a nation deeply affected by terrorism, Pakistan has been actively combating groups like ISKP and TTP, and remains a frontline state in counterterrorism efforts. Accusing Pakistan of supporting ISKP not only misrepresents the facts but also undermines collaborative efforts against terrorism through orchestrated media campaigns. Now, more than ever, there is a need for united action to confront the global menace of terrorism, rather than misusing it as a geopolitical tool and proxies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWbSe0CECQbNybhY9v9IG4	2024-10-29T09:32:29-07:00	
France Reaffirms Support For Morocco’s Sovereignty Over The Sahar...	In a historic address before Morocco's Parliament in Rabat, French President Emmanuel Macron unequivocally underscored France's support for Morocco's sovereignty over the Sahara, a gesture that was met with resounding applause from Moroccan lawmakers. His words, 'the present and future of the Western Sahara lie within the framework of Moroccan sovereignty,' carried profound implications, not only for Morocco but also for regional stability in North Africa. This stance reflects a principled position that is neither antagonistic nor exclusive. Addressing Algeria's criticism of this alignment, Macron emphasized that France's stance 'is hostile to no one.' Algeria, which has long backed the Polisario Front—a group advocating for Saharan independence—has historically contested Morocco's claim over the Sahara. However, Macron's message was one of unity, focused on advancing development and peace. Macron's vision went beyond political rhetoric. He affirmed that French companies and operators would actively support the economic development of the Sahara through sustainable investments and initiatives that serve the local population. This commitment reflects France's intention to act as a proactive partner in Morocco's efforts to transform the region into a hub of opportunity, prosperity, and stability. France's support for Morocco's autonomy plan aligns with the growing international consensus recognizing the strategic importance of stability in the Sahara. As Macron's statement reflects, the future of the Sahara hinges on responsible economic engagement that benefits local communities, fosters inclusive growth, and counters the spread of instability. By advocating for initiatives that prioritize sustainable development, Macron positioned France as a catalyst for a brighter future for all Moroccans, from Rabat to Laayoune. This reinforcement of Moroccan sovereignty resonates not only within Moroccan borders but also signals to the global community that pragmatic diplomacy can be a force for lasting peace in contested regions. Macron's stance, grounded in respect for Morocco's territorial integrity, is a step toward a future where shared prosperity serves as the foundation for peace, diplomacy, and regional solidarity. With this speech, Macron has sent a clear message: France stands alongside Morocco in its vision for the Sahara, and together they aim to build a region marked by security, development, and opportunity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1owK7vNfNby	2024-10-29T09:31:04-07:00	
Factions And Fallout In Kabul – OpEd	When a nation claims unity amidst growing fractures, the silent echoes of internal discord often tell a different story. Recently, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, denied the existence of factions within the Afghanistan Taliban-led government and blames Afghanistan’s woes on external ‘adversaries’ he claims are out to frustrate Afghans’ efforts. However, this now well-known story of scapegoating ‘enemies’ conceals a far larger and growing problem—the clear and present fracture line within the ranks of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA). This growing divide is much more than an example of a leadership fissure; rather, it is a structural vulnerability with implications for Afghanistan and the region. Despite all the reassuring sentiments that Stanikzai has tried to convey, independent sources of information, the already cited statements of former Afghan officials, and the general course of political and, especially, economic developments in Afghanistan over the past several years do not support this image. This picture is far from the unified, ideologically coherent political movement, but the period of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, at least in the early stages of the current insurgency, is far from being a unified political project: it is a struggle of authorities not only of characters, but ideas and concepts of the future of the country. Internal divisions in the Taliban seem to be ideological, procedural and even ethnic in nature. With Afghanistan virtually shunned internationally, there is growing internal rivalry within the IEA based on differences on governance, foreign policy and internal policies. This fracturing of leadership does not only relate to petty differences in policy making. There are at the same time pro-international dialogue people like Stanikzai, who seems ready to engage in talks, and those advocating for the strict rule of Sharia law, which splits are building that can potentially bring the government down. The consequences of these Internal divisions also stretch beyond the Taliban ‘s top brass. From the ministries to the provinces and all the way to the Afghan villages, each factional disagreement shakes the country. Indices point to a government that is not only siloed within its ranks but also administrative discordant; with no clear policy direction because of incessant splits within the government. Thus, while the public statements are used to frame an external ‘enemy’, the actual threat is a divided house – a government unable to set and enforce a coherent policy agenda, and unwilling or unable to adequately address the multifaceted challenges it is facing. Afghanistan’s economic crisis is a vivid example of these unresolved contradictions. Stanikzai blames outside forces for undermining the economy, but the facts reveal that the Taliban also bear much responsibility for it. Through passing restrictive laws that prevent women from working, degrading the country’s ability to engage internationally through denying women’s input in the formation of the government, and denying competent workers their position in government, the Taliban have effectively strangled Afghanistan of economic potentiality. In addition, the fact that Afghanistan is still unrecognized by most of the countries of the world constitutes one of the most daunting challenges to economic growth. Lacking international recognition, Afghanistan cannot attract foreign investment, imports and exports, or international donations. Still, instead of analyzing their contribution to this isolation, the latter refers to ‘enemies’ within the foreign context over and over again, while ignoring the fact that many of the economic problems are the result of local self-organizing. The consequences of such internal conflict do not restrict themselves to Afghanistan. While a government bogged down by internal divisions tries to hold together, the prospects for stability in the region worsen. The various factions in the IEA have started developing diverse attitudes to the neighboring states and regional security organizations, whereas some of them call for diplomacy, others still adhere to the basic principles of confrontation and uncompromising hostility. Consequently, afraid of being an instrument in the game of different international players who will use Afghanistan as a tool to achieve their goals, political factions might make deals with other foreign actors for that very purpose. Further exacerbation of the internal fragmentation of the Taliban can very sharply worsen an already delicate security situation as policy inconsistencies emerge that inflame insurgent movements and empower them, notably when disgruntled factions or excluded leaders turn rogue. Moreover, the adjectives ‘enemies’ are not mere political tropes; rather, they are discursive practices that harbor the risk of turning into a reality. In placing Afghanistan in the status of a helpless victim of outside interference, Taliban leaders might inadvertently foster a more assertive foreign policy of response to potential threats, rather than a policy of building the stability of south and Central Asian regions. This approach could pose threats to stability in border areas, negatively impact the relations with Pakistan and Iran, and amplify instability in the entire expanse of Central and South Asia. However, the constant referring of scapegoats, the 'enemies' of Afghanistan, only undermines the Taliban’s authority. They are gradually losing control of the narrative due to failure to contain internal dissent, manage the economy and end factionalism. This deceit may seem effective in the short term, but it can lead to the rejection of the Afghan people who have been deceived by promises that some parts of their lives get better while in real life it’s only getting worse. The Afghan readers are not naive to go for the daily struggle of operating in an economy, political policies and an administration that is often focused more on internal conflict and less on development. The question remains: as leaders of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will they be hiding behind the phantom of the foreign foes or they will be demonstrating that they know that their house is divided? Unfortunately, it will take internal accountability and true reforms in order for Afghanistan to have a chance at the stability and prosperity it lacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1SImCsqq4-8	2024-10-29T09:29:51-07:00	
India-China Disengagement: Progress On The Ground, Doubts In The ...	By Manoj Joshi The Sino-Indianagreement on patrolling arrangements in eastern Ladakhis a significant achievement for New Delhi. From the outset of the Chinese actions of 2020—the establishment of blockades at six points and massing troops on the border—India has sought to deal with the situation in a measured manner. On the one hand, it confronted the Chinese at the blockade points and also amassed troops on the border, signifying a defensive rather than offensive intent. On the other hand, it pressed Beijing through firm and steady diplomacy to roll back its action. In this way, and by applying military pressure by occupying the Kailash heights overlooking Spanggur Tso, New Delhi managed to resolve four of the six blockade points by July 2022. These points were transformed into buffer zones, where neither side would patrol. Two blockades, in the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala in Demchok, proved more difficult. For two years, talks between military and civilian officials did not yield any results. Then suddenly, a few months ago, things changed, and after a flurry of diplomacy, we have a settlement that goes well beyond the deals that had been arrived at on the other blockade points. Statements from officials in New Delhi last week signalled that China and India have managed to resolve the issue of the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala. The deal announced on 21 October appears to be a multi-layered one which is likely to be rolled out in various phases. As a first step,External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, during a summit in New Delhi, said that 'the disengagement process with China has been completed'. This has been followed by whatForeign Secretary Vikram Misriannounced at a briefing—'an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas.' Both said that through this deal, the situation that had arisen in 2020 in eastern Ladakh had been resolved. Reports quotingsources in the Armysay that 'a detailed agreement outlining the modalities of disengagement as well as patrolling was concluded at the Corps Commander level on Monday'. As a result, the Chinese blockades will be lifted this week, and the two sides will begin coordinated patrolling in the Depsang Bulge and Demchok. So in Depsang, the Indian side, which had been blocked at the so-called Y-Junction, will now be able to patrol to PP 10, 11, 11A 12 and 13 from which they had been blocked in March 2020. In turn, China will also patrol certain areas, though it is not clear as to which ones. Figure 1. Depsang blockade. Source: Author’s own, made by annotating Google Earth imagery. An important innovation here will be that the patrolling, which will begin at the end of the month, will be coordinated by the two sides to prevent the troops from coming face to face. Sources added that 'patrols will be spaced in such a manner that there would be no faceoffs.'Another reportsaid that as soon as the deal was struck, both sides began disengaging by dismantling prefabricated sheds and tents that were being used to house equipment, vehicles, and troops. The report had said that Indian and Chinese troops would now pull back from their forward positions in the two sectors by 28-29 October. In 2020, China blockaded India at six places—the Pangong Tso north bank, PP17A near Gogra Post, the Gogra-Hotsprings area of PP 15, the Galwan river (PP14), the Y-Junction in the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala. Except for the last two, the other issues had been resolved through negotiations between July 2020 (Galwan) and the PP 15 area in July 2022. But in those areas, the two sides created buffer zones varying in depth from 3-10 km in which neither side could send patrols. The current agreement involves both disengagement and patrolling. In other words, in the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala, the agreement reversed the situation and the Chinese blockades have been removed. This goes beyond the actions at the other blockade points, which will, for the present, remain as 'no patrol' buffer zones. Throughout the period of diplomatic engagement,India had insistedthat the process follow the sequence of 'disengagement' followed by 'de-escalation' and then by the 'de-induction' of additional forces that had been brought into the region. However, this deal is a breakthrough of sorts since it amounts to a restoration ofstatus quo anteas of April 2020 in the Depsang Bulge and Charding Nala area. If a similar process can be put in place for the other areas in question, India and China could resume normal management of the LAC. However, it will not be that easy to turn the clock back. India and China had broadly managed to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LAC with the help of a series of confidence-building agreements of 1993, 1996, 2005, and 2012 that largely covered their military conduct on the LAC. An example of its success was the fact that the Galwan clash did not involve the use of guns but of sticks and stones since the use of firearms was banned by the 1996 CBM agreement. Yet, important elements of the agreements had been violated by the Chinese. There are hints in the remarks of officials that elements of the agreement could also be extended to the eastto cover areas like Yangtse,where Indian and Chinese troops clashed in December 2022. Further, innovations likecoordinated patrolling, which were first tried out in the eastern sector, could now be applied in other areas where India and China have overlapping claims and hence insist that they will patrol them. The key to the future lies in the restoration of trust. TheArmy Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, in the wake of the announcement of the agreement, said that the bottom line of the agreement is the importance of restoring 'trust' between the two armies. Urging a restoration of the status quo as of April 2020, he said that India needed to carefully look at the issue of 'disengagement, de-escalation and normal management of the Line of Actual Control' thereafter. This would be done in several phases over some time. While disengagement, de-escalation, and de-induction may proceed apace, restoring trust will require more time. This may require a restructuring and rewriting of the CBM agreements of the past. An important outcome of the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last weekwas the instructions they have given to their Special Representatives (SR)on the Sino-Indian boundary issue—NSA Ajit Doval and his counterpart Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China—to meet soon. The last meeting of the SRs took place in 2019. It is expected that the SRs will guide the process of Sino-Indian reconciliation, which could see a thaw in their constrained political, military, and economic relations in the coming period.

Using AI In Albanian Public Procurements ‘No Easy Solution’ For C...	By Vladimir Karaj Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama has proposed using artificial intelligence in public procurement processes to tackle corruption – but experts argue that the root causes should be dealt with first. Prime Minister Edi Rama has repeatedly said that his government is planning to use artificial intelligence in the country’s public procurement processes, claiming it could offer a solution to corruption – one of the main problems Albania faces as it seeks EU membership. 'I am not saying that it will go down to zero,' he acknowledged in a recent speech, 'but we will neutralise a lot of that infestation.' Corruption in Albania is perceived as widespread. Members of Rama’s ruling Socialist Party have been hit by multiple corruption scandals over the years, while two opposition party leaders, Ilir Meta and Sali Berisha, have also been charged with corrupt practices related to their time in office. Rama’s government has been increasingly in the spotlight since the relatively new Special Structure Against Corruption and Organised Crime, SPAK started a series of investigations that brought charges on abuse of power and corruption against several dozen officials, mayors, ministers and a deputy-prime minister who is currently on the run from justice. SPAK’s efforts are part of wider efforts to tackle high-level graft, backed by Albania’s Western partners. Rama claims that he bears no structural responsibility for these cases, insisting they were just incidents of individual wrongdoing. As to tackling corruption in public procurement processes using AI, he has not explained specifically how this might work. Experts are also unsure. 'It is difficult to evaluate with the data at hand the capacities of the government to implement AI in public procurement, and it is not clear what elements of the public procurement process it will cover,' said Orkidea Xhaferaj, digital and innovation policy expert at the Centre Science and InnovationforDevelopment in Tirana. 'Although the government of Albania is working with Microsoft to implement AI for public procurement, there are concerns when it comes to technology, legal and regulatory measures, as well as operational ones. Predominantly, data management and quality remain an issue in the country, especially at local level,' Xhaferaj added. She pointed out that recruiting well-educated staff to implement such innovations remains a challenge in Albania, not only for public institutions, but also for the private sector. But she argued that using AI in public administration has a series of benefits – 'automation of processes which reduce manual work, data analytics capabilities, real time analysis of bids, contracts and notices, to address risks of fraud and errors'. However, there are practical issues too: 'The use of AI in public procurement brings about concerns in regard to cybersecurity and data privacy, and data biases raise concernsaswell,' she pointed out. She recommended that the authorities begin with smaller-scale or pilot projects before committing to involve AI in larger processes. ‘The machine is deciding’ Political observers expressed cynicism about Rama’s idea of using AI to fight corruption – seeing it as a potential tool for blame-dodging. 'He is apparently aiming to tell citizens and businesses who are complaining about public procurement services that ‘the machine’ is deciding and consequently, his administration bears no responsibility and the system that he created is causing no issues,' commented Zef Preci, executive director of the Albanian Centre for Economic Research. Afrim Krasniqi, director of Albanian Institute of Political Studies also believes that the Prime Minister is trying to avoid accountability. 'This will create a new alibi for corrupt officials,' Krasniqi told BIRN. This isn’t the first time that Rama has promised high-tech solutions for Albania’s institutional problems. Rama has previously said earlier that he believes that AI will help Albania to speed up its EU integration process by machine-translating EU laws and regulations. However, these plans failed when a public procurement call resulted in no offers. The digitalisation of the Public Procurement Commission’s documents has got under way, however; the National Agency for Information Society, which is supervised by Rama’s office, last year awarded a 17 million leks (173,000 euros) contract to a private company to begin the process. Corruption deeply rooted Albania’s Special Prosecution Against Corruption and Organised Crime, SPAK observed in its annual report that its investigations have shown how corruption has been identified from the inception of some public procurement processes and not as part of the process. 'The corrupt activity might start from the very initial stage, from the decision to allocate funds for a specific project, followed by incorrect actions and decisions from the contracting authority,' SPAK noted. The report revealed that investigations have shown direct involvement of high-ranking public officials in irregularities that start before a call for proposals is even issued for a specific public procurement process. 'We have seen direct interventions by high level officials who negotiate with a private party before a procurement or a public private partnership process has been started,' the report said. Experts believe that digitalisation and the use of AI will make little difference to this. 'One of the main faults [of the government] has been the preparation of the laws or decisions to serve specific oligarchs or political clients; many of these things that are presented as large-scale development projects have been granted to companies that have been created exactly for the purpose of winning such contracts,' Krasniqi said. Rigels Xhemollari, executive director of Qendresa Qytetare (Civic Resistance), a pressure group, says that technological innovation will not help if the people operating the new tools are the same as those who have been manipulate public procurement processes on paper. 'The problem here is not the process, but the need to fight corruption in the public procurement processes,' Xhemollari said. Jorida Tabaku, an MP from the opposition Democratic Party, said that that the government has already a high-tech tool to identify potential graft issues – the Open Data Albania online platform. Open Data Albania evaluates procurement processes according to anti-corruption criteria and flag those with suspected anomalies. Some 40 per cent of all procurement processes have been flagged on the platform. 'SPAK has arrested several high-level officials, including MPs and ministers while a deputy prime minister is currently on the run. The question is whether the government has stopped to think over what has caused this widespread corruption among its ranks,' Tabaku declared. Krasniqi said that the lack of will to analyse corruption in the current procurement system means that using AI may make no difference in practice. 'The new system provides no guarantees that it will be more successful than the traditional method of tackling corruption in public procurement,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1ohquz_oOlm	2024-10-28T17:01:26-07:00	
The Politics Of Fear: Laying The Groundwork For Fascism, American...	America is in the midst of an epidemic of historic proportions. The contagion being spread like wildfire is turning communities into battlegrounds and setting Americans one against the other. Normally mild-mannered individuals caught up in the throes of this disease have been transformed into belligerent zealots, while others inclined to pacifism have taken to stockpiling weapons and practicing defensive drills. This plague on our nation—one that has been spreading like wildfire—is a potent mix of fear coupled with unhealthy doses of paranoia and intolerance, tragic hallmarks of the post-9/11 America in which we live. Everywhere you turn, those on both the left- and right-wing are fomenting distrust and division. You can’t escape it. We’re being fed a constant diet of fear: fear of terrorists, fear of illegal immigrants, fear of people who are too religious, fear of people who are not religious enough, fear of extremists, fear of conformists, fear of the government, fear of those who fear the government, fear of those on the Right, fear of those on the Left... The list goes on and on. The strategy is simple yet effective: the best way to control a populace is through fear and discord. Fear makes peoplestupid. Confound them, distract them with mindless news chatter and entertainment, pit them against one another by turning minor disagreements into major skirmishes, and tie them up in knots over matters lacking in national significance. Most importantly, divide the people into factions, persuade them to see each other as the enemy and keep them screaming at each other so that they drown out all other sounds. In this way, they will never reach consensus about anything and will be too distracted to notice the police state closing in on them until the final crushing curtain falls. This is how free people enslave themselves and allow tyrants to prevail. This Machiavellian scheme has so ensnared the nation that few Americans even realize they are being manipulated into adopting an 'us' against 'them' mindset. Instead, fueled with fear and loathing for phantom opponents, they agree to pour millions of dollars and resources into political elections, militarized police, spy technology and endless wars, hoping for a guarantee of safety that never comes. All the while, those in power—bought and paid for by lobbyists and corporations—move their costly agendas forward, and 'we the suckers' get saddled with the tax bills and subjected to pat downs, police raids and round-the-clock surveillance. Turn on the TV or flip open the newspaper on any given day, and you will find yourself accosted by reports of government corruption, corporate malfeasance, militarized police and marauding SWAT teams. America has already entered a new phase, one in which children are arrested in schools, military veterans are forcibly detained by government agents because of their so-called 'anti-government' views, and law-abiding Americans are having their movements tracked, their financial transactions documented, and their communications monitored. These threats are not to be underestimated. Yet even more dangerous than these violations of our basic rights is the language in which they are couched: the language of fear. It is a language spoken effectively by politicians on both sides of the aisle, shouted by media pundits from their cable TV pulpits, marketed by corporations, and codified into bureaucratic laws that do little to make our lives safer or more secure. This language of fear has given rise to a politics of fear whose only aim is to distract and divide us. In this way, we have been discouraged from thinking analytically and believing that we have any part to play in solving the problems before us. Instead, we have been conditioned to point the finger at theotherPerson or vote forthisPolitician or supportthisGroup, because they are the ones who will fix it. Except thattheycan’t and won’t fix the problems plaguing our communities. Nevertheless, fear remains the method most often used by politicians to increase the power of government. The government’s overblown, extended wars on terrorism, drugs, violence, disease, illegal immigration, and so-called domestic extremism have been convenient ruses used to terrorizethe populace into relinquishing more of their freedoms in exchange for elusive promises of security. An atmosphere of fear permeates modern America. However, withcrime at an all-time low, is such fear rational? Statistics show thatyou are 17,600 times more likely to die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack. You are 11,000 times more likely to die from an airplane accident than from a terrorist plot involving an airplane. You are 1,048 times more likely to die from a car accident than a terrorist attack. You are 404 times more likely to die in a fall than from a terrorist attack. You are 12 times more likely to die from accidental suffocating in bed than from a terrorist attack. And you are 9 more times likely to choke to death in your own vomit than die in a terrorist attack. Indeed, those living in the American police state are8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist. Thus, the government’s endless jabbering about terrorism amounts to little more than propaganda—the propaganda of fear—a tactic used to terrorize, cower and control the population. In turn, the government’s stranglehold on power and extreme paranoia about the citizenry as potential threats has resulted in a populace that is increasingly viewed as the government’s enemies. Why else would the government feel the need to monitor our communications, track our movements, criminalize our every action, treat us like suspects, and strip us of any means of defense while equipping its own personnel with an amazing arsenal of weapons? So far, these tactics—terrorizing the citizenry over the government’s paranoia and overblown fears while treating them like criminals—are working to transform the way 'we the people' view ourselves and our role in this nation. Indeed, fear and paranoia have become hallmarks of the modern American experience, impacting how we as a nation view the world around us, how we as citizens view each other, and most of all how our government views us. The American people have been reduced to whatcommentator Dan Sanchezrefers to as 'herd-mindedhundreds of millions [who] will stampede to the State for security, bleating toplease, pleasebe shorn of their remaining liberties.' Sanchezcontinues: I am not terrified of the terrorists; i.e., I am not, myself,terrorized. Rather, I amterrifiedofthe terrorized; terrified of the bovine masses who are so easily manipulated by terrorists, governments, and theterror-amplifying mediainto allowing our country to slip toward totalitarianism and total war… I do not irrationally and disproportionately fear Muslim bomb-wielding jihadists or white, gun-toting nutcases. But I rationally and proportionately fear those who do, and the regimes such terror empowers.History demonstratesthat governments are capable of mass murder and enslavement far beyond what rogue militants can muster. Industrial-scale terrorists are the ones who wear ties, chevrons, and badges. But such terrorists are apowerless fewwithout thesupine acquiescenceof the terrorized many. There is nothing to fear but the fearful themselves… Stop swallowing the overblown scaremongering of the government and its corporate media cronies. Stop letting them use hysteria over small menaces to drive you into the arms of tyranny, which is the greatest menace of all. As history makes clear, fear and government paranoia lead to fascist, totalitarian regimes. It’s a simple enough formula. National crises, reported terrorist attacks, and sporadic shootings leave us in a constant state of fear. Fear prevents us from thinking. The emotional panic that accompanies fear actually shuts down the prefrontal cortex or the rational thinking part of our brains. In other words,when we are consumed by fear, we stop thinking. A populace that stops thinking for themselves is a populace that is easily led, easily manipulated and easily controlled. The following, derived by from John T. Flynn’s 1944 treatise on fascismAs We Go Marchingare a few of the necessary ingredients for a fascist state: The government is managed by a powerful leader (even if he or she assumes office by way of the electoral process). This is the fascistic leadership principle (or father figure). The government assumes it is not restrained in its power. This is authoritarianism, which eventually evolves into totalitarianism. The government ostensibly operates under a capitalist system while being undergirded by an immense bureaucracy. The government through its politicians emits powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism. The government has an obsession with national security while constantly invoking terrifying internal and external enemies. The government establishes a domestic and invasive surveillance system and develops a paramilitary force that is not answerable to the citizenry. The government and its various agencies (federal, state, and local) develop an obsession with crime and punishment. This is overcriminalization. The government becomes increasingly centralized while aligning closely with corporate powers to control all aspects of the country’s social, economic, military, and governmental structures. The government uses militarism as a center point of its economic and taxing structure. The government is increasingly imperialistic in order to maintain the military-industrial corporate forces. The parallels to modern America are impossible to ignore. 'Every industry is regulated. Every profession is classified and organized. Every good or service is taxed. Endless debt accumulation is preserved. Immense doesn’t begin to describe the bureaucracy. Military preparedness never stops, and war with some evil foreign foe, remains a daily prospect,' writes economist Jeffrey Tucker. 'It’s incorrect to call fascism either right wing or left wing. It is both and neither… fascism does not seek to overthrow institutions like commercial establishments, family, religious centers, and civic traditions. It seeks to control them… it preserves most of what people hold dear but promises to improve economic, social, and cultural life through unifying their operations under government control.' For the final hammer of fascism to fall, it will require the most crucial ingredient: the majority of the people will have to agree that it’s not only expedient but necessary. In times of 'crisis,' expediency is upheld as the central principle—that is, in order to keep us safe and secure, the government must militarize the police, strip us of basic constitutional rights and criminalize virtually every form of behavior. We are at a critical crossroads in American history. As I make clear in my bookBattlefield America: The War on the American Peopleand in its fictional counterpartThe Erik Blair Diaries,fear has been a critical tool in past fascistic regimes, and it has become the driving force behind the American police state. All of which begs the question what we will give up in order to perpetuate the illusions of safety and security. As we once again find ourselves faced with the prospect of voting for the lesser of two evils, 'we the people' have a decision to make: do we simply participate in the collapse of the American republic as it degenerates toward a totalitarian regime, or do we take a stand and reject the pathetic excuse for government that is being fobbed off on us? There is no easy answer, but one thing is true: the lesser of two evils is still evil.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1LPkkT0UC0-	2024-10-28T17:00:12-07:00	
Dissent: Gaps In The Regime – OpEd	At certain times in history, sometimes protracted events have occurred that demonstrated the power ofdissent– that (as far as we know) uniquely human capacity to express strong disagreement with some or other aspect of the political, social, or culturalstatus quo, whether this is done peacefully or, in some cases, violently, in a manner that could (and sometimes did) result in revolutionary conflict. The term, ‘dissent’ is related to another, cognate term –dissensus– in the very specific philosophical sense employed by philosopher JacquesRancière, who writes (inDissensus–On Politics and Aesthetics, Continuum, New York, 2010, p. 38): The essence of politics is dissensus. Dissensus is not a confrontation between interests or opinions. It is the demonstration (manifestation) of a gap in the sensible itself. Political demonstration makes visible that which had no reason to be seen; it places one world in another… And further (p. 69): A dissensus is not a conflict of interests, opinions or values; it is division inserted in ‘common sense:’ a dispute over what is given and about the frame within which we see something as given…This is what I call a dissensus: the putting of two worlds in one and the same world…A political subject is a capacity for staging scenes of dissensus. What should be noted above, in the first quotation, is the phrase, ‘gap in the sensible itself.’ If this seems opaque, consider that any ‘normalised’ political situation – such as that in the US today, which consists of a kind of forced ‘consensus’ brought about by the ruling party and its figureheads – structures the ‘sensible’ world of perception in such a manner that any deviation from ‘accepted’ (tacitly enforced) ways of acting meets with various degrees of disapproval and outrage. For example, dissenting views that people express about the desirability of having ex-President Donald Trump back in the White House routinely meet with howls of derision, implying that such opinions amount to lunacy. Dissensus, in this situation, constitutes ‘gap in the sensible itself,’ or inserts ‘one world within another,’ thus demonstrating that the sensible world’s organisation according tooneset of exclusive political and cratological (power-related) criteria for action and speech (or writing) can never be exhaustive.Dissensusis therefore, for Rancière, the ‘essence of politics’ insofar as no extant political dispensation is ever saturated, devoid of other political possibilities, which is why he writes that a ‘political subject is a capacity for staging scenes of dissensus.’ Accordingly, in the present time, those among us who are aware of possessing this capacity for dissensus are called upon to stage its ‘scenes,’ whether in acts of writing (or speech) or of actions, aimed at creating ‘gaps’ in the totalising regime of the sensible, established by those who desire it to saturate the sphere of social space to the exclusion of other possibilities of being political subjects. This capacity to create a ‘gap’ in the established world of power through dissent (ordissensus) has been demonstrated throughout human history. Think of the slave revolt against the might of Rome, led by the slave gladiatorSpartacusaround 73-72 BCE – when he and his followers defied the might of Rome to the point where it took the force of virtually the entire Roman army to quell the gladiator uprising – or any number of rebellions and revolutions in the course of history, rooted in dissent, including the French Revolution that started with the storming of the notorious prison, the Bastille, in 1789, as well as, sometime before that, the American Revolution that erupted in 1775, having been triggered by the so-called Boston Tea Party in 1773. Add to this the American Civil War of the middle 19th century, related to Northern dissent surrounding the practice of slavery. When, in the early 16th century, MartinLutherdistanced himself from what he saw as malpractices within the Roman Catholic Church of his time, it was another case of dissent, which gave rise to a different kind of religion within Christian ranks. These are only a few instances, among the most visible ones (given the sustained, violent conflict involved), to which could be added many others if one scoured history for examples. Here in South Africa the protest and resistance against the practice of apartheid, which took many forms, from literary and philosophical dissent, to peaceful resistance, to guerrilla warfare against the apartheid authorities, were a further instantiation of dissent. When FrantzFanonresisted the colonial authorities in Algeria, in word and deed, it was dissent. What one witnessed in Britain some time ago, in the shape of citizens protesting against Brexit, was also a sign of dissent. And when brave, astute citizensrefusedto accept modes of unjustifiable iatrocratic coercion imposed on them globally in recent times, supposedly in the name of ‘health,’ it also deserved the name of dissent. It is true, of course, that dissent need not appear in such publicly conspicuous ways; it manifests itself in households, virtually on a daily basis, for instance where subordinated women engage in dissent – sometimes silently, at other times vociferously – regarding the oppression or abuse they experience (sometimes literally) at the hands of their husbands or partners. AsFoucaultpointed out, before (some) women gained institutional power through emancipation, they always had the sexual power of their bodies to resist those who dominated them; that, too, is dissent. Today, in excessively patriarchal countries – such as Afghanistan – where the emancipation of women is but a distant, albeit beckoning, ideal, dissent assumes many guises, such as a woman perhaps openly driving a car in a courageous demonstration of independence. It should already be apparent from the above that dissent, although not always recognised as such, is ubiquitous, and everyone who reflects on this would probably be able to pinpoint a manifestation of it in their own lives. Personally, I recall several instances of dissent on the part of some members of the university faculty and senate in which I have served, for example, in the face of attempts by university management to reduce the benefits of staff members at the university in a surreptitious manner, without consideration of the negative effects this would have on the living conditions of the latter. In the work of one of the most (justly) celebrated novelists of the 20th century, who died not so long ago, JohnFowles, one encounters the following thoughtful reflection on the seldom acknowledged value of dissent (A Maggot, Vintage 1996, Kindle edition, Epilogue, location 9209): Dissent is a universal human phenomenon, yet that of Northern Europe and America is, I suspect, our most precious legacy to the world. We associate it especially with religion, since all new religion begins in dissent, that is, in a refusal to believe what those in power would have us believe – what they would command and oblige us, in all ways from totalitarian tyranny and brutal force to media manipulation and cultural hegemony, to believe. But in essence it is an eternal biological or evolutionary mechanism, not something that was needed once, merely to meet the chance of an earlier society, when religious belief was the great metaphor, and would-be conforming matrix, for many things beside religion. It is needed always, and in our own age more than ever before. The novel from the epilogue of which this is taken – and which I cannot discuss at length here – is an astonishing hybrid: part quasi-historical, part science-fiction. The excerpt from the epilogue, above, makes sense against the backdrop of its subject matter as well as the era in which it is set, namely early 18th-century England. The fictional narrative ends with an account of the birth of someone who was destined to become a historical person of note – Ann Lee, who was also known as Mother Ann, the leader of the so-called Shakers (so-called because of their ecstatic dance-shaking, which can be regarded as a kind ofsublimationin Freudian terms), who dissented from orthodox religious conventions in the belief that these were misguided, and that a new, radically different religious practice was called for. Fowles’s marvellous historical reconstruction of socially stratified, oppressive 18th-century English society inA Maggotprovides the context within which the phenomenon of Ann Lee – a female religious leader at a time when women were still regarded as naturally and constitutionally inferior to men – may be understood as the embodiment of dissent. The extremity of her dissent, and that of the Shakers, can be gauged from their rejection of sexual intercourse between men and women, including husband and wife (which is probably what led to their denunciation of marriage in the end). It is as if Ann’s disgust with the extant world of 18th-century England found its expression in the refusal to support the reproduction of the human race in a world that she and her followers considered degraded, and hence unworthy of perpetuation. What I would like to stress here, however, is Fowles’s allusion (in the excerpt, above), on the basis of his reference to religious dissent of the kind encountered on the part of Ann Lee, to the very nature of dissent, namely: ‘…a refusal to believe what those in power would have us believe – what they would command and oblige us, in all ways from totalitarian tyranny and brutal force to media manipulation and cultural hegemony, to believe[my italics; B.O.].’ This allusion makes the relevance ofA Maggotfor the present era in which we live conspicuously significant, to say the least. Regarding mainstream media manipulation and disinformation, those people who do not avail themselves of alternative news and commentary sources face a constant barrage of distorted information often amounting to outright lies, and perhaps worse, algorithmically determined, complete silence on important events occurring in the world (which the manipulators see as something that would undermine their grip on media power).

Iranian Officials Double Down On Warmongering Amid Regional Tensi...	On the morning of Saturday, October 26, during Israel’s aerial attacks targeting various military sites in Iran, the government-affiliated Khabar Fouri Telegram channel issued an announcement about 'the serious consequences of sharing images and news with opposition media.' Labeling this action a 'crime,' the channel warned, 'Anyone who cooperates with hostile foreign governments against the Islamic Republic of Iran, unless considered an enemy combatant, will be sentenced to between one and ten years in prison.' Previously, Massoud Ali, a cleric close to the office of regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei, referenced internal conflicts and disputes within the regime during wartime crises, doubled down on the regime’s warmongering in the region. He advocated for prosecuting and threatening dissenting voices against the regime’s costly interventions in the region. He questioned, 'Why isn’t the judiciary taking the actions necessary during wartime? This is wartime; they should be tried as they would be in war.' He elaborated, 'Some of these people, if we assume generosity, may be called ignorant; otherwise, they’re traitors.' The cleric also cited additional instances of turmoil and infighting within Iran’s regime and called for more aggressive terrorist interventions in the region. Ali said, 'After the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh, we refrained from action for two months, and nothing happened. During these two months, on social media and in some outlets, there was talk. God is my witness, I can barely bring myself to say it. Commanders like Bagheri, Salami, and Hajizadeh were accused of ‘political impotence.’ I apologize to them all, but this term—political impotence! This language circulated, questioning why they hesitated to act. Has this created deep-seated distrust—should it be like this?' (Regime television – October 25). A little earlier, on October 25, Alireza Arafi, the government-appointed head of the regime’s seminaries, spoke on state television, condemning any person and institution who opposes the financial and social costs of war and supporting a two-state solution. Arafi emphasized, 'We are at a historical turning point and a sensitive moment, requiring vigilance, wisdom, foundational decisions, bold steps, and resilience against those adversaries who seek to weaken the Islamic world [i.e., the mullahs’ regime]. This is a new scenario entirely. In this grand struggle and monumental confrontation, the first condition is to hold the correct and principled positions.' This 'immense clash' and 'historical turning point,' as this alarmed cleric describes, are the grim consequences of the regime’s warmongering, which has now entrapped his regime. The fact that Iranian officials are doubling down on warmongering and chaos despite overwhelming opposition against these actions within Iran reveals much about the regime’s nature. The regime intended to use war to counter uprisings within Iran and position himself as a regional power and global player. However, this strategy has backfired, leading to fear, division, and internal conflicts within the regime’s war-driven quagmire. And the regime’s costly intervention in the region, which has come at the expense of the most basic needs of millions of Iranians, will give the people more reason to rise up against this regime and take their destiny and country back from the criminal mullahs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq6ywLSsKTxKC	2024-10-28T16:57:15-07:00	
Why Austrian Business Cycle Theory Is Better Than Keynesianism – ...	By Ed Bugos '…boom and bust cycles are caused—not by the mysterious workings of the capitalist system—but by governmental interventions in that system.'—Murray Rothbard Another way to put it is that the primary cause of what you call a recession is central banking, specifically due to their inflationism and underwriting of fractional reserve banking. If you think that inflation is the product of greedy merchants or the animal spirits, or an economy that is just too hot, or climate change, you have been hoodwinked. In the first place, it is not a product of anything. The term refers to the government’s economic and banking policies. These policies have three main effects (and many knock on effects): The Cantillon effects – redistribution of incomes and wealth Interest rate manipulation – creation of unsound booms General price increases – non-uniform, but general rises in prices One of the knock-on effects is a potential run on confidence, which results in acrack-up of the policy, economy, and currency. One of the biggest factors historically behind the declines of civilizations has been the corruption of its money. It is usually the beginning and can last a century. The corruption of the dollar system has lasted over a century and the dollar has been completely fiat for 55 years now. In this time period, it has lost 99 and 85 percent of its value, respectively (since 1913 and 1971). This article will deal with the second effect above: the manipulation of interest rates, which results in the business cycle. Every economic school, other than the Austrian school, blames it on the inherent instability of the capitalist system. And as a result, they all believe the central bank exists in order to counteract these very tendencies and stabilize those wildly free markets. The Austrian school’s contention, on the other hand, is that the central bank creates the instability, and/or makes it worse than it otherwise would be, due to the impact of its forced expansion of credit (through the expansion of the monetary base) on interest rates in particular. In light of this analysis, it becomes evident that the central bank’s goals, which are repeated by the press every other day (balancing full employment and price stability) are blatant lies. They and the economic theories that justify them provide a cloak for the true goals of the central bank system: To inflate asset markets for its Wall Street friends To support, indefinitely, the deficit spending policy of the government To backstop the banking system and inflate its deposits Basically, the central bank is a tool for the theft of income and wealth for the establishment bankers, Wall Street dealers, and the pork barrel interests that influence government the most, as well as for the bureaucrats themselves, as they use it to grow the size and scope of government over time. We recognize that all of those things are justified by mainstream media, but the justifications are fallacious. Notwithstanding, debunking them is not our purpose here. For a more in depth understanding of the economic theory behind it, there are several publications citedhere. Or if you want a quickervideo elaboration, see economics professor Roger Garrison’s one-hour video. You may regard this elaboration as an intro or summary explanation of the theory, but with a focus on the difference between boom and growth. In order to understand the impact of the central bank’s money and interest rate interventions, it might help to define 'boom' and contrast it with genuine 'growth' because, in fact, the booms created by this policy can only ever undermine growth. One of the flaws of the GDP metric—and the approach of most economists in measuring growth—is that it is 'consumption' weighted. It is true that you can measure wealth by the value of final goods in theory, but in practice it is problematic and influenced by the inflation of money supply. More essentially, growth really ought to reflect the trends in production, and importantly, whether it is aimed at producing the things consumers want most urgently (i.e., which they value most). Consumer spending contributes between 60 and 70 percent to GDP, thereby understating all the spending on intermediate or producer goods. This way, economists end up measuring the growth of an economy by how much people spend on consumer goods from period to period. The more they spend, the more growth, presumably. The trouble is, how do you know if they are spending a part of the new wealth they are creating, or if they are depleting their savings, or just borrowing to spend more? The latter would not be an example of growth, yet would be regarded as growth by the government, media, and Wall Street. Certainly, the cause of growth is not consumption. That is only the beneficiary. The real cause of growth is saving and investment into the structure of production so that the economy can produce more, thereby enabling growth in consumption and wealth. Unfortunately, many analysts believe in theparadox of thrift, a puzzle whichAustrian economists solved long ago. This theory posits that while saving may seem like the right thing to do, collectively it produces depressions. This is because many economists see growth emanating from consumption and saving as holding back consumption. Falling consumption—even if it is to produce more growth so that consumption can grow in the future—is viewed as a negative. But because there is so much pressure on politicians to achieve GDP targets and to ensure that it is always growing, even when consumers don’t necessarily want to grow the economy in a given period, there is an immense amount of pressure on the central bank to stimulate investment with the printing press. By inflating credit artificially, they can stimulate investment too, except without the consumer having to make the sacrifice by abstaining in consumption. Hayek called it, 'forced savings.' You can call it 'fake savings.' The new money is mistaken for an increase in savings available for investment. But because capital is scarce and cannot be created out of thin air, if there is no curtailment of consumption, the resources (capital and labor) committed to another section of the production structure will have to be bid away to where the investment bankers want to direct it. Because this intervention bypasses or eliminates the trade-off that consumers have to make between consuming for today and investing for tomorrow, it fuels the demand for consumption and capital goods at the same time, which puts a strain on scarce resources, causing prices to rise. It crowds out real savings, encourages people to consume rather than save, and it allows the government to borrow without forcing interest rates higher in its competition for available savings. We should thus be able to grasp the long-term effects of such a policy. The investment boom that emerges is based on artificial incentives. The lower interest rates inflate the value of various capital goods, usually the favorites of investment bankers and bureaucrats. But this comes at the expense of producing the highest value consumer goods. So, it falls short in creating real wealth, and it depletes the real savings pool. The investment is driven into lines of production that appear to be economic under the ephemeral incentives but are not truly economic. This is not realized until the incentives have to be revoked, which typically happens when either prices rise so much that the central bank loses control of interest rates, or when the central bank revokes the accommodative policy to forestall that point, or for political reasons. At this point, the investment in unproductive enterprises, which is called 'malinvestment,' is laid bare, resulting in a liquidation, and often a financial crisis, thus a system-wide recession. The boom is not only unsound because the policy itself is usually temporary but because it has diverted scarce capital and labor into unproductive and uneconomic investments. Some economists have labelled it a 'cluster of errors' denoting the outcome of artificial signals in the marketplace. Since it diverts scarce capital and labor into the production of goods that eventually have to be liquidated because they are uneconomic enterprises in real terms, this undermines growth—because those resources were not available for the production of things consumers would have really wanted. Genuine growth is fueled by real savings increases. Only investment funded by actual expansion of saving can produce lasting growth. If people or businesses save enough to invest in the structure of production beyond the maintenance of their fixed capital, they will be basically adding to existing capital or forming new capital. The investment usually implies an improvement in productivity or output, or both. This allows for increased consumption in future. Conclusion A boom that is created by an artificial expansion in credit (with the help of inflated money), generated by government monetary policies, is not built on a solid foundation. And when the policy has to be reversed or when the imbalances come home to roost, the malinvestments are revealed as uneconomic, thus the market proceeds to liquidate them. This process is necessary to return the system to one that operates normally, which means one that reflects a market-determined balance between production and consumption so that prices and interest rates can more properly inform entrepreneurs. In this sense, the boom—even if it appears as growth in GDP or employment—is not growth, but rather represents a destruction of capital. On the other hand, the liquidation stage is healthy because it is simply the market trying to return prices and ratios to levels that reflect true signals. Normally the government and everyone else with an interest in the central bank will stop this liquidation before it’s complete because it is too punishing. They paper over it by trying to create a new unsound boom. Often with success on the surface since a boom feels like growth for most of us. But it is a squandering of resources ultimately. And the policy always runs the risk of producing a run in confidence on its funny money. If central banks and their interests were truly interested in eliminating the business cycle, they would stop manipulating money and interest. They would allow the liquidation to run its full course so that the market can reallocate capital and labor on a sounder footing. The important point to illuminate here is that not only is the 'boom' not the same as 'growth,' it comes at the expense of growth. It taxes growth.

Four More Items In The Wages Outpacing Prices Debate – OpEd	Ben Casselman had a usefulpiecein the New York Times examining the extent to which wages have outpaced prices since the pandemic. While he notes that for most people they almost certain have, there are people for whom this is likely not the case. In fact, this will always be the case, even in the best economy, which arguably is what we are seeing now, or at least best in half a century. But there are some additional points to the ones Casselman raised that are worth keeping in mind. Low Wage Workers’ Wages Outpaced Food Inflation First, Casselman notes that not everyone consumes the same basket of items. For lower income people, food is a larger share of their budget and food prices have risen more than the overall rate of inflation since the pandemic. This is true, but it is important to keep in mind that the lowest paid workers have seen the largest wage gains since the pandemic. To take an example, non-supervisory workers in hotels and restaurants had a 32.0 percent increase in their average hourly pay from before the pandemic. Their pay averaged $14.92 an hour in February of 2020. It had risen to $19.69 an hour in September of this year. That easily outpaced the 25.8 percent increase in food prices. No one would try to claim that someone earning $19.69 an hour today is doing well, but they are doing better than the person earning $14.92 an hour at the start of 2020. It would be hard not to score this person as being better off. 14 Million Homeowners Refinanced Their Mortgages Casselman notes that the widely derided increase in house prices has not been bad news for everyone. Specifically, the two-thirds of households that own their home might actually be feeling pretty good that the value of their house has risen. However, there is another aspect to this picture that is also worth noting. More than 14millionhomeowners refinanced their mortgages, taking advantage of the low mortgage rates we saw from the start of the pandemic until the Fed began raising rates in March of 2022. Those that didn’t borrow additional money with a cashout refinance are saving an average of $2,500 a year in interest payments. That would be a big deal for a family with an income around $80,000. For some reason these savings for a large number of middle-class families rarely get mentioned in discussions of people’s well-being. The Number of People Working from Home Has Increased by Almost 20 Million Since the Pandemic Working from home exploded during the pandemic. While it has fallen somewhat since the peak months of the shutdown period, the number of people working remotely is nearly 20millionmore than the pre-pandemic number. This increase is nearly one-eighth of the workforce. These people are saving thousands of dollars a year in commuting costs and other expenses associated with working in an office. They also are saving hundreds of hours a year in commuting time. Any assessment of whether we are better off would need to factor in the impact of the increased opportunity to work from home. Consumers’ Buying Patterns Tell Us They Feel Better Off One way to find out how people feel about the economy is to ask them. Another way is to see what they do. The answers to the first question can be somewhat ambiguous (almost everyone seems to feel they are doing much better than the rest of the country). The answer to the second question is less ambiguous. We see people buying more of just about everything. We have seen recordlevelsof air travel in the last year. We also saw recordlevelsof road travel on the summer holiday weekends. We know numbers can be skewed by the buying patterns of a small number of rich people, but that story is hard to tell here. Wealthier people do fly disproportionately, but with peak summer travel nearing 3 million flights a day, we are looking far beyond the one percent. That story is even more clear with road travel, with more than 60 million people hitting the road on holiday weekends this summer. We can also look to other areas of non-necessary spending that have seen big increases since the pandemic. Purchases of televisions was 79 percenthigherin the third quarter of this year than in the last quarter before the pandemic. (This is quality adjusted, so it does not mean 79 percent more TVs.) Inflation-adjusted purchases of restaurant meals was 10.5 percent higher last quarter than before the pandemic. Purchases at fast-food restaurants was 10.1 percent higher last quarter than before the pandemic. It’s hard to believe that the rich are driving spending at McDonalds and Subway. In short, if we look at what people are spending, they do seem to be considerably better off than before the pandemic. Again, this is not true for everyone. Some people have lost jobs and are now forced to work for lower pay. Some people have become disabled and may be able to work less (often because of the pandemic), or not at all. But if we are trying to look at the big picture, consumption patterns seem to be telling us that people feel they are better off today than they were before the pandemic.

In Post-Hasina Bangladesh, Awami League Faces Uncertain Future Af...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury With its leaders in jail or fleeing from justice, the party that led Bangladesh to independence and ruled for 15 consecutive years faces an existential crisis after a student uprising toppled the autocratic prime minister in August, analysts say. Students, who have since carried on with street protests, and some smaller political parties have demanded that the Awami League party be banned over the estimated 750 deaths linked to pro-democracy demonstrations that began in July and led to the fall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Last week, the interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus banned the Chhatra League, Awami’s student wing, whose members took part in violence that targeted students protesting against the Hasina government. Now, there are questions about whether the transitional government will follow suit by banning Awami and preventing it from participating in elections. Leaders of the student movement that toppled Hasina are serving in the Yunus government. Since Yunus took office on Aug. 8, he has promised to reform state institutions and prepare the country for free and fair polls. Hasina, who fled to India after resigning three days earlier, and her party had been accused of rigging recent general elections in Awami’s favor. 'Awami League is a 75-year-old party in Bangladesh. Sounds unbelievable but true: The Awami League faces charges of genocide,' Sabbir Ahmed, a political science professor at Dhaka University, told BenarNews. About 20 party members have been ordered to appear before the nation’s International Crimes Tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide, according to media reports. Hasina is the daughter of Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s founding president, who had led it to break free from Pakistan, whose forces were accused of committing genocide during the war of independence in 1971. The Awami party was founded in 1949, when Bangladesh was then known as East Pakistan. 'The party chief [Hasina] hurriedly fled to India, making hundreds of thousands of her party leaders vulnerable,' Ahmed said. Hasnat Abdullah, coordinator of theStudents Movement Against Discrimination, which had spearheaded the anti-Hasina uprising, called for the tribunal to put party members on trial. He also said Awami must be banned. Ahmed, the analyst, expects party leaders to remain and to organize online. 'TheChhatra Leaguehas been banned, but, I think, Awami League will not be banned, and it will stage a comeback, although slowly. They would take part in the upcoming elections – if they remain in the electoral political system, someday they will return,' he said. 'Awami League is a registered political party. There is no legal bar against conducting political activities, though their leaders have gone into hiding. The senior leaders will, now, utilize the online platform and the social media to organize themselves,' Ahmed said. An Awami League official who has been in hiding because he faces arrest over violence linked to the protests promised that his party would be back. 'The Awami League is a party having leaders and supporters even at every hamlet of the country. You will see we must return to politics, we are just waiting for an opportune time,' Joint Secretary Bahauddin Nasim told BenarNews. 'I do not claim that we made no mistakes. We are learning from our mistakes. We will present a reform of the party,' he said. 'If they ban Awami League, it will be more popular.' Another party member took a more hardline stance. Awami League presidium member Jahangir Kabir Nanak went on Facebook on Friday to declare that Hasina was still prime minister. He warned that the Awami League would one day try Yunus’ 'illegal' government. ‘Their future is not bright’ According to another analyst, Bangladeshis had largely been sympathetic to the Awami League and Hasina since the August 1975 assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But that changed when her government became more autocratic. '[T]his time, people are highly hostile to Awami League for 15 years of authoritarian rule. Their future is not bright,' Md. Shamsul Alam, a professor of government and politics at Jahangirnagar University, told BenarNews. 'The way party chief Sheikh Hasina abruptly fled to India without considering the safety of hundreds of thousands of her leaders and workers cannot be substantiated by any definition of leadership,' he said. He noted that the Awami League was split into three factions following Rahman’s assassination and in 2008, senior party members proposed dropping Hasina from her leadership role. 'But they overcame all hurdles in the past. This time, the crisis is existential as the party leaders are facing trials for misdeeds. This is difficult for them to overcome soon,' he said. Meanwhile, officials fromBNP, the top opposition party during Hasina’s rule, and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, expressed concern about possible future consequences. 'The Awami League leaders must face trial for massacres and other crimes. But Awami League must not be banned,' Zahir Uddin Swapon, chief spokesman for the BNP, told BenarNews. 'We have learned from the Awami League what consequences would await if the state authority were used in politics,' he said. 'We want the Awami League to be tried by popular judgment through votes.' Matiur Rahman Akanda, the publicity secretary of theBangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, agreed with Swapon. 'The people will decide about the Awami League for destroying the country’s democracy,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq9Nsl8hc-WrV	2024-10-28T16:52:21-07:00	
The 2024 Austrian Elections And The Rise Of The Freedom Party Of ...	By Saman Ayesha Kidwai The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) emerged as the largest party in the 2024 general elections, winning over 28 per cent of total votes (almost 13 per cent more than the previous election).1 The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) secured around 26 per cent of the vote share followed by Social Democrats with 21 per cent, the New Austrians with 9 per cent, and Greens with 8 per cent.2 President Alexander Van der Bellen has entrusted Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s government with administrative duties (as a caretaker administration) until a new leader assumes charge. Notably, the Austrian constitution does not specify a time period within which a new government must be formed after election results are announced. It could vary depending on the pace and success (or failure) of negotiations between various parties. The FPÖ was founded by Anton Reinthaller, a former SS Officer associated with the Nazi party.3 It was part of coalition governments in 2000 and during 2017–2019. While its primary support base is made up of people between the age of 35 and 59,4 it also acquired the largest support this year from a critical voting bloc—the youth and those part of the labour force—voters under 35. This development has spurred a wave of celebration among other far-right figures5 across Europe like Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini and Viktor Orbán. FPO’s performance shows that Austria’s political landscape is aligned with the broader shift to the far-right across Europe, with hardening anti-migrant rhetoric. Across Hungary, Italy, France and Germany, far-right politicians are steadily gaining ground amid the growing popularisation of conspiracy theories through social media, such as the Great Replacement6 and concepts such as Remigration.7 The recent policy measures introduced by the EU regarding immigration,8 which human rights organisations have decried, is a testament to disenchantment with the liberal democratic governance and globalisation. These trends have been supplemented by a resurgence of tribalism9 and nationalism, rejection of multiculturalism, widening socio-economic marginalisation and misinformation and disinformation that have become rampant on social media platforms. As has been observed since the 1800s, far-right and populist policies have gained momentum following a period of upheaval or crisis. Concerns regarding the viability of the Bretton Woods system and rising immigration levels across Europe, which had begun simmering mainly after the 2008 financial crisis and the 2015 refugee crisis, boiled over after the COVID-19 outbreak. As parties across the continent faced backlash for the lockdown measures and imposition of vaccination drives, the locals’ disgruntlement and skepticism about the implications of COVID-19 vaccines and handling of the health crisis grew louder. The anti-government sentiments festered as governments found themselves increasingly challenged at countering the false narratives about the lockdown measures and vaccines being promoted by conspiracy theorists rampantly. Austria was no exception to the pushback felt across the continent against vaccine mandates,10 and the far-right conservatives sought to capitalise on the resentment felt deeply by the populace in order to secure electoral benefits. The measure to impose a fine—ranging from 600 to 3,600—on those adults refusing vaccination, despite being quickly shelved, had evidently generated significant hostility among the people on the ground. Furthermore, the paranoia generated by FPÖ about Muslim immigrants outnumbering the majority population, failure of these immigrants to assimilate into the national culture, and potential Islamist radicalisation, potentially contributed to its recent success. It would not be improbable to assume that the projections by the Austrian Academy of Science that Muslims could comprise 12 to 21 per cent11 of the Austrian society by 2046, would have exacerbated the anti-immigration and anti-Islam rhetoric that has extensively been propounded by far-right parties such as FPÖ as part of its Fortress Austria platform.12 At the same time, the rising cost of living and gas prices and socio-economic crisis have worked in FPÖ’s favour. In the background of the Ukraine conflict and Austria’s dependence on Russian gas (surpassing the EU average), inflation and total household expenditures will surge as the bloc doubles down on Austrian consumption of Russian gas. Notably, FPÖ has argued favourably about continuing the purchase of Russian gas despite European attempts to diversify since 2022.13 Key Considerations The possibility of the Social Democrats combining with ÖVP and other smaller parties like Greens to form an alternative coalition government to prevent the FPÖ from assuming office has been discussed. President Van der Bellen has proposed14 that ÖVP enter into a coalition government with Social Democrats. However, such ideologically opposing movements would find themselves at odds over key domestic and foreign policy issues and could bolster the FPO’s capacity to emerge much stronger moving forward. The ÖVP, The New Austria, Social Democratic Party, among others, profess differing views on issues such as immigration, climate change, economic policies and multiculturalism.15 In the event a pan-ideological coalition government takes charge, there seems little to suggest that it would be able to curb the rise of the far-right FPÖ while maintaining a consensus on policy issues. The FPÖ and the ÖVP came together as allies in a coalition government in 2000 and then in 2017. Any political party hoping to enter into a coalition government would require to muster at least 92 out of 183 seats in the National Council (Legislature). At the moment, the FPÖ has the largest vote share with 57 seats. The ÖVP has 51 seats, the Social Democrats 41 seats, the New Austria Party 18 seats, followed by Greens with 16 seats.16 It remains to be seen whether the centre-right ÖVP will come to the aid of the FPÖ in exchange for concessions that involve a stake beyond the Chancellery.17 One of the key concessions, which seems unlikely at the moment, would require FPÖ’s leader, Herbert Kickl, to be sidelined from the subsequent coalition government. His party ran the campaign with him as Austria’s future leader. Simultaneously, he could step aside from claims to leadership in the government, based on the precedent established by the party’s previous head, Jörg Haider, in 2000, while exercising power through a proxy. If no coalition government can be proposed, the country and its leaders could be thrust into another round of elections. If negotiations between other political parties falter, Austria might find itself breaking ranks with the rest of the European Union members regarding the Russia–Ukraine conflict. The FPÖ has been critical of the sanctions against President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials due to the Ukraine crisis. This makes Kickl’s party one of the few pro-Russian political factions in Europe. FPÖ’s potential presence in a future government would be perceived as another concerning development following Robert Fico’s victory in Slovakia last year. Fico had also campaigned on an anti-Ukrainian narrative. Furthermore, FPÖ has envisaged remodelling Austria as per the model of governance practiced in Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. Several EU parliamentarians have criticised18 the erosion of liberal democracy under Orbán’s leadership and, therefore, would want Austria to presumably avoid the same fate. Conclusion It remains to be seen whether the FPÖ can convert the zeitgeist favouring far-right populism to emerge as the single-largest party and form a government without external support following the next elections. This is because, despite the Austrian tilt towards the far-right over the past several years, some key factors continue hindering the far-right from sweeping into power single-handedly with a majority stake. This includes the stark reminders of the policies enacted during the Nazi era, continued resistance (with its ebbs and flows) by political and civil society actors against cooperating with the far-right across Europe, and a largely pro-Ukrainian worldview among Europeans. Widespread protests, with numbers ranging between 15,000 and 17,000,19 were held in Vienna to express outrage against the far-right’s victory and to display resistance to Kickl’s ambition to sweep into power. These trends indicate that the FPÖ has challenges in its path of power and unless significant compromises can be made on its ideological platform and tangible assurances given to the public, it is unlikely to secure a stake in the government in the immediate future.

The Lifestyles Of The World’s Super Rich Threaten People And Plan...	The world’s superrich—including about 50 billionaires—produce, on average, more carbon through their investments, private jets and yachts in just over an hour-and-a half than the average person does in an entire lifetime, says a new Oxfam report released October 28. 'The super-rich are treating our planet like their personal playground, setting it ablaze for pleasure and profit. Their dirty investments and luxury toys—private jets and yachts—aren’t just symbols of excess; they’re a direct threat to people and the planet,' said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. 'Oxfam’s research makes it painfully clear: the extreme emissions of the richest, from their luxury lifestyles and even more from their polluting investments, are fueling inequality, hunger and—make no mistake— threatening lives. It’s not just unfair that their reckless pollution and unbridled greed is fueling the very crisis threatening our collective future—it’s lethal,' said Behar. The first-of-its-kind study, 'Carbon Inequality Kills,' tracks the emissions from private jets, yachts and polluting investments and details how the super-rich are fueling inequality, hunger and death across the world. Asked whether this would necessitate a voluntary change of lifestyles by the rich and famous, Alex Maitland, one of the authors of the Oxfam report told IDN: 'The super-rich have shown, time and again, that they can’t be trusted to voluntarily take action'. But this isn’t simply about individual responsibility, he said, 'it’s about reimagining the economic systems that allow, and even encourage, their overconsumption and pollution'. 'We need governments to step up, tax the wealth of rich polluters, and regulate corporations so that they cut emissions—not in small measures, but radically and quickly,' said Maitland. The report comes ahead of COP29, amidst growing fears that climate breakdown is accelerating, driven largely by the emissions of the richest people. The 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly known as COP29, will be the 29th United Nations Climate Change conference—and is scheduled to take place in Baku, Azerbaijan from 11 to 22 November 2024. If the world continues its current emissions, the carbon budget (the amount of CO2 that can still be added to the atmosphere without causing global temperatures to rise above 1.5°C) will be depleted in about four years. However, if everyone’s emissions matched those of the richest 1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in under five months. And if everyone started emitting as much carbon as the private jets and superyachts of the average billionaire in Oxfam’s study, it would be gone in two days. The report, the first-ever study to look at both the luxury transport and polluting investments of billionaires, presents detailed new evidence of how their outsized emissions are accelerating climate breakdown and wreaking havoc on lives and economies. The world’s poorest countries and communities have done the least to cause the climate crisis, yet they experience its most dangerous consequences. Oxfam found that, on average, 50 of the world’s richest billionaires took 184 private jet flights in a single year, spending 425 hours in the air —producing as much carbon as the average person would in 300 years. In the same period, their yachts emitted as much carbon as the average person would in 860 years. Jeff Bezos’ two private jets spent nearly 25 days in the air over a 12-month period and emitted as much carbon as the average US Amazon employee would in 207 years.Carlos Slim took 92 trips in his private jet, equivalent to circling the globe five times. The Walton family, heirs of the Walmart retail chain, own three superyachts that in one year produced as much carbon as around 1,714 Walmart shop workers. Billionaires’ lifestyle emissions dwarf those of ordinary people, but the emissions from their investments are dramatically higher still —the average investment emissions of 50 of the world’s richest billionaires are around 340 times their emissions from private jets and superyachts combined. Through these investments, billionaires have huge influence over some of the world’s biggest corporations and are driving us over the edge of climate disaster. Nearly 40 percent of billionaire investments analyzed in Oxfam’s research are in highly polluting industries: oil, mining, shipping and cement.On average, a billionaire’s investment portfolio is almost twice as polluting as an investment in the S&P 500. However, if their investments were in a low-carbon-intensity investment fund, their investment emissions would be 13 times lower. Oxfam’s report details three critical areas, providing national and regional breakdowns, where the emissions of the world’s richest 1 percent since 1990 are already having —and are projected to have— devastating consequences: Global inequality. The emissions of the richest 1 percent have caused global economic output to drop by $2.9 trillion since 1990. The biggest impact will be in countries least responsible for climate breakdown. Low- and lower-middle-income countries will lose about 2.5 percent of their cumulative GDP between 1990 and 2050. Southern Asia, South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa will lose 3 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. High-income countries, on the other hand, will accrue economic gains. Hunger. The emissions of the richest 1 percent have caused crop losses that could have provided enough calories to feed 14.5 million people a year between 1990 and 2023. This will rise to 46 million people annually between 2023 and 2050, with Latin America and the Caribbean especially affected (9 million a year by 2050). Death. 78 percent of excess deaths due to heat through 2120 will occur in low- and lower-middle-income countries. 'It’s become so tiring, to be resilient. It’s not something that I have chosen to be —it was necessary to survive. A child shouldn’t need to be strong. I just wanted to be safe, to play in the sand —but I was always fleeing when storms came. Counting dead bodies after a typhoon isn’t something any child should have to do. And whether we survive or not, the rich polluters don’t even care,' said Marinel Sumook Ubaldo, a young climate activist from the Philippines. Rich countries have failed to keep their $100 billion climate finance promise, and heading into COP29, there is no indication that they will set a new climate finance goal that adequately addresses the climate financing needs of Global South countries. Oxfam warns that the cost of global warming will continue to rise unless the richest drastically reduce their emissions. Ahead of COP29, Oxfam calls on governments to: Reduce the emissions of the richest. Governments must introduce permanent income and wealth taxes on the top 1 percent, ban or punitively tax carbon-intensive luxury consumptions—starting with private jets and superyachts—nd regulate corporations and investors to drastically and fairly reduce their emissions. Make rich polluters pay. Climate finance needs are enormous and escalating, especially in Global South countries that are withstanding the worst climate impacts. A wealth tax on the world’s millionaires and billionaires could raise at least $1.7 trillion annually. A wealth tax on investments in polluting activities could bring in another $100 billion. Reimagine our economies. The current economic system, designed to accumulate wealth for the already rich through relentless extraction and consumption, has long undermined a truly sustainable and equitable future for all. Governments need to commit to ensuring that, both globally and at a national level, the incomes of the top 10 percent are no higher than the bottom 40 percent.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zqww7EOR8tVG_	2024-10-28T16:48:26-07:00	
Pakistan: Target Acquired In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On October 25, 2024, a 19-year-old under training Army lieutenant, Arif Ullah, who was on leave at his hometown, was gunned down by unidentified militants during prayers in a mosque in the Sarai Naurang area of Lakki Marwat District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Two other persons also sustained injuries in the incident. According to a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Gentleman Cadet Arif Ullah was offering prayers in the mosque when the attack took place. The cadet was undergoing training in Kakul, but had returned to his hometown of Lakki Marwat on leave, ISPR said. On October 14, 2024, a Frontier Corps (FC) trooper, Gulzar Ali, was shot dead while two civilians sustained injuries after unidentified assailants opened fire on them in the Tank District of KP. Gulzar Ali was home on holidays. October 9, 2024, an FC trooper, on leave and visiting his family, was abducted in the Tank District of KP. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) affiliated channels claimed responsibility for the abduction. These incidents of targeting ‘on-leave’ SFs point to a new trend in recent months in KP. Though target killings SF personnel, particularly when they are off duty or visiting their homes, has been ongoing since 2023, when two such fatalities were recorded, there has been a sharp rise in such killing in 2024. According to theSouth Asia Terrorism Portal(SATP), at least 16 SF personnel have been killed in 16 incidents of such targeted attack in the current year. There is also a wider surge of attacks on SFs in the province. According to partial data compiled by SATP, KP has recorded 324 SF fatalities in 2024 (data till October 27, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, there were 260 SF fatalities. During the whole of 2023, there were 329 such fatalities. In fact, with almost two months remaining in the current year, SF fatalities in 2023 threaten to be the highest in a year since 2009, when 494 such fatalities were recorded. According to a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) report published on September 19, 2024, as many as 337 personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were killed while 616 injured in terrorist attacks carried out by terrorist outfits in the province this year. Dera Ismail Khan suffered the largest number of SF casualties, at 63, while Bannu suffered 58, North Waziristan 50 and South Waziristan 38 fatalities. At least 29 SF personnel were killed in Bajaur, 22 in Khyber, 18 in Peshawar and 16 in the Kurram District. Eleven SF personnel each were killed in Malakand and Mardan, 10 in Kohat, eight in Dir, two in Mohmand and one in Hazara District. Some of the major targeted attack on Security Forces in the current year include: October 24: At least 10 Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were killed and another three sustained injuries when their post was targeted by militants in the Draban area of Dera Ismail Khan District. October 8: At least eight SFs personnel were killed and two were injured in a militant attack in Kurram District. The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) faction of TTP claimed responsibility for the attack. July 15: A total of 12 terrorists, including two suicide bombers, and eight SF personnel were killed in a terrorist attack in the Bannu Cantonment of Bannu District. Jaish-e-Fursan-e-Muhammad, a faction of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group of TTP took responsibility for the attack. March 16: Seven soldiers, including two officers, were killed in a suicide attack on an SF post in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan District. Hafiz Gul Bahadur affiliated Jaish Al-Fursan claimed responsibility for the attack. February 5: At least 10 Policemen were killed and another six personnel sustained injuries in a terrorist attack on the Chaudhvan Police Station in the Dera Ismail Khan District. January 8: At least five Police personnel were killed and 22 were injured in a bomb attack on a Police vehicle in the Mamondtehsil(revenue unit) of Bajaur District. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack. The surge of targeted attacks against SF personnel can be attributed to the three principal factors: the United States (US)-Western withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan; the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 14, 2021; and finally, the collapse of ‘official talks’ between the Pakistan Government and TTP on November 28, 2022. The spike in violence in KP in 2023 was foreseeable, when TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali asked his fighters to resume attacks in the wake of the collapse of peace-talks. On January 2, 2024, the Federal Ministry of Interior informed the Senate (Upper House of Parliament) that the continuous influx of TTP cadres in significant numbers, with recruitment, training and deployment of suicide bombers, in the merged Districts [districts which were part of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and now merged with KP] of KP was 'cause for concern'. Significantly, when the US pulled its forces out from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind around USD 7 billion worth of military equipment and weapons, including firearms, communications gear, and even armoured vehicles. The Afghan Taliban seized the weapons during the chaotic US withdrawal. On September 8, 2023, the Pakistan Foreign Office expressed concern over the 'advanced weapons' being used by terrorists operating out of Afghanistan, in attacks in Pakistan, particularly on its security agencies. 'These modern weapons have fallen into the hands of terrorists in Afghanistan, who are using these [weapons] to attack Pakistan and its security agencies,' Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch stated. Meanwhile, the TTP is now the largest terrorist group in Afghanistan, enjoying operational and logistical support from both the Afghan Taliban and factions of the Al Qaeda terrorist network. 'The Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group: the bonds are close, and the debt owed to TTP significant,' states the 15th report of the ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda/Taliban Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council. Estimating its strength at around 6,000-6,500 fighters, the report notes that TTP is now the largest among the two dozen or so such groups that enjoy freedom to manoeuvre, under the oversight of the Taliban regime. The report notes that TTP 'continues to operate at significant scale in Afghanistan and to conduct terrorist operations into Pakistan from there, often utilising Afghans'. 'TTP has intensified attacks against Pakistan, significantly increasing from 573 in 2021 to 715 in 2022 and 1,210 in 2023, with the trend continuing into 2024,' the report, updated until May 28, 2024, states. Further, a new United Nations Security Council (UNSC) report released July 31, 2024, highlighted the severe threat to Pakistan's security from TTP, noting increased collaboration between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban in cross-border terrorist attacks, primarily targeting Pakistani military posts. 'With Taliban acquiescence, and at times support, TTP has intensified attacks inside Pakistan primarily targeting military installations,' the report from the UNSC’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIL (Daish), Al-Qaeda and associate groups, noted. Earlier on December 15, 2023, Pakistan urged a United Nations (UN) panel to investigate how TTP was acquiring modern weaponry to carry out terrorist attacks in the country. Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative, highlighted the alarming trend during a UN Security Council (UNSC) open debate on the threat posed by the diversion, illicit trafficking, and misuse of small arms and light weapons. He argued that terrorist groups like TTP acquire such weapons 'from illicit arms markets or receive them from entities that want to destabilise a particular region or country.' On September 9, 2024, frustrated with targeted killing by terrorists, Police personnel of Lakki Marwat District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa staged a protest sit-in against the terrorist attacks targeting law enforcement personnel. A consultation was held at the Police lines, where they presented their demands, including a call for full authority for police operations, and protection for officers. Following the discussions, they blocked the Bannu-Mianwali Road of the Indus Highway as part of their demonstration. Further on September 11, the Bajaur District Police announced the boycott of duties for Anti-Polio Campaigns because of Police consistently being targeted and killed while protecting polio eradication teams. The announcement was made in a video clip by scores of Policemen. The 50-second clip, seen byDawn, shows several Policemen gathered at the Police Lines in Khar, announcing their decision to boycott the vaccination drive in protest. Policemen from at least three Southern Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had already been protesting against the targeted attacks over the preceding week. In the wake of this new development, while the terrorists were equipped with modern sophisticated weapons, including sniper rifles and thermal sensors, the provincial Police forces who stand on the first line of defence, remain ill-equipped. On October 1, 2024, the Chief Minister of KP, Ali Amin Gandapur, chaired a high-level meeting in Peshawar to discuss peace and security in the province, particularly in the merged Districts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and southern KP. To enhance the capabilities of Police, 122 bulletproof vehicles were allocated to former FATA Districts, PKR 7 billion was provided for the Police in the merged districts, and PKR 1 billion was released for the purchase of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs). Additionally, 1,300 Police positions were announced for the Tank and Lakki Marwat Districts in Southern KP. Measures proposed by the Tribal Grand Jirga are also to be considered, including compensation for losses suffered by Tribal Districts’ residents. Despite the Provincial government’s claim of anti-terrorism measures to curb terrorism in the province, the terrorists continue to thrive and to target SF personnel with impunity.

India: Deepening Containment In Maharashtra – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On October 21, 2024, five Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadres were killed in an encounter with Security Forces (SFs) in a forest area under the BhamragadhTaluka(revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. The slain Maoists were identified as Sukhmati, RitaakaDeve and Jaya (women cadres), and Basant and Saoji (male cadres). Many criminal cases, including encounters, arson, murder, etc., were had been registered against these Maoists, who carried a combined bounty of INR 3.8 million. One Policeman also sustained injuries in the encounter. Police also recovered five guns from the encounter site. A press release, subsequent to the incident, issued by the office of the Gadchiroli Superintendent of Police (SP) stated, 'In view of the November 20 elections, a group of Maoists had gathered in the forest on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border for the last two days and was planning an attack. As many as 22 teams of C-60 commandos and two squads of the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] under the supervision of senior officers launched an anti-Naxal [Left Wing Extremism, LWE] operation. As soon as they reached the area, the SFs faced indiscriminate firing from Naxalites. The security personnel immediately retaliated, and in the ensuing exchange of fire, five Maoists were killed. ' Earlier, on July 17, 2024, 12 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter between C-60 commandos and Maoists at Wandoli village in Gadchiroli District. 12 bodies of Maoists were recovered from the spot along with seven automatic weapons, including three AK-47s, two INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifles, one carbine, and one SLR (self-loading rifle). Two SF personnel, including a C-60 sub-inspector and one jawan, were injured in the encounter. SP Neelotpal disclosed, 'Credible information was received yesterday morning that 12 to 15 members of Korchi-Tipagad and Chatgaon-Kasansur joint Local Organisation Squad (LOS) are camping in a forest area near Chhattisgarh border in Wandoli village with an aim to carry out subversive activities in view of the upcoming Martyrs' Week observed by Naxalites (between July 28 and August 3). Entire Korchi-Tipagad and Chatgaon-Kasansur LOS of Naxalites, including three senior cadres of the rank of divisional committee member, five area committee members and four Dalam (squad) members carrying a total reward of Rs 86 lakhs [INR 8.6 million] were wiped off in the encounter. Most of north Gadchiroli has been cleared of armed Maoist formations.' On May 13, 2024, three Maoists were shot dead in an encounter near Katrangatta village in BhamragadTalukain Gadchiroli District. The killed Maoists included PermiliDalam(armed squad) ‘commander’ Vasu Samar Korcha, who carried an INR 2.2 million bounty; Reshma Madkam, an ‘Area Committee Member’ and Kamla Madavi. Arms, including three automatic weapons — one AK-47, one carbine, and one INSAS assault rifle — and Maoist literature and other belongings were recovered from the incident location. 'Korcha and the two women were the last of the three remaining members of thedalam. The trio was trying to mobilise villagers and plan subversive activities,' SP Neelotpal said. At one time, the PermiliDalamlorded over a 1,000-square-kilometres patch in the Maharashtra. These incidents in Gadchiroli are indicative of the deepening containment against the rebels in the district, with the aggressive action against the Maoists resulting in the decimation of the rebel formations. According to partial data collated by theSouth Asia Terrorism Portal(SATP), at least 24Naxaliteshave been killed by SFs in the Gadchiroli District in 2024 (data till October 27). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had neutralised fourNaxalites, and another two rebels in the remaining period of 2023, taking the total to sixNaxalitesthrough 2023. TwoNaxaliteswere neutralised in 2022, and another 49 in 2021. On the other hand, in the fight against theNaxalites,SFs have not lost a single trooper in the district in the current year (till October 27). During the corresponding period of 2023 also, no SF trooper was killed, nor any in the remaining period of 2023. Moreover, no SF fatality was registered in 2022 as well as in 2021. The last SF fatality was recorded on August 14, 2020, when a Police Constable, Dushyant Nandeshwar (26) was killed while another Constable, Dinesh Bhosale was injured when a CPI-Maoist ‘action team’ shot them in a market at Kothi village under Bhamragad tehsil in Gadchiroli District. Significantly, since 2021, the SFs have emphatically crushed rebel activities/developments in Gadchiroli. Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documentingNaxaliteviolence and activities in the district and the State, the kill ratio emphatically remained in favour of SFs in 2006 at 1:16.5; 2007 at 1:4; 2008 at 1: 1.75; 2011 at 1: 2.22; 2013 at 1:3.85; 2016 at 1:11; 2017 at 1: 4.66; 2018 at 1: 25.5; and 2020 at 1:3. On the other hand, the Maoists got the better of SFs in 2005, with a ratio of 2.12:1; 2009 at 1.40:1; 2010 at 5:1; 2012 at 2.6:1; 2014 at 1.1:1; and 2015 at 2:1. Nevertheless, the overall kill ratio in the district remained in favour of SFs at 1:2.09. In the interim, according to the SATP database, SFs have already arrested nineNaxalitesin 2024 (data till October 27) in the Gadchiroli District, in addition to seven in 2023. 366Naxaliteshave been arrested in the district since March 6, 2000. Moreover, at least 12Naxaliteshave surrendered in 2024, in addition to three in 2023. 281Naxaliteshave surrendered in the district since March 6, 2000. The total number of arrests in the state is 490 since March 6, 2000, while 307Naxaliteshave surrendered. Civilian fatalities, a key index of security, have been following a cyclical trend in the district, without considerable relief. Three civilians have been killed in the district in the current year (till October 27). During the corresponding period of 2023, the Maoists killed one civilian. Through 2023, five civilian fatalities were recorded, in addition to five civilians killed in 2022 and four in 2021. The most common alibi given by the Maoists targeting the civilians was that their victims were working as 'informers' or 'spying’ for the Police. Several other parameters indicate that theNaxalitesare losing their sway in Gadchiroli and are also unable to orchestrate significant violence or disruptive activities due to aggressive SF consolidation in the district over the past four years and 10 months, since 2020. No major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in the civilian or SF category have been reported since 2020. At peak, four such incidents each were recorded in 2009 and 2010. Eight arson-related incidents have been recorded since 2020 – three in 2020, one in 2021, three in 2022, and one in 2023. At peak, 11 such incidents were recorded in 2019. The Maoists have engineered one incident of explosion since 2020, on May 27, 2019, during an exchange fire with a team of elite C-60 Commandos in Gadchiroli District. At peak, five such incidents were recorded in 2005. Gadchiroli, with a total area of 14,412 square kilometres, of which 11,694 square kilometres, i.e., 78.40 per cent, fall under forest cover, has, for long, provided an ideal and safe landscape for the Maoists to operate in, as the task of locating and sanitising extremists’ sanctuaries becomes difficult due to the exigencies of the terrain. Moreover, the district shares borders with Chhattisgarh, the worstNaxalite-affected Indian state, as well as with Telangana, historically the heartland of the insurgency, making it a perfect hideout for the Maoists. As a result, the district emerged as the epicentre of LWE violence in Maharashtra. Since March 6, 2000, Gadchiroli has recorded at least 721 Maoist-linked fatalities, including 166 SF personnel, 348 Maoists, 195 civilians and 12 in the unspecified category. At its peak in 2009, Gadchiroli recorded at least 99 fatalities, including 52 SF personnel, 37 Maoists, and 10 civilians. Thereafter, however, the district has seen a noticeable weakening of rebel strength. According to an October 25, 2024, media reportage, 10,000 additional paramilitary forces, approximately 150 drones, and 100 anti-mine vehicles have been deployed for poll preparations in Gadchiroli and Gondia, the two Maoist-affected districts of Maharashtra, to contain any potential sabotage the rebels during the upcoming Assembly election on November 20, 2024. SFs focused on sealing off the borders with neighbouring states, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh, from where Maoists could sneak in to disrupt polling. Further, SFs also decided to launch joint operations in the heart of the Maoist headland, Abujhmadh, to cut off possible entry and exit routes. The passage connecting Abujhmadh and the Maoists' alternative stronghold in the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone is also being cut off, with strong deployment. Sustained SF efforts to completely sanitise the ostensible ‘Red Corridor’ are essential to restoring an enduring peace in Gadchiroli and the region. The declining trends in violence in the district suggest that Maoist capacities are at a terminal stage in this erstwhile area of dominance. Aggressive operations to consolidate the gains are necessary to establish a lasting peace in the region.

Privacy In The Confessional: Is Your Smartphone Listening To Your...	By Jonah McKeown Anyone who uses a smartphone has likely experienced the same unsettling phenomenon — a pointedly placed advertisement that seems to show up right after you’ve discussed a topic or product. Could it be true that your phone is 'listening' to your private conversations? It’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer — and one that has bred enough uncertainty that bishops are starting to issue bans on smartphones in that most private of Catholic spaces: the confessional. Here’s what you need to know about the privacy concerns surrounding smartphones and how one Catholic diocese is responding. Protecting the seal Right off the bat, it’s important to point out that the Catholic Church takes privacy in the confessional very seriously. The sacrament of confession, also called reconciliation, was implemented by Jesus Christ as the means of forgiving sins. He passed the authority to forgive sins down to his apostles, who in turn passed it down to the priests of today. The 'seal of confession' binds priests to treat a penitent’s privacy with the utmost solemnity; in fact, over the centuries,some priests have chosen deathrather than reveal what they have heard. If a priest reveals any information he learned in the context of confession, he will be excommunicated from the Churchlatae sententiae— essentially, automatically. What about if someone else hears your confession, or you accidentally overhear someone else confessing their sins? Well, in that instance, the person overhearing the confession is bound by what is known as the 'secret' and is forbidden from sharing any of that information. It’s possible that a Catholic layperson could be excommunicated for breaking the secret, though normally it would involve a penal process rather than occurring automatically like it does for priests. As you can imagine, intentionally recording someone’s confession is also a big no-no. The Church formally addressed this problemin a 1988 decreein which the Congregation (now Dicastery) for the Doctrine of the Faith wrote that anyone who records or divulges a person’s confession is excommunicated from the Churchlatae sententiae. Smartphones — worth the risk? It’s long been known that the 'smart assistants' built into almost every modern phone, such as Apple’s Siri, do indeed 'listen' constantly for wake words such as 'Hey Siri' unless a user specificallyturns that setting off.(The odds are good that most tech-savvy people who are concerned about privacy have already done this.) Perhaps a deeper concern, though, is the myriad of smartphone apps that inexplicably ask for full access to a user’s camera, microphone, and location — despite no clear need for control over those aspects of a user’s phone. Could those apps be 'spying' on us? This long-simmering fear was thrust back into the spotlight late last year when itcame to lightthat CMG Local Solutions, a subsidiary of Cox Media Group, was openly bragging about its ability to listen through the microphones of people’s smart devices to 'identify buyers based on casual conversations in real time' using artificial intelligence. CMG quickly backpedaled when challenged, claiming that it had never listened to anyone’s private conversations and didn’t have access to anything beyond 'third-party aggregated, anonymized, and encrypted data used for ad placement.' Despite CMG having ties to Google, Amazon, and Facebook through those companies’ ad partner programs, all three of those companies denied they were ever a part of CMG’s 'Active Listening' program. But many have found these denials unconvincing. Browsing online, you’ll findpageafterpageof warnings that yes, indeed, your smartphone is listening in on you. (Granted, many of them are blog posts from cybersecurity companies that are selling privacy-related products, which makes them either more or less credible, depending on how you look at it.) Plus, the revelation from CMG throws some additional uncertainty into the mix. So what does the evidence say? According to one technology expert, it’s complicated. David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, told CNA that research he has personally conducted suggests that the question of whether our smartphones are constantly listening to our private conversations is, for the most part, 'no.' Choffnes, who is also an associate professor of computer science, conductedstudies in both 2018 and 2020to test the hypothesis that our phones are constantly listening. Choffnes and his colleagues ultimately examined more than 17,000 apps in an attempt to gain information about their potential to leak media content. While their analysis did uncover some security risks, 'we found no evidence that apps are surreptitiously recording audio from our phone’s microphones,' he noted. The results they got when they tested smart speakers like Amazon Alexa, however, were a different story. Most models they tested, as mentioned before, didn’t 'wake up' and start recording unless a specific 'wake word' was spoken. But sometimes, Choffnes warned, smart speakers can unexpectedly activate without a user’s knowledge because theythinkthe wake word was spoken. Choffnes also said their tests suggested that smart speakers generally collect 'only a few seconds of recording most of the time, but sometimes it was tens of seconds.' As for whether any actual human will ever hear those recordings, Choffnes noted that there have been cases where private conversations were made accessible to third-party contractors who listened to them for the purpose of improving voice assistant accuracy for speech recognition. 'So there is concern that real people have listened to real conversations. Contractually, these conversations should not be shared or leaked, but of course contracts don’t prevent misuse,' he said. 'In short, I think it’s always a good idea to be cautious, but I don’t think this [secret recording by smartphones] should be a primary concern for smart device users at the moment,' he continued. 'On the other hand, I do think there is incredible value in removing technology from spaces that we intend to be private — not only for privacy but also for peace of mind and elimination of distractions.' When asked about his opinion on policies banning smartphones in the Catholic confessional, Choffnes said that as a scientist, he 'strongly [endorses] this position' — and not just because of privacy concerns. 'I think the value goes beyond privacy, since these devices also serve as constant distractions that I would expect to be unwelcome in places of worship,' he said. Choffnes continued by saying, however, that it is important to point out that 'a mobile app recording your conversations is not usually your biggest privacy threat.' After all, it’s already well known that tech companies can and do track their users’ browsing history, app use, and exact location — using all of them for marketing purposes. Even religious apps havesometimes been caught exploiting user datain this way, he noted. 'Given how sensitive and personal one’s religion and religious activity are, I think this is an important consideration for clergy and congregants: Think twice about installing apps, try to read the fine print if you can, [and] don’t grant permissions that aren’t needed,' Choffnes said. And, he reiterated: 'Turn off your device when you need privacy and focus.' To ban or not to ban? Bishop James Conley of the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska,formalized a new policy this yearbanning priests from using their smartphones in the confessional. Father Caleb La Rue, chancellor for the Diocese of Lincoln, told CNA that he has anecdotally heard about several other dioceses implementing similar policies specifically over privacy concerns — fears of 'accidentally hitting [record], or worst-case scenario, a priest butt-dials somebody and broadcasts somebody’s confession,' he noted. The primary impetus for the Lincoln policy, however, was actually not privacy concerns but rather a recognition that a priest’s time in the confessional should be quiet, prayerful, and free from distractions, La Rue said. He said Conley had been 'strongly encouraging' priests to leave their smartphones out of the confessional since at least 2014, without going so far as to issue a formal ban until this year. 'You’re not going to have your phone out on the altar when you’re saying Mass — why would you have your phone out while you’re hearing confessions?' he said, adding it was important to counter 'the perception that the priest is scrolling Twitter while hearing confessions.' La Rue acknowledged, however, that many Lincoln priests — himself included — liked to make use of smartphones in the confessional for perfectly innocent reasons, such as for checking the time and looking up prayers or Scripture readings. Penitents, too, often bring their phones into the confessional because they have a list of their sins on it or because they have the Act of Contrition prayer pulled up for reference. At the end of the day, though, La Rue said the policy is really about 'removing anything that might possibly get in the way, or be an obstacle' to 'an authentic encounter with Christ.' 'It’s [about] trying to keep sacraments as holy encounters of God, especially God’s mercy in the confessional,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq39BLdUxuoEE	2024-10-28T16:43:08-07:00	
IRGC Chief Warns Of ‘Consequences’ For Israeli Strikes On Iran	(RFE/RL) -- Tehran is warning that Israel can expect retaliation for its recent attack on Iranian military sites, even as the country’s supreme leader appeared noncommittal on continuing tit-for-tat strikes between the two regional foes. Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said on October 28 that Israel will face 'bitter consequences' for carrying out air strikes on Iranian territory two days earlier. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei, also speaking on October 28, said that Tehran would use all available tools to respond to Israel's attack. Israel has said it successfully carried out 'targeted and precise' retaliatory strikes on Iranian military sites on October 26. The strikes -- which came in response to an Iranian missile barrage against Israel on October 1 that itself was in response to the killing of an IRGC commander -- came amid fears that Israel might launch a major attack that risked seriously escalating the possibility of all-out war between the two regional powers. Experts suggested that the strikes gave both Israel and Iran anoff-ramp to avoid a broader regional war. Iran has said that it received warning from Israel ahead of the strikes, the latest in a series of attacks and strikes between Israel and Iran related to Israel’s ongoing retaliatory war in Gaza and Iran’s role in supporting anti-Israel militant groups in the region. Iranian officials have insisted that Iranian defenses intercepted most of the projectiles that Israel fired on October 26 but have acknowledged that four Iranian military officers were killed in the attacks. Speaking on October 27 to the families of the Iranian military officers who were killed, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the Israeli action as a 'miscalculation' but stopped short of calling for an Iranian response. Instead, Khamenei called on government officials to 'understand the capability' Iran had and advised that while it was wrong to 'exaggerate' the impact of the Israeli strikes, it was also wrong to 'minimize' them. IRGC commander Salami was quoted by Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying that Israel’s military action had 'failed to achieve its ominous goals.' Salami also said the strikes were indicative of 'miscalculation and helplessness' by Israel as it continues to battle the Iran-back groups in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon. The Palestinian group Hamas is a U.S.- and EU-designated terrorist group that sparked Israel’s war in Gaza with a deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel has also launched an air assault and invasion against Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, part of which it controls. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the EU blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Reports suggest that satellite images of the aftermath of the Israeli strikes against Iran on October 26 appeared to damage facilities at military bases that in the past have been linked to Iran’s secretive nuclear program and to its ballistic-missile program. Iran has not acknowledged damage at either its Parchin or Khojir military bases that were reportedly targeted.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq5qTjJgfb5qG	2024-10-28T16:40:11-07:00	
Kim Jong Un’s Close Aide In Russia Overseeing North Korean Troops	By Taejun Kang A senior North Korean army official and close aide to leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Russia to oversee North Korean troops there helping Russia in its war against Ukraine, media reported. The North Korean troops, who according to the latest reports are mobilizing near the front lines in Ukraine, will be overseen by Kim Yong Bok, deputy chief of the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army, Japan’sKyodo Newsreported on Saturday, citing a Ukrainian military source. Kyodosaid it obtained a list of military officers in charge of the North Korean troops recently sent to Russia, and Kim Yong Bok was at the top. Although exactly when Kim Yong Bok arrived in Russia was not known, it was confirmed that he was there last Thursday, according toKyodo. Ukraine said last week that about 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were in Russia undergoing training. Russian President Vladimir Putindeclinedto deny or confirm that North Korea had sent troops to help his army, adding that Russia and North Korea would themselves decide how to implement a pact they struck in June that includes a mutual defense clause to help each other in case of external aggression. The arrival of the North Koreans has raised fears in Ukraine, its Western allies and South Korea about what they see as a dangerous escalation of the Ukrainian war. Kim Yong Bok’s profile has risen over the past year. His position as deputy chief of the army was confirmed when he was reported in state media as a member of Kim Jong Un’s entourage during a visit to a key operational training base in western North Korea in March. Moving to the front Kim Yong Bok accompanied the North Korean leader on a tour of reconstruction efforts in flood-hit areas of North Pyongan province, as reported in state media on Sept. 30, and at artillery live-fire drills by military academy graduates, reported on Oct. 6. News of Kim Yong Bok’s arrival in Russia came amid media reports that North Korean troops were mobilizing near the front lines in Ukraine, and combat with Ukrainian forces could begin this week. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Sunday that Russia was transporting North Korean soldiers to the front lines in trucks with civilian license plates. Russian police on Sunday stopped a Kamaz truck with civilian license plates on the Kursk-Voronezh highway, the intelligence agency said, adding that the vehicle was reportedly loaded with North Korean military personnel, but the driver did not have documented combat orders. Separately,The New York Timesreported on Saturday that the first North Korean troops had made the nearly 6,500 kilometer (4,038 mile) journey to the Kursk region as of Wednesday, with thousands more arriving daily. Citing troop movement data from a senior Ukrainian military officer, the newspaper said that as many as 5,000 North Korean soldiers were expected to have arrived by Monday. South Korea last weekreleaseddetailed satellite images it said showed the first deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. The United States also said on Wednesday it had seen evidence that North Korea had sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. On Friday, North Korean state mediacitedits vice foreign minister in charge of Russian affairs as saying he had heard a 'rumor' spread by foreign media that troops had been sent to Russia. The vice minister declined to confirm if troops were indeed there, saying that his ministry was separate from the Ministry of Defense.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1xAoQP4mfPS	2024-10-28T16:38:38-07:00	
South Africa: Home Affairs Issues First-Ever Certificates Recogni...	The Department of Home Affairs has issued the first-ever South African marriage certificates officially recognising the 'type of marriage' as 'Muslim'. After changes were made to the department’s internal systems, Home Affairs has granted the first batch of 33 marriage certificates for Muslim marriages for the first time in the South African history. 'Members of the Islamic faith community have made extraordinary contributions to South Africa’s history for more than 350 years,' said Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreiber. 'While it comes hundreds of years later than it should have, it is a personal honour for me to preside as Minister over the granting of marriage certificates recognising Muslim marriages. 'This is a major step towards enhancing the dignity of this faith community and reflects the ongoing commitment of Home Affairs to deliver dignity to all our valued clients. It is also an expression of nation building, and a celebration of South Africa’s unity in diversity,' Schreiber said. He said Home Affairs stands ready to assist all clients who similarly wish to have a Muslim marriage formally recognised. 'Additionally, we have enabled our systems to retroactively recognise Muslim marriages. At a fee of R20, clients can request a reprint of their marriage certificate specifying that they wish to change the wording to reflect that it is a Muslim marriage,' the Minister said. Divorce Amendment Act In May, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Divorce Amendment Bill, which amends the Divorce Act of 1979 to recognise Muslim marriages and safeguard the interests of Muslim women and children of Muslim marriages in the event that marriages are dissolved. The amended legislation addressed shortcomings in the Divorce Act of 1979, which differentiated between people married in terms of the Marriage Act and people married according to Muslim rites, especially women. The amendments enacted by the President provided for a definition of a Muslim marriage in the Divorce Act of 1979; the protection and safeguarding of the interests of dependent and minor children of a Muslim marriage; the redistribution of assets on the dissolution of a Muslim marriage and forfeiture of patrimonial benefits of a Muslim marriage, according toa statement issued by The Presidency at the time. It said the new legislation was a response to an earlier Constitutional Court judgment that recognised the need for and importance of protecting Muslim women and children of Muslim marriages, particularly when a Muslim marriage is dissolved.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq3GYPT28bm6U	2024-10-28T16:36:14-07:00

By Soe Nandar Linn Since the 2021 coup,the people of Myanmar have endured a severe economic downturn,human rights violationsand mass displacement under the mismanagement of the military junta. The depreciation of the Myanmar kyat against foreign currencies,the outflow of investments and an unstable business environmenthave all contributed to Myanmar’s economic decline. The organisation Armed Conflict Location and Event Data documented that 288 out of 330 townships across Myanmar have experienced12,739 armed conflictssince the coup, with 57,904 civilians killed — 4537 of them by airstrikes and heavy weapons. More thanthree million peopleare internally displaced as of August 2024and about 18 millionneed humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Development Programme reported that nearly half of the population was livingbelow the national poverty linein 2023, compared to 27 per cent in 2017. Armed opposition has beenintensifying, with the military junta losing control of more than half the country. The military has suffered from a significant number ofdefections, with soldiers leaving to join the resistance or fleeing the country. Amid these crises and facing a shortage of manpower, the junta activated conscription laws in February 2024. ThePeople’s Military Service Lawtargets men aged 18–35 and women aged 18–27, while theReserve Forces Lawconscripts veterans.Another orderconscripts men up to age 65 to form local militia groups known as public security forces. Through these laws, the junta planned to recruit 12 batches of conscripts annually, with a monthly quota of 5000 recruits per batch. Starting from April, the military began training four batches of conscripts. Forced conscription has fuelled fears among many in Myanmar, particularly working age young people, who are more likely to be drafted. The economic crisis in Myanmar, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, has already made it difficult for many families to bear the costs associated with conscription, such as bribes or the loss of income from a family member’s absence. This has led to a massive flow of people fleeing Myanmar, especially to neighbouring Thailand. After the conscription law was enforced, many young people queued at the Royal Thai Embassy in Yangon toapply for visas, while thousands have already crossed the border into Thailand, many of them undocumented. This has exacerbated brain drain, a crisis that started with the coup. The massive outflow of working-age individuals has severely affected all sectors, especially agriculture, leading to food insecurity and rising food costs. The new law has not only compelled young people to flee the country but has also driven many domestic businesses to sell their assets and relocate to Thailand.In the previous year, Myanmar citizens invested3.7 billion baht(US$ 111 million) in Thai condominiums, becoming the second-largest buyers after the Chinese. Thailand’sDepartment of Employmentreports that nearly2.3 million Myanmar migrantshad registered by July 2024 but there are still an estimated two million undocumented Myanmar nationals living in Thailand. In addition to the effects of conscription, the junta’s strict regulations on passport renewal are forcing many living abroad — particularly in Thailand — to become undocumented.Passport renewalis denied to those in Thailand on non-ED visas, a type of visa issued to students attending language schools or non-accredited educational institutions in Thailand. Other regulations include an additional 10 per cent tax on income earned abroad and amandatory transferof a quarter of earnings to Myanmar bank accounts through official banking channels. Since the coup, there have been over 4500 battles in all of Myanmar’s states bordering Thailand, wheremore than 90,000 refugeeshave been hosted in nine temporary shelters. In the past three months, 144,000 undocumented migrants from Myanmarhave been deportedby the Thai authorities. Since Thailand is a non-signatory to the 1952 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, it hasno legal obligationto provide protection for refugees. While there is a risk of forced enlistments in the junta’s armed forces, some deportees mayjoin the resistance forcesagainst the military. These multiple crises in Myanmar have also increased the risk of cross-border crime, including illicit drug trafficking, human trafficking and recently emergingscam factorieswithin the Golden Triangle region. Undoubtedly, Myanmar’s conscription law has significantly affected both Myanmar and itsneighbouring countries, particularly Thailand, in terms of humanitarian and security challenges. At present, armed resistance is the only viable path to oppose the military junta. As people are oppressed and forcefully conscripted by the junta, domestic unrest will increase and people will continue to flee.

ZIG’s Devaluation Reflects Zimbabwe’s State Of Perpetual Crisis –...	A vicious cycle of currency failure, policy inconsistency and short-term fixes has battered investor and citizen confidence. By Ringisai Chikohomero Less than five months after it was introduced, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) announced a devaluation of the ZIG (Zimbabwe Gold). The official devaluation on 27 September came a few weeks after the government startedpushingfor de-dollarisation. The reserve banksaidthe devaluation was in response to a‘resurgence in exchange rate pressures,’ which manifested in ‘the widening parallel market exchange rate premium and the increase in inflationary pressures.’ While the ZIG has been devalued to about US$1:25, it is still playing catch-up with the parallel market, which is hovering around US$1:32. The latter is closer to renowned global inflation monitor Professor Steve Hanke’sestimateof 67% devaluation of the ZIG since its introduction. The move puts ordinary citizens and businesses in a bind, and not for the first time. To the average civil servant who was paid the previous week, the announcement meant the ZIG component of their salaries lost 42.5% of its value – a major reduction in purchasing power. The constant erosion of wages has led to widespread dissatisfaction among public sector workers and further distrust in the economic and monetary policies that impoverish them. It’s now clear that ZIG wasn’t backed by gold, and Zimbabwe has insufficient reserves to back the currency Zimbabweans are accustomed to the vagaries of currency fluctuations. Over the past two decades, the value of citizens’ savings, pensions and insurance have been effectively wiped out, and their earnings whittled away. Respective Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) administrations appear oblivious to this impact on ordinary people, and government assurances that the currency will stabilise lack credibility. Business and private sector players have not been spared. Companies such as large retail shops and manufacturing firms are also burdened by currency instability and short-term reactive policy measures. Government controls and reserve shortages severely restrict access to foreign currency on the formal market. The formal allocation process, the auction system and the interbank forex market areflawedand reflect a pegged exchange rate that doesn’t allow price discovery. The reserve bank auction system has a nearly US$100 millionbacklog. At the same time, the interbank system fails to provide sufficient forex on demand. This makes it difficult for businesses that must apply for forex weekly on auction to plan, price goods, or invest in long-term growth. The informal sector – which operates almost exclusively in US dollars and is estimated to be 64% of Zimbabwe’s economy – has been a weathervane of the local currency’s credibility. It has the advantage of operating on a cash basis, escaping regulatory sanctioning and the formal banking system. Source: World Bank The black-market exchange rate often trades at double or even triple the official value for price discovery on an open market. This parallel market has become the government’s go-to scapegoat to explain the ZIG’s lack of traction, even though the parallel market is largely a reaction to currency manipulations and distortions by the monetary authorities. The distortions further point to persistent foreign currency shortages in the formal market. The reserve bank has been accused of manipulating forex by controlling access to foreign currency at the official rate, leaving businesses and citizens with no choice but to turn to the parallel market. The ZIG’s introduction was greeted with a mix of cautious optimism and scepticism from citizens expecting a similar outcome to the previous fiveattemptsat introducing a domestic currency. A local currency would be preferable, but many analysts question the government’s knee-jerk reactions and lack of transparency and consultations. Thehistoryof Zimbabwe’s failed currency and troubled economy is well documented, yet the government continues to make counterproductive decisions. Since the Zimbabwe dollar’s collapse in 2008, attempts by the monetary authorities and Ministry of Finance to stabilise the currency and support the ZIG have been largelyineffective. Several factors are to blame, including the ad hoc reactionary approach, fiscal imprudence, inconsistency in policy application and misalignment of policies with market realities. The currency crisis reflects governance overall – characterised by short-term fixes, propaganda and threats While the government said the new currency would be backed by gold reserves, the official devaluation and food inflation since August tell a different story. It’s now clear that the ZIG was not backed by gold and that Zimbabwe has insufficientreservesto back the currency. Such amismatch between government’s position and reality does little to engender trust. Currency instability is likely to make resolving the country’s external debt difficult. The African Development Bank-facilitated High-Level Debt Resolution Forum for dealing with Zimbabwe’s external debt crisis has three pillars. Comprehensive economic reforms by the government are one of them. Managing currency stability is a corepart of these reforms, but the government lacks commitment to fiscal discipline, transparent monetary policy and actions to militate against runaway inflation. Higher spending on infrastructure increases the amount of local currency in circulation, which defeats efforts at currency stabilisation. Zimbabwe’s unsustainabledebtstands at 96.7% of gross domestic product. The currency crisis reflects a deeper governance and ideological crisis. The ZANU-PF government has opted for politically expedient decisions at the expense of ensuring macroeconomic stability, which requires actively building confidence. This resonates with its overall approach to governance – characterised by short-term fixes, propaganda and threats. Zimbabwe’s biggest challenge is that the government is not invested in building a trusting relationship with citizens. Over the past two decades, citizens’ experiences have created a crisis of confidence in government that is impossible to resolve without significant political and economic reform. Source: Afrobarometer Rather than papering over the cracks, Zimbabwe needs a coherent, credible economic strategy. The painstaking task of restructuring the political economy, building public and business confidence, and long-term strategic thinking will be the Mnangagwa administration’s main challenge in the next four years. Without a consistent economic strategy, Zimbabwe will remain trapped in perpetual crisis, with ordinary citizens bearing the brunt of the government’s failures as the ZIG faces the same fate as previous local currency experiments.

North Korea And Russia’s ‘Far-Reaching’ Strategic Relationship – ...	By Abhishek Sharma Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's remarks on the presence of North Korean troops in its temporarily occupied territories have caught international attention, raising concerns about the state of deepening ties between Russia and North Korea. Following the announcement, the South Korean President called for an urgent national security meeting, after which South Korean intelligence agencies confirmedthat they believed that North Korea had sent their troops. However, both, Russia and North Korea have refuted these claims. Nonetheless, if proven to be true, this would be considered a drastic step up in their bilateral ties since the signing of theTreaty of Comprehensive Strategic Partnershipin June this year. Following the Treaty, there was already a visible increase in high-level bilateral visits between Russia and North Korea, from ministerial to senior officials. Nevertheless, the pace at which their strategic ties had developed signalled North Korea and Russia were not shying away from openly supporting each other. The troop deployment will only validate the deepening of their ties, highlighting the importance of North Korea in Moscow’s strategic calculus and vice-versa. Strengthening military cooperation All this started with Russian President Vladimir Putin'smeetingwith Kim Jong Un this year to reinvigorate their bilateral ties. Following the meeting, the relations have progressed at an unprecedented pace. Thus, the North Korean troop deployment will only prove that both parties are not hesitating to display their support on thebattlefieldand indiplomatic avenues, as already seen. However, thismilitary bonhomiebetween the two countries started last year with thevisitof Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu,who attendedthe Weaponry Exhibition 2023 alongside Kim Jong Un, signifying the importance of arms exports in this relationship. Post his visit, the defence cooperation has increased drastically, benefiting both the Russian andNorth Korean military economies. Nonetheless, the initial dealings started in thefirst year of the Russian invasion, when North Korea supported Russia by exporting arms and ammunition. Since then, the exports of military equipment have continued unabated. Some of the major arms exports between Russia and North Korea,claimedby South Korea’s Joint Chief of Staff, include 2,000 containers of military equipment, including 200,000 rounds and 1 million 122 mm artillery shells and 152 mm shells, respectively. Other arms exports, part of the tranche,includeshort-range ballistic missiles, machine guns, rocket launchers, and anti-tank guided missiles. Some open-source evidence of weapons transfer includes the Russian military jet routinevisitsto Pyongyang, the latest one on 18 October, when a Russian Air Force Ilyushin Il 62-M landed at the Sunan Airport in North Korea. A similar plane alsolandedat the same airport earlier last month on 20 September, then flew to Khabarovsk and returned to Pyongyang on 22 September. In addition, it issuspectedthat Russian naval vessels are also transferring arms from the North Korean port of Rason, infamous forexporting13,000 shipping containers carrying arms since 2022. As per South Korean Intelligence, North Korea has decided to send its troops to an active war,deployingfour brigades of 12,000 soldiers, including their special forces, signalling its allegiance to Russia. However, this is not the first time that North Korea has sent its troops to another country. During the height of the Cold War, it sent its troops to participate in wars inNorth Vietnamand Egypt. In addition, the country has also been accused of helping and training theTanzaniaandMozambique militaryand even providing missile systems. Besides, North Korea has always shown its support to both state and non-state actors in what it saw as a fight against Western imperialism. For instance, in the run-up to 1973, as war was becoming imminent between Egypt and Israel, and the formers severed ties with the erstwhile Soviet Union, North Koreastepped in, sending 20 experienced pilots and 1,500 personnel to support the Egyptian Air Force in handling their Soviet Air Force assets such as the surface-to-air missiles. Intensifying Russian support to North Korea In exchange for material support, Russia has also intensified its comprehensive cooperation with North Korea in diplomatic avenues like the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), even supporting the North Korean nuclearisation agenda. During a recent episode of an allegedincursionby a South Korean drone dispersing propaganda leaflets, Russia, unlike North Korea’s other northern neighbour, China, came out in support and condemned South Korea. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson,saidthat ‘Such acts are a blatant encroachment on (North Korea's) sovereignty and internal affairs to destroy its legal state and political framework and deny it the right to its development.’ This unequivocal support was quite unprecedented. Another landmark decision was the Russian veto of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, responsible for monitoring its multilateral sanctions. After its discontinuation, Russia flouted UN sanctions openly. For instance, Russian President PutingiftedKim Jong Un a Russian-made Aurus Limousine, openly violating the sanctions. Similarly, RUSI, a UK-based think tank report investigation,highlightedthe increasing oil trade by North Korean vessels from Russia’s Vostochny port, violating the UN-mandated 500,000 barrels of oil in favour of arms for oil arrangement between the two countries. However, the most serious U-turn was Russian support for the nuclearisation of North Korea; this stands in stark contrast to Russia’s traditional position. In a briefing, Sergey Lavrovsaidthat for Russia, ‘the very term of 'denuclearisation' as applied to North Korea has lost all meaning. For us, this is a closed issue.’ This is opposite to Russiancondemnationof Pyongyang's nuclear test and itssupport for sanctions. In 2017, a Russian spokesperson in UNSCsaidthat ‘his country did not accept the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s claim to be a nuclear-weapon State.’ This change highlights Moscow’s prioritising its geopolitical interests, supporting Kim’s nuclear agenda over proliferation concerns, unlikeChina, which continues to support denuclearisation. Far-reaching strategic alignment These developments, including troop deployment and arms exports, are tactical. However, there is a strategic logic to closer military cooperation between the two. To understand that, it is critical to look closely at the regional geopolitical dynamics in Northeast Asia between the US and its allies, South Korea and Japan. Two notable developments concern Russia and North Korea—South Korea-Japan-US trilateral security cooperation and NATO deepening ties with South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, the Japanese Prime Minister’s latest Asian NATO idea and the US Ambassador's remarks on Asian economic NATO have only strengthened the concerns in Moscow and Pyongyang about the West's and its allies' intention to corner them. Recently, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, in a press conference confirmed this thesis, stating, ‘It is obvious today that the United States and its allies decided to draw the Asia-Pacific Region into NATO’s sphere of interests by creating all these narrow and exclusive US-led military and political associations. This includes the troika formed by the United States, Japan and South Korea.’ While the question regarding why North Korea will likely send its troops is important, what is more critical to understand is what it is getting in return for its strong support for Russia. Whilst the answer to the question remains unclear due to the opacity of information, based on some reports and the recent Russian support for North Korea, it looks like Pyongyang has reached an understanding with Moscow. This understanding will likely entail providing military and diplomatic support both in materiel and kind, particularly as North Korea looks to modernise and upgrade its arsenal. Some reports suggest Russia has already supported North’s space programme, and other modern systems, such as fighter jets and air defence, will likely be the low-hanging fruits. Beijing’s unresponsive attitude and neutrality have acted as a tacit support to this relationship. Thus, going forward, if military cooperation persists between Russia and North Korea, we will likely see the latter coming out of its strategic aloofness and becoming a spoiler for the US and its allies in the region. This will likely have strategic implications for Northeast Asian regional stability and the larger Indo-Pacific region.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba And The Future Of Japanese Politics...	By Dr. Sandip Kumar Mishra In Japan’s post-Shinzo Abe era, the old days of frequent changes in top leaders appears to have arrived again. This will have implications for the country’s domestic as well as its foreign policy. Japan needs continuity and credibility in its top leadership particularly with global power transitions intensifying and becoming more complex. Unfortunately, this looks to be elusive after Shinzo Abe. Shigeru Ishiba is Japan’s third prime minister in the past four years. While the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its institutions still retain power and there is consistency in broader foreign policy, frequent changes in leadership complicate vision articulation, messaging to both friends and foes, and follow-up action on policies. Newly elected Prime Minister Ishiba is considered to be a 'maverick' in Japanese politics. He is a five-time candidate for the top post within the LDP, has held several important positions including defence minister, and himself claims to be a security expert. He also says that he reads three books a day, runs a YouTube channel, and has written a piece on his policy priorities published by the US-based Hudson Institute. His current success, however, can be largely attributed to the LDP’s old guard, who believe that for now, he will give the LDP a better chance in the upcoming October 2024 general elections. Speculations suggest that post-election, Ishiba may either be sidelined by the old guard as he doesn’t come from the LDP’s large factions, or that he may himself have to relinquish his position because of mistakes. Ishiba hurriedly announced his policy priorities after entering office. These include measures to address Japan’s demographic crisis because of the low birth rate and an aging population, and his support for the establishment of a NATO-like structure in Asia, in which the US-Japan alliance would be the lynchpin. In his own words, 'today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s East Asia,' and the security situation in Asia is 'the most severe since the end of World War II.' Ishiba was Japan’s defence minister from 2007-2009 but his tenure was not special. Recent sharp statements on security are more likely an attempt to carve out political space for himself and prevent the party’s old guard from sidelining him. Though called 'anti-Abe' within the party—because he contested against Shinzo Abe several times—he now appears to be following Abe’s style of leadership, with big domestic and foreign policy announcements. It will be interesting to see if Ishiba is also able to emulate Abe’s success in getting his point across credibly. Shinzo Abe cemented his leadership credentials through his ‘‘Abenomics’’ on the domestic front and Indo-Pacific strategy on the regional front. Ishiba appears to be trying the same approach to create a niche for himself, by making bold statements about Japan’s demographic crisis and an ‘Asian NATO’. This approach, however, isn’t easy. With a national debt that is 265 percent of GDP, and it won’t be easy for Ishiba to focus on or deal with the demographic crisis. Similarly, an Asian NATO also doesn’t sound feasible as important regional actors, who are also members of ASEAN and the Quad, don’t seem keen on the idea at this moment. So even as Ishiba adopts Abe’s approach, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to have the same effect. Shigeru Ishiba as Japan’s prime minister essentially means that the LDP is projecting a popular face for the upcoming elections. This is necessary because of the allegations of corruption within the party, and in all probability, he won’t continue for too long in this position after the LDP is able to secure victory in the elections. Ishiba, however, appears to be resolute in using this opportunity to strengthen his position and make himself politically viable in the long run. The question is whether Ishiba will be able to survive as prime minister, or the old days of short-term prime ministers in Japan are indeed back.

The Political Economy Of Vietnam’s North-South High-Speed Rail Pr...	By Nguyen Khac Giang Vietnam has had to struggle to develop an efficient railway system due to financial and technical constraints. In 2010, then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung proposed an ambitious plan to build a 1,500km high-speed rail (HSR) which would connect the two economic centres, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), bringing travelling time down to less than six hours. The project would cost US$60 billion, equivalent to two-thirds of Vietnam’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2009.[1] It was approved by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)’s Politburo and Central Committee, the highest decision-making institutions in the one-party state.[2] However, after heated public debates, the National Assembly voted against the project; 37 per cent voted in favour and 41 per cent against, primarily based to concerns about its economic feasibility.[3] Fourteen years later, the Vietnamese government revived the project, now with an estimated cost of US$70 billion. This time, the project appears more feasible – given the Vietnamese economy’s growing scale, the proven successes of several HSRs in Southeast Asia, and increased support from the public and from policymakers. However, concerns remain about its profitability, feasibility, and socio-economic impacts. Furthermore, the current deliberations are influenced by geopolitics, as Vietnam weighs potential partnerships. This essay adopts a political economy perspective to examine Vietnam’s HSR ambition. It starts by providing a brief overview of the HSR plan and its implications for the country’s overall socio-economic development. After that, it explores the political and economic motivations driving the government’s renewed push for the project and analyses the geopolitical considerations, focusing on the challenges faced by Hanoi in selecting a foreign partner. Finally, the essay discusses domestic concerns, particularly public support for the project, and concludes with reflections on the future of Vietnam’s HSR development. BACKGROUND Vietnam’s long, narrow geography underscores the critical need for an efficient railway system. However, financial and technical limitations have long impeded the development of such infrastructure. The national railway network, spanning 3,315 kilometres,[4] was largely constructed during the French colonial period between 1881 and 1936, with no significant expansion since.[5] The outdated one-meter gauge, which still comprises over 80% of the network, is a relic that remains in use in only a few other countries. Current train speeds are modest, with maximum speeds of 100km/h for passenger trains, and about 50-60km/h for freight trains. These are significantly lower than in regional neighbours where newer, faster lines have been developed. For example, the maximum train speed in Thailand is 120km/h (soon to be 250km/h when the Bangkok–Nong Khai high-speed rail line opens, perhaps as early as 2026) and in Laos is 160km/h with the recent completion of the China-funded Boten–Vientiane railway. This gap, coupled with China’s expanding railway network in Southeast Asia, risks isolating Vietnam from the emerging pan-Asian transport infrastructure.[6] As such, the North-South HSR project has become a crucial necessity to meet the country’s increasing demand for both travel and logistics. This is why domestic opposition to the project has waned. The renewed momentum behind the North-South HSR project is driven by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. In the post-COVID economic recovery, Chinh has emerged as a key promoter of mega-infrastructure projects, including the Long Thanh Airport and the 500kV Quang Trach-Pho Noi transmission line, despite an overall sluggish public investment environment.[7] He has also actively sought international cooperation from potential partners and lobbied domestic stakeholders to accelerate the project. His efforts have successfully garnered support from both the Politburo and the National Assembly for the necessary policy framework. On 28 February 2023, the Politburo issued Conclusion No. 49-KL/TW on the orientation for the development of Vietnam’s railway transportation system by 2030, with a vision towards 2045. Subsequently, on 9 November 2023, the National Assembly passed Resolution No. 103/2023/QH15 regarding the 2024 socio-economic development plan, calling for the effective implementation of the Politburo’s Conclusion No. 49. This includes accelerating the construction of several key national railway lines, particularly the East-West railway, and completing studies for the North-South HSR project, with the goal of approving the project’s investment plan in 2024.[8] At its 10th Plenum in mid-September 2024, the CPV Central Committee did indeed vote to approve the implementation of the HSR project with the 350km/h variant. This decision effectively cleared the most significant political hurdle for the project. The National Assembly is anticipated to formally endorse the project’s investment plan during its 8th session, scheduled for late October 2024.[9] ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS The construction of an HSR line in Vietnam is now more economically justifiable than when it was first proposed. The HSR would significantly reduce the travel time among key locations along the Hanoi–HCMC route, boosting domestic economic activities and partly solving Vietnam’s logistics constraints amidst increasing foreign investment. Future connections could enhance regional connectivity with neighbouring countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and China, thereby boosting trade and consolidating Vietnam’s position as a regional logistics hub. Additionally, the project is expected to stimulate real-estate development around the designated stations, reduce traffic congestion, and thus lower maintenance costs for existing infrastructure.[10] Environmentally, the HSR aligns with Vietnam’s sustainable development goals by providing a greener, energy-efficient transportation alternative that could reduce carbon emissions and lessen reliance on road and air travel. Vietnam’s economic growth over the past decade has significantly improved the financial feasibility of the North-South HSR. A proposed US$70 billion project, which would have represented two-thirds of the country’s GDP in 2010, now accounts for only approximately 16 per cent of GDP, making it more manageable, especially given that the costs will be distributed over a ten-year period during construction.[11]According to the initial proposal by the Ministry of Transport, the state budget would need to cover about 22 per cent of the total cost, or approximately US$16 billion. This proportion suggests that the project would not, at least on paper, exceed the government’s fiscal capability. The ongoing Long Thanh Airport project, which costs US$19 billion follows a similar financing model, and provides a useful precedent as the government proceeds with the North-South HSR project. However, concerns about economic efficiency persist. Vietnamese experts are sceptical about the project’s cost-effectiveness, particularly given that the current proposal includes a passenger line with a speed of 350 km/h and a capacity of 364,000 passengers per day, when projected demand by 2050 is estimated to be only 40 per cent of that capacity.[12] There are also doubts about the cost-effectiveness of an HSR line exceeding 800 kilometres.[13] Moreover, the projected cost per kilometre for the North-South HSR is approximately US$45.6 million, significantly higher than the Beijing–Shanghai HSR, which costs US$26 million per kilometre despite having a similar distance and terrain. For comparison, the average cost per kilometre of Chinese HSRs is around US$21 million for a 350 km/h line and US$17 million for a 250 km/h line.[14] Vietnam’s ability to keep the project on schedule and within budget is another significant concern. The country’s experience with metro projects in Hanoi and HCMC, where cost overruns totalled US$3.4 billion and almost doubled the initial estimates, highlights the risk of financial mismanagement.[15] It is not uncommon for projects of this magnitude to experience cost overruns. For example, the Jakarta-Bandung HSR, initially estimated at US$35 million per kilometre, ended up costing US$52 million per kilometre when it was finally completed in 2023, four years behind schedule.[16] Furthermore, the current focus on a passenger train with a 350 km/h speed does little to address Vietnam’s existing logistics problems, which are crucial for the country’s booming manufacturing industry.[17] Beyond the initial investment, there is a high likelihood that the government will need to subsidise the operational costs of the HSR, as is the case with other HSR systems around the world.[18] These operational subsidies are often substantial, which is why even high-income countries like Australia and the United Kingdom have abandoned their HSR plans after decades of consideration.[19] The current proposal for Vietnam’s North-South HSR project does not address the potential need for operational cost subsidies, leaving this financial question unanswered. GEOPOLITICS AND RAILWAY DIPLOMACY The sheer scale of the North-South HSR project presents significant opportunities for potential foreign partners, but geopolitical considerations are equally significant. When the project was first proposed, it was widely assumed that Vietnam would adopt Japan’s Shinkansen technology, which dominated the global market at the time. However, over the past decade, China has emerged as the leading power in railway technology, particularly following the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013. After securing HSR projects in Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, China is eager to extend its influence by exporting its HSR technology to Vietnam. Success in Vietnam would represent a significant geopolitical victory for China, particularly given Hanoi’s general reluctance to fully embrace BRI projects. Moreover, it would bolster the development of a China-centred connectivity network across Southeast Asia.[20] Japan remains Vietnam’s most trusted partner in infrastructure development and was the preferred partner in the original North-South HSR proposal. However, China’s rise has complicated this dynamic, and Japan’s status as the partner of choice is no longer guaranteed. After losing the bid for the Jakarta-Bandung HSR to China, Japan is determined to secure the Vietnam project as a showcase of its 'Partnership for Quality Infrastructure' initiative, competing with China’s BRI. In addition, Vietnam plays a crucial role in Japan’s strategy of constructing production networks through a division of labour among mainland Southeast Asian countries. In addition, South Korea has also expressed interest in participating in what is being termed Vietnam’s 'project of the century',[21] having successfully lobbied for the first overseas Korean-made bullet train in Uzbekistan.[22] In recent years, Vietnamese leaders have sought support from various foreign capitals without committing to any partner. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has made three visits to China in the past year, where he met with key Chinese railway corporations and directly asked for their support in Vietnam’s railway projects, including the North-South HSR.[23] During a visit to Japan in late 2023, Chinh also requested Japanese official development assistance (ODA) for the project,[24] and he made a similar appeal to South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol during a visit to South Korea in July 2024, highlighting the potential for a high-speed railway to serve as a symbol of bilateral cooperation.[25] High-speed rail cooperation was also a topic during General Secretary To Lam’s visit to China in August 2024, which culminated in an agreement to plan the Lao Cai–Hanoi–Hai Phong rail line.[26] However, despite prior discussions, the North-South HSR was notably absent from the final bilateral statements. It is clear that, similar to Indonesia and Thailand, Vietnam is leveraging its advantage as the project owner to attract alternative suppliers and strengthen its bargaining position.[27] Compared to other regional countries, however, Vietnam faces more challenges. Its long, narrow geography means that it may only be able to select a single technology, unlike Thailand, which has chosen Chinese technology for the Bangkok–Nong Khai line and Japanese technology for the Bangkok–Chiang Mai line.[28] Furthermore, the North-South HSR would be the most expensive rail project in Southeast Asia and among the most costly in the world.[29] Given the massive investment required, once a decision is made, it will be difficult to reverse, making the choice of partner—and by extension, the technology—crucial for the future of Vietnam’s railway infrastructure for decades to come. This partly explains why Hanoi is exercising extreme caution in making a final decision on the partnership. Additionally, Vietnam’s negotiating position with China is somewhat weakened by the operational status of the Laos–China Railway. With that project already in place, China may have less incentive to prioritise a Vietnamese HSR as the main line connecting China with Southeast Asia, even though initial plans for a regional railway network included Vietnam in the eastern route from Yunnan to Cambodia and Thailand.[30] DOMESTIC HEADWINDS Although domestic opposition to the North-South HSR project has diminished over the last decade, partly due to the rapid advancements in HSR technology and the positive coverage of HSRs in China and Laos, significant domestic concerns remain. One major issue is the political risk associated with choosing China as the main partner for the project. While China offers the most cost-effective option, strong anti-China sentiments in Vietnam make it a controversial decision for any leader. This is evident in the comparison of existing urban rail projects in Hanoi and HCMC. Despite the Cat Linh–Ha Dong line in Hanoi being the first operational metro project in Vietnam with fewer cost overruns than others, it has attracted the most public criticism.[31] Given the vast scale and decade-long construction period of the proposed North-South HSR, similar issues are likely to arise. While public support for the HSR project may be high at present, any incident during its construction could quickly shift sentiment. The stakes are particularly high as Vietnam might be able to select only one partner, unlike Thailand, which could involve both Japan and China in its HSR network.[32] Another concern is the dependency on foreign expertise for the project. Although Vietnam aims to localise the project, it currently lacks enterprises capable of absorbing the necessary technological transfer from international partners. This could lead to a prolonged period of reliance on foreign expertise for operation and maintenance, contradicting Vietnam’s ambition to master high-speed rail technology independently.[33] Moreover, there is a genuine concern among both the leadership and the population regarding foreign influence over critical infrastructure like the North-South HSR. This concern extends beyond the construction and operation of the railway to include land development projects along the route. A study in 2020 estimated that a significant portion (32 to 54 per cent) of the project’s profits would need to come from non-transportation sectors,[34] which would likely involve foreign builders due to the lack of technological capacity and management expertise among local partners.[35] The prospect of Chinese developers occupying prime locations along the North-South HSR would be particularly politically sensitive. A similar issue arose in 2018 when a draft law on Special Economic Zones proposed allowing foreign investors to lease land for up to 99 years, sparking nationwide protests over fears of Chinese control of strategic areas in Vietnam. Finally, the project might require a large population displacement, as it will traverse 20 densely populated provinces along a new route, rather than upgrading the existing line. Land disputes have long been a major social and political issue in Vietnam, and this project is unlikely to be an exception. Additionally, environmental challenges are expected, as the HSR line might pass through several protected biodiversity areas in the central region. CONCLUSION Today, Vietnam is arguably better positioned, both financially and geopolitically, to move forward with the North-South HSR project. However, the feasibility of this ambitious megaproject hinges on a careful cost-benefit analysis, which is fraught with uncertainty.[36] Domestically, the government faces the dual challenge of maintaining public support and managing the logistical, social, and environmental hurdles that come with such a massive undertaking. To minimise risks and potential public backlash, the government must proceed with extreme caution, prioritising transparency and public engagement in assessing the project’s viability. While the final decision will likely be influenced more by political considerations than purely economic ones,[37] ensuring public support through engagement is crucial for the project’s long-term success. Furthermore, Vietnam must maintain its agency in selecting international partners, leveraging its bargaining position while avoiding being entangled in great power competition. The choice of foreign partners, particularly between Japan and China, will not only determine the project’s success but also shape Vietnam’s choice for critical infrastructure for decades to come. To mitigate operational risks, the North-South HSR should be viewed as an integral part of a broader pan-Asian network. By connecting to Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, as envisioned in the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC), Vietnam can strengthen regional ties and solidify its position as a key player in Southeast Asia’s infrastructure development.[38] Ultimately, the success of the North-South HSR will depend on Vietnam’s ability to secure the necessary financial and technical resources while navigating the geopolitical and domestic political landscapes. The project could either become a cornerstone of Vietnam’s modern infrastructure or a cautionary tale of overreach and mismanagement. The decisions made in the coming years will be crucial in determining which path the country lands on. For endnotes, please refer to the original pdf document.

Strengthening Sovereignty: Indonesia, Malaysia, And The Philippin...	The South China Sea, a critical maritime corridor abundant in natural resources vital for global trade, has long been a locus of overlapping territorial claims. In recent years, China's assertive expansion of its 'Nine-Dash Line'/'Ten-Dash Line' has markedly escalated disputes, presenting strategic dilemmas for neighbouring Southeast Asian nations. For Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, incursions by Chinese maritime forces threaten not only economic interests and national sovereignty but also regional stability. This essay posits that a united stance, founded on regional cooperation and strategic alignment, is essential to counter China's expanding influence. By establishing a trilateral coalition within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), these countries can bolster their collective security, reinforce their territorial claims, and promote regional stability, thereby ensuring adherence to international law in the South China Sea. The Problem of Disunity: China’s Expanding Claims and ASEAN’s Challenges China's assertive territorial claims articulated through the 'Nine-Dash Line,' encroach upon exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and waters historically associated with Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Each of these nations has experienced regular incursions by Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels, disrupting economic activities and exacerbating tensions. Notably, Chinese vessels have increasingly violated Indonesia's Natuna waters, Malaysia's EEZ, and the Philippines' maritime boundaries surrounding the Spratly Islands. These unilateral incursions jeopardise national sovereignty and pose risks of militarisation, potentially creating flashpoints that could precipitate broader conflicts. Despite facing shared threats, responses from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have remained disjointed. Diverging levels of dependency on China, in conjunction with contrasting foreign policy orientations, have contributed to this fragmented approach. For example, Indonesia has sought to balance its non-alignment policy with economic engagements with China, whereas Malaysia and the Philippines have oscillated between diplomatic caution and overt condemnation of Chinese activities. This lack of cohesion has diminished the collective leverage required for effective deterrence, enabling China to exploit divisions within ASEAN. Although ASEAN possesses mechanisms for addressing regional security concerns, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, its consensus-based decision-making process restricts its efficacy as individual member states often prioritise national interests over those of the region. Implications for Sovereignty, Security, and Regional Stability China’s territorial claims and persistent incursions significantly undermine the sovereignty of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, thereby posing considerable economic and security risks. The South China Sea is home to substantial stocks of fish, as well as oil and gas reserves, which are crucial to the economies of these nations. For example, fisheries are essential for supporting local livelihoods, while the potential for oil and gas exploration could enhance energy security. However, China’s unauthorised activities threaten these vital resources, thereby impeding economic stability. Security concerns are equally pressing. The presence of Chinese vessels in contested waters is frequently accompanied by an assertive military posture, which intensifies the risks of conflict escalation. Such militarisation not only challenges national sovereignty but also contributes to regional destabilisation as the likelihood of military confrontation rises. Moreover, the unresolved disputes in the South China Sea have broader geopolitical implications, inviting external intervention from global powers such as the United States, which has committed to conducting freedom of navigation operations. This involvement further complicates regional dynamics and heightens the potential for superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia, thereby placing additional strain on regional peace. Proposed Solutions: Forming a Trilateral Coalition for Unified ASEAN Action A unified response from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines is essential for upholding regional security and maintaining the rule of law in the South China Sea. Establishing a trilateral coalition within ASEAN, provisionally termed the South China Sea Coalition (SCSC), could serve as a strategic framework for these countries to address shared challenges. Such a coalition would facilitate intelligence sharing, coordinated maritime patrols, and joint exercises, thereby communicating a strong message of regional unity and deterring Chinese encroachments. Furthermore, reinforcing these countries' claims through the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a crucial legal foundation. Although the Philippines previously secured a landmark UNCLOS ruling against China in 2016, enforcement has been limited. By collectively endorsing this ruling and submitting joint declarations to UNCLOS, the coalition can amplify international recognition of their rights, thereby strengthening their legal position. This approach underscores that China's historical claims lack a legal basis, contributing an additional layer of deterrence and a means for garnering global support. ASEAN's diplomatic framework remains vital in this context. Leveraging ASEAN’s role as a multilateral platform enables Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines to engage with other ASEAN members and foster broader consensus. By advocating for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, the coalition can assist ASEAN in adopting a more unified stance, thus enhancing the organisation’s credibility as a regional security actor. Within ASEAN, the coalition can address the structural limitations posed by consensus-driven decision-making by pushing for alignment on critical issues, even when achieving consensus proves challenging. Implementation Strategy: Long-Term Cohesion and Defence Capacity A robust implementation strategy will necessitate regular trilateral consultations and collaborative maritime security efforts among Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. High-level diplomatic meetings should be institutionalised, creating a forum for strategic alignment and intelligence sharing. This approach ensures that each country remains responsive to developments and can effectively coordinate its response. Joint patrols and military exercises will serve as visible displays of solidarity and practical mechanisms for deterring further Chinese incursions. A structured agreement on shared patrol responsibilities, coupled with unified surveillance efforts, will enhance maritime monitoring and demonstrate an assertive regional defence posture. The development of a coordinated messaging strategy is also essential. Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines should jointly articulate their commitment to peaceful resolution and rule-based maritime governance, aligning with global norms to reinforce their position internationally. By promoting transparent communication, these countries can mobilise public support within ASEAN, illustrating that regional sovereignty is a collective responsibility. Potential Obstacles and Mitigation Strategies Achieving a unified response necessitates the navigation of substantial obstacles, including economic dependencies on China and the intrinsic structural limitations of ASEAN. China continues to be a principal trade partner for Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines; thus, the potential for economic repercussions may inhibit the adoption of a resolute stance. To address this challenge, diversifying economic partnerships and reinforcing intra-ASEAN relations while promoting intra-ASEAN trade could diminish reliance on Chinese markets. This shift would afford these nations greater autonomy in policy decisions. Furthermore, ASEAN's consensus model presents another challenge. The coalition might advance informal agreements among ASEAN members regarding South China Sea policies without requiring unanimous assent. This semi-formal approach could promote stronger commitments while adhering to ASEAN's fundamental principles, thereby facilitating a balanced and unified response to shared security concerns. Conclusion Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines confront a collective threat in the South China Sea that necessitates coordinated action to uphold sovereignty, stability, and rule-based governance. By forming a South China Sea Coalition, these countries can attain a more assertive regional posture, safeguarding their territorial claims and economic resources. The role of ASEAN is essential, as it provides a multilateral platform that can elevate the coalition’s stance within a broader regional context. Through the adoption of a unified approach, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines can enhance their security, bolster ASEAN’s credibility, and support the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea. Recommendation To progress, the South China Sea Coalition should prioritise the establishment of regular diplomatic and defence meetings, the development of shared maritime patrol frameworks, and the submission of joint legal declarations to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). By aligning its initiatives within ASEAN and adhering to international legal frameworks, this coalition can formulate a cohesive strategy that reinforces ASEAN's collective voice, thereby ensuring that Southeast Asia remains a stable, rule-governed region despite ongoing challenges from external powers.

Agricultural Cooperation Among BRICS Countries: A Panacea For Foo...	Agricultural cooperation among BRICS countries is a crucial tactic to address the pressing issues of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that afflict the Global South. More than 3.2 billion people live in this region, which is facing a complex crisis where access to healthy food and sustainable farming practices sustain cycles of deprivation. Despite international efforts, 828 million people—many of whom resided in BRICS nations—went hungry in 2022. These issues are exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, and climate change, which disrupt food supply chains and reduce agricultural productivity. In this sense, the BRICS framework presents a unique opportunity for collaboration, enabling member countries to leverage their collective agricultural resources, technology, and knowledge. In order to address persistent issues like food security, malnutrition, and health problems, BRICS has made agricultural cooperation a top priority. As a crucial concept, Anne Garland Mahler of the University of Virginia has distinguished three primary definitions of the Global South. First of all, it has been used in IGOs to describe economically underdeveloped nation-states and as a post-Cold War alternative to the term 'Third World.' Second, it has been applied post-nationally to regions and people negatively impacted by contemporary capitalist globalization. Deterritorial conceptualization, which refers to the transnational political subject's resistant imaginary resulting from a shared experience of oppression under contemporary global capitalism, gives it a third meaning. Current State of Hunger, Poverty, and Malnutrition Hunger, malnutrition, and poverty are complex problems, have been facing by the Global South, which includes regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Despite the numerous interventions of national, regional, and international organizations, millions of people continue to suffer, and ongoing conflicts, economic instability, and climate change often exacerbate these issues. The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023 report estimates that 828 million people globally went hungry in 2022, with the Global South accounting for a significant portion of this number. According to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, a large number of nations in this region—particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa—have alarming or serious levels of hunger. The economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted livelihoods and food supply chains, are one of the numerous causes of this hunger crisis. Conflicts in countries like Yemen, South Sudan, and Syria have hindered food production and access. Furthermore, more extreme weather events like droughts and floods threaten agricultural productivity in already vulnerable areas, making climate change a serious threat. Around 700 million people, or 8.5% of the global population, make less than $2.15 per day and are considered to be living in extreme poverty. Progress has stalled because of low growth, COVID-19 setbacks, and increased fragility. In low-income countries, poverty rates are higher than they were prior to the pandemic. 44% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people, still live below the poverty line, which is more suitable for upper middle-income countries ($6.85 per day). Since the 1990s, the number of people living below this level has barely changed due to population growth. In 2024, 67 percent of people living in extreme poverty were in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the region only comprising 16 percent of the world's population. Two-thirds of the world's population lives in extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa; when all fragile and conflict-affected countries are included, the percentage jumps to three-quarters. Roughly 72 percent of the world's extreme poor live in countries eligible for International Development Association (IDA) assistance (Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet Report, WB, 2024). Malnutrition is a complicated problem with a wide range of manifestations in the Global South. Stunting is a symptom of chronic malnutrition that affects 149 million children under five, according to the Global Nutrition Report 2023. Stunting rates are the highest among in the South Asian nations. However, approximately 45 million children suffer from stunted children, a severe form of malnutrition that significantly increases the risk of death. Furthermore, 2 billion people globally experience hidden hunger, or micronutrient deficiencies, which can have major health consequences like impaired cognitive development and increased susceptibility to diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malnutrition is a major cause of child mortality, contributing to roughly 50% of deaths in children under five. Children who are malnourished have higher rates of morbidity and mortality because they are more susceptible to infectious diseases. Adult survivors of malnutrition are more likely to develop chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Indicating a dual burden of malnutrition, obesity prevalence is also increasing in the Global South. Malnutrition has a substantial financial impact; estimates indicate that it can result in losses equal to two to three percent of a nation's GDP because of decreased productivity, medical expenses, and lost potential. Many communities in the Global South are vulnerable to shocks, and they lack the resilience to deal with economic or environmental disruptions. Furthermore, social inequality is significant because marginalized groups, including women and children, are at the highest risk of hunger and malnutrition. Discrimination and limited access to resources make it difficult for them to get enough food and nutrition. International attention must be given immediately to the concerning levels of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that are currently occurring in the Global South. As the consequences of conflict, economic instability, and climate change continue to worsen, sustainable solutions are crucial to guaranteeing food security and enhancing health outcomes for millions of people. Cooperation, particularly within the BRICS framework, can lead to a healthier and more equitable future by significantly boosting agricultural productivity, advancing nutritional education, and enhancing food access. BRICS’s Potential for Food Security The food production and supply potential of the BRICS countries—China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, have been emerging substantially. With the addition of five more countries, the BRICS nations—which are both major developing nations and emerging markets—now produce around 40% of the world's grain. The 2021–2024 Action Plan's primary goals are to: accelerate agricultural development to improve nutrition and food security; improve the use of water resources in agriculture; increase trade in safe and high-quality agro-products; promote sustainable agriculture, with a focus on small and family farmers; and share agricultural best practices and information through BRICS platforms. The BRICS Strategy on Food Security Cooperation has identified key areas for collaboration within the food sector and delineated precise methods for their implementation. On 16–17 April 2024, Russia convened the inaugural meeting of the BRICS Working Group on Agriculture through videoconference. During this session, the member countries were introduced to the key priorities of the BRICS chairmanship in the agricultural domain: securing food security, enhancing mutual trade, and promoting sustainable agricultural production. Vasily Osmakov, the First Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, stated that Russia stands prepared to serve as the guarantor of the technological foundation for food security. He emphasized the importance of enhancing the BRICS partnership and implementing social technologies to address food security. Brazil, a vital supplier of fertilizers, significantly contributes to food security, with nations working in harmony within a unified agricultural production chain. In 2023, Russian farmers are projected to acquire 80% more fertilizers compared to five years prior and 2.5 times the amount used in 2013, reflecting a consistent rise in crop yields. In 2023, agricultural export revenues surpassed US$45 billion for the first time, marking a remarkable achievement. Over the past five years, these exports have nearly doubled. Over the past years, Russia has ramped up its exports of mineral fertilizers to the Global South by 25%, rising from 23.5 million tonnes in 2022 to 29.1 million tonnes in 2023. Approximately 1.2 billion individuals in the Global South rely on food cultivated with Russian fertilizers, representing 22% of all fertility nutrients utilized by local farmers. Hala Helmy El-Said, Egypt's Minister of Planning and Economic Development, highlighted the government's efforts to expand agricultural land and enhance crop yields, aiming to ensure food security for over 100 million citizens in the country. Mikhail Khachaturyan, an Associate Professor at the Department of Strategic and Innovative Development of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, emphasized that key initiatives in BRICS agriculture and food security include programs aimed at sharing farmers' experiences in executing agricultural projects under challenging conditions, as well as investment projects focused on land reclamation, seed production, crop cultivation, livestock breeding, and the establishment of water treatment systems. In June 2024, Moscow served as the venue for the 14th Meeting of BRICS Agriculture Ministers, presided over by the Russian Minister of Agriculture. The meeting addressed the advancement of sustainable agriculture, the creation of the BRICS grain exchange, and various other pertinent matters. The Russian Ministry of Agriculture is prepared to collaborate with BRICS members on exploring the potential for settlements in national currencies, as well as the establishment and advancement of a BRICS grain exchange. Agricultural Cooperation Among BRICS Countries With the theme 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security,' the 14th The BRICS Ministers of Agriculture convened in Moscow on June 28, 2024. The meeting not only emphasized the integration of new member nations into the established interaction mechanisms but also celebrated their accession to BRICS on January 1, 2024. The ministers acknowledged the significant role that BRICS countries, which represent over 45% of the global population and more than 30% of agricultural land, play in safeguarding global food security. To tackle ongoing challenges related to food security and nutrition, they highlighted the importance of creating fair and sustainable food systems, particularly for at-risk populations such as women, children, and smallholder farmers. The Agriculture Ministers of BRICS recognized the impact of natural disasters, climate change, inequality, and international conflicts while addressing the vital challenges surrounding food security. They called for the cessation of trade restrictions and unilateral coercive measures that could exacerbate these issues. They emphasized their commitment to accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in the realms of eradicating hunger and improving nutrition through innovative agricultural practices. Ministers agreed that a fair, transparent, and rules-based trading system, underpinned by the World Trade Organization, was crucial, with enhancing agricultural trade identified as a key priority. To ensure a consistent supply of food and essential inputs, they highlighted the importance of minimizing trade disruptions, particularly in agriculture and fertilizers. The BRICS Agricultural Research Platform has seen the member countries commit to enhancing research initiatives, utilizing technology to boost production, and developing as well as sharing sustainable agricultural practices. To safeguard natural resources, enhance soil health, and mitigate the impacts of climate change, there was a pronounced focus on sustainable agricultural practices. The ministers urged greater collaboration in advancing indigenous agricultural systems, acknowledging the importance of traditional farming methods. They recognized the accomplishments of the Agricultural Cooperation Working Group and emphasized the importance of South-South cooperation in enhancing developing nations' capacity to produce food. In order to strengthen BRICS' approach to food security, the meeting ended with plans to create a new Action Plan for Agricultural Cooperation for 2025–2029. The ministers added their support for Brazil, which will host the next meeting in 2025, and thanked the Russian Federation for hosting the event. Conclusion In conclusion, immediate and cooperative action is required to address the interconnected problems of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition in the Global South. The magnitude of these problems, which impact over 3.2 billion people, calls for sustainable solutions that go beyond conventional methods. Food security and health outcomes in the region can be greatly improved by the special agricultural cooperation platform provided by the BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS nations can promote sustainable practices, increase productivity, and provide fair access to wholesome food by utilizing their combined agricultural capabilities, which make up a significant amount of the world's grain production. Their efforts, like the creation of the BRICS Agricultural Research Platform and the BRICS Strategy on Food Security Cooperation, demonstrate a dedication to tackling food security issues while fostering resilience among marginalized groups, especially women and smallholder farmers. It is impossible to exaggerate how urgently equitable food systems are needed, since malnutrition continues to be a major cause of adult chronic illnesses and child mortality. In order to ensure that hunger and poverty are not only lessened but completely eradicated in the future, the BRICS framework's emphasis on sustainable agricultural methods and South-South collaboration is essential. The potential of the BRICS countries to revolutionize agricultural methods and enhance food security could be a cure-all for the Global South as long as they continue to create cooperative plans and projects. The BRICS nations can set the path for a more equitable and healthy future by continuing their dedication and collaboration, guaranteeing that everyone has access to enough food that is safe and nourishing. The collaboration in agriculture among BRICS nations emerges as a formidable answer to the pressing food security issues faced by the Global South. Through the integration of resources, technology, and expertise, the BRICS nations have the potential to propel sustainable agricultural practices, alleviate hunger, and enhance community well-being—demonstrating that united initiatives within BRICS could serve as a solution to food insecurity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTFpYFHaRgwmg	2024-10-27T16:54:54-07:00	
The Kims Are Coming – OpEd	After a few cat and mouse days of Defense Secretary Lloyd 'Raytheon' Austin’s denials, the Pentagon finally yesterday affirmed that therewasevidence of a North Korean military presence in Russia. Asked what they were doing in Russia, Austin replied,'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out.' For days, South Korea (no conflict of interest there) and Ukraine (nor there) had been claiming that thousands of North Korean soldiers had swooped in to rescue a beaten and bloodied Russian army from certain defeat at the hands of Ukraine (which has lost nearly a million men at arms in the nearly three year war). As the Russian army accelerates its pace,burning through the last fortified towns in eastern Ukraine,the mainstream media continues – with a few reluctant but panicked exceptions – to push the 'Russia is losing' narrative. The added twist of thousands of 'evil communists' from North Korea screaming across the Russian tundra (on horseback, no doubt) promises to add new plot lines to the drama concocted by the mainstream media and most of Washington, and indeed the usual suspects are biting furiously at the bait. Take US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Michael Turner. He is so outraged that there might be members of the North Korean military in Russia that he actually sent a letter to President Biden calling for war. 'If North Korean military forces join Russia’s war against Ukraine,'Fox Newsreportedhim to say, 'the US should consider the possibility of direct military action.' Against whom? We are already involved in a proxy war with Russia through Ukraine. We are already directly involved in Israel’s seven-front war against its neighbors and Iran. Who does Chairman Turner think we should attack if North Korean troops are present in Russia? Russia? North Korea? China? All of them? North Korea and Russia have justsigned a treatywhereby their two militaries will more closely collaborate and even come to each other’s aid if one is threatened. While such an agreement may give Turner and the other neocons the vapors, it is nothing different than the mutual defense treaty the US has with its NATO partners and with many others on a bipartisan basis. Treaties for me but not for thee? Is that the name of the 'rules-based international order' game? The hypocrisy runs even deeper. It is well-known and widely reported that NATO countries aretrainingUkrainian troops not onlyin NATO countriesbutinside Ukraineitself. So it’s absolutely fine for the US and its NATO partners to insert troops inside Ukraine to train its military to kill more Russians and to evenoperate sophisticated weapons systems inside Ukrainethat the Ukrainian military could never operate on its own, but if Russia strikes up a deal with North Korea where the two armies can train together inside Russia, it’s a 'red line' (as Chairman Turner wrote) that demands that we start WWIII. It seems we are not sending our best and brightest to Congress. What we are witnessing is the birth of a new narrative after some 500 Ukraine narratives have already collapsed under the weight of their own contradictions. Remember the two years of 'Russia is losing' narrative? Well just this week NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, saidin an interviewwith the German Spiegel magazine that Russia would emerge from this conflict actually STRONGER than when it entered! But of course they are losing… So what to do? Just as the Hollywood writers do once a sit-com has run too many seasons and is playing itself out, plot-wise, insert a new character. Insert anew twist, to bamboozle the viewers and give them a new reason to keep watching the program. It’s funny but not funny, because the future of the world hangs in the balance. Just like the film 'Idiocracy' has become a documentary in our absurd times, so has 'Wag the Dog.' The military industrial complex with its Hollywood-like allies producing endless narratives to keep the gravy train rolling… P.S. if anyone believes this whole insane and hysterical anti-North Korea narrative is not political…well I have a bridge in Brazoria, TX, to sell you… This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTJp-cVEvAVVq	2024-10-27T16:53:05-07:00	
Iran’s Response To Israel’s Response Could Be A Game Changer – Op...	The tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated to a point unseen in the past four decades, marking a critical juncture for the region. Recent strikes by Israel on military facilities in three Iranian provinces represent an unprecedented direct attack, further intensifying the hostilities between the two regional rivals. This escalation does not bode well for regional stability. If the trend continues, it could spark a wider conflict that would not be limited to Israel and Iran, but could envelop other regional players and even global powers.For several decades, Iran’s primary military strategy has revolved around asymmetrical warfare, leveraging proxy forces to achieve its objectives without directly engaging its enemies. This indirect approach has allowed Tehran to influence conflicts in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, while avoiding a full-scale confrontation with Israel. Iran’s government, particularly its Revolutionary Guards, has relied on Hezbollah in Lebanon, various Shiite militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen to counter Israel and its allies without provoking direct retaliation. This method has proved effective, allowing Iran to expand its influence without the risks of an all-out war. However, recent events suggest that there has been a shift away from this established modus operandi.The dynamic changed dramatically in April when Israel launched airstrikes on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, which Tehran regarded as a blatant provocation. In response, Iran did something it rarely does — it directly attacked Israel with missiles and drones. This marked a significant departure from Iran’s typical strategy of using proxies to fight its battles. The launch of hundreds of missiles and drones into Israel showed that Iran was and is willing to take greater risks.Following Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all of Iran’s domestic and foreign policies, particularly when it comes to matters of national security, wasted no time in ordering retaliatory strikes. However, despite the immediate strike orders, Iran chose not to sustain a prolonged attack. This restraint may have been a calculated decision, allowing Iran to express its discontent without fully committing to a costly conflict.The situation intensified even further after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which was followed by an Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon. In response, Iran launched over 100 missiles into Israeli territory, a dramatic escalation in hostilities. Israel, in turn, vowed to retaliate, raising the stakes to an even higher level. The dangerous unpredictability of these back-and-forth strikes has left both countries on high alert, where any miscalculation could lead to a full-scale war that neither side may be able to control. The escalation reached a new peak with Israel’s attacks on military facilities within three Iranian provinces. This direct strike on Iranian soil signifies Israel’s intent to degrade Iran’s military capabilities and serves as a clear warning to Tehran. This unprecedented move has placed Iran in a position where a robust response may be unavoidable, escalating the risk of regional conflict. The international community, including the US and European powers, is closely watching how Iran will respond, as any retaliatory actions could further destabilize the Middle East.The most critical aspect of this conflict is how Iran will respond to Israel’s latest and most direct strike yet. This moment could be the tipping point that either leads to a de-escalation of tensions or pushes the two nations toward full-scale war. Iran’s response will be closely watched by not only Israel, but also by the broader international community. If Iran chooses to respond strongly, it could trigger a chain reaction that would engulf the Middle East in a larger, more devastating conflict. On the other hand, a more measured response from Tehran could defuse the situation, at least temporarily.There are several potential scenarios that could unfold in the coming days. One possibility is that Iran will downplay Israel’s retaliation, choosing to treat it as insignificant rather than escalating the situation further. This scenario has precedent; when Israel launched airstrikes in April targeting an Iranian air defense facility in Isfahan after Iran’s missile attack, Tehran decided not to escalate the conflict further. Instead, Iranian officials played down the attack, and the situation cooled down. Such a response is seen as favorable for Iran, as it avoids the risk of direct war, which Tehran is likely keen to avoid given the current state of its economy which is under immense pressure due to sanctions and mismanagement.Iran may revert to its strategy of asymmetrical warfare, activating all its proxies across the region, including the Shiite militia groups in Iraq, to retaliate against Israel.Another possible scenario is that Iran will vow to retaliate harshly, but will delay any significant action in an effort to de-escalate tensions. This would allow Iran to save face while avoiding a costly conflict with Israel. By keeping Israel uncertain about when or if the retaliation will come, Iran can maintain psychological pressure on Israeli leaders, who would be forced to remain on high alert. This tactic has been used before, most notably after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. At that time, Iran ordered retaliatory strikes, but did not follow through immediately.Ultimately, Iran’s response to Israel’s latest move will be critical in determining the trajectory of this conflict. The tit-for-tat nature of these retaliations is incredibly dangerous. No matter how carefully planned a country’s military actions might be, the inherent unpredictability of war means that things can quickly spiral out of control. A full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel would not be confined to those two nations. Other countries in the region, such as Syria and Iraq, could be drawn into the fray, as well as global powers such as the US and Russia. This could lead to a conflagration that would engulf the entire Middle East, with devastating consequences for the region and the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTPFjyohAmdc3	2024-10-27T16:51:16-07:00	
Another Black Hundreds Group Revived In Putin’s Russia – The Unio...	Just as took place in the last decades of the Russian Empire, extreme right and often prepared for violent Russian nationalist organizations are springing up in Putin’s Russia, announcing their intention to fight against all the Kremlin’s enemies so as to defend the Russian people. The most prominent of these so far is the Russian Community organization which has branches in 140 Russian cities (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/10/extremist-russian-community-now-active.html), but it and most of its allies have been cautious about highlighting the obvious parallels between themselves and their notorious pre-1917 predecessors. Now, a new group has emerged whose leaders say they are not creating something new but restoring these tsarist-era groups. At a congress in Moscow in the Christ the Savior Cathedral, a group of more than 1,000 officials and activists announced the restoration of the Union of the Russian People (tsargrad.tv/news/sojuz-russkogo-naroda-tysjacha-neravnodushnyh-russkih-ljudej-obedinilis-radi-budushhego-rossii_1072812). Organizers, led by the Orthodox oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev declared that 'we are a union of Russian people who are not indifferent, a union of the Russian people, and that in our movement there are no limits.' They also said that the meting had attracted governors, deputies, business people, scholars, soldiers, priests, students and sportsmen.' Among the speakers were Duma vice speaker Pyotr Tolstoy, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova, Duma deputy Aleksandr Boroday, and former ROC MP priest and now prominent actor Ivan Okhlobystin. Their participation suggests that this new movement enjoys support from the Kremlin. On his telegram channel, Malofeyev outlined the group’s goals: 'Our ideals and values are simple: Russia is a great Orthodox state-civilization. The Russian people is the state-forming state and on its well-being depends the well-being of all the citizens of our country. The foundation of the people is a strong, traditional, multi-child family, the support of which is the most important obligation of the state' (t.leme/kvmalofeev/3053). The Russian nationalist oligarch said that 'the overwhelming majority of Russian people' support these ideas. 'We are the voice of the Russian Orthodox majority. The revived Union of the Russian People. All who are not indifferent to the future of Russia should join the Society Tsargrad and its Russian Militia.' (On that group, which took part, see t.me/s/russian_druzhina.) Not everyone in Russia is thrilled by this development. Moscow commentator Viktor Frolinsky suggests that it 'is designed to inherit all the worst in the Black Hundred movement of pre-revolutionary Russia: Ideological obscurantism, aggression and servility to those in power' in the country (vkrizis.info/russia/soyuz-czarya-i-grada/). Even the Tsargrad title that the revived Union of Russian People has chosen is indicative, he continues. This word 'refers to imperial dreams of Constantinople and the chauvinistic organization' of Aleksandr Dubrovin, an anti-Semite who eaded the predecessor of today’s Union of the Russian People and organized pogroms. Before he was executed by the Soviets, Frolinsky said, Dubrovin identified himself as 'a monarchist communist.' People like Malofeyev and his ilk can say they same thing. Indeed, they are now doing do.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTIgSnOpXlRK5	2024-10-27T16:49:02-07:00	
A Stunning De-Capitation? The Netanyahu ‘Madness’ – OpEd	A major war between Israel and Iran is soon likely to erupt – so says Israel’s Defence Minister Gallant. It will be initiated when Israel launches its long mooted strike on Iran. Gallant haspromisedthat Israel’s strike on Iran will be 'lethal, precise andespecially surprising', adding that Iran 'won’t understand what happened to it, or how'. ‘How’ so – an interesting choice of words. As of this morning, there is no sign of the lethal response promised by Gallant. It would appear that Israel which initially attached importance to responding swiftly and directly, is awaiting the THAAD anti-ballistic missile batteries to be set up – and for the U.S. troops that will operate them to arrive in Israel. THAAD likely is no ‘game-changer’. Iran proved on 1 Octoberits abilityto saturate and overwhelm Israeli Air Defence capabilities through two successive volleys of incoming ballistic missiles. The point here about the THAAD arrival is that, on the one hand, Israel isrunning shortof intercept missiles, and secondly, that drawing the U.S. into a war between the U.S. and Iran – is hugely more important for Netanyahu than keeping to timetable. The THAAD batteries paradoxically might do just that (draw the U.S. into the war). With U.S. forces now deployed on the ground in support of Israel’s military kinetic action against Iran, Israel effectively inserts an American ‘tripwire’ into the war drama: Should American soldiers be killed, then the U.S. is at war with Iran; It would feel bound to react forcefully to the deaths of American soldiers. Netanyahu has been wanting this war for 25 years. He can now see it taking solid shape – directly in front of his eyes. It comes too, from his perspective, at an benign juncture – just before the U.S. elections in which almost every candidate vies to pronounce his or her fealty to Israel. To be clear, this is no ‘small beer’. It may evolve into a major conflict with Russia, should Tehran be threatened. Israel’s genocide in Gaza and its inhuman – beyond all Rules of War – bombing of civilians in Lebanon to force a terrorised submission, has turned Russia into a full partner with Iran. Russia therefore, has worked hard to supplement Iranian defences with their own top-of-the-line defence systems. Russia’s role however likely will be confined to providing Iran with this defence assistance: Russian ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance); its latest electronic warfare system; certain missiles; and possibly S-400 Air Defence missiles (though their arrival in Iran has not been confirmed). Russia will have a prime interest in observing how these weapons perform against an Israeli strike. Should they function well, it will provide a major boost to Russian general deterrence. And here lies the key point: For Israeli Zionists and American neocons, the path to a de-fanged Moscow is viewed as passing through a de-capitated and defeated Tehran. Iran winning – the Resistance winning therefore – is very much a Russian interest. Excited by Israel’s de-capitation of much of the Hizbullah senior leadership, and heartened perhaps by unauthorised (and wrong) signalling from Iran that it might respond perfunctorily to an Israeli strike, Team Biden might well perceive a new Zionist-led Middle East about to be born. Will the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon intervene to stop the march to conflict – as they did over Blinken’s escalation plans in Ukraine? It seems unlikely. They have unreservedly supported Israel up to now. And they have agreed to send the THAAD batteries. The Joint Chiefs certainly will have experienced the strong pro-Israeli sentiment in Congress, in marked contrast to the growing disenchantment with Ukraine. Yet, taking on Iran – supported by Russia and China – is no small thing: Is it truly ‘winnable’? What if it isn’t? What if Israel loses – and therefore America loses? It would be an earthquake; a humiliation that would shake the western world. One commentator, James Kroeger, intriguinglypredictsthat 'Israel’s attack, if it comes, will be yet anotherdecapitation strike: This time executed in even more stunning fashion than the one they pulled off vs Nasrallah'. 'You see, the Pentagon won’t sign on to IDF’s plans to attack Iran’s oil fields or even Iran’s buried nuclear industry; but they have a history of supporting Israel when it targets the Resistance leaders who oppose Israel. Didn’t the IDF just use 82 – 2,000lb U.S. bombs in Beirut to kill Nasrallah? With full U.S. complicity? 'As a basic concept, the U.S. is likely to approve and possibly even enable a ‘decapitation’ strike on Iran’s key leaders in Tehran in the belief that Iran would be too stunned to respond with a ‘total war’ attack on Israel. After all, what did Iran do after Nasrallah was killed? Attack some IDF Air Bases in a way that killed no Israelis? Did it deter Israel from daring to attack Iran once again?' 'What the Pentagon wouldnotbe likely to approve is the use of nukes to decapitate Iran’s government – because it just might be enough to trigger the all-out war that the Pentagon so fears: But what if cunning Israel, after accepting America’s assistance in an operation to deliver a conventional ‘bunker buster’ bomb attack on the Supreme Leader, decides on its own, to also deliver a tactical or strategic nuke on Tehran that completely devastates Iran’s chain of command?' 'Understand, Israel’s intent isnotto avoid an all-out war with Iran, but to ignite one & using a nuke on Tehran would do just that. 100% guaranteed. Bibi understands that after such an attack, if Iran responds by attacking Israel with everything it’s got, he’ll be able to get Congress to pass a Declaration of War vs Iran'. 'MSM and the State Dept [together with Congress] would be marshalled first, to deny that nukes were used, and then to make emotional excuses for why Israel needed to use its nukes 'to defend itself'. The theme they’ll endlessly repeat: Poor Israel, threatened with annihilation by terrorists, resorted to the only weapons it had left to defeat the evil it was facing …'. 'Madness? Yeah. Netanyahu ‘madness’'… Yet, Gallant’s enigmatic 'lethal, precise and especially surprising: Iran won’t understand what happened to it, or how' – odd wording fits neatly with this Kroeger thesis. Big unknown: Will the Pentagon be able to take a stand and refuse to comply? Indeed the Pentagon consistently has opposed all-out war between the U.S. and Iran. Why?All the war ‘games’ played over successive years have resulted in America losing.

Israel’s Iran Reprisal, Middle East Destabilized – OpEd	On Saturday, Israel’s retaliatory attack was framed as 'carefully calibrated.' But in the absence of ceasefire, regional turmoil is simmering close to an edge, thanks to the escalation ladder. Early on Saturday, Israel hit Iran with a set of airstrikes, stating it was targeting military sites in retaliation for the 180 missiles that Iran fired into Israel over 3 weeks ago (which itself was a reprisal against a prior Israeli offensive). Officially, it was a 'carefully orchestrated, underwhelming retaliation' that was preceded by Israel's message to Iran ahead of the impending attack. But not everything is what it seems to be in the Middle East. The stories behind the stories The Israeli retaliation was designed to be underwhelming; not by the Netanyahu cabinet, but by the White House and the Pentagon. Presumably, portions of Iranian military sites in three provinces – Tehran, Ilam and Khuzestan – were hit. Iran said its air defenses successful and damage was estimated as 'limited.' Yet later, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated Israel targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.' It also hit surface-to-air missile sites and 'additional Iranian aerial capabilities.' To stress that the retaliation was more effective, the Israeli Air Force later claimed that these attacks had destroyed 'the backbone of Iran's missile industry', a critical component of its ballistic missile program. The targets struck were sophisticated equipment that Iran could not produce on its own and had to be purchased from China. Subsequent reports claim Israel destroyed air defense systems near oil refineries in retaliatory strike on Iran. If that’s the case, Netanyahu government was trying to minimize the damage it caused in Iran, to appease the White House and defuse a potential Iranian response. By the same token, Netanyahu struggled to deflect international attention away from atrocities in northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. The Netanyahu cabinet was playing with fire. Retaliation scenarios and repercussions Since early October, I had argued that there were basically three basic scenarios for an Israeli retaliation: First, a proportionate Israeli retaliation would signal might without causing widespread economic and human costs. A disproportionate escalation would also target vulnerable infrastructure. Finally, if the aim is to seek regime change, the retaliation would additionally target Iranian nuclear sites and critical military infrastructure, hoping to destabilize Iran for a US-style regime change. In the first case, Iran would likely contain its further response. In the second, Iran would escalate. In the third, all bets would be off in the Middle East and global reverberations would ensue. Israel’s Saturday attack seems to have been positioned within the scenario 1 (unless critical infrastructure was, indeed, destroyed which takes us into scenario 2 and more lethal consequences). This was a surprise to many who expected a massive Israeli reprisal, as President Netanyahu and his defense minister Gallant had pledged and the cabinet’s far-right had urged. Reaction in Israel The net effects in Israel? PM Netanyahu lost political capital. In part, he will suffer heavy criticism by the Messianic far-right. It seeks a war with Iran and would like to drag the U.S. administration into a regional conflict. At the same time, the opposition blames Netanyahu for the failure to better sync Israeli responses with Washington (the argument of center-right Benny Gantz). Another part of the opposition says Israel should have deployed a stronger response against Iran (the argument of the centrist Yair Lapid). The fact that a pure scenario 2-like retaliation did not happen - if that proves to be the case - is likely a direct outcome of hard American pressure. After all, the initial Israeli retaliation plan was leaked, which undermined the expected scenario 2 attack. Most likely, Israel’s initial plans were far more aggressive and offensive. Most probably, those plans were buried after U.S. pressure. If the Biden administration and/or its stakeholders were behind the leak, it would not be surprising. A regionwide war in the Middle East is the last thing the Democratic White House needs just two weeks before the U.S. presidential election – particularly as the fragile lead of Vice-President Kamala Harris is softening. Israel, Iran and US presidential race The way the Israeli response was constrained may contain the ongoing destabilization in the Middle East in the short-term; until the U.S. election day. That, however, is predicated on the assumption that the impending attack by Hezbollah against more than two dozen Jewish settlements in northern Israel will not further escalate the status quo. Nonetheless, during the U.S. presidential transition – between November and mid-January – there is another vacuum when much can still happen. It is not in the interest of Iran to attack. But it is very much in the interest of the Netanyahu cabinet and particularly PM Netanyahu to retaliate harder. To retain his immunity and avoid prosecution for corruption, Netanyahu depends on the far-right support. The bottom line: If Harris wins the US election, Netanyahu will face some constraints. If Trump emerges as the winner, Netanyahu is likely to see it as a carte blanche for a broad-scale Iran attack. Currently, both Israel and the U.S. share the strategic objective of destabilizing Iran and undermining its government. As I show in my bookThe Fall of Israel, these goals were developed in the US already two decades ago. The question is not 'what' and 'why', but 'when' and 'how.' The Middle East crisis is far from over. Tragically, the future of the Middle East is effectively a hostage of the U.S. presidential race. Regional uncertainty There are many possible scenarios, as long as Israel is able and willing to execute offensive actions in multiple fronts, thanks to the incessant flow of U.S. weapons to Israel, American bases in Israel and the region at large, and massive financial inflows of U.S. military aid. In the past, U.S. military aid to Israel amounted to $3.8 billion per year; last year, it soared to $18 billion. It is not transparent aid. The Biden administration has not disclosed its true extent. Financially, it contributes to the soaring U.S. debt, which already exceeds the size of the American economy. In the Gaza Strip and possibly in southern Lebanon, this aid has made U.S. complicit to genocidal atrocities. Thanks to the continued destabilization, the turmoil in the Middle East is simmering close to an edge. Worse, the uncertainty is likely to prevail as long as Israel’s genocidal atrocities, backed by U.S. weapons and funds, continue in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere in Israel’s proximate neighborhood; there is no ceasefire between Israel and Hamas; the Israeli hostages are ignored by the Netanyahu cabinet; the anti-Arab pogroms prevail in the West Bank which is effectively being annexed into Israel; the IDF keeps pushing deeper into southern Lebanon; Iran’s government and critical civilian and military infrastructure remain Netanyahu cabinet’s ultimate targets, with intelligence and logistical support by the United States. The worst is not behind. It has only been deferred, for now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTEjsVgkX2oon	2024-10-27T16:45:24-07:00	
For A ‘New’ Bangladesh: An Astute Strategic Prism? – OpEd	The sweeping protests in July-August 2024 that ousted Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s (Hasina) authoritarian rule, won the country an innovative brand---the 'New' Bangladesh minus the earlier steamroller governance. In the wake of that upheaval, which still rings throughout the country, two hot-button disputes reemerged from its not-so-hidden past: While Hasina’s sudden tumble ripples like a political earthquake in India, will New Delhi be a threat to Bangladesh’s future stability and sovereignty? Should Bangladesh reset its ideological and identity sensitivities as a bulwark against a future despotic menace? Both are existential questions. But Dr. Mohammad Yunus is now busy navigating between the populist cry for a retribution against the perpetrators of the banished tyranny, responsible for wanton killings and repression, and the simmering demands for an early restoration of an elected democracy. The post-Hasina leaders need an astute strategy to deal with the emerging Bangladesh-India encounters and the ideological contents for the country’s national integrity and sovereignty. Neither the strategic imperatives nor the ideological probes will take care of themselves---not in 'new' Bangladesh where Hasina’s earlier autocratic rule is more than a painful remembrance! Her swift collapse has severely jolted India, the persistent benefactor of the hegemonic leadership that rigged three consecutive elections boycotted by the opposition parties. And the maximum number of Bangladeshis are more confident now, which is likely to pop up in their domestic and diplomatic aspirations. Geo-politics, however, does not give Bangladesh easy choices in dealing with its big and powerful neighbor that surrounds the country from three sides. But India’s enormous size and its military as well as economic prowess have not yet offered an unrestrained diplomatic advantage over Bangladesh, still blistering against its ousted autocrat, now sheltered in India. New Delhi’s old political ties to the AL and its remnants scattered across the band evoke deep suspicion in Bangladesh. Not long ago, Guardian, the British newspaper disparaged India’s strategy of putting all its diplomatic eggs in the basket of one leader (Hasina) and one party (Awami League/AL) as a 'myopic' venture. India hopes for Bangladesh’s 'eternal obligation' to yield to New Delhi’s wishes because of its overt and covert help towards the 1971 struggle for independence. Narendra Modi’s brazen anti-Muslim policy is humiliating to the Bangladeshi Muslims although the Hasina government did not raise an eyebrow against India’s Hindutva zealots. It will be a thorn in the future Indo-Bangladesh relations. New Delhi tries to handcuff Dhaka’s domestic and foreign policies on the grounds of the (Bengali) Hindu minority’s alleged insecurity in Bangladesh while the Indian media continues to smear Bangladesh’s current Interim Regime for its apparent capitulation to the Islamic militants and their leaders. Badruddin Umar, a senior socio-political commentator in Dhaka recently pointed out that the Indian intellectual community has been mostly silent about the unprecedented protests that recently dislodged a dictatorship after an enormous loss of lives and destruction of infrastructures. Hasina’s rapid plunge on August 5 dramatized India’s loss in Bangladesh, but India’s popularity faltered with the bulk of Bangladeshis, not long after the 1971 independence. As New Delhi became the enabler of the Hasina-led single party (AL) juggernaut, India’s unpopularity spiraled in Bangladesh throughout the last decade. India will be a threat to Bangladesh’s internal politics and stability if New Delhi tries for a 'regime change' by rehabilitating and regrouping Hasina and her AL. She has settled in a virtual exile in India, but scores of the AL leaders have also fled to India, and the whispering reminiscences of the 1971 Indian military intervention stoke up anxiety in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshis itch for Hasina’s extradition to face a domestic or international trial for the hundreds of students and ordinary citizens deliberately killed or wounded by the politicized police, security forces and the AL-hired goons during the tumultuous civil unrest in July-August 2024. China, New Delhi’s archrival may now extract more geo-political advantages from the post-Hasina regime; it will not be welcome to India and the western rivals vying for influence in the region. The storm of protests that evicted the Hasina government changed the country’s political calculus. The secular Bangalee nationalism that gained an unprecedented ascendancy against the earlier Pakistani Muslim nationalism exhausted its political traction since 1971. Secularism and Bengali nationalism provided an ideological cover for Hasina’s long tyrannical rule. She also postured her regime as a thundering protection against Islamic orthodoxy in Bangladesh. Those appeals, exclusionary in their substances, merit a reset although it is not yet certain if Dr. M. Yunus’ cabinet is ready to step into emotionally charged identity debates. The western style secularism has failed to take roots in most Muslim countries including Bangladesh mainly because the social, political, and religious interactions in the Muslim-majority countries are not identical with those of the European and North American nation-states. The stringent secular rhetoric that indeed equated conventional Islamic expressions with hardline fundamentalism hastened the country’s political polarization. The Muslim political inheritances of Colonial Bengal, the 1947 Partition and former East Pakistan connect with what is independent Bangladesh today. Not surprisingly, the Bangladesh government exiled in India in 1971 did not have enough time to deliberate on the details of the expected country’s ideological and identity configuration. Even though their political and historical contexts did not match, Bengali nationalism sauteed in Rabindranath Tagore’s patriotic song as the national anthem became a convenient choice blessed by India at those critical hours. Later in Bangladesh, the 'pro-liberation forces' and their 'cult of patriotic fervor,' a vocabulary borrowed from (late) Ashok Mitra, a West Bengali leftist intellectual, denied the Muslim inspiration’s space in the country’s chronicle. But those ideological postures effectively helped the AL to consolidate its authority multiple times---by Hasina in recent years, but also by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Sheikh Mujib) at the dawn of Bangladesh. Muslim distinctiveness, not a religious extremism, is a security asset for Bangladesh’s sovereignty, independence, and integrity. Once A.K. Fazlul Haque, in the 1940s, called upon the people not to apologize for being Muslims. The liberal perception of the Islamic groups as the 'enemy' of Bangladesh sovereignty is a dangerous appellation that undermines national harmony. The Islamic parties stand for the curse of the liberal intellectuals and politicians---the stance goes beyond the right-wing parties’ controversial resistance to the 1971 breakup of Pakistan. In my Asian Survey, November 1994, article, 'The Liberals and the Religious Right in Bangladesh,' I observed that the right-left controversy eventually destabilized peace and democracy in Bangladesh while, globally, that time-worn dichotomy gradually yielded to a more pragmatic and multilateral view of life. The feisty Muslim consciousness, however, survived through their populist roots. Partly, the liberal-secular clash emanates from the liberal establishment’s 'blind spot' about religion. Anyone who appeals to Islamic values endures the relegation as a Maulabadi (fundamentalist/fanatic), enemy of Bangladesh independence scratching for zealotry. The AL and their liberal allies abused this epithet as a political capital against the so-called religious right. But the country’s strategic future and its democratic development call for participation of all groups including the Islamists in the political process. Majority of the liberal leaders, their outfits and the cohorts did not raise a hell against the New Delhi-supported authoritarian regime for the last fifteen years. Hasina’s ultimate downfall came from the swelling anti-job-quota roil that transformed into a fearsome coalition against her long dictatorship. The widening political upheaval involved diverse elements--- the opposition-blessed protestors, rightwing Islamic campaigners and the ordinary citizens who came out of their hiding plus a handful of human rights NGOs. The courageous student coordinators from both sides of the ideological scale blasted through deaths and destruction conducted by the police and the armed partisans. But it was an effective example of a strategic partnership between the right and left to exorcise a merciless autocracy that consistently denied democracy, fair election, and a peaceful political transition in Bangladesh.

Militant Attacks And Challenges To Peace In Jammu And Kashmir – O...	The region of Jammu and Kashmir is witnessing signs of renewed tension, challenging the anticipated transition toward democracy and stability. A recent series of violent attacks have raised alarm, indicating the complex security scenario that both the central and state governments must address. Shortly after the newly elected government took office, the region experienced multiple attacks that threatened to destabilize the administration’s efforts to restore order. One such attack occurred on October 24, near Gulmarg, when terrorists ambushed an Army vehicle, resulting in the deaths of two civilians and two soldiers, with several others injured. The targeted vehicle belonged to the 18 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) and was en route from Botapathri when it was fired upon. Among the victims was an army porter who succumbed to injuries sustained during the attack. According to police sources, the attackers aimed at a Rashtriya Rifles unit stationed along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gulmarg. The incident took place in a high-security zone near the India-Pakistan border, a restricted area typically accessible only to Indian Army personnel. In response, security forces have launched intensified operations to secure the area and ensure the safety of troops. Initial reports indicated that six soldiers were injured, prompting additional deployments to evaluate the situation and reinforce security measures. This marked the fourth major incident within a week, highlighting a worrying trend. Earlier, on October 20, another deadly attack occurred near Sonamarg, along the Srinagar-Leh national highway. Militants targeted a camp housing workers of an infrastructure company, aiming to inflict significant casualties. The attack claimed the lives of seven employees, including both local and migrant workers, who were part of the Z-Morh tunnel construction team. This tunnel is a critical infrastructure project meant to enhance connectivity between Gagangir and Sonamarg in Ganderbal district. The attackers indiscriminately fired at various parts of the workers’ camp, including the mess area, and reportedly remained on site for a considerable period. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) later arrived to conduct forensic analysis and is expected to lead the investigation. This assault marked a shift in militant tactics, as large infrastructure projects in Jammu and Kashmir had seldom been targets in the past. The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a militant outfit linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. TRF’s operational strategy, led by Sheikh Sajjad Gul, has evolved to focus on both local and non-local targets, moving beyond its earlier focus primarily on Kashmiri Pandits. TRF has become increasingly active in the region over the last several months, aligning its actions with significant political developments, such as the recent Assembly elections—the first since 2014, especially after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. The October 24 attack, along with earlier incidents, occurred shortly after the elections in which the National Conference, led by Omar Abdullah, allied with the Congress to secure a majority and form the new government. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack, calling it 'dastardly and cowardly.' He expressed sympathy for the victims, emphasizing that the workers were unarmed civilians contributing to a crucial infrastructure project. Abdullah reiterated that violence against civilians would not transform Kashmir into Pakistan, a claim often promoted by militant groups. His father, Farooq Abdullah, also condemned the attack, stressing that dialogue remains impossible as long as Pakistan continues to support violence in Kashmir. The recent surge in violence appears to be part of a broader escalation in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the Jammu region, which has seen increased militant activity since 2021. Historically, militancy has been concentrated in the Kashmir Valley since 1989, while Jammu had remained relatively peaceful after the early 2000s. However, the strategic shift towards Jammu—predominantly a Hindu-majority region—suggests a calculated change in militant operations, potentially aimed at diverting security forces from more strategic areas in the Valley. Militants have adapted to the region’s rugged terrain, exploiting forested mountains and limited road connectivity to launch surprise attacks. The region’s geographical challenges, combined with a heavy concentration of security forces in the Valley, may have driven militants southward toward Jammu. Experts also suggest that militants are deliberately shifting focus to disrupt India’s broader security apparatus, taking advantage of Jammu’s relative vulnerability. The insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, which began in 1989, has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Despite the government’s rationale for abrogating Article 370 in 2019—asserting it would reduce violence and spur economic growth—recent statistics paint a different picture. From 2021 to 2024, there have been 33 militant-related attacks in Jammu alone, including eight in 2024, resulting in 11 soldiers killed and 18 injured. One of the deadliest incidents occurred in June 2024, when nine Hindu pilgrims were killed and over 30 injured during an attack on a bus in Reasi district. This marked a significant escalation, following a series of attacks targeting civilians and security forces. The attacks also cast doubt on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that the insurgency in Kashmir was nearing its end, as indicated by his government’s multipronged strategy after the region’s special status was revoked. The July attacks, including ambushes in Kulgam, Kathua, and Doda districts, highlighted persistent challenges to the central government’s claims of stability. The revocation of Article 370 was accompanied by legal and administrative changes that further centralized control over Jammu and Kashmir. New land-related laws allowed greater central control, while measures such as curfews, internet shutdowns, and mass arrests deepened the trust deficit between Kashmiris and the Indian government. Critics argue that these policies have eroded civil liberties, resulting in widespread discontent. Arrests under controversial laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Public Safety Act have targeted journalists, human rights activists, and lawyers. Local governance, despite recent elections, remains weak, with significant powers vested in the centrally appointed governor. The political downgrade of Jammu and Kashmir from a state to two Union Territories in 2019 limited local leaders’ ability to implement meaningful change, fuelling grievances. Experts suggest that restoring peace in the region would require measures that address the political wounds caused by the revocation of Article 370, such as reinstating statehood and local governance. In response to the ongoing violence, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah’s cabinet proposed a resolution urging the central government to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha approved the resolution, marking a significant step toward reestablishing the region’s former status. Omar Abdullah also met Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who reportedly assured the central government’s full support for the new administration. Meanwhile, the broader India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir remains unresolved, posing risks of prolonged regional instability. Experts emphasize that diplomatic negotiations, coupled with efforts to reduce violence, are crucial for achieving lasting peace in Jammu and Kashmir. Without urgent measures for dialogue and reconciliation, the cycle of violence is likely to persist, complicating India’s internal security and foreign relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTO9Gx40GDFmU	2024-10-27T16:42:29-07:00	
New Paintings And Details Uncovered In Egyptian Temple Of Esna	The Roman-era temple of Esna, 60 kilometers south of Luxor in Egypt, is undergoing extensive restoration work in an Egyptian-German cooperation project. The temple proper no longer exists, but the large vestibule or pronaos was rediscovered more than 200 years ago, and is complete. The restoration work has been in progress since 2018. On the Egyptian side it is led by Hisham El-Leithy from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MoTA) Documentation Center; on the German side, by Egyptologist Professor Christian Leitz from the Institute of Ancient Near Eastern Studies at the University of Tübingen. Over the past 1800 years, local people lit fires in the temple vestibule. As a result, the once-colorful wall and column decorations were blackened. Over the past six years, a team of up to 30 Egyptian restorers led by Ahmed Emam revealed the colors of the astronomical images covering the entire ceiling as well as the colors of the 18 inner columns. Yellow and red predominate A new phase of restoration began this year. Specialists finished restoring the southern inner wall and the southern part of the western rear wall. They brought to light the original colors with dominant yellow and red pigments, marking a sharp difference from color schemes found elsewhere, for example at the temple of Dendara, where white and light blue predominate. 'The greatest discovery this year was the many painted details of the clothing on the king and the deities of Esna, their crowns and their thrones,' says Christian Leitz. 'Previously, we could not see them at all due to the thick layer of soot over the reliefs.' All these painted details are an integral part of the offering scenes which cover the inner walls of the temple. Researchers knew about the hieroglyphic texts and the reliefs; but the freshly-uncovered decorations on the throne images have their own meaning. In one scene – an offering of bow and arrow to the goddess Neith – the conservation team uncovered four painted bows in the lower part of the throne – perhaps part of originally nine bows, a reference to the 'nine bows' as a designation for Upper and Lower Egypt and seven other territories ruled by the king of Egypt. Another example is the apron of the king in one of the offering scenes. It is decorated with two plants: The papyrus (top) is the emblem of Lower Egypt and the lily (bottom) the emblem of Upper Egypt, symbolizing that the king is the ruler of the two parts of the country. Perhaps the most spectacular scene is the one with the holy barque of the local deity Khnoum which carries the shrine of the god. This boat is carried by several priests who are bringing it out from the innermost part of the temple in a procession, so that on special occasions the people of Esna could at least see the closed shrine of the god. For the rest of the year it was hidden in the temple to which only the priests had access. The conservation work will resume at the beginning of November. The main goal for the next winter season is the cleaning of the outer part of the six front columns of the temple. This cannot be done in summer due to the great heat. The Esna temple restoration work is sponsored by the Ancient Egypt Foundation, the American Research Center in Egypt and the Gerda Henkel Foundation. The pronaos The pronaos of the temple in Esna is 37 meters long, 20 meters wide and 15 meters high. It is a sandstone structure which was erected in front of the actual temple building before or during the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius (41–54 AD) and was probably much larger than the temple itself. Its location in the middle of the city center probably contributed to the fact that the vestibule was preserved and was not used as a quarry for building materials as other ancient edifices were during the industrialization of Egypt. Even in Napoleon's time, the pronaos attracted attention among scholars, as it was considered an ideal example of ancient Egyptian temple architecture.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTDpIxaHo2Lky	2024-10-27T16:40:58-07:00	
Scarce Room At The Top Of Vietnamese Politics For Women – Analysi...	By Zachary Abuza Communist systems are purported to be egalitarian and gender neutral. But in Vietnam, as with China, despite the lofty rhetoric, the country falls short in terms of its own stated goals and ideals. A handful of women have excelled in the Vietnamese corporate world, such as tycoon Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. And Truong My Lan has set the bar for spectacular corporate scandals, receiving the death penalty and a life sentence in two cases involving fraud and money laundering at Van Thinh Phat and Saigon Commercial Bank. Vietnam, which celebrates women’s day on Oct. 20, is often touted for having some of the highest rates of female political participation in Southeast Asia. Based only on the metric of parliamentarians, with just under 30%, Vietnam does stand above its ASEAN peers, with the exception of the Philippines. But in other aspects of politics, Vietnam is falling far short of its stated goals. Gender equality was always tied to the ideals of the socialist revolution. One of the first laws passed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the Marriage and Family Law of 1959 that gave women equality under the law. Article 26 of the Constitution, amended in 2013, assures gender equality, and puts an onus on the state for advancing women’s rights, and prohibits sexual discrimination. In their 2024 country report, Freedom House wrote that 'Vietnam has enacted policies and strategies aimed at boosting women’s political participation, but in practice the interests of women are poorly represented in government.' Vietnam set a high bar for itself, with the goal of having 60% of all state agencies and local governments having key female leaders by 2025, and 75% by 2030. Vietnam seems on track to have 35% female representation in the National Assembly by 2030. Plucky parliamentarians Vietnamese women have fared well in the plucky National Assembly. Though controlled by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), it is not a rubber stamp, and has demonstrated a surprising degree of independence. Women’s participation in the National Assembly fell between 2007-2016, before recovering. But it is still below their target. Women currently comprise 27% of National Assembly delegates. But beyond the National Assembly there is a dearth of female representation at both the senior level of leadership and the key pathways to senior leadership that would result in greater female representation down the line at the 15th and 16th Party congresses, expected in 2031 and 2036, respectively. There is currently only one woman on the elite 15-member Politburo: Bui Thi Minh Hoai, who was elected mid-term at the 9th Plenum in May. Truong Thi Mai, the only woman elected to the 18 member Politburo at the 13th Congress in January 2021, was forced to resign in May as part of the ongoing Blazing Furnace anti-corruption scandal. Mai headed the CPV’s Secretariat, making her the highest-ranking female politician in the country’s history. With Mai’s resignation, there are currently no women on the 12-member CPV Secretariat, which is in charge of the party’s day-to-day affairs. The 12th Politburo was the acme of female representation, with three women among 19 members, or 16%. Tellingly, all three women served in National Assembly leadership positions: chair Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, deputy chair Tong Thi Phuong, and Mai, then a member of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee. Phuong and Ngan likewise served on the 11th Politburo, concurrently serving as deputy chairs of the National Assembly. So even in the Politburo, often the pathway to power for women comes through the National Assembly. Pathways to power What about other pathways to power? For starters, only one-third of the Communist Party’s 5.3 million members are women. In the current term, nine of the 63 provinces or provincial-level cities were headed by a woman: An Giang, Bac Ninh, Hai Nam, Lai Chau, Lang Son, Ninh Binh, Quang Ngai, Thai Nguyen and Vinh Phuc. In mid-2024, the newly minted Politburo member Bui Thi Minh Hoai was appointed chair of the Hanoi Party Committee, following the forced resignation of the incumbent, Dinh Tien Dung, on corruption charges. That brings the number of provincial committee chairs to 16% of the total. This is important, because roughly one-third of the Central Committee is composed of provincial representatives. At the time of writing, the Central Committee had only 183 members and alternate members. Only 16, or 9%, are women. This is down from the 13th Congress in January 2021, when women comprised 9.5 percent of the Central Committee. At present, only two provincial governments, Bac Ninh and Binh Phuoc, are headed by women, a mere 3%. Within the State Council, none of the five deputy prime ministers are women, and only three of 22 minister-level officials are women. These include Minister of Internal Affairs Pham Thi Thanh Tra, Minister of Health Dao Hong Lan, and the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, Nguyen Thi Hong. Correcting imbalances The minister of health has been under a cloud ever since the Viet-A covid-19 test kit scandal, which rocked her ministry, and landed her predecessor in jail. Netizens have long mocked the ministry as a font of corruption. The State Bank governor, likewise, has been under intense scrutiny following the government’s failure to adequately regulate Saigon Commercial Bank, caught up in the Truong My Lan and Van Thinh Phat scandal, which led to a $24 billion government bailout of the bank. One area where women are continuing to excel is within the country’s elite diplomatic corps. At a recent ceremony, five of 16 newly appointed ambassadors were women. While that is important for Vietnam on the world stage, it does little in the world of Vietnamese politics. Gender equality has been a concern since the onset of the socialist revolution; Ho Chi Minh himself made it a priority of the revolution. But in recent years, the CPV has fallen short of its stated goals. There is a chance to rectify that at the 14th national Party Congress, expected to be held in January 2026. Planning, including the composition of the 14th Central Committee, is already underway. While the elite Central Committee and Politburo are out of balance in a number of ways – most notably regional dynamics – the party has to move beyond tokenism in representation of women within its highest decision-making bodies.

Muslim And Arab American Leaders In Michigan Endorse Trump	Prominent Muslim leaders were invited by former USPresident Donald Trumpon Saturday during a campaign rally in Michigan to announce their support for the Republican candidate. Trump was joined onstage by what his campaign described as 'prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community' to encourage Muslim and Arab American to endorse him in the Nov. 5 presidential election. The former president also said that he was banking on 'overwhelming support' from these voters in the state, according to CNN. 'They could turn the election one way or the other,' Trump said of the Arab and Muslim communities, who are critical of US support for Israel in its war on Gaza. On stage, the Muslim leaders cited Trump’s commitment to ending conflicts. 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war,' ImamBelal Alzuhairitold thecrowd. Alzuhairi described Trump as the 'peace' candidate. 'The bloodshed has to stop all over the world. And I think this man can make that happen.' Trump said that Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a 'stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East.' 'That’s all they want,' he said. The endorsement of Trump by Muslim and Arab communities would be a notable shift by Michigan’s Muslim community, who have traditionally aligned with the Democrats.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTAjCBbne-mbL	2024-10-27T16:37:33-07:00	
Israel Hopes Focused Targets In Retaliatory Strike Will Limit Ira...	By Linda Gradstein Israeli officials say its series of strikes Saturday overnight on Iran achieved their objectives.'Following the directive of the political echelon, we carried out precise and targeted strikes on targets in different areas in Iran,' Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing.'These included missile manufacturing facilities used by Iran in its attacks on the State of Israel over the past year. Simultaneously, we targeted Iran’s surface-to-air missile arrays and Iranian aerial capabilities that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran. Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' Hagari said.Iranian state news site IRNA quoted the nation’s air defense organization as saying Israel attacked military centers in Tehran and in the western provinces of Khuzestan and Ilam. It said Iranian forces 'successfully' intercepted many of the strikes, ensuring they caused only 'limited damage.' On Sunday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, did not call for retaliation. Instead, he said, the attacks 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed.' 'It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country,' said Khamenei, who has the final say over all major decisions in Iran. The U.N. Security Council will meet Monday following a request by Iran after Israel’s attack, claiming that Israel violated international law. Iran Israeli analysts said the decision to limit the attack to military targets gives Iran a way to back away from its escalating rhetoric against Israel. 'Israel didn't make it larger than it was expected,' Beni Sabit, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies, said. 'Last time, Iran attacked [Israel’s] military bases, air force bases, so Israel also attacked military bases, air force, air defense bases, and also some military factories for missiles and drones.'So, we see that Israel wants to close this event to pass this message to Iran that it is closed, [this is] a closure, and we don't want to escalate it,' Sabit said. 'So now it depends on Iran, if they take this message, understand this message, or no — they want to escalate it, too.' The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said there had been no Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted. IAEA inspectors are safe and continue their vital work. I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety & security of nuclear & other radioactive materials,' Rafael Mariano Grossi wrote on social media platform X.One of Israel’s broadcast network’s reported that Israel initially planned to strike Iran’s oil and natural gas facilities but changed the targets after U.S. pressure, a claim the Israeli prime minister’s office called 'totally false.''Israel chose the targets ahead of time, based on its national interests,' the prime minister’s office said in a statement, 'and not based on American directives.''That’s how it was, and that’s how it will be,' the statement reads.Israeli analysts say the ball is now in Iran’s court, and they can choose to de-escalate the conflict with Israel.'I do hope they realize that the best way to go would be to stop attacking Israel with ballistic missiles,' said Shlomo Shapiro a professor of national security at Bar Ilan University.'If the Iranians would retaliate now, that may drive Israel to an even harsher response, and that could escalate into a regional conflagration. I don’t think any of the sides now need that and I hope that cooler minds will prevail,' Shapiro said.The Israeli government did not issue any special instructions to the population after the strikes, meaning they did not expect an imminent Iranian response. On October 1, Iran attacked Israel with 200 missiles, which damaged property but did not cause any fatalities. Israel vowed at that time to respond, and almost a month later, it launched this series of attacks on Iran, which showed Israel’s capability for long-range attacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTPHVhF0_XvMh	2024-10-27T16:35:53-07:00	
BRICS: Brazil Says It Was Just Outlining Criteria For New Admissi...	By Lucas Pordeus Leon Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Relations explained it does not advocate the admission of any specific nation to BRICS, adding, however, that it did advocate the creation of criteria and principles to guide the choice of the bloc’s new members. According to the Secretary for Asia and the Pacific at the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ambassador Eduardo Paes Saboia, the criteria include defending reform of the UN, not accepting unilateral economic sanctions, and having friendly relations with all the member countries. Brazil’s position was clarified after the Venezuelan government said in a statement that Brazil had vetoed the Caribbean country’s entry into BRICS, and that the move was an aggression. Representatives of Brazilian diplomacy, however, maintain that the group has merely outlined criteria and principles for new members. According to the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry’s note, 'the Venezuelan people feel indignation and shame at this inexplicable and immoral aggression by Brazilian diplomacy, which is maintaining the worst of [former Brazilian President] Jair Bolsonaro’s policies against the Bolivarian Revolution founded by Commander Hugo Chávez.' During this week’s BRICS meeting in Russia, the list of countries that could join the group as associate members was defined, but Venezuela was left out. By consensus of the ten BRICS member countries in Latin America, Cuba and Bolivia were selected. Nigeria, Turkey, Malaysia, and Indonesia were also cited as meeting the defined criteria. Brazil has been diplomatically distancing itself from Venezuela since the election on July 28 this year, which resulted in the re-election of President Nicolás Maduro. The outcome was contested by the opposition, international organizations, and other countries, including Brazil, on the grounds that the electoral data per polling station had not been presented.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTKc_Eiiu8w62	2024-10-27T16:31:50-07:00	
After Preliminary Election Results, Disappointment For Georgia’s ...	By Joshua Kucera (RFE/RL) -- The ruling Georgian Dream party eked out a slim victory in Georgia's pivotal parliamentary elections, preliminary results showed. Georgian Dream won just under 53 percent of the vote, with 69 percent of the precincts tabulated, according to the first preliminary results that the Central Election Commissionreleasedjust over an hour after polls closed on October 26. Four opposition blocs topped the threshold of 5 percent required to gain seats in the parliament, totaling just over 38 percent. The parties had agreed to cooperate as a united front against Georgian Dream, campaigning against the ruling party as an authoritarian, pro-Russian force. Pro-Western Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who has broken with the ruling Georgian Dream party, said she will not recognize the results of parliamentary elections held on October 26 and alleged that the country has been thevictim of a 'Russian special operation.' Zurabishvili did not present any evidence to back up her claim in a brief statement to the media in Tbilisi on October 27. Foreign Policy Focus The vote was deeply polarizing in Georgia and closely watched around the world, seen as a crucial battle in the country's post-Soviet history. The campaign messaging from both sides was dominated by foreign policy messages. The opposition accused Georgian Dream of sabotaging relations with the European Union and United States. They promised to restore relations with the West. Georgian Dream, meanwhile, claimed that the opposition parties woulddrag Georgia into warwith Russia and that the ruling party would ensure peace. The first foreign leader to congratulate Georgian Dream was Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whoweighed ineven before the first official results were announced. Orban's illiberal domestic politics and West-skeptic foreign policy has been an inspiration to Georgian Dream and he has become a key ally to Georgia's leaders. Opposition parties had predicted that a high turnout would be good news for them, but that did not turn out to be the case. More than 2 million voters came out, even before voters abroad were tabulated, representing 59 percent of eligible voters. It was the highest turnout since 2012, the year that Georgian Dream came to power. With the narrow victory, Georgian Dream was denied its stated goal: a constitutional majority, which requires 113 seats in parliament. Exact numbers were not immediately available but if this result holds it would give Georgian Dream under 90 seats in parliament. That would prevent the party from carrying out one of its most extreme campaign promises: to ban the opposition parties, under the pretext that they provoked Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008. Election Violations The vote was plagued by large numbers of apparent violations. Election monitors recorded dozens of physical altercations outside voting places around the country, as well as other forms of intimidation of voters. There were widespread allegations about the marking fluid that voters were supposed to get on their fingers to prevent them from voting a second time: that the fluid quickly wore off, or that poll workers let in voters who already had the marking. The election was marred by 'violations of vote secrecy, physical violence and threats of violence, interference with the legitimate work of observers and journalists and attacks against them, [and] incidents of illegal campaigning,' the watchdog group Georgian Young Lawyers' Associationsaidin a preliminary assessment. Opposition-friendly exit polls had predicted a strikingly different result, with Georgian Dream taking only 41 or 42 percent of the vote and the collective opposition between 48 and 52. Based on those results, opposition figures declared victory before the first official results were announced. It was not immediately clear how the opposition parties would respond. The initial results were based on the electronic counting of the votes, which was expected to be completed on election night. A hand-counting of the votes, plus a counting of the precincts that did not have electronic systems, was expected to be completed in the morning of October 27. Many expected that a Georgian Dream declaration of victory would spark protests, given the deep opposition to the party among many in Tbilisi. The city saw large-scale demonstrations in the spring against Georgian Dream's adoption of a notorious 'foreign agent' law. But as of just before midnight on election night, masses of people were not taking to the streets. Joshua Kucera is a journalist living in Tbilisi. He also contributes to Eurasianet, The Economist, and other publications.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTKiyDL3osMgn	2024-10-27T16:30:30-07:00	
Thailand: Time Runs Out For Justice In Tak Bai Massacre – Analysi...	By Don Pathan It was always a long shot but Malay Muslims in Thailand’s southern border region never gave up hope that the government would amend the criminal code to extend the 20-year statute of limitations in the infamousTak Bai massacre. They hoped that all 14 suspects, now retired government officials, could be brought to justice for the deaths of 85 unarmed protesters in Tak Bai on Oct. 25, 2004. The statute expired on Friday without any of the suspects being taken into custody, although there were warrants out for their arrest. During the past weeks, there were relentless demonstrations and seminars about the incident. These included a Senate hearing and a public protest in front of a military base in Yala province, where people demanded that the government amend the criminal code and demonstrate its commitment to justice. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and her Cabinet members sought comfort in the legal procedures, saying these requests must be examined thoroughly and that due process must be observed. While apologizing to victims’ relatives on Thursday, she said it would be constitutionally impossible to extend the statute of limitations in the Tak Bai case beyond Oct. 25. No one wanted to acknowledge the political underpinnings of the incident, or how the country’s justice system and international standing were at stake. Of the85 victims, seven were shot dead at the protest site. The rest suffocated to death while stacked up like logs in the back of military trucks, after being rounded up and detained. They were among nearly 1,400 demonstrators calling for the release of six village security personnel, who were accused by police of willingly handing their government-issued weapons to separatist insurgents. The massacre happened during the holy month of Ramadan, considered sacred by Muslims. Gen. Pisarn Wattanawongkiri, the region’s highest military commander who was at the demonstration site, was quickly reassigned. He would retire from the Royal Thai Army honorably some years later. Shortly after the killings, a shaky video clip of the incident circulated widely. It showed protesters being kicked and struck with the butts of rifles, as they were forced to crawl into the trucks. The message to them and to the Malay Muslims, who make up about 85% of the 2 million residents of this historically contestedregion, was clear: You’re a defeated people, and there isn’t much you can do but learn how to live with this reality; don’t forget that challenging the authorities comes with a heavy price. The message was rejected outright, of course. The Tak Bai massacre became part of a powerful narrative, not only for the local Malay Muslims because it reinforced their historical mistrust of the Thai state, but for the separatist insurgents who would use it in their recruitment drive. In what was billed as a gesture of goodwill, then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra launched a 'peace bombing' campaign to assuage the fury of the Malays in the border region. He asked the country’s people to fold origami birds, which were dropped from the military planes across the far south. Collecting 20 paper cranes entitled one to a carton of milk. Despite the intention, the peace bombings baffled both the militants and the Muslims, who offered an entirely different interpretation of the birds. The Islamic understanding of dropping birds is battle, the late opposition MP Surin Pitsuwan, a Muslim, told the Parliament floor. He pointed to Sura 105 of the Quran, (Al-Fil, the Elephant), in which God sends down 'birds in flocks' on his enemies to flatten them like blades of grass. Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, who was installed by a junta after Thaksin was toppled in a 2006 coup, apologized to the family members of the Tak Bai victims during a town hall meeting in Pattani province in 2007. But the Thai state and society didn’t feel the need to build on Surayud’s apology. There was no public monument or official event to commemorate the tragic event. In May 2009, the Songkhla Provincial Court ruled that security officials who were sent to break up the Tak Bai protest had acted within their duties, and that 78 of the victims had died from suffocation. In other words, they died as a result of unfortunate circumstances rather than intentional acts. Nothing was said about the seven others who were shot dead on site. In 2012, the then-government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra – Thaksin’s younger sister – provided compensation of7.5 million baht (U.S. $ 222,028) to thefamiliesof each of the victims. However, financial compensation was not the same as justice, no matter how hard the Thai officials and Thaksin’s political allies wanted it to be. This past August and September, a Thai court decided to try the cases and bring murder charges against 14 men, from military Gen. Pisarn to the drivers of the transport trucks. For some it was a chance for justice; for others, it was an opportunity for closure, to heal the wound and move on as a nation. The militants had resurfaced in mid-2001, after a decade-long hiatus. But their presence was not officially recognized by Thaksin’s government until they pulled off a major arms heist from a military weapons depot in Narathiwat province, where Tak Bai is located, in January 2004. Twenty years later, more than 7,500 people have been killed from insurgency-related violence, and the end is still nowhere in sight despite several attempts at negotiations with the rebels. Peace initiatives have never moved beyond confidence-building measures. With the military and conservative establishment in a firm place after a Faustian deal with the ruling Pheu Thai Party, the peace negotiation is likely to be even more difficult than in the past. As the 20th anniversary of the incident approached, violence in the far southspiked. But this year’s attacks were much more vicious, perhaps because the statute of limitations in the Tak Bai incident was going to expire, and because separatist militants needed to remind the country – particularly Thai security forces in the heavily militarized Deep South – the case was far from being closed. Today’s ruling party, the Pheu Thai, an offshoot of Thai Rak Thai, is headed by 38-year-old Thaksin’s daughter, Paetongtarn. Pisarn became a senior member of the party and an MP until his resignation on Oct. 14, seemingly to distance the ruling party from the case. Like others who have been charged by the Thai court in August, Pisarn is nowhere to be found. The same could be said about national reconciliation. Don Pathan is a Thailand-based security analyst.

Factors Underlying Sino-Indian Rapprochement At BRICS – Analysis	India's disillusionment with the West, its need for Chinese investments and China's opening its doors to Indian tycoon and Modi acolyte Gautam Adani account for the change. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a very significant bilateral meeting on October 23 on the side lines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's summit in Kazan, Russia. Both leaders signalled a breakthrough in the long-drawn out and tortuous negotiations on ensuring peace on the troubled 3,000 km border between the two countries. Speaking at a think tank in New Delhi, after Kazan summit, India's Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh, said that the two countries have reached a broad consensus to restore the ground situation based on principles of equal and mutual security. The new agreement allows Indian forces to resume patrolling in key areas such as Depsang and Demchok that had been flashpoints in the India-China standoff on the 3,000 km border. The resumption of patrolling opens areas for Indian herdsmen to take their flock for grazing, a major demand of people on the Indian side of the border. Although the deal does not amount to 'disengagement' as such, it is an arrangement which will lessen friction on the ground, allow the two countries to discuss de-escalation and disengagement, and hopefully go for demarcation of the border in course of time. Experts said that the resumption of these activities is a confidence-building measure and a signal that both countries are willing to reduce military tensions. According to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, continuous dialogue had paid dividends. Surprise for Most To most observers in India and abroad, the deal, however small, came as a surprise as the prevailing wisdom is that India and China are such incorrigible rivals that even the smallest detente is inconceivable. But economic compulsions and geopolitical developments combined to shape events in favour of a détente In 2020, in Galwan Valley, 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed as the two sides fought ferociously with clubs and stones. This unusual clash led to a marked deterioration in Sino-Indian relations. India banned many Chinese consumer products including Tik Tok. But all the bitterness appears to have disappeared into thin air and euphoria is the order of the day. A combination of diverse factors such as India's growing disillusionment with the West, its need for Chinese investments and China's opening its doors to Indian tycoon and Modi acolyte, Gautam Adani, account for the change. Geopolitical Dimension To take the geopolitical dimension first: India's relations with the Western bloc, particularly US and Canada, had hit stumbling blocks. India did not back the West's case against the Russian attack on Ukraine. On the contrary, it bought crude oil from sanctioned Russia at a concessional rate, refined it, and made money by selling it to energy-starved Western Europe. An angry US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, told an audience in Kolkata that he does not think that India and the US are friends. Friends, he said, come to each other's help when one of them is in need. India's hadn't come to Ukraine's aid at a time of distress.Before Garcetti's admonition, US foreign policy expert Dr. Ashley Tellis, wrote a paper urging Washington not to count on India, because India takes a lot from the US, especially sophisticated defence equipment, but does not reciprocate. In American eyes, India's bid to exercise 'strategic autonomy' while being a 'strategic partner' of the US, is not on. More recently, the US, Canada and India have been at odds over an alleged Indian government involvement in the killing of a Sikh Canadian, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil, and an attempt to kill an American Sikh Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US. Nijjar and Pannun have been campaigning for the secession of a part of India to form an independent Sikh state of Khalistan. For the US and Canada, any Indian official involvement in the assassination of Nijjar or the attempt on the life of Pannun, is unacceptable, an invasion of their sovereignty. India not only denied any official involvement in the two cases, but accused Canada and the US of disregarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity and brazenly mollycoddling known terrorists and separatists. Though talks are on about the matter, an understanding is not on the cards, as of now. India and US are at odds over foreign policy with India not wanting to go against Russia or fight a war with China as the US desires. With the result, New Delhi is reaffirming its ties with Moscow and is making overtures to China. While Russia has an unbroken history of close of ties with India, China is shedding its antagonism to India. It has been showing interest in economic cooperation with India putting the intractable border issue on the backburner. And India appears to be shedding its stance that there can be no normalization of ties so long as the border is tense. Economic Factor India's need to develop its industry is pushing it to have closer ties with China and shedding some of its fears about Chinese infiltration and sabotage. A rather embarrassing fact for India is that its key industries are heavily dependent on Chinese intermediaries. According to economists Biswajit Dhar and K.S Chalapati Rao, India's depends on China for the supply of a wide range of products, from the simplestlike nails/tacks and umbrellas to sophisticated telecom and electronics products, and pharmaceutical intermediates called Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API). Chinese domination in the import of telecom and electronic products has increased manifold over the past few years after the Indian government initiated the Digital India programme in 2015. Chinese APIs have helped Indian generic manufacturers provide cheap medicines not only in Indians but to many abroad in both the developing and developed worlds. Due to its deep penetration in the global markets, the India has acquired the name 'Pharmacy of the World'. Large volumes of mobile phones are sourced from China. In 2019–20, more than 83% of imports of mobile phones were of Chinese origin. Nearly 90% of colour TV sets imported into the country were from China. India continues to depend substantially on imports of Chinese telecom transmission equipment. The motorcycle industry sourced 85% of its imports of parts and components from China in 2018-19. While most motorcycle components are obtained locally, India imports critical parts like wheel rims from China. India is heavily dependent on China for solar photovoltaic cells. More than 90% of imports of silicon wafers and solar lanterns in 2019–20 were from China. To support the production of Indian textiles and garments, another important export industry, India has been ramping up imports of yarn and fabric from China. Even the automobile industry — considered a success story for both domestic and export sales — has been increasing its imports of vehicle parts and accessories from China.India had made significant strides in producing solar panels but now relies even more on the Chinese solar cells that go in them. No wonder then that China is India's largest trading partner. Bid for Chinese FDI In July, India's Chief Economic Adviser Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran said that to boost global exports India should either integrate into China's supply chain or promote FDI from China. India has already been allowing Chinese companies o invest, albeit on a case by case basis. It has also been allowing minority share-holding in some companies and relaxing visa rules for Chinese experts. Nagewaran was keen on reducing the adverse trade balance with China which was US$ 83.36 in 2023. Adani's a Critical Entry On China's part, it has done something significant to clinch issues with India. In September, it allowed the Adani Global Pte, a Singapore-based subsidiary of Adani Enterprises owned by Gautam Adani, to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary, Adani Energy Resources (Shanghai), with a registered share capital of U$ 2.1 million. AERCL was incorporated and registered under the Company Law ofChina on September 2, 2024. This was a month before Prime Minister Modi was to meet Xi Jinping in Kazan, smile and shake hands. With a Modi acolyte like Adani having a stake in China's economy, economic relations between the twocountries will be on a sound footing, and that in turn, will lay the foundation for a strong political relationship.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-23v5mJBMBbC	2024-10-26T16:53:01-07:00	
Beyond Borders: How Iran’s Internal Repression Fuels Regional Con...	The news of Maryam Akbari Monfared's extended sentence was deeply shocking this week. A mother of three daughters, Maryam was arrested while putting her 4-year-old daughter to bed. Now, after 15 years of imprisonment without a single day of furlough, she has been transferred from Semnan Prison, where she was in exile, to Qarchak Prison in Varamin—an infamous facility known for its harsh conditions. Maryam's only 'crime' is her relentless pursuit of justice and accountability for the unjust executions of her siblings in 1980s as political prisoners in Iran. Maryam’s courage in seeking justice for her family has made her a target of ongoing persecution by the regime. The Iranian regime has long used violence as a tool to suppress dissent and maintain its hold on power. Recent months have seen an unprecedented surge in executions, with over 500 reported in 2024 alone. This includes the execution of more than 300 prisoners since the inauguration of the new president, Pezeshkian, in August. The regime has carried out executions at an alarming rate. These executions serve as a method of silencing political opposition and dissent within the country, reminiscent of the 1988 massacre when 30,000 political prisoners were executed. As internal protests grow and international pressures mount, Tehran’s response has been to increase its use of the death penalty as a means of instilling fear and control. Externally, Iran’s aggressive foreign policy exacerbates conflicts throughout the Middle East. By financing, training, and arming proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, and Iraq, the regime fuels regional instability. Senior Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, have openly admitted that Iran's involvement in these conflicts serves to distract from the regime's internal struggles. Khamenei has stated, 'If we do not fight in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, and Iraq, we will have to fight in Tehran.' This clear admission underscores the regime's strategy of exporting conflict to prevent domestic unrest. Iran's foreign interventions serve to distract the international community from its severe human rights violations at home. The humanitarian crisis within Iran, marked by the systematic repression of its population, is too often overshadowed by the focus on regional conflicts. Despite the severity of these crises, effective international action has been hindered by geopolitical considerations and misinformation propagated by the Iranian regime. Global powers have been reluctant to confront Tehran out of fear of further destabilising the region. Additionally, the regime’s efforts to delegitimise opposition groups have been somewhat effective in diverting attention from its own abuses. However, international bodies such as the United Nations have voiced strong opposition to Iran’s increasing use of executions. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and various UN thematic mandate holders, including the Special Rapporteur on Iran, Professor Javaid Rehman, have condemned the surge in executions, calling on Tehran to halt these unlawful acts. The joint statement issued by the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also highlights the regime’s brutal repression of women, girls, and political activists. UN experts have described Iran’s executions as unlawful, pointing to serious violations of fair trial and due process rights and urged Iran to immediately halt the use of the death penalty. In response to the crisis, political prisoners in Iran have initiated the 'No to Executions Tuesdays' campaign, which has gained traction in 22 prisons across the country. This campaign, in its 39th consecutive week, protests the regime's widespread use of executions as a political tool. Additionally, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), led by President-elect Maryam Rajavi, has launched a global campaign against executions. The campaign has received support from 1,500 prominent personalities across 78 countries, including parliamentarians, former presidents, and Nobel Prize winners. The global community must act decisively to address both Iran’s internal repression and its destabilising activities in the Middle East. To address the escalating human rights crisis in Iran, it is crucial to establish an international accountability process that holds the regime responsible for its unlawful executions and crimes against humanity. Iran's human rights record should be referred to the International Criminal Court or an international tribunal to ensure justice for victims of these atrocities. These demands must also be included in the UN General Assembly’s annual resolution on Iran, calling for urgent action. Additionally, cooperation with the main Iranian opposition, NCRI, and activists who are campaigning for accountability is essential to amplify the global response. Imposing sanctions on Iran’s leaders and senior officials responsible for human rights violations will further pressure the regime. Finally, diplomatic relations with Iran should be severed until the regime halts executions and releases all political prisoners. The situation in Iran is urgent, and the risk of another massacre is real. Without decisive international intervention, the cycle of repression and violence will continue, both within Iran and across the region. The global community must take action to stop the executions and hold the Iranian regime accountable for its crimes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-78ond_4ajfq	2024-10-26T16:51:00-07:00	
Institutionalized Statism And India’s Social Fabric – OpEd	India, once celebrated as a secular and pluralistic society, is increasingly becoming a nation defined by religious intolerance and communal divisions. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, Hindutva, the political ideology advocating for Hindu dominance, has gained unprecedented momentum. This shift has disproportionately affected India’s Muslim population, leading to systematic discrimination, state-backed violence, and social exclusion. The rise of such policies threatens India’s secular framework and has triggered global concerns about the erosion of human rights and minority safety in the world's largest democracy. In the past decade, Modi's government has systematically implemented policies that marginalize Indian Muslims, portraying them as outsiders within their own country. Two Indian states, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, recently passed a policy mandating that restaurants publicly display the names of all their employees. While seemingly innocuous, this policy has been viewed with concern by Muslim business owners, who fear it will result in targeted attacks, economic boycotts, and even violence by extremist Hindu groups that operate in these states. These fears are not unfounded. The increasing influence of Hindutva has empowered hardline groups to enact mob violence, often with little to no government intervention. Modi's administration has promoted laws and policies that disproportionately target Muslims and other religious minorities, including Christians, Sikhs, and Dalits. Religious conversions, interfaith relationships, the wearing of the hijab, and even the slaughter of cows have all been restricted under the guise of 'protecting Hindu values.' Such measures not only embolden Hindu extremists but also deepen social divisions, undermining India's foundational principle of secularism. Economic boycotts against Muslims have become a disturbing trend in India. In states like Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, Muslim business owners face systematic exclusion from the economy, with calls from extremist groups urging Hindus to refrain from buying goods from Muslim-owned businesses. These boycotts are a powerful tool of economic disenfranchisement and create a climate of fear and isolation. The situation worsened with policies like the employee disclosure mandate, which provides extremists with an easy means to identify and target Muslim workers and businesses. Moreover, Muslim exclusion from housing in Hindu-majority areas, particularly in states like Gujarat, has led to modern-day apartheid-like conditions. In some communities, Muslim single mothers have been denied housing based on their religion, illustrating the depth of institutionalized discrimination that exists today. These acts of exclusion are not just societal but are often state-sponsored, as seen in the repeated demolitions of mosques and Muslim shrines under the guise of development projects. One of the most visible forms of oppression against Indian Muslims is the targeted demolition of mosques, shrines, and dargahs. Between 2015 and 2024, several Muslim religious structures were demolished across India, including remnants of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the Ahmad Shah Masjid in Ahmedabad, and multiple shrines in Delhi and Gujarat. The reasons cited by the authorities range from urban development to anti-encroachment drives, but the pattern of destruction is too consistent to ignore. Beyond economic and social exclusion, violence against Indian Muslims has escalated under Modi’s tenure. The aggressive rise of the Hindutva agenda has emboldened religious extremists to commit atrocities with impunity. One particularly concerning instance was when BJP member Gyan Dev Ahuja openly incited violence by advocating for the killing of individuals involved in cow slaughter—an issue that has become a flashpoint for religious tensions. This violent rhetoric is reflected in a spike in communal clashes across India. The Washington-based India Hate Lab (IHL) reported that in 2023, there were nearly two anti-Muslim hate speech events per day, with 75% of these events occurring in BJP-ruled states. Coupled with the state's failure to intervene or punish perpetrators, this has created an environment where mob violence is increasingly normalized, especially against Muslims and other religious minorities. Yet, despite this global attention, the Modi government continues to push policies that further marginalize minorities. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) were introduced with the clear aim of disenfranchising Indian Muslims. In Assam alone, over 700,000 Muslims are at risk of losing their citizenship, exacerbating fears of statelessness and mass displacement. The rise of Hindutva under Modi's regime has created an increasingly hostile environment for India’s Muslim population, with violence, discrimination, and exclusion becoming the norm. As these policies continue to unravel the fabric of India’s secular identity, it is imperative that the international community holds the Indian government accountable for its actions. Economic boycotts, mosque demolitions, and state-backed violence against religious minorities are not merely domestic issues—they are violations of human rights that demand global scrutiny and action. If left unchecked, the Hindutva agenda threatens not only India’s Muslims but the stability and unity of the nation as a whole.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-yioGVfn5rsF	2024-10-26T16:45:50-07:00	
The Challenges Of Managing An Educational Institution Of Higher L...	In this wide-ranging interview, Associate Professor Elisée Byelongo Isheloke, Rector/Vice Chancellor of Université Espoir du Congo (UEC), narrates his experiences of managing an educational institution from scratch, its embryo stage in many ways and with zero-capital, little support and a myriad of challenges. Despite the existing difficulties and challenges, the UEC is steadily becoming a regional powerhouse of knowledge, research and development. The UEC administration will also appreciate any form of assistance and support from external sources. Here are the interview excerpts: What are the peculiarities of managing an educational institution of higher learning, Hope University of Congo which is located in a small town of Baraka, in central Africa? Byelongo Elisee Isheloke: First of all, I would like to greet you and your viewers/readers on this day and thank you for having me on this platform. Now, to answer your question, there are a number of challenges in managing any University, let alone a young one like the 'Université Espoir du Congo' (UEC) also known as the 'Hope University of Congo' with very limited infrastructure and a myriad of challenges. To name but a few, the peculiarities stem from a variety of factors such as the lack of operational funding, inappropriate infrastructure and the (endemic) insufficient registered students. Most people in the small town of Baraka still send their children to bigger cities for their education. Although I do not entirely condemn this act, I would like to urge the community members to support this tailor-made community University in its mission to address some of the challenges of the very community as so far as education is concerned. The UEC is the only University of Fizi which is entirely based in that territory – with only one branch in Kamituga (Fizi is a territory of an area of 41 745 km2 which is bigger than that of the neighbouring country of Burundi or Ruanda). Although there are a few other Higher Learning Institutions, the UEC had been conceived to cater for the academic needs of Fizi-Itombwe with its five faculties, namely Economics, Law, Social, Political and Administrative Sciences (SSPA in French acronym) or six if one dares to add the Faculty of Languages, Interlinguistics and Esperanto which is still on its embryo stage in many ways. In cities like Bukavu and Lubumbashi, Universities started small and developed into greatness and maturity over the years. I understand that most of those used resources from the state to develop but there are instances in the Great Lakes region where community Universities outperformed public ones in many regards. In my view, the UEC is not following a strange path per se, what is strange though, is the attitude towards it taken by not only 'the elites' who live in or have roots within but even by the people who were supposed to hold it dearly. It is time this attitude changes in favour of one which is going to mobilize resources, provide capabilities and get more involvement with research and development; one which is going to allocate funds to build, manage and strengthen this University, the 'UEC'. For now, what would you count as the marked achievements during the past few years, despite the fact that the university has a short history? BEI: The university had its years of glory when a lot of funding were allocated to its administration by the Free Methodist Church and when the Faculty of Theology had some bursaries for registered students supported from the United States of America (USA). At that time, many professors came from abroad and the region to lecture and do a number of initiatives with the aim of giving the population of this territory a better chance to education. It will be remembered that Fizi is a war-torn territory owing to more than two decades of war, conflicts in the eastern DRC where the UEC is based, and an aftermath characterized by relative security or the lack thereof. The population of Fizi deserves better and needs access to better education in their own territory and this should allow interactions to take place between the people of Fizi-Itombwe and other indwellers who have come to Fizi for socio-economic reasons and are now part and parcel of our destiny. To answer your question more directly, the UEC has formed many cadres now deployed in many state institutions. Alumni include the sector chief, education prefects, bankers, magistrates, lawyers, teachers, religious superintendents, pastors, agriculturalists, economists, political analysts, esperantists, businessmen and businesswomen, entrepreneurs, Engineers and many other cadres who play a vital role in the socio-economic, development and political spheres, not only of the territory, but also that of the entire country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Do students, in other words, your clients recognized the educational curriculum (quality education) useful in the current competitive labor market in central Africa? BEI: There is no doubt about it because a year or two ago the government published a list of viable institutions in the entire DRC. The UEC came out as one of those viable institutions recognized on national scale. This goes without saying that the diplomas, degrees and certificates issued by UEC are equal to those issued by the University of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi or Bukavu, to name but a few. Some of our graduates have been employed as magistrates by the state. There is therefore no reason to turn away this important institution of education. When I took office as the Rector of UEC, I led my team in conducting a number of reforms which have also visibly make UEC impactful in the society. The human capital is one of those cornerstone achievements under my leadership. I have also managed to bring a few professors to volunteer as academics, deans, professors, assistant lecturers, fund-raisers, technical advisers and prayer-warriors in favour of the UEC. We have academics who joined in different initiatives from Africa, Italy, India, Spain, France, the USA and so forth. We managed to introduce reforms, under my stewardship, such as enhancing the quality of education through improved training by suitably qualified professors, assistant lecturers, the provision of technology, solar panels, Wifi, and the reception of new books from France, in the past and recently, mainly from the USA. The last donation of almost four hundred books from the Emeritus Professor Denis Aliko Songolo made history, making the UEC library an institution with very important written books – a treasure to be cherished for many more years. I managed to reschedule that all major transactions be done through a local bank and organized many conferences and events to enhance the culture of reading, researching and engaging in meaningful as well as robust debates about all aspects of life. Briefly, I managed to give to the university more international exposure in America, Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia; all this with the support of my team. Last but not least, my aim is also to promote the culture, social cohesion and collaboration among the people, within and beyond the community. To do this, we started to organize the Faculty of Language, InterLinguistics and Esperanto which apart from teaching other African languages next to imported ones, namely Mandarin, English, French, Esperanto, it will particularly promote and defend the use of Ebembe, Kiswahili and the likes – previously disadvantaged African languages. This will not only restore our dignity as the people of that territory but will also affirm our determination to a more equal society where linguistic human rights and indigenous knowledge of culture and science will be preserved and shared. What competitive advantages has Hope University of Congo over other similar educational institutions in the region? BEI: To go straight to the point, I would say the UEC has now the biggest library in the entire Fizi territory. The library which is yet to be built to the desired standard already has more books than any other in Fizi-Itombwe. If we manage to make my dream of building new facilities for the library, and later on for the UEC, it will become a milestone achievement of all the time. The community University namely UEC places at the centre of its policy the preservation of this community core values, traditions and culture, its languages Ebembe, Kiswahili as well as others and the sharing of science and technology through the use of other means of communication. It was initially meant to be a bilingual University (French and English) but evolved to accommodate other medium of communication including Esperanto, although it is in this regard that capacity need to be reinforced with infrastructure, volunteers, funding, bursaries and win-win partnerships. Science and technology remain two weaknesses of UEC owing to the lack of investors and regardless of entrepreneurial activities we have undertaken in the past. I appeal to the world to join us in this vision. A university like the UEC is destined to be a catalyst of peace in that slowly recovering region. If we get funding for entrepreneurship incubators, we could make UEC an economic hub of that semi-rural territory of Fizi. Beyond competition, I believe we could extend access to our library to sister Higher Learning institutions such as the Institut Supérieur Pédagogique (ISP Baraka), Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural (ISDR Baraka), Institut Supérieur de Technique Médical (ISTM Baraka) to name but a few. Where we could help we will not hesitate to do so in order to serve others with our library, sharing of knowledge, know-how through research products and beyond. Please help us build and further develop the library. We have managed to bring professors and other academics to join us in shaping the future of this University project. The likes of Emeritus Prof Denis Aliko Songolo, Prof Majaliwa Mwanjalolo, Prof Nehemie Mwilanya, Prof Extraordinary Badar Iqbal, P.O Hon. Obedi Nyamangyoku, Prof Renato Corsetti, Prof Vicente Manzano-Arrondo, Ir. Ahmed Mamdoohi, Dr. Jean Sikatenda, Rev. Nana Yenga, Mrs. Francoise Noireau, Mr. Yamungu Yamalong Boniface, Mr. Jérémie Mahungo, Mr. Kester Kenn Klomegah and many more, team up in support to our vision to make the UEC a regional powerhouse of knowledge, research and development. While some of them lecture physically or virtually, others either support/ed with donations, books, vehicle, Ruforum bursaries procedure, visits, lobbying, conferences, advocacy, fundraising and most importantly with technical advise to the office of the Vice-Chancellor that I hold. What has been the most difficult challenge running this university? And what management styles do you disagree with especially as head of this institution? BEI: The lack of funding is number one problem of this young University. We need funding to pay (decent) salaries to employed staff and visiting professors/Assistants, run the University, support research, equip with infrastructure, promote discoveries, use the 45 hectares of land that we have for agriculture and/or tree planting, nature conservation, and manage developmental projects. As a community University, we could use financial resources to intervene where necessary in the suburbs, villages where the Lake Tanganyika water rise effect impacted so negatively to the housing facilities, standard of living and life in general in Fizi territory and beyond. A proper operational budget coupled with reforms that I am conducting would take this university to another level of service to the community. If for example industrial fishing, research and development are promoted via the UEC which is (relatively) at the shore of the Lake Tanganyika, it can become a hub of economic development and job creation in the region. I adopted an open door policy in managing the UEC and I therefore do not agree with the autocratic leadership style. I treasure excellence in doing work and want to steer my colleagues to follow my example. I don't agree with insubordination in any way. Some say entrepreneurship is very challenging, but what keeps you motivated as a rector? Who are some of the most notable people that have experienced during the work of Hope University of Congo? BEI: I taught entrepreneurship and business economics to the university community and around Fizi and I am prepared to do so hoping to get people and organizations to extend some form of support. Fizi should not depend on handouts from NGOs instead I suggest an economic model similar to that of China where community development is catered for, supported, and developed through a bottom up approach at times with top down support most of the time; so that we teach the people to fish more efficiently, to cultivate the land, to work with their hands and brain, hard and smartly, to preserve the environment, recycle, reuse, reorient our inputs/outputs, promote own literature, fight corruption and mismanagement of funds, embrace the culture of saving and maintenance, promote peace and stability, build on faith, educate on good governance and so forth. I have been inspired by our leaders. The former Bishop Welongo Wehusha who saw the need to start off the UEC and the current Bishop Dr Lubunga Wehusha whom I believe to hold dear the idea of taking this University to another level and provide it with the necessary support as I lead it to a phase of ambitious project of greatness. As I said before, I also met many professors both in the country and abroad willing to do more to help. I should say the team efforts of those who sacrifice their time to work with me in Baraka or from wherever they are, I say thank you so much. I think of people who work/ed as security guards, librarian, cleaner, assistants, professors, office bearers, and appreciate their contribution which makes it possible to hope for a better future. I pray and work that we will one day have funding to rewards and recognize their efforts. Serving and working in the DRC and at the UEC for me it is in a way giving back to the country of origin and my people. It keeps me going. Having survived the atrocities of the war in that region, I think the people deserve better. It will all start with a better education to change the course of their life. After 26 years in South Africa, I am equipped to do something to change the world around me. With benefactors' support, I believe that I will make it happen. How do you value education and training for staff, as well as regular educational exchanges, as a means of forging relations with external universities (international cooperation) here? BEI: I think the UEC must be a learning organisation. We need to provide continuous training and cater for career development. We are not doing enough although during my term I am trying it. I have conducted not less than five conferences/workshops and invited other academics to do so but over the years we need more capacity, volunteers, missionaries, investors, authors, engineers, economists, business analysts, educationalists, scientists, researchers, esperantists, philosophers to join me in doing capacity building, training and more. The major partnerships we forged so far is that with Université Catholique de Bukavu (UCB), with Civencia (Spain) although in both instances we ought to materialize the agreement with practical initiatives. I am willing to steer my team in this regard going forward. I invite people with resources and the will to support me and get involved. We need well established universities to kindly provide bursaries and training opportunities to both our staff and students, invite us for joint venture initiatives, and we are willing to have twin relations with other universities abroad. Please let us know if you are reading me and could help with this. Where would you like to see this business of education, at least, in the next five years? In other words, what's your future vision for Hope University of Congo? BEI: I would like to see a modern library built and then after the rest of the infrastructure for the UEC. I will reveal later the name of it when the project starts. The UEC must grow into becoming a modern University with all the facilities; it can be a unifying force that call for peace and stability in the Great Lakes region. If developed into a full-fledged University, it will have the muscles to fully call for social cohesion, security, people to people relations, peace and cater for community development, culture preservation, environment conservation, research and development, publications, natural medicine, medicinal plants, multilingualism, food security, breeding of cows and other animals, controlled hunting, that put the spirit of Ubuntu, this African philosophy of humanity and generosity, at the centre of our core values. I thank you for the opportunity and the readers for their time, especially, those who will extend a hand of support to the University project that I have. God bless you!	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-71DST6wfYfo	2024-10-26T16:43:04-07:00	
Crippling UNRWA: The Knesset’s Collective Punishment Of Palestini...	The man has a cheek. Having lectured Iranians and Lebanese about what (and who) is good for them in terms of rulers and rule (we already know what he thinks of the Palestinians), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been keeping busy on further depriving access and assistance to those in Gaza and the West Bank. This comes in draft legislation that would prevent the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from pursuing its valuable functions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The campaign against UNRWA by the Israeli state has been relentless and pathological. Even before last year’s October 7 attacks by Hamas, much was made of the fact that the body seemed intent on keeping the horrors of the 1948 displacements current. Victimhood, complained the amnesiac enforcers of the Israeli state, was being encouraged by treating the descendants of displaced Palestinians as refugees. Nasty memories were being kept alive. Since then, Israel has been further libelling and blackening the organisation as a terrorist front best abolished. (Labels are effortlessly swapped – 'Hamas supporter'; 'activist'; 'terrorist'.) Initially came that infamous dossier pointing the finger at 12 individuals said to be Hamas participants in the October 7 attacks. With swiftness, the UN commenced internal investigations. Some individuals were sacked on suspicion of being linked to the attacks. Unfortunately, some US$450 million worth of donor funding from sixteen countries was suspended. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini was always at pains to explain that he had 'never been informed' nor received evidence substantiating Israel’s accusations. It was also all the more curious given that staff lists for the agency were provided to both Israeli and Palestinian authorities in advance. At no point had he ever 'received the slightest concern about the staff that we have been employing.' In April, Lazzarini told the UN Security Council that 'an insidious campaign to end UNRWA’s operations is under way, with serious implications for peace and security'. Repeatedly, requests by the agency to deliver aid to northern Gaza had been refused, staff barred from coordinating meetings between humanitarian actors and Israel, and UNRWA premises and staff targeted. Israel’s campaign to dissuade donor states from restoring funding proved a mixed one. Even the United Kingdom, long sympathetic to Israel’s accusations, announced in July that funding would be restored. In the view of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, UNRWA had taken steps to ensure that it was meeting 'the highest standards of neutrality.' In August, the findings of a review of the allegations by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, instigated at the request of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, were released. It confirmed UNRWA’s role as 'irreplaceable and indispensable' in the absence of a political solution between Israel and the Palestinians, a 'pivotal' body that provided 'life-saving humanitarian aid and essential social services, particularly in health and education, to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank.' In identifying eight areas for immediate improvement on the subject of neutrality (for instance, engaging donors, neutrality of staff, installations, education and staff unions), it was noted that 'Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence' that the agency’s employees had been 'members of terrorist organizations.' On October 24, UNRWA confirmed that one of its staffers killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza, Muhammad Abu Attawi, had been in the agency’s employ since July 2022 while serving as a Nukhba commander in Hamas’s Bureij Battalion. Attawi is alleged to have participated in the killing and kidnapping of Israelis from a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im in October last year. His name had featured in a July letter from Israel to the agency listing 100 names allegedly connected with terrorist groups. But no action was taken against Attawi as the Israelis failed to supply UNRWA with evidence. Lazzarini’s letter urging, in the words of Juliette Touma, the agency’s director of communications, 'to cooperate … by providing more information so he could take action' did not receive 'any response'. Having been foiled on various fronts in its quest to terminate UNRWA’s viable existence, Israeli lawmakers are now taking the legislative route to entrench the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Two bills are in train in the Knesset. The first, sponsored by such figures as Yisrael Beytenu MK Yulia Malinovsky and Likud lawmaker Dan Illouz, would bar state authorities from having contact with UNRWA. The second, sponsored by Likud MK Boaz Bismuth, would critically prevent the agency from operating in Israeli territory through revoking a 1967 exchange of notes justifying such activities. Even proclaimed moderates – the term is relative – such as former defence minister Benny Gantz support the measures, accusing the UN body of making 'itself an inseparable component of Hamas’s mechanism – and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it'. It did not improve the lot of refugees, but merely perpetuated 'their victimisation.' Evidently for Gantz, Israel had no central role in creating Palestinian victims in the first place. By barring cooperation between any Israeli authorities and UNRWA, work in Gaza and the West Bank would become effectively impossible, largely because Jerusalem would no longer issue entrance permits to the territories or permit any coordination with the Israeli Defense Forces. UN Secretary-General Guterres was aghast at the two bills. 'It would effectively end coordination to protect UN convoys, offices and shelters serving hundreds of thousands of people.' Ambassadors from 123 UN member states have echoed the same views, while the Biden administration has, impotently, warned that the proposed 'restrictions would devastate the humanitarian response in Gaza at this critical moment' while also denying educational and social services to Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem. In their October 23 statement, the Nordic countries also expressed concern that UNRWA’s mandate 'to carry out […] direct relief and works programmes' for millions of Palestinian refugees as determined by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV) would be jettisoned. 'In the midst of an ongoing catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, a halt to any of the organisation’s activities would have devastating consequences for the hundreds of thousands of civilians served by UNRWA.' The statement goes on to make a warning. To impair the refugee agency would create a vacuum that 'may well destabilise the situation in [Gaza, and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem], in Israel and in the region as a whole, and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects of a two-state solution.' These are concerns that hardly matter before the rationale of murderous collective punishment, one used against a people seen more as mute serfs and submissive animals than sovereign beings entitled to rights and protections. Israel’s efforts to malign and cripple UNRWA remains a vital part of that agenda. In that organisation exists a repository of deep and troubling memories the forces of oppression long to erase.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-wmV6dTO2IcY	2024-10-26T16:38:28-07:00	
The Synod On Synodality’s Final Document: What You Need To Know –...	By Almudena Martínez-Bordiú In a significant departure from previous synods, Pope Francis adopted the final document of the Synod on Synodality on Saturday, foregoing the traditional apostolic exhortation in favor of direct implementation of the assembly's conclusions. The 52-page document, approved by 355 synod members in attendance, outlines substantial proposals for Church renewal. The proposals include expanded women's leadership roles, greater lay participation in decision-making, and significant structural reforms. Key Developments The document emerges from a two-year consultative process that began in 2021, incorporating 1,135 amendments from both collective and individual submissions. Compared to its 2023 predecessor, the text presents more concrete recommendations and clearer structural guidelines. The final document is organized into five main sections and calls for five forms of conversion: spiritual, relational, procedural, institutional, and missionary. Structural Reforms Among the most significant proposals is a call for strengthening pastoral councils at parish and diocesan levels. The document advocates for regular ecclesiastical assemblies across all Church levels — including continental —and heightened ecumenical dialogue. The text introduces the concept of synodal authority while acknowledging that in 'a synodal Church, the authority of the Bishop, of the Episcopal College and of the Bishop of Rome in regard to decision-taking is inviolable.' 'Such an exercise of authority, however, is not without limits,' the document adds. On this view, the text calls for a revision in canon law, 'clarifying the distinction and relation between consultation and deliberation and shedding light on the responsibilities of those who play different roles in the decision-making process.' Women's Leadership In a notable development, the document explicitly states there is 'no reason or impediment' to prevent women from assuming leadership roles in the Church. Furthermore, 'the question of women's access to diaconal ministry remains open,' and that discernment should continue. The text advocates for increased female participation in clergy formation and broader involvement in Church decision-making processes. Lay Participation The document significantly expands the role of lay faithful in Church governance. It calls for their increased presence in synodal assemblies and all phases of ecclesiastical decision-making. New procedures for selecting and evaluating bishops and expanded lay participation in diocesan leadership and canonical processes are proposed. Implementation Phase While Pope Francis has declared the synodal path 'completed,' the document emphasizes that a crucial implementation phase lies ahead. This next stage will focus on integrating synodality as a 'constitutive dimension of the Church.' The text also addresses accountability measures, calling for enhanced financial transparency and protocols for abuse prevention, declaring: 'The need within the Church for healing, reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust has resounded at every stage of the synodal process.' Background The document represents the culmination of one of the most extensive consultative processes in Church history, building on both the 2023 assembly's work and the broader synodal journey initiated by Pope Francis in 2021. The exercise aimed to balance traditional Church teaching with contemporary pastoral needs while promoting greater inclusivity and transparency in Church governance.

Geopolitical Expansion In BRICS Summit 2024: A Strategic Strength...	The recent expansion of BRICS presents considerable geopolitical ramifications, particularly for Russia, which has leveraged its membership to mitigate the economic and political isolation enforced by the United States and NATO since the commencement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The strategy employed by Russia to utilize BRICS as a countervailing bloc has garnered significant momentum, particularly in light of Western sanctions that have compelled Moscow to pursue financial systems and trade routes that operate independently of the U.S. dollar. In the course of this expansion, Russia secures not only economic allies but also geopolitical partners who possess a shared interest in contesting the prevailing Western-dominated global order. The BRICS encompasses roughly 30% of the global landmass and constitutes 45% of the world's population. South Africa is recognized as the foremost economy within the African continent, whereas Brazil, India, and China are positioned among the top ten nations worldwide concerning population, land area, nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and purchasing power parity. The five founding member states collectively possess a nominal GDP of US$28 trillion, representing approximately 27% of the global gross product. Their aggregate GDP, calculated on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), is approximately reached to the amount of US$ 65 trillion, which constitutes 33% of the global GDP PPP. BRICS Summit 2024’s Agenda On the 23 and 24 October, Russia convened the 16th Summit of the BRICS. Representatives from 32 nations had participated in this Summit in Kazan, Russia. The summit has arisen as the preeminent geopolitical event orchestrated by Russia in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, symbolizing the Kremlin's strategic pursuit to promote a multipolar world order as a counterweight to U.S. dominance. The BRICS Summit revolved around the agenda of 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Fair Global Development and Security,' underscoring the organization's commitment to promoting a multipolar world order that emphasizes inclusivity and the reform of global governance frameworks. In accordance with this strategic initiative, the BRICS has introduced 'BRICS Pay,' a payment system aimed at improving transaction efficiency and facilitating information exchange among the central banks within the bloc. This initiative functions as a credible alternative to the SWIFT system, thus facilitating international settlements that operate autonomously from the existing Western financial architecture. In the quest for multilateral aims, the BRICS has adopted the 'BRICS Kazan Declaration,' which championed the reforms within the United Nations, especially regarding the Security Council, and endorses the full participation of Palestine in the United Nations as part of a two-state solution. Moreover, the BRICS nations have come to an agreement to explore the creation of a cross-border settlement and depository system, entrusting finance ministers with the task of continuously assessing the feasibility of national currencies in the context of international payments.On October 24, a session convened by Russia in the BRICS Plus/Outreach format brought together representatives from the CIS, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, indicating a notable expansion of BRICS' global influence. Thirteen new partner countries—Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam—have recently aligned themselves with the broadened agenda of BRICS, highlighting the organization's growing influence across diverse geopolitical contexts. The agenda of multipolarity and multilateralism, promoting the pursuit of a more equitable global order have been figured in the Kazan Declaration. The declaration offers a nuanced critique of Western practices by articulating the deep apprehension about the adverse effects of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the global economy, international trade, and the advancement of sustainable development objectives. Russia -Ukraine War and Sanction Regime Commencing in February 2022, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raised geopolitical concerns and resulted in broad US, European Union’s sanctions. Sanctions on Russia's financial sector, energy exports, and technological access constitute crucial first steps towards isolating her diplomatically and economically. Russia's financial power was contracted as more than $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen and major Russian banks were expelled out of SWIFT, so limiting international transactions. An EU embargo on Russian coal, gas, and oil as well as a G7-imposed price cap on Russian crude have further taxed Russia's income from energy exports. The ruble declined, inflation increased, and Russia's GDP were contracted by 2-3% in 2022 as a result of the economic interruptions caused by these sanctions. Russian companies are experiencing challenges in filling the gaps in the consumer and technology markets as a result of the widespread withdrawal of Western corporations from Russia. Additionally, Russia's economic and military advancements are restricted by export restrictions on advanced technologies, including semiconductors. In spite of these challenges, Russia has responded by increasing trade with countries outside the Western bloc, particularly China and India, and the economic consequences have been less severe than initially anticipated. The sanctions have fortified Russia's alliances with China and other BRICS countries and have facilitated its geopolitical transition toward Asia by altering trade and energy flows. Europe's energy costs experienced a significant increase as a result of its diversification of energy sources to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. This involved the imports of more LNG from the United States and other suppliers. Russia has responded by redirecting its cheap gas and oil exports to Asian markets, thereby diminishing Europe's influence in the global energy market and forging new trade relationships. Furthermore, the sanctions and war have revealed the vulnerabilities of the Western-led order. The SWIFT enforcement of sanctions has placed significant pressure on European economies, particularly due to inflation and the increasing cost of energy. This has prompted certain international powers, including allies of the United States, to investigate alternatives to the dollar-based financial system and has drawn attention to the dollar's deficiencies as a primary tool for sanctions. The sanctions have driven Moscow to pivot towards the East, forge alliances with Asian partners, and contribute to the establishment of a multipolar global order that diminishes dependence on U.S.-controlled financial systems. The Geopolitical Expansion of BRICS The geopolitical expansion of BRICS, highlighted at the 2024 Kazan Summit, marks a pivotal shift in global politics, notably influencing Russia's strategic manoeuvres within the sphere of international relations. The inclusion of countries such as Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE reflects a strategic initiative to enhance the representation of the Global South and emerging markets within BRICS. This membership expansion aims to strategically reshape global power dynamics, challenging the dominance of Western-centric institutions and bolstering the collective negotiating power of the bloc. The summit highlighted the proposal for a BRICS common currency, designed to boost trade among the member nations. This initiative holds considerable significance for Russia and its allies, as it reduces reliance on the U.S. dollar, challenging Western economic supremacy and fostering greater financial stability in the region. The summit highlighted the critical role of collaboration in political and security issues, emphasizing the need to combat terrorism and address regional conflicts. The BRICS nations have committed to mutual support in these areas, advocating for a multipolar world order that respects national sovereignty and rejects interference in domestic affairs. The expansion of BRICS presents Russia with a crucial opportunity to regain its standing in global politics by strengthening ties with the new member countries. This strategic move allows Russia to alleviate the impact of Western sanctions and political isolation while promoting a multipolar world order that challenges Western dominance. Furthermore, increased economic collaboration within BRICS allows Russia to expand its trade partnerships, reducing dependence on traditional Western markets while exploring new trade routes and investment opportunities. Moreover, Russia's involvement in BRICS fosters alignment with countries that share common geopolitical and geostrategic interests, nurturing collaborative security frameworks that enhance regional stability and forge strategic alliances on global platforms. Therefore, the geopolitical expansion of BRICS marks a significant shift in global power dynamics, allowing Russia to enhance its influence, broaden economic ties, and strengthen security alliances with emerging economies, thereby reshaping international relations. Kazan Declaration: Russia Strategic Gains The Kazan Declaration offers a thorough framework aimed at enhancing multilateralism and fostering a more just and democratic global order. Essential elements encompass the emergence of new power centers, dedication to multilateralism, the need for reform in global governance, advocacy for UN reform, and a focus on establishing a fair and inclusive multilateral trading system. The document highlights the significance of a multipolar world that enables emerging and developing countries (EMDCs) to engage more actively in global affairs. The Declaration advocates for a cooperative strategy in global governance, highlighting the United Nations as a fundamental pillar for peace, security, human rights, democracy, and development. BRICS advocates for a thorough reform of the UN, with a specific focus on the Security Council, aiming to improve both representation and effectiveness. The Declaration underscores the necessity for a strong Global Financial Safety Net, advocating for reforms in Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF to more accurately represent the contributions of EMDCs to the global economy. A central pillar of Russia’s BRICS strategy is the creation of alternative financial channels. With Western sanctions effectively severing Russia’s access to SWIFT and limiting its dollar transactions, the Kremlin has been vocal about BRICS’ potential for developing a parallel financial infrastructure. In the Summit, Russia proposed a 'BRICS Bridge,' a blockchain-based payment system aimed at reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. Although this proposal has yet to be fully realized, it signals Moscow’s commitment to a multipolar financial system that could eventually bypass Western financial controls. This economic weight of BRICS provides Russia with crucial markets and resources, bolstering its trade relations in sectors like energy, technology, and agriculture. In response to sanctions, Russia has pivoted toward energy trade with China and India, two of BRICS’ largest members, with Russian oil exports to China increasing by 55% in 2023 alone has weakened the efficacy of sanctions, underscoring the limitations of Western financial isolation when alternative networks exist. The 16th BRICS Summit in 2024 marked a pivotal change in the landscape of challenging U.S. dominance in political, economic, and geopolitical arenas. The summit underscored the necessity of creating a multipolar world order as a response to the U.S.-dominated unipolarity that has existed since the conclusion of the Cold War. The BRICS member states have pledged to work together on crucial matters including international governance, human rights, and the rule of law. This partnership seeks to establish a cohesive opposition to the Western standards that have long influenced global conversations. The inclusion of countries like Argentina, Egypt, and Iran in BRICS exemplifies this political challenge clearly for the western dominance. The unification of developing countries under the BRICS framework effectively reduces the political influence of the United States and its allies, facilitating a synchronized strategy toward common interests and political objectives. This strategic partnership empowers BRICS to amplify its impact in global discussions. The summit highlighted initiatives aimed at creating alternative financial systems that contest the existing economic supremacy of the United States. The primary emphasis was on the proposal for a unified BRICS currency designed to enhance trade and diminish dependence on the U.S. dollar, a crucial element of American economic dominance. Moreover, the BRICS nations are actively working on the creation of bilateral trade agreements that circumvent the dollar, thereby strengthening economic resilience among the member states. The summit underscored the significance of joint security initiatives to tackle common challenges, especially in areas like Eastern Europe and the Middle East. BRICS seeks to shape global governance by promoting reforms in international institutions, particularly the United Nations, to enhance the representation of emerging economies' interests. The expansion of BRICS signals a cautionary note to the U.S. and NATO, highlighting that nations are progressively exploring alternatives beyond Western-dominated organizations. More than 40 countries have shown interest in joining BRICS, highlighting a significant demand for a global framework that facilitates more equitable involvement. This trend poses a risk of diminishing Western influence and suggests that unilateral sanctions may prove ineffective in the presence of alternative alliances. Internal Challenges Despite the potential for geopolitical impact, the expansion also brings internal challenges, notably in managing diverse member interests. BRICS’ decision-making process is consensus-based, meaning differing agendas could create friction, particularly between China and India, both of whom have contrasting approaches to global governance. China’s role in BRICS is often viewed as dominant, which may create hesitations among other members wary of excessive Chinese influence. Russia’s role, therefore, may be one of balancing relationships and mediating between competing national interests to maintain cohesion within BRICS. While countries like Brazil and South Africa favor a more diplomatic stance that does not directly oppose Western structures, Russia and China are keen on positioning BRICS as a competitor to the Western-dominated international order. As a result, maintaining internal unity within the expanded BRICS could be a challenge, particularly as each member has unique relationships with the U.S. and the West. Conclusion In summary, the geopolitical expansion of BRICS signifies a crucial geopolitical strategy for Russia, enabling it to mitigate Western sanctions and reinforce its presence on the international arena. Through the promotion of a multipolar world order and the creation of alternative economic frameworks, Russia been anticipating to effectively counter the impacts of U.S. isolation strategies. The recent BRICS Summit in Kazan underscored the bloc's dedication to transforming global governance and fostering collaboration among emerging economies, thus contesting the power of Western institutions. Nonetheless, this expansion brings forth internal challenges, as the varied interests of members may hinder the process of reaching a consensus within the group. The increasing influence of BRICS compels Western powers to reassess their engagement strategies with the Global South, reflecting a shift in the dynamics of international relations towards a more multipolar landscape. Ultimately, the advancements within BRICS not only enhance Russia's geopolitical position but also signify a wider shift in global power dynamics, where the quest for multipolarity is steadily materializing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-4W4WFYz0z9d	2024-10-26T16:36:00-07:00	
Climate Meet COP 29: Sign Of Hope Or Despair? – OpEd	The forthcoming Climate Meet COP 29 that would take place from November 9 to November 22 at Azerbaijan does not seem to have created any euphoria. On the other hand, there is considerable skepticism about the outcome of the COP 29, considering the outcome of the earlier 28 climate meets in different countries. Has anything changed? The ground reality is that nothing much has changed over the years and global warming continue to take place, causing severe and unexpected weather changes and several other adverse impacts on climate One cannot but get an impression that the climate meets have become sort of annual ritual, marked by loud claims, high level of promise and particularly with focus by developing countries demanding fund support from developed countries to implement eco-friendly measures to protect global climate. It is well recognized that to protect the global climate, emission of noxious gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, methane gas have to be curbed and ultimately eliminated to get zero emission. The first requisite to achieve such drastic reduction in the emission of noxious gases is that the consumption of fossil fuel such as coal, crude oil have to be slashed down and ultimately stopped. This is not happening. Ambitious targets going for a toss Several countries have fixed target for themselves to achieve zero emission in time bound schedule, with India promising that it would achieve zero emission by the year 2070 while China fixed the deadline of year 2050 and various other schedule by different countries. While such ambitious targets have been fixed to achieve zero emission, the ground reality is that these promises have not been followed by reduction in the production and use level of coal, crude oil, natural gas and reduction in the emission of methane gas from livestock. Neither the producers of fossil fuel are reducing production nor the consumers of fossil fuel are reducing consumption over the years. On the other hand, consumption of fossil fuel like coal have been steadily increasing, in spite of the promises made during climate meets by different countries. In such circumstances, one gets an impression that all tall promises to reduce emission have been made in vacuum. Can use of fossil fuel be entirely eliminated? It is now well recognized that the substitute for fossil fuel for energy generation are alternate eco-friendly energy source such as renewable energy from solar, wind and hydro, increasing production of green hydrogen, increasing the production of biofuel etc. But, the development and production of the alternate eco-friendly energy source are slow and nowhere near the level required for matching the need. It is mainly due to several issues with regard to alternate energy source such as high production cost of green hydrogen produced from water source and limitations in wind, solar and hydro power due to seasonal factors and uneconomic capacity utilization as well as curtailment of methane gas emission not happening as livestock population cannot be reduced. While alternate energy source is much needed and should be developed with utmost efforts, still alternate energy source cannot significantly reduce the demand for fossil fuel, particularly since the energy demand and consequent demand for fossil fuel are steadily increasing. Why not reduce energy demand? One solution on which the climate meets are not focusing is with regard to the possibility of steady reduction in the energy demand, so that the demand for fossil fuel can be brought down. Of course, developing countries would particularly object to the reduction of energy demand, as it would adversely impact the industrial and economic growth of the countries. Alternately, the demand for energy can be brought down by optimization of energy utilization by technological advancements and development of non energy intensive products and services. However, this can be done only to a limited extent with no significant impact on the overall demand for fossil fuel. Target population to reduce energy demand Possibly, another way of reducing energy demand is to reduce the global population level. While a few countries such as South Korea, Japan, Russia are concerned about the population level reducing and are taking steps to increase the population by offering special incentives to people, there are countries like India and in Africa where the populations are steadily increasing. The net result is that the global population is now steadily increasing. Since more population means more energy demand and more fossil fuel consumption, the COP 29 climate meet should discuss this issue and fix target for level of global population to be reached and to be stabilised at that level. Impact of wars and conflicts Even as all countries are concerned about climate issues and almost all of them are participating in the global climate meets, some of the participating countries are indulging in bloody conflicts and wars such as the ongoing Russia Ukraine war and the ongoing Israel Hamas war. Further, terrorist activities are also taking place frequently in different locations. All such wars and terrorist activities involve use of missiles, dropping of bombs, shootings, drone attack and so on which cause emission of huge quantity of toxic gases and cause severe atmospheric pollution. It appears that climate meets have not discussed these aspects at all. COP 29 sign of hope or despair The question is whether the forthcoming COP 29 will be more forthright in discussing the issues in depth and calling a spade a spade, instead of confining itself to cosmetic discussions. Based on the proceedings of the past meets, there is certainly justification to view the forthcoming COP 29 climate meet as sign of despair.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-4U0VkLp0ZGj	2024-10-26T16:28:39-07:00	
How Indonesian Migrant Workers In ASEAN Region Coped With Pandemi...	The role of migrant workers in the ASEAN region is crucial to the economies of the region. The mobility of labour enables workers to move around countries in southeast Asia to work in various sectors such as construction, plantation, manufacturing, domestic work and services. Within the ASEAN region, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam are the major 'supplier' of foreign labor, whereas, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are the major 'receiving' countries where the migrant workers go to work. Malaysia sees the largest number of migrant flows in the region. Migrant workers fill critical labour shortages in nations where there are not enough domestic workers. On the one hand, businesses gain as they are in a position to produce more goods, thereby boosting their productivity. On the other hand, the remittances sent by migrant workers back home support their families and also stimulating the economies of home countries. However, despite their economic contributions migrant workers face several public health challenges which often put their health and even lives at risk. Workers face occupational hazards due to dangerous nature of their work. These include the risk of injury, exposure to toxins and not to mention the long working hours that could be physically demanding. At times, there are as many as 8 to 12 persons housed in a single room or dorm. These overcrowded and often unsanitary housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases. Financial constraints and the pressure to send money back home further exacerbates the situation as it prevents them to seek proper medical disgnosis and treatment. Isolation, discrimination, sometimes undocumented status, impacts the mental health of these migrant workers. ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers is a document adopted by ASEAN member countries in 2007 that outlines the responsibilities of both receiving and sending states in ensuring the protection of fundamental human rights of migrant workers. The document also acknowledged the right of each member state’s right as a sovereign state to determine its migration policies. While of the obligation of the receiving states is to ensure the provision of fair employment conditions and access to legal systems, the sending states had an obligation to offer alternative employment opportunities, worker protection, and reintegration upon returning home. The declaration also expects all the ASEAN nations to achieve decent work conditions for migrants, prevent human trafficking, capacity building, training programs, and assistance to migrant workers in crisis circumstances. It has been 17 years since this declaration was signed. Migrant workers are vital to the economies of many ASEAN member countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. These workers work in other regions or nations to fend for themselves and their families back home. The Indonesian migrant workers, in particular, significantly represent the labor force of these countries. However, despite their contributions, they face numerous challenges, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 'infodemic—a flood of misinformation.' Here I examine the condition of such Indonesian migrant workers in ASEAN, focusing on their coping strategies during COVID-19 and highlighting their struggles and resilience. While Malaysia is one of the preferred countries for Indonesians seeking employment, cases will also be drawn from other ASEAN countries to give a more extensive view of the regional issues. The labor challenges—limited access to healthcare, wage exploitation, and poor living standards have always been the major problems for Indonesian migrant workers in ASEAN countries. These issues are well observed in countries such as Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia where they work in domestic services, construction and agriculture. Past studies have pointed to working conditions among Indonesian workers in the Thai fishing industry which include low safety levels. Furthermore, domestic workers who have been the pillars of Indonesian households back home had been subject to wage thefts and long working hours as mobility was restricted. (International Labor Organization, 2020). Indonesian workers in the region were also the hardest hit by the pandemic as many of them either lost their jobs or had to face wage cuts. Research conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in 2024 revealed that a greater number of these workers could not return to Indonesia because of the closure of borders, and were living in their host countries, vulnerable and neglected (International Organization for Migration, 2024). Most of these migrant workers lived in overcrowded dormitories with a higher risk of spreading COVID 19. For instance, in Singapore, such accommodation facilities were found to be among the main sources of COVID-19 in 2020. Nonetheless, Indonesian migrant workers stayed resilient in various ways during these challenging situations. The ASEAN community networks have acted as a bridge, especially in the time of the pandemic. For instance, Indonesian workers in Thailand were dependent on the informal social support structures which allowed to them to share resources and verified information. It was also a source of emotional backing during these difficult times. The domestic workers in Singapore utilized digital platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook to stay connected by sharing experiences and important information regarding safety and health​ measures (International Organization for Migration, 2024) Another important development during the pandemic was combating misinformation using digital platforms. During COVID-19, the 'infodemic' resulted in widespread disinformation related to vaccines, safety measures, and government policies. Limited access to accurate information in the native language, also made Indonesian migrant workers easy prey for such falsehoods. Virtual ethnography—a methodology focused on online communities has shown that migrant workers turned to online platforms to confirm such information and talk about their rights. For instance, Indonesian workers in Malaysia resorted to using digital media to demystify rumors surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and pass relevant health information (Human Rights Watch, 2023; International Labor Organization, 2020). Furthermore, financial coping strategies have also evolved during this time. Most Indonesian migrant workers, especially domestic ones and construction workers had to work multiple jobs to fill in the income gap. In Thailand for example, Indonesian workers employed in the fishing industry despite health risks still worked in stringent conditions to feed their families back home (Globalization and Health, 2021). These efforts were complemented by remittance systems which continued to function during the pandemic but with less amount in people’s pockets because of wage deductions. Indonesian migrant workers irrespective of ASEAN nation they were working in, experienced similar problems; some countries however implemented suitable policies. For instance, Thailand enacted emergency labor laws aiming to safeguard the rights of migrant workers especially in sectors like; farming, and fishing, among others. Still, its implementation was not standardized; many workers claimed that the protection of labor rights was poor​ (International Labor Organization, 2020). On one hand, construction and plantation Indonesian workers in Malaysia have been vulnerable at the time of the pandemic. Although regional development frameworks such as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Indonesia and Malaysia aimed at enhancing protections for these workers was enacted at the height of pandemic in 2022, its implementation had been, however, slow, hence depriving the workers the adequate protection (International Organization for Migration, 2024). On the other hand, Singapore imposed and enhanced healthcare policies in worker dormitories and provided access to healthcare to migrants during the pandemic. However, as highlighted by the Globalization and Health Journal (2021), several Indonesian workers expressed reluctance in seeking medical care to avoid being deported as several of these workers were either undocumented or lacked proper work permits. ​ Interestingly, during the pandemic social media and other technologies have played a vital part in building support for lonely and vulnerable Indonesian migrant workers. Virtual ethnography, as mentioned earlier, studies online interactions, indicated that migrant workers relied on Social Media more to communicate and seek support. Specifically, while WhatsApp became important in the sharing of factual news, Facebook groups allowed migrants to remain close to their loved ones in Indonesia​ (International Organization for Migration, 2024). Nations like Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia have taken measures to provide adequate protection to migrant workers during the pandemic, but much is needed to be done to safeguard their health as well. The bilateral agreements been Indonesia and Malaysia did hold good promise but there was a need for stronger enforcement so that the labor rights and health of these workers could be better safeguarded. Regarding the measures for enhancing the resilience of migrant labor systems, the following actions could be considered: enhancing the legal protection of the migrants, increasing access to credible information and improving the digital competencies of prospective migrant workers.

Russian-Ukraine War And Middle East Crisis: Global Impacts Of Oil...	The ongoing crises in Ukraine and the Middle East are reshaping global energy and trade landscapes. Russia and Ukraine occupy strategic positions in global energy exports and agricultural production, while the Middle East serves as a focal point for oil flows and geopolitical stability. October 2024 marked heightened military engagements, the intensification of sanctions, and consequential economic ripples that impacted both oil supplies and the global economy. This essay argues that the overlapping effects of the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle Eastern conflicts are intensifying economic vulnerabilities worldwide. Addressing these challenges necessitates coordinated international efforts and forward-looking policy frameworks to stabilize critical sectors. Background and Contextual Analysis Russian-Ukraine War: Key Developments and Economic Repercussions The escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war since 2022 has created significant strains on energy supplies. A timeline of key escalations reveals an intensification of sanctions, particularly against Russian oil and gas exports, which have substantially disrupted supply chains. As Europe has sought to decrease its reliance on Russian energy sources, alternative supply networks have been explored, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. However, these adjustments have proven challenging due to limited infrastructure and increased competition for energy resources. Europe's new alliances with the Middle East have also driven up demand for Gulf oil; yet, the infrastructure in these regions struggles to keep pace with the growing reliance. Middle East Crisis: Overview and Strategic Importance Recent hostilities between Israel and Gaza have escalated into a regional crisis that threatens the stability of the Strait of Hormuz—a critical chokepoint through which nearly a third of the world’s oil supply transits. The security of this region affects energy supply continuity and pricing on a global scale. Oil-dependent nations, particularly in Asia and Europe, are especially vulnerable to supply disruptions stemming from these geopolitical tensions. The crises reveal broader implications for oil-dependent economies, with energy security concerns amplified by the strategic and logistical fragility of the oil infrastructure in this region. The Global Oil Market Shock Price Volatility and Economic Pressures Oil prices have experienced significant fluctuations since the onset of recent crises, reaching unprecedented levels in October 2024. Import-dependent nations, particularly those within developing economies, confront increased fuel costs that exacerbate inflationary pressures and diminish purchasing power for other essential imports. These resultant economic strains extend to sectors reliant on energy-intensive processes, including transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. Numerous governments, notably those of the United States, European Union, and China, have tapped into strategic reserves to stabilize markets; however, these measures constitute short-term remedies, underscoring the necessity for sustainable and reliable energy policies to safeguard against similar shocks in the future. Diversifying Oil Supplies and Strategic Reserves In light of ongoing price volatility, both the European Union and Asia-Pacific economies are intensifying investments in renewable energy sources, encompassing wind, solar, nuclear, and green hydrogen. The EU's pivot towards the Gulf States and Africa for oil and gas supplies marks a significant alteration in geopolitical alliances. Long-term strategies focus on diversifying energy supplies and fostering regional energy independence through technological innovations and robust investments in renewable energy infrastructure. Attaining true resilience will necessitate cross-sector and cross-national collaboration, as well as significant financial resources to ensure that these energy solutions align with the scale of global demand. Trade and Supply Chain Disruptions Key Trade Route Blockades and Instabilities Trade routes adjacent to conflict zones—particularly the Black Sea and the Strait of Hormuz—are beset by security threats. Naval skirmishes and the militarization of these regions disrupt the flow of essential goods, including oil and grain. The obstruction of Ukrainian grain exports, coupled with threats to oil shipments from the Middle East, has escalated shipping costs and inflated prices across various commodities. Furthermore, insurance premiums for cargo traversing conflict zones have also surged, further heightening operational expenses for both importers and exporters. Ensuring the security of trade routes remains a critical issue, necessitating coordinated responses to effectively mitigate these disruptions. Diversification and Regionalization of Trade Routes In response to these challenges, nations are increasingly investing in alternative trade routes that circumvent conflict zones. EU-Africa trade routes and Indo-Pacific trade corridor initiatives represent essential frameworks for developing reliable supply chain infrastructures. Major projects, including the expansion of ports, railways, and pipelines, are currently underway to minimize dependence on perilous routes. Nevertheless, these initiatives are associated with substantial costs and confront significant implementation challenges, requiring extended timelines to reach full operational capacity. Efforts to regionalize trade and enhance logistical resilience are vital for reducing vulnerability to high-risk areas. Economic Growth and Global Inflation Concerns Deterioration in Global Growth Projections The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have revised downward their growth projections for the years 2024 and 2025, citing ongoing conflicts in energy-producing regions as a primary factor for these declines. The energy, manufacturing, and food production sectors are experiencing the most significant impacts. Emerging markets, in particular, are grappling with the dual pressures of rising energy and food import costs, alongside an increased necessity for currency devaluation, which exacerbates their debt profiles. This economic slowdown not only affects developing economies but also disrupts interconnected global supply chains that are susceptible to disturbances stemming from regional conflicts. Rising Global Inflation Global inflation continues to escalate due to increased costs in fuel, food, and transportation. Central banks face a challenging policy dilemma: raising interest rates to curb inflation may hinder economic growth, whereas the absence of action could allow inflation to spiral uncontrollably. This situation poses particular challenges for emerging economies, which are already struggling with high inflation rates and economic instability. Effectively addressing inflation through a combination of monetary policy measures and targeted relief programs is essential to protect these economies from sustained economic distress. Policy and Strategic Recommendations Energy Independence and Sustainability Initiatives Diversification of energy sources through the adoption of renewables remains of paramount importance. Governments are prioritizing investments in wind, solar, nuclear, and hydrogen technologies. National policies should incentivize rapid transitions towards energy independence, especially in nations that are particularly susceptible to oil price volatility. Moreover, the establishment of expanded energy-sharing agreements could facilitate the allocation of resources during supply crises. Sustainable energy models can significantly reduce dependency on oil markets, thereby helping to mitigate economic vulnerabilities associated with fluctuating oil supplies. Multilateral Cooperation and Crisis Management International organizations such as the United Nations (UN), International Energy Agency (IEA), and World Trade Organization (WTO) play crucial roles in the coordination of multilateral crisis management efforts. Developing frameworks for sharing emergency oil reserves, accessible to smaller economies, can contribute to enhanced stability. Historical crises, exemplified by agreements among OPEC+, illustrate the efficacy of coordinated actions in stabilizing markets, highlighting the importance of collaborative solutions. Such cooperation is especially pertinent in safeguarding supply chains in regions where the risks of disruption are elevated. Strategic Trade Route Protection and Alternatives Countries can enhance the resilience of trade routes by pursuing regional trade agreements, such as those between the Indo-Pacific and Africa-EU regions, which provide alternative transportation options and strengthen supply chains. Furthermore, increased investment in secure transport infrastructure, including anti-piracy measures and maritime security initiatives, is essential to ensure the safe passage of goods in volatile areas. Economic Relief and Debt Relief for Vulnerable Economies The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should spearhead initiatives to implement debt relief and provide financial assistance to economies struggling with elevated import costs and inflation. Conditional debt moratoriums serve as essential mechanisms for countries experiencing economic instability, allowing them to prioritize crucial imports and stabilize domestic markets without further compromising growth. Conclusion In conclusion, the interrelated crises in Europe and the Middle East are redefining global energy dynamics, trade patterns, and economic priorities. A coordinated international response is imperative to address these disruptions, stabilize oil markets, safeguard trade and energy security, and promote independence. The pressing necessity for resilient infrastructure and diversified energy sources is paramount, as nations navigate these intricate geopolitical realities to achieve sustained growth and stability.

Robert Reich: Cowardice And Intimidation At The Washington Post A...	Will Lewis, the chief executive of the Washington Post, announced that the paper would not endorse a presidential candidate this year. Why not? Lewis explained that the paper was 'returning to its roots' when it didn’t endorse presidential candidates. Lewis’s explanation raises more questions than it answers. ThePosthas made an endorsement for president in every election since 1976, when it supported the candidacy of Jimmy Carter. Before the late 1970s, thePostdid not usually make presidential endorsements, although it made an exception in 1952 to back Dwight D. Eisenhower. Yet it wasn’t until the 1970s — with its exposure of Richard Nixon’s illegal break-ins at the Watergate complex and subsequent cover-ups — that theWashington Postbecame a respected national newspaper with a reputation for holding the powerful accountable. Why decide not endorsenow,when America faces an election with potentially enormous consequences for democracy at home and abroad — with someone on the presidential ballot arguably far worse than Nixon? Besides, the paper had endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, and Joe Biden over Trump in 2020. What’s changed now? The only credible explanation I can think of is that thePost’sbillionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, doesn’t want to raise the ire of Donald Trump, should Trump become president — especially now that Trump has declared his intention to punish his opponents. Bezos’s other businesses have many federal government contracts, and his largest — Amazon — is the current target of a federal antitrust suit. Assuming this is the explanation, it stinks. It undermines the credibility of one of our leading newspapers. It preventsThe Washington Postfrom exercising its responsibility to tell the public where it stands on Trump and why. The New York Times’seditorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom,endorsedHarris for president on Sept. 30, saying: 'It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump.' At least one member of theWashington Post’sopinions department, Robert Kagan, has resigned. The rest of the opinions department should do so as well. Immediately. We are come to a juncture in America where, as in the first Gilded Age, enormous wealth is lodged in a very few hands — hands that are now either actively supporting Trump (such as Elon Musk) or afraid to come out against him for fear he’ll wreak vengeance on them if they do. Trump has already seriously endangered American democracy. Those who are afraid to stand up to his bullying are only encouraging him to further assail democracy. Marty Baron, the recent editor ofThe Postcalledthe decision 'cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. Baron predicted that Trump would view it as an invitation to continue to try to intimidate Bezos and others. ThePost’smove follows the decision by the billionaire owner ofThe Los Angeles Times,Patrick Soon-Shiong, to block a planned presidential endorsement at that newspaper as well —resulting in the resignation of the head of the editorial board and two of its writers. Mariel Garza, who resigned as editorials editor, said in aninterviewwith the Columbia Journalism Review that the editorial board had planned to endorse Kamala Harris, but that Dr. Soon-Shiong informed the editorial board on Oct. 11 thatThe Timeswould not be publishing any presidential endorsement. 'I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,' Ms. Garza said. 'In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up.' Exactly. And in dangerous times, dishonest and cowardly billionaires shouldn’t be able to abuse their power by preventing honest people from standing up. This is how fascism takes root.

Assessing Causes Of Terrorism In Afghanistan – OpEd	In a recent statement on X, Afghan government spokesperson Qahar Balkhi expressed serious concern about the escalating political tensions in Pakistan, warning that the situation could have negative repercussions for the entire region. While the sentiment of concern for regional stability is commendable, the delivery and context of the statement raise significant questions about its appropriateness. It is crucial to recognize that Afghanistan should prioritize addressing its internal issues rather than critiquing its neighbors’ political dynamics. Firstly, Balkhi’s comments represent not just an expression of concern but an unwarranted interference in Pakistan’s domestic affairs. This kind of rhetoric is not only frivolous but also deeply troubling, as it overlooks Afghanistan’s own pressing challenges. The Taliban regime is grappling with severe governance failures that undermine basic human rights and civil liberties. Instead of casting aspersions on Pakistan, it would be wiser for Afghan authorities to concentrate on stabilizing their own government and addressing the myriad problems plaguing Afghanistan. The ongoing suppression of basic rights in Afghanistan is a critical issue that demands attention. Since the Taliban took power in August 2021, reports have emerged detailing widespread violations of human rights, including restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. The Taliban’s stringent policies, particularly against women and girls, have led to a humanitarian crisis that the international community cannot ignore. Before the Afghan government attempts to advise Pakistan on its internal matters, it must first focus on resolving the humanitarian crises and media suppression that afflict its own population. Moreover, Afghanistan is grappling with an alarming economic decline, exacerbated by the international community’s withdrawal of support following the Taliban’s takeover. The economy, already fragile, has suffered further due to sanctions and isolation, pushing millions into poverty and hunger. The situation in Afghanistan presents a far more immediate threat to regional security than the internal political dynamics of Pakistan. The Taliban’s focus should be on addressing the economic challenges their citizens face rather than pontificating on Pakistan’s political scene. Furthermore, the issue of terrorism and extremist safe havens remains a grave concern that should occupy the minds of Afghan officials. Afghanistan has long been a breeding ground for terrorist groups, and the resurgence of such entities poses a significant risk to regional stability. If the Taliban truly care about promoting peace in the region, their efforts should be directed towards combating the rampant terrorism and extremism that plague their own country. Addressing these threats not only benefits Afghanistan but also fosters a more secure environment for its neighbors, including Pakistan. It is both ironic and impractical for Afghan officials to criticize another country’s governance while their own regime is struggling with severe internal issues. A more pragmatic approach would involve focusing on effective governance, restoring the rule of law, and ensuring the protection of basic human rights for their citizens. By doing so, Afghanistan could stabilize its internal situation, which would ultimately contribute to regional peace and security. Adding to the irony of Balkhi’s statement is the recent incident in Islamabad, where approximately 120 Afghan nationals were arrested for attacking police and disturbing public order. This reality underscores a troubling paradox: while Afghan officials are quick to critique Pakistan, their own citizens are engaged in actions that disrupt the stability of the neighboring country. Before taking on the role of an advisor, the Taliban should ensure that their own nationals are not contributing to regional instability. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than lofty statements. The Taliban’s approach to governance and regional relations requires a fundamental shift in perspective. Rather than attempting to assert influence over Pakistan’s political landscape, they should work on building a stable, functional government that prioritizes the welfare of Afghan citizens. Only by addressing their own internal issues can they hope to gain credibility and respect on the international stage. In conclusion, Afghanistan must look inwards and focus on its own governance challenges before pointing fingers at its neighbors. The Taliban's interference in Pakistan's internal matters is not only unhelpful but also hypocritical, given the numerous crises their regime is facing. By prioritizing stability, human rights, and economic recovery, Afghanistan can contribute positively to regional dynamics rather than exacerbate tensions through unfounded criticisms. Ultimately, a stable Afghanistan will lead to a more peaceful and secure region, benefitting all its neighbors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-z8NOjERTJH6	2024-10-26T16:08:58-07:00	
Georgia Pivoting Toward Russia? Difficult Days Ahead – Analysis	This Saturday, October 26, citizens of the Republic of Georgia in the South Caucasus began voting in parliamentary elections that will determine the future of their country. Georgia's political arena is divided between a pro-European opposition and a ruling party accused of pro-Russian authoritarianism. Polling stations opened at around 8 a.m. local time. The first exit polls will be conducted after they close at 8 p.m. Both the government and the opposition describe today's vote as a choice of destiny - a choice between war and peace, between the European Union and Russia. But many Georgians are more worried about their economic situation than about joining the European Union. On October 24, a politician from the opposition party Droa ('It's Time!') posted a message on X saying: 'Two days and two hours until Georgia is free! There is great hope among civil society and the liberal opposition that the parliamentary elections will bring an end to the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012. They point to the number of participants in anti-government protests. On October 20, tens of thousands took part in a demonstration calling for Georgia to join the EU. Opinion polls have shown that support for EU membership has been stable at 80 percent for many years. The liberal opposition characterizes the parliamentary vote as a choice between the EU and Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, to which the ruling party of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili is loyal. He made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, and since coming to power in 2012, the Georgian Dream party has gradually shifted to a more pro-Russian position, although it still officially supports Georgia's membership in the European Union. The Georgian Dream-dominated legislature has passed a new anti-democratic law requiring groups that receive 20% or more of their funding from abroad to register as 'agents of foreign influence'. This Putinesque law is reminiscent of what is happening in Russia and, more broadly, the Soviet Union. The government passed a massive anti-LGBTQ+ law earlier this month, banning same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and changing one's gender on identity documents. Ivanishvili claims that only his party can keep the peace, and accuses the West of trying to provoke Georgia into conflict with Russia. He is tapping into the deep fears of the population. His goal: a constitutional two-thirds majority in parliament for the Georgian Dream. Senior party members warn that the opposition, backed by the West, is trying to stage a coup. The opposition fears vote rigging and complains of pressure on voters critical of the government and attacks on its political leaders. High Dissatisfaction with All Parties The true mood of the population is unclear. Both pro-government and opposition media have published polls showing majorities in favor of their respective parties. The respected Caucasus Research Resource Center (CRRC) published data on Georgian views a year ago. At that time, 62% said that none of the parties represented their interests. 52% felt that members of parliament did not represent their interests. A pre-election survey by the McCain Institute, named after the late U.S. Senator John McCain, concluded that the ruling party could count on a 'healthy majority. The problem is that the liberal parties have not united as a solid bloc. They are generally weak in the polls and even fear for their survival after the election. The confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition is increasingly overshadowing the real needs of the people. For years, concerns about earning a decent living and improving living conditions have been at the forefront of public opinion polls. The increasing frequency of strikes reflects this. Last week, residents of the village of Shukruti, some 300 km from Tbilisi, ended weeks of protests and hunger strikes in the capital - with no tangible results. They had been protesting the destruction of their village by mining activities and the non-payment of their salaries. A week before the parliamentary elections, the ruling party finally agreed to mediate with the mining company, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The villagers left Tbilisi in frustration. No opposition party has yet been able to translate popular concerns into a platform that the majority of the population, especially the conservative rural population, can support. The opposition has had difficulty uniting its forces, in part because the EU has made it clear that the current ruling party and its authoritarian approach will not allow the hoped-for start of accession negotiations. With a clear signal from the EU for a speedy accession process, voters would have a clear choice: vote for or against EU membership. The reluctance of many EU politicians to make such a clear statement has led people to openly question the start of accession negotiations. In July, a number of employees of Swedish casino operator Evolution Georgia went on strike to demand better working conditions and to protest the sexist attitudes of the company's management. A Facebook post by the Swedish embassy in Georgia praising the company for its excellent working conditions sparked outrage among Georgian workers. Strikes are also common at other European companies in the service sector. For example, a strike over low wages and poor working conditions hit Bolt, an Estonian company that provides ride-hailing, micromobility rental, food and grocery delivery, and car-sharing services. For the agricultural sector, the third most important in the Georgian economy, the EU is an extremely difficult market to penetrate and establish. Even the world-renowned producers of Georgian wine struggle in the highly competitive European market. It is easier - and with lower quality requirements - to sell wine to China and Russia. Therefore, the ruling party's warnings that the pro-European parties could impose sanctions on Russia, which remains an important market for many Georgian companies, fall on fertile ground, even though these parties did not make such campaign promises. Given the high level of dissatisfaction with all parties and the indecisiveness of voters, the outcome of the election appears to be open. However, even before the polls opened, both the ruling party and the liberal opposition, including President Salome Zurabishvili, predicted defeat for their respective opponents and refused to accept the results. Foreign Influence The government has indicated that it will respond to any protests with force. Ivanishvili has even announced legal action against former President Mikheil Saakashvili's party, the United National Movement (UNM, now led by Tina Bokuchava), which he claims has committed numerous crimes against the Georgian state and people. Ivanishvili has consistently claimed that 'external forces' control the UNM, making its continued participation in Georgian political life unacceptable. The October 26 elections were to serve as a kind of 'Nuremberg political trial' for the UNM. The days and possibly weeks following the election are expected to be tumultuous, creating an environment conducive to foreign influence and potential intervention. The head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergei Naryshkin, has repeatedly commented on the upcoming elections in Georgia. He has accused the United States of trying to deny the Georgian Dream another term in office. In August, he said that Russia would prevent another 'color revolution,' a type of nonviolent protest aimed at changing government and society that has taken place in some post-Soviet states. The U.S. State Department, of course, categorically denied the accusation. With Russia looming large in the background, it is certain that Putin will do everything in his power to prevent peaceful protests from bringing about a change of government, as was the case in Armenia in 2018. Georgian opposition politicians have also expressed concern about a scenario similar to the fraudulent August 9 presidential election in Belarus, where the Lukashenka regime repressed tens of thousands of Belarusians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-55DCJfxBNTC	2024-10-26T16:01:52-07:00	
The Lingering Dilemma Of Kashmir – OpEd	The Kashmir conflict, one of the most complex and enduring territorial disputes in modern history, continues to shape the geopolitical landscape of South Asia. At the heart of this seven-decade-long issue is a broken promise: the unimplemented plebiscite that was meant to allow the people of Jammu and Kashmir to decide their future. Following the partition of British India in 1947, Jammu and Kashmir, a princely state with a Muslim majority but ruled by a Hindu monarch, became a point of contention between the newly formed India and Pakistan. In October 1947, faced with an invasion by tribal fighters from Pakistan, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh, signed an Instrument of Accession to India in exchange for military assistance. This led to the first Indo-Pak war. As the conflict escalated, India brought the matter to the United Nations, which in 1948 called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Pakistani forces from the region. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed resolutions stipulating that the future of Kashmir would be determined by a plebiscite in which the people of the region would choose between joining India or Pakistan. This plebiscite, however, has never taken place, leaving the status of Kashmir unresolved. The failure to implement this democratic process has had profound consequences for the region, with Kashmir caught in a perpetual state of conflict. For the Kashmiri people, it has meant decades of political uncertainty, military occupation, and human rights abuses. For India and Pakistan, it has been the root cause of three wars, numerous military skirmishes, and a constant state of tension that affects all aspects of their bilateral relations. Over the decades, the conflict has evolved from a territorial dispute between two nations into a deeply entrenched political and social issue within Kashmir itself. The promise of a plebiscite is not just about choosing between India and Pakistan; it symbolizes the right of the Kashmiri people to determine their own future, a fundamental principle of self-determination recognized in international law. The continued denial of this right has exacerbated the grievances of the Kashmiri population, leading to widespread disillusionment with both India and Pakistan, as well as with the international community for failing to uphold its commitments. The strategic importance of Kashmir, due to its location between India, Pakistan, and China, further complicates the issue. Both India and Pakistan view control over Kashmir as vital to their national security and identity. For India, Kashmir is seen as an integral part of its secular, multi-ethnic state, while for Pakistan, Kashmir is the unfinished business of Partition, where a Muslim-majority region was expected to accede to a Muslim-majority country. In recent years, the situation in Kashmir has deteriorated further. India has increasingly asserted its control over the region, particularly following the revocation of Article 370 in August 2019, which stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special autonomous status. Pakistan, on the other hand, continues to support the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination and has called for renewed international attention to the unresolved conflict. The UN resolutions calling for a plebiscite remain a key point in Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts, though the international community’s interest in actively mediating the conflict has waned over time. The plebiscite may seem like a relic of the past, but it holds the key to a just and lasting resolution that honors the rights and aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Without a genuine effort to resolve the Kashmir conflict through peaceful and democratic means, the region will continue to be a flashpoint for violence and instability, not only between India and Pakistan but also within Kashmir itself. The international community, particularly the United Nations, bears a moral responsibility to ensure that promises made are kept and that the people of Kashmir are given the opportunity to determine their own future. In conclusion, the failure to hold the plebiscite remains a central grievance in the Kashmir conflict. It represents a broken promise that continues to fuel discontent, violence, and instability in the region. Addressing this unresolved issue is crucial for lasting peace in South Asia, and it is incumbent upon the international community to ensure that the people of Kashmir are granted their right to self-determination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-wulz_C_QcFW	2024-10-26T15:58:02-07:00	
Revitalizing Franco-Moroccan Ties: A Partnership For The Future –...	As President Emmanuel Macron embarks on a landmark visit to Morocco, hopes are high for a revived and reenergized Franco-Moroccan partnership. This visit is not just ceremonial; it marks a crucial shift toward deeper cooperation, strategic alignment, and economic synergy between these two historical allies. After three years of diplomatic strain, exacerbated by disputes over Western Sahara, immigration, and visa restrictions, the invitation from King Mohammed VI signals a fresh chapter in Franco-Moroccan relations. Both leaders are keenly aware that their bond, rooted in shared history and enduring cultural ties, deserves a renewed ambition. Macron's visit, filled with symbolism and high-level agreements, offers a foundation for that ambition. Moroccan Sahara: A Game Changer in Regional Stability Perhaps the most significant development in this rapprochement is France's recent shift on the Western Sahara issue. When the United States recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the territory, the ball was in Europe's court to respond. Macron's acknowledgment of Morocco's sovereignty over Moroccan Sahara represents a breakthrough. By endorsing Rabat's stance, France reaffirms its commitment to regional stability, supporting Morocco's role as a mediator in North Africa and the Sahel. This endorsement has regional implications, signaling to other European nations the importance of a united front in support of Morocco's territorial integrity, even as it prompts tension with Algeria. A Shared Approach to Migration Migration, another point of contention, holds particular weight for both nations. With the rise of far-right politics in Europe and the challenges of integration, immigration remains a critical issue. France's policy of visa restrictions, initially aimed at encouraging cooperation, left a bitter aftertaste in Morocco. This visit promises a shift: Macron's administration aims to rebuild trust by approaching immigration diplomatically, focusing on cooperative solutions rather than punitive measures. French officials now advocate for open dialogue and a stronger framework for joint migration management, recognizing that only a balanced approach will yield lasting results. Morocco: Europe's Gateway to Africa France's engagement with Morocco goes beyond bilateral matters; it is a strategic investment in the region. Morocco's role as a 'hub' between Europe and Africa offers France a gateway to the continent. The kingdom's robust infrastructure, from advanced ports to modern transportation networks, positions it as a prime partner for Europe's future economic ambitions in Africa. France understands this potential, seeing Morocco not only as a regional ally but as a bridge to broader African engagement. As Morocco gears up to host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations and co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup, these events present opportunities for France to offer its expertise in infrastructure and event management. French companies have long been leaders in these sectors, and the potential for collaboration on these projects is immense. Building a Resilient Economic Partnership Economic cooperation remains central to the Franco-Moroccan alliance. France is Morocco's largest foreign investor, with nearly 1,000 companies operating in the kingdom, representing key industries from technology to defense. The economic partnership stands poised for expansion, with discussions on defense contracts—including potential purchases of Airbus helicopters by Morocco's Armed Forces. Such agreements could fortify Morocco's defense capabilities while bolstering France's role as a trusted supplier. However, France must stay attuned to shifting dynamics. China and Spain are expanding their influence, challenging France's economic footprint in the region. To stay competitive, France needs to leverage its technological edge, particularly in renewable energy, a sector critical to Morocco's future. By aligning with Morocco's ambitious energy goals, France can solidify its presence in one of North Africa's fastest-growing markets. Embracing a Common Vision for the Future As Macron's visit unfolds, it is clear that the Franco-Moroccan relationship is evolving. No longer bound solely by history, this partnership is set to tackle the challenges of the 21st century—energy security, migration, economic development, and regional stability. The shared vision emerging from this visit promises a deeper, more resilient alliance grounded in mutual respect and strategic cooperation. This renewed partnership holds lessons for the rest of Europe. In a time of global uncertainty, Morocco and France are modeling a relationship built on pragmatism, shared interests, and respect for sovereignty. France's embrace of Morocco as a strategic partner serves as a blueprint for European engagement across Africa, offering a vision of collaboration that transcends traditional diplomacy. President Macron's visit may well go down in history as the moment Franco-Moroccan relations were reborn. As both nations look toward the next 30 years, they carry the weight of their shared past—and the promise of a common future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-yPbNtJYvzz5	2024-10-26T15:55:30-07:00	
Diplomatic Fallout: The Implications Of India-Canada Relations – ...	In recent weeks, the diplomatic landscape between India and Canada has been sharply defined by accusations and counterclaims, shedding light on the underlying hegemonic ambitions of the Indian state. The ongoing diplomatic spat escalated when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of being involved in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist in Canada. This incident has not only strained bilateral relations but has also raised questions about India’s intentions on the global stage and its willingness to act unilaterally to advance its geopolitical agenda. Trudeau’s assertions were met with swift denials from India’s government, which accused Canadian authorities of failing to address criminal activities allegedly committed by individuals connected to the Khalistan movement. India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman, Randhir Jaiswal, argued that Canada had not provided any evidence to substantiate its allegations, thus deflecting accountability onto Canadian law enforcement and government policies. The crux of this diplomatic debacle revolves around a broader pattern of Indian behavior that suggests a willingness to resort to extraterritorial measures against perceived threats, particularly those associated with Sikh separatism. At the heart of this dispute lies the longstanding issue of the Khalistan movement, which seeks an independent Sikh state in Punjab, India. India has consistently labeled supporters of this movement as terrorists, arguing that their activities threaten the country’s sovereignty. As a result, the Indian government has engaged in a campaign to silence dissent among its diaspora, particularly in Canada, where a significant Sikh population resides. This approach reflects India’s hegemonic tendencies, which prioritize national integrity over the principles of sovereignty and human rights. The allegations of state-sponsored extrajudicial actions in Canada not only breach international norms but also highlight India’s willingness to undermine diplomatic protocols in pursuit of its geopolitical ambitions. The implications of this diplomatic fallout for Canada-India relations are profound. The Canadian government, under Trudeau, must navigate a complex landscape where it balances economic interests with ethical imperatives in protecting its citizens. In recent years, Canada and India have cultivated a burgeoning relationship characterized by trade agreements and shared interests in technology and defense. However, the current crisis poses significant challenges to these cooperative efforts. The deepening rift raises the specter of economic repercussions; Canadian businesses may become hesitant to engage in trade with a country accused of extraterritorial aggression. Furthermore, the allegations have incited public sentiment in Canada, particularly among the Sikh community, which has rallied in support of Nijjar and against perceived Indian overreach. This backlash could pressure the Canadian government to adopt a more confrontational stance toward India, potentially jeopardizing ongoing negotiations related to trade and immigration. As Canadian lawmakers deliberate on how to respond, the complexities of this situation will undoubtedly play a critical role in shaping future diplomatic interactions. In an analytical context, some observers argue that Canada’s handling of the crisis could have been more strategic. Critics note that the Canadian government’s immediate public allegations against India may have escalated tensions unnecessarily, thereby complicating diplomatic dialogue. This stance has been echoed by analysts such as Dr. Shada Islam, a prominent scholar on international relations, who cautioned that 'Canada must tread carefully to ensure that its approach does not further alienate a critical global partner while also upholding its values of justice and human rights.' The accusations have also strained existing agreements, notably the Canada-India Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA), which has been under negotiation for several years. The specter of escalating tensions could hinder progress on this front, as trade agreements typically require a stable political relationship to thrive. Additionally, Canada’s burgeoning tech and innovation sectors could suffer setbacks as India’s reputation as a reliable partner comes into question. The risk of retaliation by the Indian government could further complicate matters, leading to potential restrictions on Canadian businesses operating in India. In light of these developments, it is crucial to analyze the broader implications for international relations. India’s actions in Canada reflect a pattern of behavior that raises questions about its commitment to respecting the sovereignty of other nations. The Indian government’s willingness to engage in alleged state-sponsored operations abroad suggests a concerning trajectory that could undermine regional stability in South Asia and beyond. As India positions itself as a rising global power, its hegemonic aspirations may lead to increased tensions with other states, particularly those that host significant diasporas with historical ties to separatist movements. In conclusion, the recent crisis between India and Canada underscores the complexities of modern diplomacy, where allegations of extrajudicial actions have profound implications for bilateral relations. India’s hegemonic tendencies have emerged as a central theme in this dispute, raising critical questions about its role on the global stage. As Canada grapples with the fallout of these allegations, the future of their relationship remains uncertain, with potential consequences for trade, immigration, and regional stability. The need for a renewed commitment to diplomatic engagement, mutual respect, and adherence to international norms has never been more pressing, as both nations seek to navigate this turbulent landscape together. Only through constructive dialogue and cooperation can they hope to rebuild trust and chart a path forward that respects the principles of sovereignty and human rights. The evolving dynamics of India-Canada relations will require vigilance and thoughtful consideration as both nations attempt to reconcile their interests and values amidst a backdrop of geopolitical challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-19R-LfGYFIe	2024-10-26T15:53:17-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Target Iranian Military Sites Amid Rising Tens...	Israel recently launched a large-scale airstrike operation targeting military installations in Iran, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. Reports indicate that over 100 Israeli aircraft, including F-35 fighter jets, flew approximately 2,000 km to conduct the mission, which struck about 20 targets across Iran. These targets reportedly included missile production facilities, air defense systems, UAV factories, and missile launch bases. According to sources, Israel's advanced F-35 jets entered Iranian airspace for the first time, flying over Tehran and targeting areas near the capital. The Israeli Air Force is believed to have fired missiles from Jordanian airspace, with some missiles reportedly launched from Iraq. However, Iran claims that its air defense successfully intercepted most projectiles, preventing significant damage. The timing of the attack was critical; Moscow reportedly provided Iran with intelligence about potential Israeli strikes only hours beforehand, giving Iran limited preparation time. In response to the attack, Iran temporarily suspended all flights and reinforced its air defenses. Iranian authorities stated, 'Israel will face a proportional response for any hostile action.' The incident underscores the fragile balance in the region, as both countries engage in heightened military posturing. As of now, no major casualties or extensive damage has been reported, but the operation has left both sides on high alert.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI--WORjVcR0c0	2024-10-26T15:51:33-07:00	
Why Did Pakistan Fail To Secure BRICS Membership At 2024 Summit? ...	Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted the first-ever summit of BRICS+ from October 22 to 24, 2024 in the Tatarstan city of Kazan. There, the founding members of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) formally welcomed five new members – Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Putin also invited more than two dozen other countries that had applied for or were considering membership in the expanding club. The 2024 BRICS+ Summit served as a powerful reminder of the growing influence of the BRICS bloc on the global stage. As BRICS expanded its membership and strengthened its goals for economic cooperation and global influence, one nation’s absence drew attention – Pakistan. Despite its geopolitical importance and interest in joining, Pakistan remained outside of BRICS+, while the organization included new members from the Middle East and other regions. Therefore, understanding the reasons behind this exclusion highlights both the priorities of BRICS and the strategic challenges Pakistan faces in meeting the bloc’s membership criteria. One of the foremost reasons for Pakistan’s exclusion is its longstanding and complex relationship with India, a founding BRICS member. The two countries share decades of unresolved tensions that have frequently spilled into global forums. India’s influence within BRICS grants it significant power in shaping the bloc’s direction, and the organization operates on a consensus-driven model, meaning that each member has considerable say in decisions, including on expansion. Admitting Pakistan, with whom India has frequent diplomatic friction, would risk disrupting the unity and cohesion that BRICS members value. In recent years, BRICS has emphasized internal harmony, as well as shared goals for economic and strategic growth, making Pakistan’s entry a potential risk to this cohesion. Without a meaningful improvement in India-Pakistan relations, India’s position on Pakistan’s membership is unlikely to change soon, leaving the door to BRICS membership closed for now. Another critical factor is Pakistan’s economic instability. BRICS has consistently prioritized members with emerging, stable economies capable of contributing to the organization’s goal of financial independence from Western influence, exemplified by its establishment of the New Development Bank and initiatives aimed at de-dollarization. Unfortunately, Pakistan’s economic challenges – including high inflation, debt dependence, and reliance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for stabilization funds contradict the BRICS model of financial sovereignty and resilience. Recent admissions to BRICS+, including economically strong and resource-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, reflect BRICS’s preference for financially robust members who can bring stability and autonomy. Pakistan, in contrast, currently faces significant economic vulnerability, which does not align with BRICS’s economic priorities and could potentially introduce unwanted financial risks to the bloc. BRICS’s choice to admit new members, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran, is also indicative of the organization’s strategic orientation toward strengthening its influence in critical areas, such as energy and global trade. These recent members bring significant economic influence and energy resources, thereby supporting BRICS’s goals for self-sufficiency and a more substantial economic presence on the world stage. While Pakistan holds strategic importance in South Asia, it does not yet offer the same economic or energy-based leverage as the newly admitted members. Until Pakistan can more closely align its priorities and strategic alliances with BRICS’s goals, its application for membership will likely remain in question. Domestic instability in Pakistan further compounds its membership challenges. BRICS members value political stability as a foundation for sustained cooperation and growth, and Pakistan’s political landscape has been marked by frequent upheaval, security concerns, and social unrest. These internal challenges present Pakistan as a country needing significant reform, and the image of political volatility contrasts with BRICS’s preference for stable, resilient partners. For Pakistan to gain serious consideration for BRICS membership, it would need to achieve greater stability, both politically and socially, and demonstrate sound governance capable of supporting international initiatives without domestic distractions. While Pakistan’s current position may appear limiting, it is not without potential avenues to improve its prospects for future BRICS membership. First, better diplomatic relations with India could address a significant barrier. Confidence-building measures and regional dialogue could gradually improve Pakistan’s image and reduce the tension that currently restricts it from joining. Additionally, Pakistan’s economic model would benefit from addressing structural challenges to reduce its reliance on international bailouts, adopting fiscal policies that foster sustainability, and focusing on the development of domestic industries to align more closely with BRICS’s preference for financial independence. Another possible step forward is for Pakistan to align its strategic policies with BRICS’s goals of global financial reform and reduced dependence on Western institutions. Aligning with the organization’s objectives in terms of trade and economic cooperation would enhance Pakistan’s appeal. Further, political stability is paramount, as domestic reforms in governance, security, and social structures could help Pakistan meet the expectations BRICS has for new members. By stabilizing its internal landscape, Pakistan could project itself as a reliable and cooperative partner that aligns with BRICS’s overarching goals of economic autonomy and political cohesion. The 2024 BRICS+ Summit demonstrated the bloc’s commitment to cautious and strategic expansion, prioritizing members who reinforce its economic strength and geopolitical influence. For Pakistan, achieving BRICS membership is not simply a matter of interest; it requires a reorientation of both domestic and foreign policy. This includes not only improving relations with India and addressing economic vulnerabilities but also adopting a governance model that aligns with BRICS’s values of resilience and autonomy. Pakistan’s path to BRICS membership is challenging but not impossible. With a concentrated focus on these areas, it could one day align itself with the organization’s priorities, potentially opening the door to membership in future summits. Until then, Pakistan’s exclusion underscores the high standards BRICS holds for its members as it continues to redefine the framework for global cooperation in the 21st century.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcanMTX1mxI-2eAz6S70lLV	2024-10-26T15:49:47-07:00	
Bringing The Space–Nuclear Nexus Into Multilateral Discussions – ...	By Nivedita Raju and Sarah Erickson In February 2024, United States government officialsclaimedto haveintelligencethat Russia was developing anuclearcapability intended to target satellites. This sparkedrampant speculationand concern about whether the reports indicated asignificant threat. The controversy, and a contentious process that followed in the United Nations Security Council, highlighted the urgent need to better understand the nexus between activities in outer space and nuclear weapons and to address these topics at a multilateral level. An increasing number of state and non-state actors are involved in the operation of space systems, which provide a wide range of services, both civilian and military—including in the nuclear domain. This has major implications for stability and security, not least given the growing escalation risks at the space–nuclear nexus. However, even within multilateral processes and bodies that might appear best equipped to link the two issues, outer space and nuclear weapons tend to be examined separately. This essay briefly summarizes the potential escalation risks at the space–nuclear nexus. It then considers some of the difficulties in discussing this nexus in existing multilateral forums and suggests ways to overcome them. The space–nuclear nexus The 1967Outer Space Treatyestablishes a legal prohibition on placing nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in orbit. While no state is known to have violated this prohibition so far, there are other ways in which developments in space systems and nuclear capabilities may interact to create dangerous escalation risks. Nuclear-armed statesrely onspace systems, to varying degrees, for functions such as early warning of a missile attack; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); verification under nuclear arms control agreements; relaying communications within a state’s nuclear chain of command; and positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) services, which can support precision-strike weapons and missile guidance. Space systems can therefore be considered a critical enabler and force-multiplier in military operations. Attacks on these systems can consequently undermine a state’s deterrence capabilities, constituting a fundamental national security threat and inviting an escalatory response. The possibility of escalation is especially concerning as so-called counterspacecapabilities(capabilities designed to destroy, disable or otherwise interfere with space systems) that can hold such strategically relevant space systems under threat are being developed by several actors. Counterspace capabilities are not comprehensively banned by the current international framework governing space activities, meaning that there is noclear red lineprohibiting attacks on space systems that enable nuclear missions. However, the doctrines of some nuclear-armed states open the door for nuclear use to be considered as a response to such an attack. The strategic ambiguity around such attacks, or even the threat of them, contributes directly to the potential for escalation at the space–nuclear nexus. The situation is complicated further by the fact that some space systems can be used to enable both nuclear and non-nuclear missions. This phenomenon is referred to as a form ofentanglementby some experts. For example, if a state’s early-warning satellites are attacked during a conventional confrontation, this could harm not only its ability to defend against conventionally armed missiles but also its defence against nuclear missiles. Thus, the state may respond as if the attack had targeted its nuclear capabilities, regardless of the attacker’s intent. Depending on the scenario, a state could also knowingly attack a space system and assume that any escalatory response would be limited to conventional weapons, which may not be the case. The ‘hard’ security concerns related to the space–nuclear nexus also need to be balanced against the many beneficial, often essential, economic, social and environmental functions that space systems serve. Any negotiations towards a risk-reduction framework related to the space–nuclear nexus need to take into account preventing or minimizing negative impacts on these peaceful functions. For all these reasons, shared understanding on the space–nuclear nexus, particularly escalation risks and how to reduce them, is essential for the future of global security. The state of multilateral deliberations on nuclear weapons and space security In response to the US claims about a Russian nuclear anti-satellite capability discussed above, the UN Security Council convened in April 2024 to vote on adraft resolutionjointly proposed by Japan and the USA. The draft not only reaffirmed the Outer Space Treaty prohibition on nuclear weapons in space, but also called on states to refrain from developing WMD designed to be placed in orbit or stationed in space in any manner. China and Russia then introduced anamendmentthat significantly expanded the scope, committing states to ‘take urgent measures to prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space and the threat or use of force in outer space, from space against Earth and from Earth against objects in outer space’ and to negotiate legally binding instruments to that effect. The amendment was not adopted, and Russia exercised its veto power to reject the original proposed resolution, arguing that the resolution was not a balanced approach to space security. In May, China and Russia then introduced their owndraft resolution. This included language on prohibiting the development of WMD designed for deployment in space as well as language similar to their proposed amendment. This draft fell short of the required number of votes to pass. The Security Council’s failure to adopt either resolution and the fact that it is not an inclusive negotiating body strongly suggest that it is not the best body to tackle the growing challenges of the space–nuclear nexus at the multilateral level, despite its broad security mandate. A number of other UN processes and forums currently discuss governance of the space or nuclear domains, and sometimes both. Yet in practice, none have thus far addressed the space–nuclear nexus, and none have shown themselves to be particularly well equipped to deal with cross-domain issues. Three UN bodies might at first sight look like good candidates: theConference on Disarmament(CD), the UN Disarmament Commission and the UN General Assembly’s First Committee. All convene annually. The CD has several agenda items, including on ‘prevention of nuclear war, including all related matters’ and ‘prevention of an arms race in outer space’ (PAROS). However, despite someminimal progressthis year, the CD has beendeadlockedfor many years due to geopolitical divisions and disagreements over agenda priorities and procedural rules. Introducing new themes may thus be premature. The UN Disarmament Commission has a general mandate to discuss disarmament questions and in 2023 deliberatedtransparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs) in outer space. The First Committee also holds general thematic debates on nuclear weapons, other WMD and space, among other topics. However, both the Disarmament Commission and the First Committee have limited capacity for detailed discussion on cross-domain issues. Furthermore, the First Committee is dominated by national statements and prioritizes work on adopting resolutions and decisions. Thus, none of the three forums could easily hold substantive discussion on risks at the space–nuclear nexus, a nascent topic that at this stage requires more informal and interactive exchange. Increasing the capacity of states to engage on these matters is a prerequisite to pursuing convergence towards the drafting of resolutions and negotiations of treaties meant for those forums. For space governance, theCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space(COPUOS) covers issues pertaining to the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, but explicit security-focused items are not included in its agenda of work. There isno comprehensive established regimeto discuss security matters in outer space nor is there a review conference or annual meeting focusing on implementation of the Outer Space Treaty. Due to this gap, various time-bound processes have been initiated dedicated to space security—for example, the2019 UN Group of Governmental Experts(GGE) on further practical measures on PAROS, the2023 Open-ended Working Group(OEWG) on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours, and the2024 GGEon further practical measures on PAROS. Their results have been mixed, depending on the political will and constructive engagement of participants. For example, of the three, only the 2024 GGE was able to adopt aconsensus report. For nuclear issues, the UN has mandated review conferences and preparatory committees under the 1968Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and meetings of states parties for the 2017Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons(TPNW). These regimes allow states to regularly consider nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Yet the meetings associated with these regimes centre on treaty implementation. The inability of NPT states parties to reach consensus on final documents since 2010 makes it difficult for them to consider broad developments in other domains that may impact on nuclear risk. Meanwhile, the limited membership of the TPNW, which does not include any nuclear-armed states, provides an impediment to considering space–nuclear risk in that context. These forums also face constant challenges related to resources. Many states do not have the capacity—in terms of personnel, expertise, time or funds—to engage actively in all of them. The limited attention paid to the space–nuclear nexus in existing multilateral forums may also be attributed to a desire by states to maintain distinct processes. Given the already challenging security landscape, adding new developments related to these topics in focused forums (whether in the space or nuclear domains) may be seen as prohibitive to achieving any results, especially in the light of the requirement for consensus in some of them and the sensitive political history between outer space, missile defenceand links to strategic stability. However, this inattention has greatly limited states’ ability to have a multilateral conversation on space–nuclear risk at all, let alone to prioritize a common nuclear risk-reduction agenda involving outer space. Creating multilateral spaces to discuss risks at the space–nuclear nexus How might states and other actors help to facilitate discussion of escalation risks at the intersection of space and nuclear issues? Below are three suggested starting points. Raise the space–nuclear nexus in ad hoc space security processes In 2023 the UN General Assembly adopted two resolutions establishing new OEWGs: one on further practical measures on PAROS (resolution78/238) and one on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours (resolution78/20). These are due to convene soon, although the General Assembly will shortly decide whether to merge the two. With enough shared interest among a coalition of states, the space–nuclear nexus could be included as a topic area for consideration in such processes, as was done for other topics in the OEWG on reducing space threats—for example, ‘protecting critical space-based services to civilians as well as services that support humanitarian operations’. Even if there is no direct language on an issue in the mandate of a process or negotiating body, states have the prerogative to share their security perspectives and concerns. Therefore, a feasible and immediate step, especially considering the future OEWG(s) on space security scheduled to commence, is for states participating in such processes to bring the issue to the attention of others through working papers (possibly also through coalitions or partnerships), statements, side events and other informational activities. Raise the space–nuclear nexus in existing nuclear processes The NPT must be considered as a venue for space–nuclear nexus issues, despite its limitations. While it excludes nuclear-armed states (and space powers) that are not parties to the treaty, it has already managed to raise other relevant intersecting topics, such as the cyber–nuclear nexus. Thechair’s summaryof the 2024 NPT Preparatory Committee notes that some states ‘also expressed support for further work by the nuclear-weapon States on risk reduction measures, including to mitigate the potential for emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence and offensive cyber capabilities, to multiply nuclear risks’. In future NPT meetings, states could include counterspace capabilities alongside other listed emerging technologies that multiply nuclear risks. Additionally, there is potential to discuss the space–nuclear nexus under the TPNW, given its focus on the humanitarian consequences and environmental impacts of nuclear weapon use. Yet there is less research on direct and indirect impacts of potential nuclear use in outer space. Engaging with the Scientific Advisory Group established by the TPNW would be useful in this and other ways. The group is mandated to review relevant research, including on technological developments that may have implications for nuclear risks, humanitarian consequences and nuclear disarmament overall. While research through this group may be limited to the TPNW states parties, it would nonetheless drive engagement, particularly in developing research agendas and related mandates on the space–nuclear nexus. Increase cross-cutting engagement on the nexus, in both formal and informal processes In order to have meaningful and productive multilateral debate, states need to be well informed about the escalation risks, as well as the potential humanitarian and environmental ramifications of developments at the space–nuclear nexus. The 2002Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation(HCOC) can strengthen understanding of the space–nuclear nexus by encouraging discussions during its annual Regular Meetings.While it is a voluntary instrument and not all states are subscribing parties, the HCOC is particularly relevant to the space–nuclear nexus, as it considersboth domains. Under the HCOC, states commit to providing others with notifications ahead of launching either ballistic missiles (capable of delivering WMD) and space-launch vehicles, or test flights of either, along with annual reports on their relevant policies. Outside governmental processes, there is additionally a role for experts and civil society in building up relevant knowledge and raising global awareness. Facilitating dialogue bycreating spacesoutside official forums where the space and nuclear communities, including those in civil society, can exchange views and knowledge is vital. Also important isregion-specific dialogue, as nuclear risks differ between contexts. Policy communities can encourage these efforts and, as appropriate, actively engage with them. Ultimately, attacks on space systems may trigger or fuel escalation towards nuclear use, which would have devastating consequences for all. It is critical to address the space–nuclear nexus at the multilateral level. About the authors: Nivedita Rajuisa Researcher inthe SIPRIWeapons of Mass Destruction Programme.

Flags At Nigerian Protests Could Signal Russian Plans To Expand I...	After forming alliances with military-led juntas in the Sahel, Russia might be moving its influence campaign south by supporting social unrest in Nigeria. During a 10-day August protest demanding better governance, some demonstrators in the northwestern city of Kano suddenly produced Russian flags and called on Russia to pressure the federal government for regime change. Authorities arrested 90 people for waving or making Russian flags. Nigerian Chief of Defense Gen. Christopher Musa told reporters the government would not accept citizens flying foreign flags. 'We will not accept anyone pushing for a change of government,' Musa said. Injecting Russian sentiment into domestic protests has become a standard ploy by Russian operatives in Africa, according to Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS) in Washington, D.C. 'The pattern of how Russia has been able to weaponize and hijack protests for its own political objectives is underappreciated on the continent,' Siegle told PassBlue, which covers the United Nations. 'It’s clearly an effort to foment unrest and manipulate authentic grievances.' The risk, Siegle said, is that Russian influence in Nigeria could cause isolated protests to expand into nation-crippling unrest. 'This is exactly the pattern we saw in Mali in the 18 months prior to the coup,' he said. Russia is a major purveyor of disinformation across Africa, particularly in the Sahel. Studies have shown that Russia accounts for 40% of disinformation on social media and fake news outlets. The African countries where Russia is active score an average of 22 out of 100 on Freedom House’s measure of access to political rights and civil liberties. African countries, on average, score 43. The ACSS estimates that Russian influence has stunted or derailed democratic progress in two dozen African countries. Russian disinformation campaigns target African countries with weak democratic institutions. Before Mali’s 2021 military coup, a Russian disinformation campaign undermined faith in the country’s elected government, which had been unable to defeat a Tuareg insurgency for many years. After the coup, the ruling junta quickly invited Russian Wagner Group mercenaries, now Africa Corps, to enter the country as 'trainers.' The mercenaries since have raided communities, executed people and violated human rights. Russia has had a similar influence in neighboring Burkina Faso and, more recently, Niger, which borders six Nigerian states to the north. Burkina Faso and Niger are ruled by juntas that overthrew democratic governments. 'So, when you see Russian flags in Nigeria, there is an obvious link to what Russia has done elsewhere,' Siegle told PassBlue. Russia has paired its military influence in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger with mining operations that target the Sahel’s most valuable national resources, including gold and uranium. Russian forces have followed a similar pattern in the Central African Republic, Libya and Sudan. Nigeria experienced five military coups between 1960 and 1999, but Nigeria’s 218 million people have lived under a multiparty democracy for 25 years. Nigeria’s northern states have a long historical, cultural and economic relationship with Niger. The regions share a largely Muslim, Hausa-speaking population. The northern states have lived for decades under the threat of terrorism from Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province. A study by the Observatory for Religious Freedom in Africa reported that nearly 56,000 people were killed in Nigeria in about 10,000 attacks from October 2019 to September 2023. More than 21,000 people were kidnapped during that same period. Observers worry the insecurity across northern Nigeria echoes the situation in the Sahelian countries, raising the potential for greater Russian influence in that region. Some see Russia’s recent attempt to develop influence in northern Nigeria as the precursor to an attempt to exploit gold resources in Zamfara State. 'Protests are a normal democratic act to demand change,' Siegle said. 'These are the very acts being hijacked by an external actor … which has been Russia’s key means of entry and influence in Africa.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO8_b2zlU8YvJ	2024-10-25T17:11:46-07:00	
Israel Launches Air Strikes In Iran	Israel has launched air strikes against targets in Iran, with the Israel Defense Forces announcing on social media that it was in 'response to months of continuous attacks'by the Iranian regime. 'Right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' the IDF statement on X said. Iran’s state TV said several strong explosions heard around the capital, but there was no official comment about the source of explosions. Local mediareported about loud explosions in the nearby city of Karaj city early on Saturday. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, Tehran’s second direct attack on Israel in six months. In its statement, the IDF said: 'The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th—on seven fronts—including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. 'Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO4U0VkLp0ZGj	2024-10-25T17:09:54-07:00	
Exchange Rate Uncertainty Endangers Japan’s Economic Stability – ...	By Gunther Schnabl In early August 2024, Japan played a prominent role in a global financial mini-crash. Markets reacted violently to the unexpected July announcement of the Bank of Japan’s decision to raise the key interest rate and halve its monthly bond purchases. That announcement preceded disappointing US employment figures, triggering expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The yen’s sudden appreciation forced many carry traders to hastily dissolve their positions which in turn caused market turmoil. The Bank of Japan haspostponed further interest rate increasesgiven the market’s recovery. But the event served as a reminder that carry trades originating in Japan and the yen–dollar exchange rate significantly affect international financial stability. One possible avenue for containing ongoing inflation risk and exchange rate uncertainty is pegging the yen to the dollar. Japan’s floating yen has been a source of unrest for decades. In the early 1980s, a depreciated yen and a fast-growing trade surplus in Japan led to accusations of unfair trade practices from Japan’s trading partners. The United States repeatedly encouraged the yen’s appreciation toobtain concessionsfrom Japan in trade negotiations until the mid-1990s. When the G5 nations announced an appreciation of the yen against the dollar with the September 1985 Plaza Agreement to cure trade imbalances between Japan and the United States,it kickstarteda ‘run to the yen’. The strong appreciation of the yen threw the export-dependent economy into a deep crisis. The yen’s depreciation starting from 1995 contributed to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis by eroding the competitiveness of Japan’s neighbours like South Korea and Thailand. Japanese banks faltered having provided extensive credit to Southeast Asia. The resulting 1998 Japanese financial crisis led to the perpetuation of Japan’s low-interest rate policy and the beginning of quantitative easing. With interest rates in Japan stuck at zero, speculators increasingly engaged in carry trades — raising cheap loans in Japan and investing in regions with significantly higher interest rates. This made them vulnerable to yen appreciation. Ordinary Japanese people — such as those pegged under the famous ‘Mrs Watanabe’ stereotype of Japanese currency traders — also invested abroad as there was hardly any domestic interest income to be found. The Abenomics policies pursued from 2013 led to the control of the term structure of interest rates, pushing 10-year government bond yields to zero. As bank deposits grew and demand for credit remained sluggish, Japanese banks further extended their investment abroad. Japan’s life insurance companies and pension funds have accumulated large foreign assets, especially in the United States. The Government Pension Investment Fund has assets of around 246 trillion yen (US$1.7 trillion), ofwhich about half is invested abroad. Exchange rate risks are often only partially hedged because of high costs. Japan’s net foreign assets increased to around 471.3 trillion yen at the end of 2023 (US$3.4 trillion at the 31 December exchange rate) due to Japan’s status as a large exporter of capital beginning in the 1980s. The prospect of converting the country’s immense foreign assets risks apotential appreciation of the yen. Japanese banks, life insurance companies, pension funds and households have become vulnerable because any appreciation reduces the value of foreign currency assets in terms of yen. The issue has greater importance due to Japan’s rapidly ageing society. If yen appreciation expectations are strengthened, the risk of another run to the yen increases as many investors may then rush to exchange foreign currency into yen, causing valuation losses for others.Uncontrolled yen–dollar movementshave become a risk for both Japanese and global financial stability. The Bank of Japan has maintained an expansionary monetary policy for 30 years — partially in order to control appreciation pressure. Monetary expansion in the United States tended to be accompanied by even larger expansion in Japan. This approach kept the yield of 10-year Japanese government bonds substantially below that of 10-year Treasury bonds. While this policy did not cause inflation for many years, consumer price inflation has exceeded the two per cent target since 2022. The Bank of Japan facesa dilemma. Lifting interest rates to contain inflation risks an appreciation of the yen, while keeping interest rates low to prevent appreciation may cause price increases and public discontent. Unlike in the 1980s, yen deprecation now serves the interests of not only the manufacturing industry but also the financial sector and pension funds. Prime MinisterShigeru Ishibahas signalled that monetary policy must remain accommodative to support economic recovery. The global financial risks stemming from yen appreciation could justify allowing it to depreciate. The burden on Japanese consumers would then further increase. One potential solution is pegging the yen to the US dollar. This would forestall politically and economically motivated yen depreciation, as the Bank of Japan would be only committed to exchange rate stability and not to the interests of lobbying groups. Japanese consumers would be protected against higher inflation. It might also be wise to eliminate appreciation-induced financial market risks. Since uncertainty would be reduced, the exchange rate peg would make a significant contribution to Japan’s economic stabilisation. Given the Bank of Japan already has limited room to manoeuvre — evident in its recent minuscule interest rate adjustments — the loss of monetary policy independence may be more palatable.

As Inflation Recedes, Global Economy Needs Policy Triple Pivot – ...	Let’s start with the good news: it looks like the global battle against inflation has largely been won, even if price pressures persist in some countries. After peaking at 9.4 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, we now project headline inflation will fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year, slightly below the average during the two decades before the pandemic. In most countries, inflation is now hovering close to central bank targets, paving the way for monetary easing across major central banks. The global economy remained unusually resilient throughout the disinflationary process. Growth is projected to hold steady at 3.2 percent in 2024 and 2025, but some low-income and developing economies have seen sizable downside growth revisions, often tied to intensifying conflicts. In advanced economies, growth in the United States is strong, at 2.8 percent this year, but will revert toward its potential in 2025. For advanced European economies, a modest growth rebound is expected next year, with output approaching potential. The growth outlook is very stable in emerging markets and developing economies, around 4.2 percent this year and next, with continued robust performance from emerging Asia. The decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement. AsChapter 2of our report argues, the surge and subsequent decline in inflation reflects a unique combination of shocks: broad supply disruptions coupled with strong demand pressures in the wake of the pandemic, followed by sharp spikes in commodity prices caused by the war in Ukraine. These shocks led to an upward shift and a steepening of the relationship between activity and inflation, the Phillips curve. As supply disruptions eased and tight monetary policy started to constrain demand, normalization in labor markets allowed inflation to decline rapidly without a major slowdown in activity. Clearly, much of the disinflation can be attributed to the unwinding of the shocks themselves, together with improvements in labor supply, often linked to increased immigration. But monetary policy played a decisive role by keeping inflation expectations anchored, avoiding deleterious wage-price spirals, and a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s. Despite the good news on inflation, downside risks are increasing and now dominate the outlook. An escalation in regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East, could pose serious risks for commodity markets. Shifts toward undesirable trade and industrial policies can significantly lower output relative to our baseline forecast. Monetary policy could remain too tight for too long, and global financial conditions could tighten abruptly. The return of inflation near central bank targets paves the way for a policy triple pivot. This would provide much-needed macroeconomic breathing room, at a time where risks and challenges remain elevated. The first pivot—on monetary policy—is under way already. Since June, major central banks in advanced economies have started to cut policy rates, moving toward a neutral stance. This will support activity at a time when many advanced economies’ labor markets are showing signs of cooling, with rising unemployment rates. So far, however, the rise in unemployment has been gradual and does not point to an imminent slowdown. Lower interest rates in major economies will ease the pressure on emerging market economies, with their currencies strengthening against the US dollar and financial conditions improving. This will help reduce imported inflation, allowing these countries to pursue their own disinflation path more easily. However, vigilance remains key. Inflation in services remains too elevated, almost double pre-pandemic levels. A few emerging market economies are facing a resurgence of inflationary pressures and have started to raise policy rates again. Furthermore, we have now entered a world dominated by supply disruptions—from climate, health, and geopolitical tensions. It is always harder for monetary policy to contain inflation when faced with such shocks, which simultaneously increase prices and reduce output. Finally, while inflation expectations remained well-anchored this time, it may be harder next time, as workers and firms will be more vigilant about protecting pay and profits. The second pivot is on fiscal policy. Fiscal space is a cornerstone of macroeconomic and financial stability. After years of loose fiscal policy in many countries, it is now time to stabilize debt dynamics and rebuild much-needed fiscal buffers. While the decline in policy rates provides some fiscal relief by lowering funding costs, this will not be sufficient, especially as long-term real interest rates remain far above pre-pandemic levels. In many countries, primary balances (the difference between fiscal revenues and public spending net of debt service) need to improve. For some, including the United States and China, current fiscal plans do not stabilizedebt dynamics. In many others, while early fiscal plans showed promise after the pandemic and cost-of-living crises, there are increasing signs of slippage. The path is narrow: delaying consolidation increases the risk of disorderly market-imposed adjustments, while an excessively abrupt turn toward fiscal tightening could be self-defeating and hurt economic activity. Success requires implementing a sustained and credible multi-year adjustments without delay, where consolidation is necessary. The more credible and disciplined the fiscal adjustment, the more monetary policy can play a supporting role by easing policy rates while keeping inflation in check. But the willingness or ability to deliver disciplined and credible fiscal adjustments have been lacking. The third pivot—and the hardest—is toward growth-enhancing reforms. Much more needs to be done to improve growth prospects and lift productivity, as this is the only way we can address the many challenges we face: rebuilding fiscal buffers; coping with aging and shrinking populations in many parts of the world; tackling the climate transition; increasing resilience, and improving the lives of the most vulnerable, within and across countries. Unfortunately, growth prospects for five years from now remain lackluster, at 3.1 percent, the lowest in decades. While much of this reflects China’s weaker outlook, medium-term prospects in other regions, including Latin America and the European Union, have also deteriorated. Faced with increased external competition and structural weaknesses in manufacturing and productivity, many countries are implementing industrial and trade policy measures to protect domestic workers and industries. But external imbalances often reflect macroeconomic forces: a weakening domestic demand in China, or excessive demand in the United States. Addressing these will requiresetting the macro dials appropriately. Moreover, while industrial and trade policy measures can sometimes boost investment and activity in the short run—especially when relying on debt-financed subsidies—they often lead to retaliation and fail to deliver sustained improvements in standards of living. They should be avoided when not carefully addressing well-identified market failures or narrowly defined national security concerns. Economic growth must come instead from ambitious domestic reforms that boost technology and innovation, improve competition and resource allocation, further economic integration and stimulate productive private investment. Yet while reforms are as urgent as ever, they often face significant social resistance. How can policymakers win the support they need for reforms to succeed? AsChapter 3of our report shows, information strategies can help but can only go so far. Building trust between government and citizens—a two-way process throughout the policy design—and the inclusion of proper compensation to offset potential harms, are essential features. Building trust is an important lesson that should also resonate when thinking about ways to further improve international cooperation and bolster our multilateral efforts to address common challenges, in the year that we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions. —This article is based on the October 2024 World Economic Outlook.

Trump’s Latest Tariff Plan Just Replaces One Tax With Another – O...	By Ryan McMaken Donald Trump on Mondayfloated the ideathat he might seek to replace the federal income tax with federal taxes on imports—also known as tariffs. This is potentially a good idea, but not for economic reasons. There is no economic reason why tariffs are any better or any worse than the income tax. A tariff, which is just a tax, is no less compulsory than the income tax. A tariff is no less destructive to private wealth and capital than the income tax. Contrary to various protectionist myths, Americans pay tariffs like they pay any other tax imposed by the US government. On the other hand, a tariff isn’t necessarilyworsethan an income tax. Yes, tariffs act to diminish trade, and that’s a bad thing. But income taxes do the same. When people pay taxes of any kind—whether they are income taxes or tariffs, people have less money to spend on—or invest in—everything,regardless of where it is made or located. The only reason why it might be a good thing to 'replace' income taxes with tariffs—note that we’re not being offered any significant cuts in taxesoverall—is that income taxes have always been a way for the federal government to engage in wholesale violations of individual privacy. Since the legalization of the income tax in 1913, the federal government has claimed the power to monitor every wage earner’s income. Theoretically, replacing income-tax revenue with tariff revenue would reduce the number of Americans who must report all their financial affairs to the federal government every year. That’s not an economic argument, it’s a political one, and maybe that’s reason enough to bother abolishing the income tax, even if something else replaces it. In economic terms, though, let’s not pretend replacing one tax with another makes anyone more free or better off. The Problem with Tax Reform All this talk about 'replacing' one tax with another means we’re talking about tax 'reform,' not tax abolition. Every now and then, we encounter various types of tax 'reform' such as replacing the progressive income tax with a flat tax, or replacing income taxes with a VAT tax or national sales tax. There is rarely any reason to get very excited about tax reform, because it usually just rearranges the tax burden without endangering the regime’s ability to collect huge amounts of revenue. As with most tax reform plans, the Trump proposal to replace one tax with another is based on the premise that overall tax revenue should be 'revenue neutral.' That is, the amount of tax revenue extracted from Americans will be more or less the same, and the American state will continue to have many trillions of dollars to spend each year. That’s not exactly a great blow to state power, nor does it offer any sort of boon to economic activity or the standard of living for ordinary Americans. Moreover, when it comes to Trump’s proposal, the details of what we mean by 'income tax' matter a lot. When Trump says he wants to abolish 'the income tax,' its unclear if he just means the graduated income tax, oralltaxes on income. After all, all wage earning Americans pay enormous amounts of taxes in the form ofpayrolltaxes. Payroll taxes are income taxes, and in order to collect them, the government demands access to the details of everyone’s earnings. So, any benefits in terms of added privacy and freedom will only be achievedif all taxes on income are abolished.That means no graduated income tax, no payroll taxes at all, and the abolition of all the machinery of the IRS. If Trump only abolishes the graduated income tax and replaces it with high tariffs, then our position is hardly improved. The federal government still monitors all our earnings,andwe get to pay a lot more for basic goods. That’s the sort of tax reform that is not worth caring about. For argument’s sake, though, let’s say Trump abolishes all income taxes and replaces them with tariffs—which would exactly 'replace' the revenues formerly obtained through income taxes. In terms of financial privacy, this would be a good thing for our everyday lives. Regular people who are not directly involved in international trade would generally not have to worry about the endless paperwork that comes with income taxes. That’s all to the good. Economically speaking, though, the 'reform' makes no difference. Tariffs would still be sucking trillions of dollars out of the private economy in a way similar to income taxes. Moreover, with tariffs rising to much higher levels, efforts to avoid tariffs will become much more widespread, and smuggling will become an occasion for much federal handwringing. As federal bureaucrats do now with income taxes, there will be demands for more taxpayer money to staff agents to enforce tariffs mandates. Again, this isn’t necessarily any better or worse than the situation with income taxes, but these facts are reminders that all taxes require enforcement, and tariffs are hardly some kind of kindler, gentler tax. What Real Tax Reform Would Look Like No revenue-neutral will ever make any real difference to the size and scope of the state, however. The only change that would make a real difference is a program of sizable cuts tobothtaxes and spending. Tax cuts alone will never make us better off because tax cuts without spending cuts only means bigger deficits.Bigger deficits mean more inflationary monetarypolicy and more price inflation. Tax cuts without spending cuts mean the tax burden is merely shifted from nominal taxes to the de facto tax of price inflation. If a politician claims to be a 'tax cutter,' he is not to be taken seriously unless he’s also for cutting spending. When Trump rearranges tax programs or cuts taxes while also signing off on more deficit spending, he is really raising everyone’s inflation tax. No tax 'reform' changes this.

California’s Prop 2: Unions Win, Students And Taxpayers Lose – Op...	California, where I live, is often considered a trendsetting state, providing an example that others frequently choose to follow. As a long-time resident, however, I can attest our policy examples are often very bad ones to follow, if we are to judge by their adverse effects. Proposition 2 on November’s ballot is a good example. On the surface, it appears to be a relatively standard 'we need more money for our schools' bond issue, except for its $10 billion price tag. And given the well-earned distrust voters have learned to apply toward our state government, it comes with now-standard boilerplate assurances that if it passes, things will be done right this time. The pro-Proposition 2 ballot argument claims there will be 'strict taxpayer accountability protections,' 'local control,' and assurance that the funds will be 'used efficiently.' But it comes with a hidden surprise that contradicts those promises. That surprise, not mentioned at all in the Official Voter Information Guide, is that every specific project with a Project Labor Agreement will be given preference over one without a PLA. And PLAs not only routinely discriminate against the vast majority of Californians, studies have found they inflated the costs of school construction projects by15 percent or more, and sometimesfar more, and resulted infewer total projects. When voters hear about the burdens of projects subject to PLAs, they become far less likely to vote for initiatives imposing them. The hiding is deliberate. How that was hidden is also instructive. Proposition 2 began life asAB 247in the California legislature. The PLA was included there as something the union leash-holders of California Democrats demanded as tribute (and 15 percent or more of $10 billion is a pretty hefty 'tip' for them). But even then it was still 'camouflaged' by its placement near the end of a section about a point system that would be used to compute matching funds, in order to minimize how much it was noticed. But not all of AB 247 made it to the ballot. Only the bond authorization is there as Proposition 2; the rest of the legislation takes effect if voters say yes (without ever hearing about the PLAs) to the debt. That does not seem like how one would go about producing 'strict taxpayer accountability protections,' or 'local control,' or ensuring that the funds will be 'used efficiently.' And understanding how PLAs work strongly reinforces that conclusion. PLAs are agreements typically drafted by construction unions, without any input from nonunion contractors or workers, that all bidders on particular projects must accept. They typically force union representation, includingmandatory membershipandunion feesfor all workers (including those working fornonunion employers), following union work classifications and rules, getting all workers fromunion hiring hallsand all apprentices from union apprenticeship programs, and contributing tounion benefitand multi-employer pension plans that few if any non-union members will ever get a penny from. Examiningunion claimsthat they just 'level the playing field' for all competitors reveals how discriminatory as well as inefficient they are. PLAs level the playing field only by forcing everyone to follow union-determined policies and pay union-determined wages. They give unions an overwhelming home field advantage byhandicapping nonunion firms’ ability to utilize their superior abilities. Nonunion contractors have no say in PLA negotiations. They cannot incorporate terms that allow them to use their resources most efficiently. They must give up their flexibility, as with workers who can cross highly inflexible union job boundaries. They can no longer hire nonunion apprentices. They can’t use less-skilled and -costly 'helper' workers efficiently, stymied by union limitations. They even give up the ability to choose their own workers, whom they trust and who already work well together in teams, to the requirement that all workers come through union hiring-halls. In sum, they make nonunion contractors act like union contractors while extracting fees from workers. PLAs, together with prevailing wage laws, as in California, also keep nonunion contractors from passing onlower costs to taxpayersfrom a labor force who choose market pay rates less than inflated union scales. Nonunion workers, even under a PLA that requires prevailing union wages, also take a hit. They must pay dues and contribute to union benefits without ever getting those benefits, which many already get from their employer. Those substantial deductions leave them paid less as a result. Further, the added burdens on nonunion contractors often leads them not to bid on PLA contracts, reducing the demand for nonunion contractors’ and workers’ services and the competition to win contracts. Roughly83 percent of all construction workersin California are nonunion; they share the burden imposed on taxpayers by preferential union contracts. Black,minorityandwomen’s groupsin construction oppose PLAs since the vast majority of them are nonunion. Requiring journeymen and journeyman pay for most tasks, reducing helper jobs, likewise crowds out minority workers, who are, on average, skill acquiring skills. The National Black Chamber of Commerce hascalled PLAs'a license to discriminate against black workers.' All of those inefficiencies and inequities produce higher costs. They also run up against some embarrassing questions. Should taxpayers be charged more for school projects, just to ensure public funds flow only to Democrats’ supporters? Why are the vast majority of construction industry workers in non-union organizations, if using union organization and rules was generally superior for workers and results? Proposition 2, like most legislation favoring interest groups, punishes and extorts the many for the benefit of the influential few. Governments often find themselves beholden to special interests, prioritizing the demands of concentrated groups over the broader interests of taxpayers. When these groups provide significant financial and logistical support during elections, policymakers tend to favor their agendas, even when the resulting policies impose hidden or underappreciated costs on the public. This dynamic undermines transparency and fair representation, as the true impact of these decisions is often concealed. Citizens should not be forced to bear the burden of special interest demands in exchange for essential public services, such as infrastructure upgrades. Until we are presented with policies that genuinely reflect the promises made to voters, rejecting such initiatives would be the best path forward.

Ralph Nader: To Chamber Of Commerce Trumpers – Watch What You Wis...	Open Letter to President and CEO Suzanne P. Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Dear President Clark, The Chamber has come a long way without my advice. However, perhaps, you will indulge my curiosity over the majority of your members supporting Donald Trump for President. There are few conditions that the business community craves more than stability and predictability. Donald Trump is a daily chaos machine. He survives and thrives on turmoil. It is integral to his egocentric personality and supercilious character traits. It is also terribly distracting for those who focus on the business of business. It produces unproductive divisions and uproars which are bad for society and the economy. It is no secret that Mr. Trump will pursue policies of revenge against his political opponents, judges, law enforcers, and others who dared to openly defy him. Recall his July 2019 declaration, 'I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President.' That has been hismodus vivendi. Whole classes of people, critical to the functioning of the economy, are on his retribution hit list. If elected, Trump, a convicted felon and the subject of multiple indictments will target immigrants, academic specialists, student activists, and a wide swath of Americans he stereotypes as 'leftists, Marxists and lunatics.' People who happen to not like Trump, his outlawry, fact deprivations, prevarications, bigotry, misogyny, and his contempt for those he calls 'suckers and losers,' including people with disabilities, are all at risk. Even retired generals, usually reluctant to enter the political fray, are now speaking out in no uncertain terms against Trump’s candidacy. Consider some specific policy positions he has stridently advanced. Trump thinks higher tariffs across the board, are paid by the foreign exporter and not passed on to consumers as higher prices. Do you know any business economists who have accepted this bizarre notion? Apart from this inflationary impact, a tariff war is believed to invite certain retaliation by foreign countries. Trump, regularly, rejects grave realities, past and present, replacing them with serious delusions. He cannot process information and brags about not reading. Trump incites violence and brings out the worst kind of hatefulness against large groups of Americans whom he paints as 'enemies within.' Many of these people merely disagree with Trump. He seriously degrades reasonable trust in the electoral process by characterizing elections he loses as being 'rigged.' Moreover, where pro-Trump governors and legislators are in office, varieties of unprecedented voter suppression and purges are rampant. Your late predecessor, Thomas J. Donohue rejected such 'conduct' as eroding 'our democratic institutions.' The Chamber may like his additional tax-cutting promises until, your economists tally up the deficits. The federal debt now takes more interest dollars to service than the Pentagon’s budget. The ever-increasing, unaudited military budget, it is never enough for Trump and causes a serious diversion from public budgets for job-producing investments in infrastructure repair and upgrading so essential for a modern corporate economy. Trump also wants to compromise the touted independence of the Federal Reserve. It is part of his web of presidential control and he is, as you know, a control freak. What is different from his first term is that, if elected, he would bring in a larger number of political appointees with extreme ideological biases and utter contempt for the civil service. Does the Chamber wish to return to the 19thcentury 'spoils system' and the corrosive corruption that it fostered? Corruption often involves overreaching business crooks who give your community a bad name and incessant negative headlines. Imagine the labor disruptions that would be caused by Trump’s determination to generate the largest deportations in American history. Over and over again he calls immigrants criminals, drug traffickers and invokes a variety of equally vile and unfounded sweeping stereotypes. His base will insist on his follow-through. This will also provoke serious ethnic tensions with costly collateral damage to critical sectors of the economy. The oil, gas, and coal companies comprise a key bloc of your membership. They applaud Trump calling climate violence a 'hoax and his 'drill baby drill' mantra. Unfortunately, mega-hurricanes, mega-floods, and mega-wildfires will have the final verdict on Trump’s destructive scrapping of a swifter transition to renewable and conservation efficiencies. You may like his constant reference to 'deregulation' or as he has recently called for 'no regulation.' Aside from studies showing the benefits of regulatory standards (see what weak regulation has done to Boeing since 2020) and protection of health and safety, what do you really have to fear from the best corporate Democrats money can buy? Besides you have a corporate judiciary bolstered by powerful corporate law firms, right up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Chamber’s members are predominantly Republican from years of allegiance to the GOP. Trump, the Republican nominee has repeatedly refused to accede to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose in November. You may wish to urgently advise your members to 'Be careful what they wish for.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO-WORjVcR0c0	2024-10-25T16:25:14-07:00	
Moscow Should Be Focusing On Lowering Mortality Rather Than Boost...	Russia’s fertility rate is approximately where Europe’s is, but its mortality rate is far higher. And because no modern country has had much success in boosting the former, Russia should be focusing on reducing the latter if it is prevent the country’s total population from continuing to decline, Russian demographers say. Unfortunately, they add, the Russian government has focused almost exclusively on boosting birthrates, something it thinks it can do, and continues to ignore reducing mortality rates by improving medical care and lifestyle choices (holod.media/2024/10/16/k-2100-godu-budet-menshe-100-millionov/). Aby Shukyurov says that in fact, Russia’s birthrate 'might be fine' given that it is an increasingly urban and modern society; but its 'mortality rate is anything but.' The former is 'comparable to Europes’s' but its mortality rate is far higher. Moreover, cardiovascular diseases rather than cancer remain the primary cause of death in contrast to Europe. Dmitry Zakotyansky points out that economic inequality is a major contributing factor to Russia’s low life expectancy, with as many as 40 percent of all Russians living in poverty, continuing to smoke and drink heavily and are more likely to be involved in or affected by crime, all of which are things the government could but isn’t addressing. Both demographers say that Russia’s demographic situation has been affected by the war in Ukraine given that according to some estimates, 120,000 Russian soldiers have died there and 400,000 more have suffered injuries which are likely to shorten their life expectancies. Again the regime could end that conflict and improve the country’s demography. Indeed, their arguments imply that all the Kremlin’s talk about boosting the birthrate is first and foremost a smokescreen to conceal its almost complete unwillingness to address mortality issues, precisely the area where state intervention could be far more effective in improving Russia’s demographic future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO5s92If7RKzr	2024-10-25T16:21:22-07:00	
Patent Monopolies And PBMs: Protectionism Leads To Corruption – O...	Last week I saw a somewhat shabbily dressed man in the pharmacy trying to get a Covid booster. They told him it would cost $130. (It was the Moderna booster.) He said that he didn’t have this money. The pharmacist and a couple of people in line then suggested a few places he may be able to get it at a lower cost, or possibly even free. The man left and was hopefully able to get an affordable shot. I was reminded of this incident when I read a New York Timespieceon pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). The gist of the piece is that PBMs often engage in sleazy practices that involve squeezing some drug stores, while overcompensating the chains with which they are affiliated. The result is higher prices and lower quality service, as many drug stores go out of business. Years ago, Ronald Reagan ran around saying that we don’t need government to fix the problem, government is the problem. In the case of the high cost of drugs and vaccines and other pharmaceutical products, Reagan is exactly on the mark. The problems that people face in getting the drugs they need at affordable prices is almost entirely due to government-granted patent monopolies and related protections. The point, which I know I make endlessly, is that drugs are almost always cheap to manufacture and distribute. In a free market it would be rare that a drug would sell for more than $30 a prescription – and often for considerably less. We would not have problems paying for our drugs and vaccines if they sold at free market prices. And there would be no such thing as PBMs in a free market. Do we have 'grocery benefit managers?' Government-granted patent monopolies create this totally avoidable problem where people have to struggle to pay for the drugs they need to protect their health and possibly their life. These can cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Even if they are able to get an insurer, the government, or a GoFundMe page to cover the cost, why do we want to make people struggling with serious health issues go through this effort? Public Funding: A Better Option Than Patent Monopolies The rationale for patent monopolies is that they are necessary for the industry to recoup the research costs involved in developing new drugs or vaccines. If they spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing a drug, and then generic competitors could start producing it the day it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they would have no ability to earn back the money they had invested. If this was the situation drug companies faced, they would never invest serious money in developing new drugs since it would not be profitable. This argument is completely true, but the problem with the logic is that we have other mechanisms for financing the research needed to develop new drugs. We could have public funding. This is not a secret. We currently spend over $50 billion a year to finance biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government agencies. If we wanted to replace the patent-supported research currently conducted by the pharmaceutical industry, we would need to increase this amount by around $120 billion a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but we would likelysavemore than $500 billion a year by having all drugs and pharmaceutical products sold in a free market. If we were to increase government funding enough to replace the patent-supported research currently done by the industry, we would likely want a different mechanism. My preferred route, which I discuss inRigged(it’s free) is a system where the government signs long-term contracts (e.g. 10-15 years) with drug companies to support research in specific areas. For example, a company could contract to get $40 billion to do research for the next 12 years into developing treatments and/or cures for heart disease. Another company may contract to do research on breast cancer or lung cancer. The idea would be that the government would make the initial award and then have a largely hands off approach, other than periodic audits just to make sure that work is actually being done and the company’s executives have not just run off to Bermuda. I held up the Defense Department as a model for this sort of contracting. While there are plenty of abuses in military contracting, the fact is that we do get good weapons at the end of the day. And, we have a huge advantage with biomedical research over military procurement. There are legitimate grounds for secrecy with military research. We don’t want to put the plans for our latest weapon systems on the web where ISIS can download them. There is no basis for similar fears with biomedical research. In fact, we should want research findings shared as broadly as possible, so that researchers around the world can benefit from the latest developments (more on this in a moment). In fact, we can look to a better example for successful government contracting than straight military research. Former Biden administration economist Ernie Tedeschi pointed me to the example of SpaceX, which has made enormous progress in improving the efficiency of putting objects into space. In spite of the contempt its CEO seems to have towards the government, Musk’s accomplishments in this area were done on the government’s dime. It’s reasonable to assume that if a government agency can successfully find an innovative company like SpaceX to develop new rocket systems, a government agency can also find innovative companies to do good research in developing new drugs. The lack of secrecy should help in this process. In fact, when contracting for the development of new drugs, a condition of getting the money should be that any contractor, as well as all subcontractors (most defense contracts involve many subcontractors), post all their findings on the web as soon as practical. This will both allow for rapid dissemination, so that other researchers can quickly build on successes and learn from failures, and also limit opportunities for waste and fraud. If a company with a major contract for research in a specific area has nothing to show after six months or a year, it will be very clear to the experts in the field that something is seriously wrong. If there is not a very good story as to why the company does not seem to be making progress, or even have failures to report, then it presumably would lose its contract. This sort of openness will require some agreement for sharing the costs of research across countries. Some may view this sort of international agreement as impossible, but in fact this is exactly what the United States has been negotiating with the TRIPS provisions of the WTO and numerous other provisions on intellectual property in trade agreements over the last four decades. Working out a deal may prove contentious, but the negotiations over intellectual property issues are already contentious. There is another very important advantage to open research that is impossible to exaggerate. The patent monopoly financing system gives drug companies an enormous incentive to misrepresent the safety and effectiveness of their drugs. The markups on patent-protected drugs are typically many thousand percent over production costs. This gives drug companies a huge incentive to push their drugs as widely as possible. The opioid crisis was the most extreme example of this sort of misrepresentation, where drug companies lied about the addictiveness of the new generation of opioids, but the problemarisesconstantly. The FDA does try to police the industry, and stronger rules on the availability of clinical trial data make deception more difficult, but when a company faces such large gains from lying, it will be difficult to ensure evidence on safety and effectiveness is presented fully and accurately. In a system of open research, where contracts are renewed and expanded based on a big picture assessment of the value of its research quality, there would be little incentive or opportunity to lie in a way that could have adverse health outcomes. Companies will try to put their research in the best possible light. But at worst, any exaggerations would lead to a bad allocation of research funds, where a less effective company got funding in place of one that would be more effective. That’s unfortunate, we want to the money to go where it would be most productive, but that is of much less consequence than treating people with a drug that is ineffective or even harmful. There is one other important aspect to this mode of direct public funding as an alternative to patent-financed research. There are often nutritional or environmental factors (e.g. exposure to lead) that have major effects on health outcomes. Under the current system, the pharmaceutical industry has no incentive to examine these possibilities. They are only rewarded for developing a patentable product. Discovering that processed sugar might increase the frequency of certain types of mental illness is not going to get them any money. They therefore have no incentive to research to this sort of issue and even if their efforts to develop a patentable product might point in this direction, they would have no incentive to share that information. By contrast, if companies are being awarded contracts based on their record for producing useful research, they would have tremendous incentive to pursue leads suggesting that nutrition, exercise, or other factors have a significant impact on health in particular areas. This could lead to a far more integrated approach to public health. Getting From Here to There I have been around Washington long enough to know that we’re not about to replace the mechanism for financing drug development in one fell swoop. That would look hugely risky from both an economic standpoint – pharmaceuticals is a huge industry – and also a health standpoint. We don’t want to take a risk that many important drugs don’t get developed because we have dynamited our industry. But it is possible to envision a gradual path where we demonstrate the effectiveness of the direct funding model in two or three areas. This could mean some additional allocation of funding to NIH with the idea that it would go to directly supporting the development and testing of new drugs, which would then be available as generics from the day they are approved. For example, we could allocate $30 billion over the next decade ($3 billion a year) to support the development of new drugs to treat specific type of cancer or diabetes. This would not prevent the industry from pursuing patent-supported research in the same area. The companies would just face the risk that if they did develop a new drug that it may be competing with one that is every bit as effective and selling for less than one-tenth of the price. Of course, if the industry is confident that government-funded research will only lead to dead ends, they need not fear this risk. There actually is already a proof of concept that we can point to. Drs. Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi, along with their colleagues at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital, developed a Covid vaccine, Corbevax. This vaccine has now been administered to more than 100 million people in India and Indonesia, protecting them against serious illness and death from Covid. Corbevax was developed on an open-source model. This means that the process for producing the vaccine, as well as the data on safety and effectiveness, is entirely open and available to anyone. That means anyone in the world with the necessary manufacturing facilities can produce the vaccine. As a result, the vaccine is cheap, selling for around $2.50 a dose in India and Indonesia. It would be desirable to have the Corbevax vaccine available in the United States. While it would likely cost somewhat more here, due to higher costs for labor and other items, we’re probably talking around $5 a shot. That compares to the $130 for the Moderna booster that my pharmacy was going to charge the shabbily dressed man. (Most people don’t see this price tag, since insurers or the government are picking up much or all of the tab for the boosters, but we do ultimately pay this cost through one pocket or another.) It would be a great first step if the FDA would approve Corbevax for distribution in the U.S. In addition to saving billions of dollars paying for boosters, and making them universally assessable, it would help to make the basic point. Drugs are cheap, government-granted patent monopolies make them expensive. Once people fully appreciate this fact, we can have more intelligent discussions of the best mechanism for financing research.

Uzbekistan: ‘We Look For Men In Beards As We Are Searching For Te...	By Mushfig Bayram From March onwards, Muslim men across Uzbekistan wearing long beards have been arrested, had their beards forcibly shaved, and fined. Muslims who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals have told Forum 18 of being arrested in and around mosques and street markets by police. Ozodlik.org (RFE/RL)Nationwide, Muslim men with long beards have been arrested during raids led by State Secret Service (SSS) secret police and ordinary police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers. The men have then been taken to police stations, had their beards forcibly shaved, and then warned that they will be fined or receive short-term jail sentences if they wear a long beard again. The fines imposed have ranged between about one month's to just over a week's average wages for those in work (see below). Some Muslim men have told Forum 18 that they have since March kept their beards 'trimmed and very thin' to avoid such punishments (see below). Regime officials have given a variety of excuses for their actions. During a March raid on a Tashkent mosque during Friday prayers, officials forced 15 male mosque attendees with beards into a room at the mosque, a Muslim who was present and wishes to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Police then claimed to the men that young people were becoming radicalised and being influenced by what were described as 'all kinds of religious movements'. Police then claimed that, therefore, all beards must be shaved off. 'If you follow their logic, a person who does not have a beard does not become radicalised,' the Muslim commented (see below). One police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' official claimed to Forum 18 that 'we sometimes look for men in beards as we are searching for terrorists. It is difficult to determine who they are at first, and sometimes they look alike. But,' he continued, 'when there is no beard or very short beard we can identify the person' (see below). When Forum 18 asked why people who the police did not identify as terrorists after an arrest still had their beards shaved, the police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' official claimed: 'I think it was because they resist the police officers' demand that they go to a police station.' He then refused to talk more, and claimed that 'we cannot discuss cases with you without the permission of the Interior Ministry.' The regime has often made allegations of alleged 'terrorism' (typically against devout Muslims) without any credible evidence (see below). Many police, Interior Ministry, SSS secret police, and court officials refused to explain to Forum 18 why Muslim men wearing long beards nationwide have from March onwards been arrested, had their beards forcibly shaved, and fined (see below). Muslims and human rights defenders, who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, have told Forum 18 that they think the regime may be planning to attack women wearing the hijab in a similar way to attacks on men wearing long beards (see below). Tashkent mosque raids In March, the State Security Service (SSS) secret police and ordinary police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers raided a Tashkent mosque during Friday prayers. Officials forced 15 male mosque attendees with beards into a room at the mosque, a Muslim who was present and wishes to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Police then claimed to the men that young people were becoming radicalised and being influenced by what were described as 'all kinds of religious movements'. The police then claimed that, therefore, all beards must be shaved off. 'If you follow their logic, a person who does not have a beard does not become radicalised,' the Muslim commented. The regime has often madeallegations of alleged 'terrorism'(typically against devout Muslims) without any credible evidence. A symptom of this attitude is the long-standing involvement of police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers in human rights violations against people of all beliefs. Some Muslim men have told Forum 18 that they have since March kept their beards 'trimmed and very thin' to avoid such punishments. In June, theSSS secret police, ordinary police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officers, and TashkentReligious Affairs Committeeofficials raided a different mosque in Tashkent Region during Friday prayers. Religious Affairs Committee official Odil Saidaliyev questioned the men who were present, one of them who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Saidaliyev then ordered all the men to shave off their beards. Tashkent Regional Police spokesperson Captain Bobur Tulyaganov refused on both 29 July and 18 October to answer Forum 18's questions about the raids. After Forum 18 asked the questions he put the phone down and did not answer further calls. Tashkent Religious Affairs Committee official Saidaliyev did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called on numerous occasions between 29 July and 18 October. Raids, fines, and forcible beard shavings continue nationwide Raids, fines, and forcible beard shavings have continued nationwide. When charges are brought against bearded men, they typically have been under Administrative Code Article 194, Part 1 ('Failure to carry out the lawful demands of a police officer or other persons carrying out duties to guard public order'), Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism'), and Administrative Code Article 184−4 ('Being in public places with the face covered to an extent that does not allow identification of a person'),introduced in September 2023. A typical example was a series of raids between 22 May and 29 May by Jizzakh Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'on Jizzakh's Kuk bozor open air market. Muslim men wearing beards were arrested, ordered to shave off beards, prosecuted and fined. The fines imposed ranged between 1,700,000 Soms (about two weeks' average wages for those in formal work) and 680,000 Soms (just over a week's average wages for those in work). A Jizzakh Regional Police officer, who refused to give his name, told Forum 18 on 21 October that the raids and fines happened, but refused to explain why Muslim men are not allowed to grow long beards. Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officer Rahmiddin Pardayev, who took part in the raids, refused on 21 October to explain why Muslim men were ordered to shave off their beards and fined. He went on to claim that 'we cannot do anything without the Interior Ministry in Tashkent agreeing, including talking to you.' 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' Deputy Head Ilhom Hajamkulov put the phone down each time Forum 18 called him and introduced itself. Judge Janibek Tangmatov of Jizzakh Court imposed some of the fines, and Court Chancellery officials who refused to give their names refused on 21 October to explain to Forum 18 why the Court fined Muslim men for wearing beards. Judge Tangmatov's assistant, Sardor Saadullayev, asked Forum 18 on 21 October to call back the following day as 'the Judge is busy'. When Forum 18 called back on 22 October, Saadullayev refused to put Forum 18 through to Judge Tangmatov and also refused to explain why Muslim men were fined for wearing beards. Andijan Region raids Similar raids on bazaars and streets also took place in Andijan Region. For example, on 10 May Asaka District Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officers stopped in the street a Muslim man for wearing a long beard. Asaka District Court then fined him 3,400,000 Soms (just over one month's average wages for those in work). On 13 June, Andijan Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'raided Andijan's Jahon bazaar, an open air market. Timurshah Odilov, a local Muslim man with a beard, refused to go a police station to have his beard shaved off as he had a child with him. However, he told officers that he would shave off his beard at home. One of the 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department' officers then grabbed Odilov by the collar while another officer twisted his arm. They then took him to a police station to have his beard shaved off. He was then prosecuted for wearing a beard. Judge Mukhayyakhon Turdiyeva of Andijan City Court fined Odilov 1,020,000 Soms (about one and a half weeks' average wages for those in formal work) under:- Administrative Code Article 184−4 ('Covering one's face in public places to the extent that it hinders identification');- Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism');-Administrative Code Article 184-3('Production, storage or distribution of works promoting national, ethnic, racial, or religious hatred');- and Administrative Code Article 194, Part 1 ('Failure to carry out the lawful demands of a police officer or other persons carrying out duties to guard public order'). Officer Murad Kasimov of Andijan Regional Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'on 21 October at first denied to Forum 18 that raids took place, or that Muslim men were stopped, had beards shaved off, and were fined. 'I do not know where you take your facts but we do not raid looking for bearded men,' he claimed. When Forum 18 referred to cases it knew of, Officer Kasimov admitted that 'maybe minor incidents took place, but there were no raids'. He refused to explain why Muslim men wearing beards were targeted. He asked Forum 18 to on 22 October call the head of Andijan Regional Police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department,' Kasim Maripov. When Forum 18 repeatedly called Maripov on 22 October, the duty officer put the phone down as soon as he heard Forum 18's name. Andijan Regional Court officials on 21 and 22 October refused to explain to Forum 18 why courts fined Muslim men for wearing long beards. One official, Jovokhir Jubakov, Head of the Court's Chancellery, put the phone down on 21 October after Forum 18 asked questions about the fines. 'We sometimes look for men in beards as we are searching for terrorists' In August in Namangan Region, police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department'officers stopped a Muslim man with a beard, who was then given a five-day short-term jail sentence under Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism'). Akramjon Omonov, Deputy Head of Namangan Police'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department', on 21 October denied that Muslim men are punished for wearing long beards. His subordinate Mansur Valiyev claimed that 'we sometimes look for men in beards as we are searching for terrorists. It is difficult to determine who they are at first, and sometimes they look alike. But,' Valiyev continued, 'when there is no beard or very short beard we can identify the person.' When Forum 18 asked why people who the police did not identify as terrorists after an arrest still had their beards shaved, Valiyev claimed: 'I think it was because they resist the police officers' demand that they go to a police station.' He then refused to talk more, and claimed that 'we cannot discuss cases with you without the permission of the Interior Ministry'. Avazjon Khasanov, Deputy Head of the Interior Ministry's'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department', would not explain to Forum 18 on 18 October why Muslim men were being punished nationwide for wearing beards. 'I am not responsible for religious issues any longer, please talk to someone else,' he claimed – even though Khasanov's colleagues stated he was still responsible for freedom of religion or belief cases. When Forum 18 called Khasanov again, he claimed that it was 'a wrong number'. AnSSS secret policeofficer at their Tashkent headquarters on 18 October refused to talk about the raids and punishments for beards. He refused to give his name and claimed that 'I am responsible for the Education Department'. He refused to put Forum 18 through to any other responsible SSS officials. Officials of theReligious Affairs Committee, which is responsible along with other regime agencies for suppressing freedom of religion or belief, did not answer their phones on 21 or 22 October. Regime plans attacks on women wearing hijab also? Muslims and human rights defenders, who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, have told Forum 18 that they think the regime may be planning to attack women wearing the hijab in a similar way to attacks on men wearing long beards. They note that regime-controlled TV channels have since September been claiming that women who were the hijab are doing something 'foreign to Uzbek culture and tradition'. Some regime officials have also suggested that 'officials and university and school teachers must carry out explanatory work among women not to wear the hijab', one human rights defender told Forum 18. People the regime rules had wanted to see the 2021 Religion Law end a de facto hijab ban among other changes, but the regimepaid little to no attentionto any suggestions made during its 'consultations' before it adopted the Law. The regime hasin 2022,in 2021, and earlier targeted women wearing the hijab in a variety of ways. This includes adding devout Muslim women to thePreventative Register, which results in a wide range of alleged 'preventative measures'. From August 2018, a government decisionimposed a secular dress code in all educational institutions. This meant a de facto ban on female students covering their heads by wearing a hijab. In 2021, officialswarned parents across Uzbekistan of unspecified consequencesif they teach Islam to their children, or if any of their children wear the hijab. The regime is also in 2024adopting a draft lawto allegedly 'further strengthen the rights of children'. The Law would ban and introduce punishments for parents or guardians who allow their children to receive 'illegal' religious education before the age of 18. The Senate – the upper chamber of the non-freely elected parliament – approved the draft law on 16 August, according to its website. Existing laws target those who teach religion to under-18s, not the parents or guardians targeted by the draft Law. Many of the people the regime rules have expressed strong opposition to the draft Law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO3BLrZUSNRzZ	2024-10-25T16:14:55-07:00	
India’s Strategic Gains At BRICS 2024: Navigating Multipolarity A...	The BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, held in 2024, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of the group, with India emerging as a pivotal player. India’s strategic diplomacy at this summit was a testament to its growing influence in the shifting global order, where emerging economies are vying for a more prominent role in global governance. India deftly balanced its national interests while promoting multilateralism, a feat that underscored its vision of an inclusive and multipolar world. Strategic Positioning in a Changing World Order India has long advocated for a multipolar world, emphasizing the need for reforms in global governance institutions to reflect the realities of the 21st century. At the Kazan summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated the call for reforms in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The idea is not just to seek greater representation for India and other BRICS members, but to create a more equitable system that better addresses the needs of emerging and developing economies. India’s advocacy for global governance reforms also reflects its strategic aspirations. As one of the world’s largest economies, India has increasingly demanded a voice in institutions that shape international financial policies, climate action, and peacekeeping missions. Reforming the UNSC, where India has long sought a permanent seat, remains a key objective. With the support of BRICS members, particularly Russia and South Africa, India has positioned itself as a leader in pushing for these critical changes. India's Exclusion from the UNSC: A Persistent Challenge One critical issue that has continually frustrated India is its exclusion from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a permanent member. Despite being the world’s largest democracy and home to nearly 18% of the global population, India remains absent from the elite decision-making circle of global governance. This exclusion is not only unjustifiable based on India's demographic and economic contributions but also undermines the legitimacy of the UNSC, which continues to reflect the post-World War II balance of power. India’s consistent push for UNSC reforms has not yielded significant results, primarily due to resistance from the current permanent members (P5), particularly China. This continuous marginalization has led India to explore alternative forums like BRICS, which serve as platforms for influencing global policy and reforming the current order. The Kazan summit reiterated India’s stance that emerging powers like itself deserve a more prominent role in international decision-making bodies. For India, BRICS represents more than just a coalition of emerging economies; it is a ray of hope for India and other developing and underrepresented countries. BRICS offers an alternative to Western-dominated institutions like the UNSC, where India’s aspirations have long been sidelined. By championing BRICS as a platform for the Global South, India is positioning itself as a leader advocating for the interests of smaller nations, particularly those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which also suffer from exclusion in global governance. BRICS Expansion and Economic Diplomacy: New Pathways for Cooperation The expansion of BRICS, including six new members Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE was a watershed moment in the bloc’s history. India supported the expansion, seeing it as an opportunity to broaden the group’s economic and geopolitical influence, especially in regions like Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, where India has growing interests. Energy Security and Strategic Partnerships: India’s energy security concerns were central to its diplomatic engagement at the summit. With the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the UAE, BRICS now boasts some of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. This presents India with an opportunity to negotiate better energy deals, ensuring long-term access to affordable energy supplies. Saudi Arabia’s entry, in particular, offers India a chance to deepen its strategic ties with the Gulf nation, which is already a crucial partner in energy and investment. Iran's inclusion is also significant, as it opens doors for greater cooperation on the Chabahar Port project. Chabahar is a critical element in India’s regional strategy, providing access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Strengthening ties with Iran through BRICS could accelerate connectivity projects and trade routes, enhancing India’s presence in Central Asia a region increasingly under Chinese and Russian influence. Expanding Influence in Africa: The addition of Egypt and Ethiopia strengthens India’s foothold in Africa, a continent that has become a focus of global competition. India has been actively engaging with African nations through platforms like the India-Africa Forum Summit, focusing on sectors such as technology, healthcare, and education. Africa’s growing strategic importance, especially in terms of natural resources and market potential, aligns with India’s long-term goals of expanding its trade and investment footprint in the region. Moreover, Egypt’s membership offers India a gateway to North Africa and enhances cooperation in areas like counterterrorism, defense, and infrastructure development. Ethiopia’s inclusion, as the seat of the African Union and a major player in East African geopolitics, further consolidates India’s diplomatic reach in the continent. China-India Relations: Diplomacy Amidst Strategic Competition At the Kazan summit, one of India’s significant diplomatic achievements was the apparent thaw in relations with China. Despite the lingering tensions over the 2020 border clashes, the summit provided an opportunity for dialogue, with Russia playing a mediating role. India recognizes that stability with China is critical, both for regional security and for ensuring the success of broader BRICS initiatives. India’s approach to China within BRICS, however, remains cautious. While it values the economic and trade opportunities within the bloc, it is wary of China’s growing assertiveness, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Through initiatives like the Quad, India continues to build strategic alliances aimed at counterbalancing Chinese influence. Nevertheless, the two nations’ shared interests in BRICS, especially in areas like trade, infrastructure development, and multilateralism, provide a platform for cautious cooperation. Economic Engagement and Trade Partnerships India’s growing economy and its emphasis on technological innovation were central to its contributions at the BRICS summit. India’s tech-driven development agenda aligns well with the group’s goals of increasing intra-BRICS trade and investment. Prime Minister Modi’s call for closer cooperation in areas such as digital infrastructure, green energy, and financial technology was well received, positioning India as a leader in these fields within the bloc. India’s booming tech sector, which has seen rapid growth in areas such as artificial intelligence, fintech, and digital payments, stands to benefit from greater collaboration with BRICS partners. India’s leadership in Unified Payments Interface (UPI) systems and its pioneering role in digital public goods were highlighted at the summit, offering a model for other BRICS nations to emulate. Expanding such cooperation could boost India's trade, especially in digital services, across BRICS economies. The BRICS Currency: A Game-Changer for Global Trade One of the most discussed proposals at the summit was the idea of a BRICS currency to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. For India, this proposal carries significant economic and geopolitical implications: Mitigating Dollar Dependency: India, like other BRICS nations, has long been exposed to the vagaries of U.S. monetary policy, particularly the fluctuations of the dollar. A BRICS currency could offer an alternative for settling trade transactions, thereby reducing the volatility that comes with dollar-based trade. This could be particularly beneficial for India’s oil imports from BRICS nations like Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Geopolitical Leverage: A BRICS currency would also provide India with a tool to bypass Western sanctions on countries like Russia and Iran, ensuring that trade and energy cooperation can continue without being affected by external pressures. Such a development could shield India from economic disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions, allowing it to maintain a steady flow of crucial imports and exports. Strengthening the Rupee’s International Role: India has been pushing for greater internationalization of the rupee, and the introduction of a BRICS currency could complement these efforts. By creating a more diversified global currency landscape, India can position the rupee as a stable currency for trade, especially within the developing world. Counterterrorism Cooperation and Regional Security Counterterrorism has been a priority for India in its BRICS engagements, and the Kazan summit was no exception. India called for enhanced intelligence-sharing and cooperation to combat terrorism, which remains a critical security concern in South Asia. The inclusion of new members from the Middle East and Africa also provides India with new avenues to collaborate on counterterrorism efforts, especially given the cross-border terrorism threats it faces from Pakistan. India’s push for stronger multilateral frameworks within BRICS to tackle terrorism underscores its broader security objectives. BRICS offers a platform for India to address not only regional security issues but also to influence global counterterrorism norms and practices. Conclusion The BRICS 2024 Kazan Summit marked a defining moment for India’s global diplomacy. By advocating for expansion, promoting reforms in global governance, and supporting initiatives like the BRICS currency, India has reinforced its role as a key architect of a more inclusive and multipolar world order. Its diplomatic balancing act navigating complex relationships with China and Russia while maintaining strong ties with the West showcases India’s pragmatic and forward-looking foreign policy. As BRICS continues to evolve, India’s leadership in shaping the group’s direction, especially in areas like economic cooperation, and energy security.

Indonesia’s Interest In Joining BRICS: Pursuing Economic Security...	BRICS, a coalition comprising five major emerging economies—Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa—collectively accounts for approximately 35% of global GDP, serving as a counterbalance to Western dominance within international economic institutions. Indonesia’s aspiration to join BRICS, as articulated by the newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs Sugiono, reflects its desire for enhanced influence in an increasingly multipolar world, while simultaneously addressing domestic objectives concerning food and energy security. This strategic initiative aligns with President Prabowo Subianto’s broader foreign policy vision, which emphasizes maintaining independence from major global blocs and advocating for the interests of the Global South. Indonesia’s interest in BRICS membership encompasses the potential for economic diversification, an augmented geopolitical position, and enhanced regional leadership; however, it also potentially encounters resistance from Western allies, particularly the United States and the European Union. This essay will analyze Indonesia’s motivations for seeking BRICS membership, the anticipated challenges stemming from Western opposition, the country’s internal readiness for such membership, and the strategies Indonesia might adopt to surmount these obstacles. Indonesia’s Strategic Benefits of Joining BRICS The decision to pursue BRICS membership is motivated by several strategic considerations. First, BRICS provides a vital platform for Indonesia to bolster its food and energy security—two pressing concerns that have been exacerbated by disruptions in global supply chains and fluctuations in commodity prices. Given that BRICS cooperation encourages sustainable development, membership would afford Indonesia access to the resources and policy frameworks necessary to safeguard these sectors against future crises. Furthermore, BRICS membership has the potential to significantly enhance investment and trade opportunities by broadening Indonesia’s economic partnerships beyond traditional Western markets. This diversification is critical for mitigating Indonesia’s economic vulnerability to fluctuations in Western markets and sanctions, while simultaneously strengthening its bargaining position on the global stage. Trade with BRICS nations, particularly China and India, could serve as a stable economic buffer, propelling growth in sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and technology. Geopolitically, Indonesia could utilize BRICS as a forum to advocate for the interests of the Global South, thereby amplifying its influence on pressing global issues, including climate change, trade equity, and technology transfer. As a leader among emerging developing nations, Indonesia could leverage BRICS to promote policies that are advantageous to less-developed countries, thereby enhancing its diplomatic stature while simultaneously addressing systemic inequities within international governance structures. Steps for Indonesia to Achieve BRICS Membership Indonesia’s path to membership in BRICS will necessitate a meticulously structured process and the backing of current BRICS members. Initially, Indonesia must submit a formal application accompanied by a comprehensive proposal that evidences its economic compatibility and shared political objectives with BRICS. It is imperative to demonstrate its status as a significant emerging market with a diversified industrial base to persuade existing members of Indonesia’s value to the coalition. To obtain support from current BRICS nations, Indonesia will be required to engage in diplomatic outreach and establish bilateral agreements. Strengthening economic and strategic ties with China and India, prominent members of BRICS would affirm Indonesia’s commitment to the bloc’s core objectives. These partnerships may encompass increased trade agreements, joint development projects, and collaborative research initiatives focused on technology and energy security. Furthermore, Indonesia must address its economic and structural readiness by implementing necessary reforms to meet BRICS standards. This involves enhancing domestic infrastructure, ensuring political stability, and aligning with BRICS Development Bank policies to showcase Indonesia’s capacity to contribute to the goals of BRICS. By adopting regulatory frameworks that align with BRICS’ positions on trade liberalization and financial transparency, Indonesia can enhance its attractiveness as a candidate. Challenges and Negative Reactions from the West Indonesia’s potential membership in BRICS is likely to elicit mixed reactions, particularly from the United States and the European Union. Politically, Western allies may perceive Indonesia’s BRICS membership as a deviation from its longstanding commitment to an independent and active foreign policy, fearing greater Indonesian alignment with China and Russia, two nations that frequently challenge Western hegemony. This shift could strain Indonesia’s defence agreements and security partnerships with the US and EU, potentially leading to a decline in defence support and critical cooperative engagements necessary for maintaining regional stability in Southeast Asia. Economic repercussions are also likely, as the US and EU may impose economic disincentives by gradually scaling back trade preferences to signal their disapproval. Such measures could include revoking favourable trade statuses, implementing tariffs, or restricting foreign direct investment in strategic sectors, especially in areas of direct conflict between BRICS and Western interests. Indonesia may also face limitations in accessing Western-backed developmental or financial aid support programs, as these countries might reallocate resources to nations deemed stronger allies. Internally, Indonesia faces challenges in aligning its economic and structural frameworks with BRICS, as it currently exhibits significant dependence on Western markets. Shifting this dependency necessitates the implementation of a long-term economic strategy that emphasizes industrial diversification, expansion, and investment in technological capabilities. Furthermore, Indonesia must enhance its financial and regulatory institutions to align with BRICS policies, including banking standards and anti-corruption frameworks, to effectively engage in multilateral financial arrangements with BRICS nations. Strategic Solutions for Indonesia To balance its diplomatic relationships while pursuing BRICS membership, Indonesia should reinforce its non-aligned foreign policy stance, clarifying that BRICS membership is intended as an extension of its strategy to diversify partnerships rather than a departure from its Western alliances. Clear communication and public diplomacy may mitigate concerns among Western nations, assuring the U.S. and EU of Indonesia's commitment to regional stability and balanced international relations. Economic reforms will be essential to prepare Indonesia for BRICS membership. The implementation of a gradual economic transition plan focused on diversifying exports and supporting domestic industries can reduce reliance on Western markets while enhancing resilience against economic shocks. Additionally, public-private partnerships within Indonesia can attract investments from BRICS and other non-Western countries, providing an economic buffer should support from the U.S. or EU diminish. Internally, strengthening institutions will be crucial for ensuring Indonesia’s long-term resilience within BRICS. Investment in robust financial institutions, the adoption of regulatory best practices, and the promotion of transparency are necessary for effective engagement within the coalition. Capacity-building initiatives across Indonesian industries will also ensure that the workforce and local businesses are prepared to adapt to shifts in trade dynamics and regional economic trends. Conclusion and Recommendations In conclusion, while Indonesia’s pursuit of BRICS membership represents a strategic initiative to enhance its economic and geopolitical influence, it must address both external and internal challenges to fully capitalize on the potential benefits. Indonesia should maintain a balanced approach, carefully navigating relationships with the U.S. and EU while strengthening cooperation with BRICS. A focus on economic reforms, institutional strengthening, and adherence to an independent foreign policy will enable Indonesia to join BRICS without compromising its long-standing alliances or regional stability. Ultimately, Indonesia’s path to BRICS reflects its vision of fostering a more multipolar world wherein emerging economies wield greater influence, potentially reshaping the global order to better represent the diverse interests of the Global South.

Poverty Is Rising And Inequality Widening In Asia And The Pacific...	The Asia-Pacific region, with over 4.8 billion people spread across 58 countries and territories, is home to about 60 percent of the world’s total population of 8.2 billion. The population of Asia, which include India and China, is expected to continue to grow, reaching 5.3 billion by 2050. However, it is projected to fall in the second half of the century. A new UN report released October 21 predicts that more than 260 million people in the Asia-Pacific region could be pushed into poverty in the next decade unless governments step up with robust social protection schemes. The findings inProtecting our Future Today: Social Protection in Asia and the Pacific reportreveal that poverty, both in monetary and non-monetary forms, is rising while inequalities in income and wealth are widening across the region. The number of people in vulnerable situations in the region is expected to rise, as negative shocks continue to hit amid prevailing inequalities. And access to basic opportunities and services also remains too often a distant goal for many. Most concerning, 45 per cent of people in the region have no social protection coverage at all. Millions of people living just above the national poverty line are vulnerable to shocks. Without stronger social protection systems, 266 million people could be pushed into poverty in 2040 under a worst-case scenario. The report was released at the eighth session of theCommittee on Social Development, which brought together senior government officials, top experts and key stakeholders to explore building inclusive and comprehensive social protection systems that are future proof in view of key megatrends including demographic trends, climate change and digitalization. United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, said megatrends bring both challenges and opportunities. 'However, we need policy action to maximize the benefits of these megatrends while minimizing their costs,' she said. 'When done right, social protection and inclusive policies with a gender—and disability lens can enhance people’s resilience, facilitate adaptation and reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Acting today rather than tomorrow is not only more cost-effective but also crucial for intergenerational solidarity and ensuring that no one is left behind.' In his keynote address, Jomo Kwame Sundaram, Senior Adviser, Khazanah Research Institute, said: 'A whole of government and a whole of society approach is needed at the national level to resolve the socio-economic and environmental challenges countries of our region are facing especially given the limited resources available for social spending.' The ESCAP report provides a blueprint on how governments can improve social protection systems across the region. Leveraging strategic foresight methodology, the report offers policy recommendations to meet changing conditions and argues that the price of inaction today far exceeds the cost of requisite action. 'Recent years have shown us how fragile our progress has been in the region. We have heard how poverty is on the rise for the first time in decades. Unless we build the resilience of our people and planet, we cannot achieve sustained peace and prosperity in the region,' said H Maliki Achmad, Deputy Minister of National Development Planning of Indonesia, who was also elected as Chair of the Committee. 'The recent pledges in the ‘Pact for the Future’made by our fellow nations, underscore our collective resolve, urgency and responsibility to shape a brighter tomorrow for future generations. This is a critical moment for reflection and action. It is time for us, as a region, to assess our progress and determine how we can come together to create a better future,'said Anukul Peedkaew, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Social Development and Human Security of Thailand. The Committee will also review social and economic challenges and opportunities associated with slower population growth and related changes in population age structures, as well as strengthening disability-inclusive development	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO2R71TIEldhh	2024-10-25T15:55:42-07:00	
Redefining Justice: The Impact Of Pakistan’s 26th Constitutional ...	Pakistan's recently passed 26th Constitutional Amendment, also known as the 'Constitutional Package,' represents one of the most comprehensive reforms in the country's judicial history. This set of amendments aims to address transparency, accountability, and the balance of power within the judiciary. By curtailing certain judicial powers and involving Parliament in judicial appointments, this amendment package seeks to enhance democratic oversight and address longstanding criticisms about judicial overreach. However, the amendment has also sparked debate, as it introduces significant shifts in judicial functioning, particularly with regard to the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers and the appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP). One of the amendment's most impactful provisions is the restructuring of the Chief Justice's appointment process. Previously, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court automatically succeeded as CJP, an arrangement designed to ensure neutrality and clear succession. However, the 26th Amendment introduces a new approach: a Special Parliamentary Committee will now recommend the CJP from among the top three senior judges, allowing Parliament to influence this critical role. The committee, composed of eight National Assembly members and four Senate members, is structured to reflect the proportional representation of parliamentary parties, giving the selection process a more democratic veneer. Supporters of this change argue that it ensures the appointment of a leader who is not chosen solely based on seniority but also possesses experience and qualifications that align with the judiciary's current needs. This provision echoes a broader trend seen in other countries where judicial leadership appointments consider qualities beyond tenure. However, critics warn that this change could open the door to political influence over the judiciary’s highest office, potentially undermining its independence. Another pivotal change under the amendment is the Supreme Court’s restricted use of suo motu powers. Previously, the apex court could initiate cases of public interest independently, a power that has been instrumental in addressing pressing issues without the need for formal applications. Under the new law, however, the Supreme Court may only exercise jurisdiction based on specific applications filed before it. This restriction is significant, as it limits the judiciary's ability to address urgent social issues spontaneously. Proponents of this measure argue that it prevents judicial overreach and respects the separation of powers by ensuring that courts do not unilaterally interfere with legislative or executive functions. Critics, however, worry that this change could hinder the court’s ability to address issues that may not be championed by the other branches of government. The amendment also introduces a term limit for the Chief Justice of Pakistan, setting it at three years or until the judge reaches the age of 65, whichever is sooner. This term cap is intended to ensure that the judiciary’s leadership remains dynamic, with frequent changes allowing for fresh perspectives. However, this raises questions about continuity, as the CJP may no longer serve long enough to see through extensive reforms. Furthermore, the 26th Amendment establishes constitutional benches within the Supreme Court, creating a specialized structure that aims to handle constitutional and politically significant cases. By forming these benches, the amendment seeks to reduce the overall backlog of cases and ensure that cases affecting ordinary citizens are resolved more quickly. High-profile cases that could stall other judicial processes are now assigned to designated constitutional benches, allowing the regular judiciary to function more efficiently. Another notable feature is the emphasis on judicial accountability. The amendment requires performance evaluations of high court judges, with unsatisfactory judges given a grace period to improve. If they fail to meet these standards, their cases can be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council, reinforcing accountability within the judiciary. Alongside judicial reforms, the amendment enshrines environmental rights as a constitutional priority. With Article 9A, Pakistan has become one of the few countries to constitutionally guarantee its citizens the right to a clean and healthy environment. This development highlights the state’s commitment to addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change makes this clause particularly relevant, setting a precedent for judicial enforcement of environmental protection. While supporters of the 26th Amendment view it as a positive step towards a more transparent and accountable judiciary, opponents remain concerned about executive overreach. The involvement of Parliament in judicial appointments raises questions about potential political interference, especially when it comes to selecting high-level judicial leaders. Balancing accountability with judicial independence will be key to the amendment's success. In redefining the roles and functions within Pakistan's judiciary, the 26th Amendment reflects a changing landscape. Its emphasis on oversight, accountability, and environmental protection signals the government’s effort to create a more modern and responsive judiciary. However, navigating the fine line between reform and overreach will be crucial to achieving its intended goals.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO_3axTY5jW56	2024-10-25T15:52:08-07:00	
Is China Peeved – Or Pleased – By North Korean Troops In Ukraine?...	By Paul Eckert China remains officially agnostic about North Korea’s deployment of troops to help Russia’s war in Ukraine – a dispatch that analysts say holds potential trouble for Pyongyang’s main backer Beijing even as both communist nations share the goal of supporting Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian repeated the line Beijing has used in the face ofincreasingly definitive and detailed accountsof the dispatch to, and movements within, Russia of Korean People’s Army forces from the North. 'China does not have information on that and our position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We always believe that all parties need to promote the deescalation of the situation and strive for a political settlement,' Lin said at Friday’s daily newsbriefingin Beijing. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate said, adding that the first sightings of North Korean soldiers were recorded on Tuesday. Reports say troops are disguised as ethnic minorities from Siberia. South Korea last weekreleased detailed satellite imagesit said showed the first deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. The United States also said on Wednesday it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. China is usually secretive about foreign policy issues, and especially about ties with North Korea, but there are real concerns in Beijing behind this silence, analysts say. 'Beijing is clearly uncomfortable with the news that North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia to assist Moscow’s war in Ukraine for a number of reasons,' said Patricia Kim, a fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington. Adding to regional troubles For one, Beijing sees a tightening Russia-North Korea alignment as reducing its own influence with those states, and worries that any military assistance Pyongyang gets from Moscow in return for deploying troops might make it more aggressive in Northeast Asia, she told Radio Free Asia Korean. 'China has no interest in the rise of a militarily strengthened and emboldened North Korea that might take greater risks and bring chaos to the region,' Kim said. Also, a bolder Pyongyang would add to the troubles stoked by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, which has been a main source of regional tension for decades. Even before the Ukraine troop deployment, North Korean nuclear saber-rattling and other acts of aggression had been drawing the United States, Japan and South Korea ever closer together in an alliance Beijing has viewed as an Asian NATO aimed at constraining Chinese power. Reports of North Korean troops poised to fight in Ukraine 'continue to confirm the growing connection between transatlantic and Indo-Pacific security,' Sen. Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement Friday. North Korea is China’s only treaty ally, posing the risk of deeper entanglement in the Ukraine conflict, further undercutting Beijing’s already strained attempts to portray itself as a neutral party and a force for peace. 'While China has taken a neutral stance on the surface regarding the war, it is clearly sympathetic to Russia,' said Naoko Aoki of the Rand Corporation think tank. 'But China does not want instability in its own region, which could be heightened as a result of North Korea’s troop deployment.' For its part, 'North Korea has been complaining quite a bit about the Japan-South Korea-United States cooperation, and how that impacts not only North Korea but also Russia and China,' she told RFA Mandarin. Chinese leverage? Aoki says the Ukraine deployment of North Korean troops means Beijing will again face calls to use its leverage on Pyongyang. 'We don’t know how President Xi and the Chinese are looking at this,' said John Kirby, spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council in Washington. 'One would think that if you take their comments at face value about desiring stability and security in the region, particularly on the Korean Peninsula, one would think that they’re also deeply concerned by this development,' he said at the White House on Wednesday. If Beijing moves beyond the current denial phase and becomes worried about North Korean troops fighting in Ukraine, its role as the main economic and diplomatic benefactor of Kim Jong Un’s regime in Pyongyang gives it many tools. 'North Korea still clearly needs China for economic support, which Russia is not in a position to give,' said Aoki. 'If the past is any guide, China’s pressure on North Korea, if it takes place, is likely to be applied quietly and will be difficult to observe from the outside,' she added. The Financial TimesreportedFriday that China has been signaling its unease with closer North Korea-Russia ties, sending senior official Zhao Leji to Pyongyang in April. In June, Kim and Putin agreed to a strategic partnership with a mutual assistance clause. In a letter last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping thanked Kim for a congratulatory message on the 75th anniversary of Communist China’s founding — but dropped the customary reference to North Korea as a 'friendly neighboring country,' the Times reported. Keeping Xi’s hands clean One school of thought, however, holds that Beijing will be happy to sit back and watch North Korea take steps that China supports but is not willing to do on its own. 'In many ways, China benefits from North Korean support for Russia as it reduces the pressure on Beijing to support Moscow with direct military aid while also straining the military capacities of the United States,' said Troy Stangerone of the Wilson Center in Washington. David Maxwell, vice president at the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said China'may be quietly pleased' as North Korea offers a 'convenient cut out' to send lethal aid and now troops to help Putin. 'Xi likely does not want Putin to fail, but he does not want to get his hands dirty by providing lethal aid from China to Russia,' he told RFA Korean. 'Xi can keep his hands clean while KPA troops fight and die for Putin.'

Israel Is Trying To ‘Weaken’ Hezbollah As A Political And Economi...	By Kian Sharifi (RFE/RL) -- Israel's weekslong aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon has targeted the leadership and military capabilities of Hezbollah. Now, Israel has expanded its targets and hit civilian infrastructure, including banks, affiliated with Hezbollah, an armed group and political party that controls much of southern Lebanon. Experts say Israel's aim is to erode Hezbollah not just as a military power but also a political and economic force in Lebanon. Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated a terrorist organization, although the EU has only blacklisted its military wing. 'Beyond the degradation of the military capabilities, personnel, and armaments, there is certainly an Israeli attempt to weaken Hezbollah politically, socially, and financially,' says Eran Etzion, a former Israeli diplomat and ex-deputy head of Israel's National Security Council. On October 21, Israeli air strikes targeted the branches of the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), which is affiliated with Hezbollah. The bank offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support. But Israel and the United States accuse it of serving as a front for the group to fund its military activities. Israel's targeting of the AQAH branches 'marks an expansion in terms of the types of targets that Israel is hitting,' says Etzion. But it does not mean Israel is attempting to completely dismantle Hezbollah, he adds. Experts say destroying Hezbollah is not Israel's objective, not least because that is an unrealistic goal. Instead, they said, Israel is trying to degrade its military capabilities and political base. 'Hezbollah is the predominant political power in Lebanon, and if it is militarily significantly weakened, that would also reduce its political power,' says Joost Hiltermann, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Belgium-based International Crisis Group. Under Lebanon's sectarian political system, the president is a Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament is a Shi'ite Muslim. Hezbollah, whose power base is among Shi'a, has representatives at the ministerial and parliamentary levels. Its alliance with non-Shi'ite parties also gives it further political clout. Hiltermann questioned whether Israel had the ability to effect political change in Lebanon. Iran-backed Hezbollah is more powerful than even the Lebanese Army, and smaller political factions in Lebanon do not have the military force or political clout to push it out completely, he said. After invading Lebanon in 1982, Israel attempted and failed to reshape Lebanon's political scene by bringing a pro-Israeli Christian party to power. 'There is a recognition that Israel's abilities in that particular sphere are limited,' says Etzion. For Netanyahu, It's Personal Observers say Israel's civilian and military leaders are split over how to approach the ongoing conflict with Hezbollah. One camp wants to wind down the war and secure a political settlement based on UN Security Council Resolution 1701. That would include Hezbollah fighters retreating from near the Israeli border and UN peacekeeping forces ensuring security along the border. The other camp, which includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is looking to expand the conflict into a 'full-fledged regional war' involving both Iran and the United States, Etzion says. Israel has vowed to strike Iran in retaliation for Tehran's massivemissile attackon October 1. Manyworrythat an Israeli attack will result in an escalating cycle of tit-for-tat strikes that will spiral into a warengulfingthe entire region. Netanyahu's primary goal 'is to sustain his grip on power and to make sure he's not ousted,' Etzion says. 'He has a clear political, personal, and criminal interest in perpetuating the war.' Netanyahu's critics blame him for the security lapses that resulted in the October 7 attack by U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Netanyahu is also facing serious corruption charges, and his detractors say the prime minister is trying to indefinitely postpone his own trial.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCOyiSojihFiHN	2024-10-25T15:45:13-07:00	
Will Specter Of War In Ukraine Overshadow Xi And Putin’s Push For...	By Katherine Michaelson The 2024 BRICS summit in Russia this week provided Moscow and Beijing with a showcase for their shared anti-West sentiment and global ambitions, but analysts say the war in Ukraine may be fracturing the 'no limits' relationship between the two countries. The location of the summit was strategically significant, given international efforts to isolate Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. 'For Russia as the host, the most important thing is to highlight that it is not isolated and still has supporters on the international stage.' said Shiau-shyang Liou, associate research fellow at the Taiwan-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. 'China is actually facing a similar predicament — it is being sanctioned by the United States, though it has not yet reached the point of military conflict. Therefore, on these issues, they share common interests and align in their direction,' Liou added. Readouts of the summit reflected the shared ambitions of China and Russia within BRICS, a grouping of 10 countries that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa but now is expanding. New members include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Ethiopia. At the summit, Beijing and Moscow both articulated plans for economic systems separate from Western-led institutions; praised the success of BRICS countries in various development initiatives; and advanced plans to lead the network of states toward a more interconnected future. In his speech at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin promoted the creation of various mechanisms that would bypass traditional, Western-led systems that make his country vulnerable to Western economic sanctions. 'We believe that launching a special mechanism for consultations between BRICS countries on issues related to the World Trade Organisation will help us chart a common position on formulating more equitable rules of the game in the global economy and overhauling the international financial system,' according to atranscript of his speechreleased by the Kremlin. Chinese leader Xi Jinping echoed Putin’s remarks, saying the BRICS countries 'should play a leading role in the reform.' 'We must ensure that the international financial system more effectively reflects the changes in the global economic landscape,' Xi said. He also said BRICS member countries need to jointly work toward building BRICS 'into a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations and a vanguard for advancing global governance reform.' China’s and Russia’s ability to deliver meaningful results on the commitments they have made is likely to face challenges, said Ali Wyne, senior researcher at the International Crisis Group. 'The BRICS grouping is unlikely to achieve geopolitical coherence. China's relations with India are strained, as are Iran's with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, most member countries see participation in the BRICS as a means of expanding their freedom of foreign policy maneuver, not of positioning themselves against the West,' Wyne said. The shared ambitions of Beijing and Moscow may also be overshadowed by larger geopolitical priorities, the most notable being the war in Ukraine, analysts said. At the summit, China doubled down on its commitment to seeking a resolution of the war. Xi promoted the 'Friends of Peace' initiative, a collaborative effort led by China and Brazil to pursue a negotiated end to the conflict. U.S. and South Korean intelligence revealed the presence of an estimated 3,000 North Korean troops training in Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military intelligence service on Thursday put the number of North Koreans already in Russia at 12,000. The Kremlin at first dismissed reports of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Putin did not deny North Korean troops were in Russia. That deepening wartime collaboration between China’s two neighbors puts pressure on China and runs counter to its peacemaking ambitions. 'North Korea feels increasingly comfortable defying China's wishes, not only by increasing its nuclear and missile provocations in the Indo-Pacific, but also by fueling an armed conflict in a different theater at a time when Beijing seeks to portray itself as a potential peacemaker,' Wyne said. In June, Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense treaty to strengthen military ties. North Korea also shares a similar treaty with China and is the only country to have entered a formalized agreement of this type with Beijing. 'China's challenge would be whether to fulfill its commitment to protect North Korea and potentially engage in a conflict with Ukraine. If North Korea were to enter the war, it would bring significant uncertainty to China-North Korea relations,' said Shanghai-based international relations scholar Dingli Shen. 'China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope that all parties will work for de-escalation and be committed to political settlement,' said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington in a statement to VOA. Chuang Chih-wei from VOA’s Mandarin Service contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO6vOC380oLRX	2024-10-25T15:42:06-07:00	
Malaysia: Govt Denies Allegations Najib Would Gain From House Arr...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia’s government denied Friday it was trying to ensure an early release for imprisoned ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak through a bill that would allow house arrest, saying it was intended to reduce prison overcrowding and punitive justice. Najib’s first public apology a day earlier for the 1MDB fund-looting scandal fueled further talk on social media that the proposed legislation was meant to benefit the former PM, who is implicated in the case. He currently has a little under four years left on his prison sentence. At a post-cabinet press conference, government spokesman Fahmi Fadzil was asked whether the bill, which is to be presented in parliament next year, was to enable Najib to serve out the remainder of his term from the comfort of his home. 'That’s incorrect. … It reflects a shift in the government’s approach from punitive to restorative justice, aiming to reintegrate individuals found guilty back into the community,' Fahmi told reporters. 'The government’s aim includes addressing prison overcrowding… [Our prisons are] designed for 74,000 inmates, but last year, we had 87,000.' Malaysia lacks legal provisions for home detention, unlike the U.S. and Australia, legal expert Salim Bashir told BenarNews. 'House arrest confines individuals at home for their sentence or remaining prison term,' said Salim, a former Bar Council of Malaysia president. 'While Malaysia’s Section 43 of the Prison Act 1952 allows certain prisoners to work and reside outside prison with approval, it’s not equivalent to house arrest.' Najib is serving time for corruption and money laundering tied to nearly U.S. $10 million from SRC International, a subsidiary of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund. Najib’s sentence is scheduled to end Aug. 23, 2028. In July, he sought a court order to enforce a document he claims was signed by the former king, allowing him to serve his sentence under house arrest, but a high court rejected his application. Najib argued that then-King Sultan Abdullah approved the order after giving him a partial royal pardonin Februarythat halved his original 12-year sentence. Najib challenged the denial of the alleged royal decree. The Court of Appeal has set Dec. 5 to hear the appeal, local media reported. Apology Many were taken aback Thursday when Najib’s eldest son, Mohamad Nizar, read out a letter by the incarcerated ex-PM that said he was 'deeply hurt' and 'in deep shock' that the 1MDB scandal occurred while he was in power. 'It pains me every day to know that the 1MDB debacle happened under my watch as minister of finance and prime minister. For that, I would like to apologize unreservedly to the Malaysian people,' Nizar read out from the letter outside the Kuala Lumpur High Court. In a separate case, a court will rule on Oct. 30 whether Najib must defend himself or be acquitted of charges tied to 1MDB, including four counts of abuse of power and 21 money laundering charges, involving 2.3 billion ringgit (U.S. $528.7 million) from the sovereign fund. When reporters asked him about the apology on Friday, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim responded: 'I received it well.' ‘Timing of the bill’ The house detention bill first came to light on Oct. 18 after Anwar presented the budget. Theofficial written versionof Anwar’s budget speech to parliament included a sentence about the government planning a law to allow some prisoners to serve time at home. The home minister, the next day, said the bill would be introduced in 2025. People on social media wondered why Anwar did not read out that part of his written speech in parliament, although it’s not uncommon for ministers to not read out every word of the budget.Political analyst Tunku Mohar Mokhtar said that 'the timing of the bill somehow gives rise to speculation that one of its reasons is to help secure Najib’s release.' '⁠We can’t read the intention behind the proposed bill, although at the same time, we can’t also rule out that this could be designed as a soft landing for Najib,' the analyst at the International Islamic University Malaysia told BenarNews. 'The timing of the bill somehow gives rise to speculation that one of its reasons is to help secure Najib’s release.' In addition to Najib’s July attempt to serve out his prison sentence at home, another recent event Tunku Mohar was referring to was the August general assembly of the UMNO party, a key ally of Prime Minister Anwar’s Pakatan Harapan coalition. During that meeting attended by more than 6,000 members, Najib’s release was the top demand, The Star, a local news website, reported. The prospect that Najib may be released from prison earlier has become a conversation topic in Malaysian politics ever since UMNO decided to back its long-time rival, Pakatan, in November 2022 to break the impasse of ahung parliament. Such speculation only intensified after a courtin September 2023dropped 47 graft charges against Deputy Prime Minister and UMNO leader Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, in a case linked to the alleged misuse of millions of dollars at a charity he founded to fight poverty. Anwar in ‘hard position’ Analysts say the government’s proposed house arrest law could be a compromise solution by Anwar to appease UMNO without fully freeing Najib from his sentence. 'Anwar is in a hard position having to balance the commitment to reform championed by his supporters and the push from certain quarters within UMNO to have Najib released, both matters that are critical to maintaining the balance and stability of his coalition,' Ahmad Mohsein Azman, an analyst at BowerGroupAsia, a political risk consultancy, told BenarNews. 'House arrest may conveniently be the right amount of compromise to manage expectations on both sides without having to absolve Najib from doing his time.' BenarNews reached out to several leaders of Pakatan and UMNO, but many declined to comment or did not respond to messages.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO1oV03NReYwm	2024-10-25T15:39:53-07:00	
Health Workers, Journalists Bear Brunt Of Israeli Strikes In Leba...	By Najia Houssari Lebanon accused Israel of targeting journalists in a 'deliberate' attack that killed three people in the country’s south on Friday, calling the incident a 'war crime.' Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the strike 'targeting journalists' was 'a war crime committed by Israel without any deterrent or international voice to halt the ongoing atrocities.' He added that the 'deliberate aggression aims to intimidate the media and obscure the crimes and destruction being perpetrated.' Mikati said he had directed the Foreign Ministry 'to include this latest crime in a series of documented files of Israeli crimes to be submitted to relevant international authorities, with the hope that global conscience will intervene to stop the ongoing violence.' Al-Mayadeen TV channel confirmed the deaths of broadcast technician Mohammed Rida and camera operator Ghassan Najjar, while Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV mourned the death of camera operator Wissam Qassim in the Israeli strike on a hotel in Hasbayya. Several other people including media personalities Zakaria Fadel, Hussein Hoteit, and Ali Chaib were injured in the blast. Survivors appeared on their respective TV channels covered in dirt in the aftermath, stressing that they did not have any weapons and that there 'weren’t any armed people' at the hotel. They added that they only had 'their cameras and microphones and that their movement was clear to everyone,' according to Al-Jadeed correspondent Mohamed Farhat and Al-Mayadeen reporter Fatima Ftouni, who showed her shrapnel-torn protective shield. The number of journalists, technicians, and photographers caught by Israeli hostilities since Oct. 8, 2023, has risen to 13. Lebanon’s Health Minister Firas Abiad said Israeli strikes killed more than 160 rescuers and health workers in the past year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. At a press conference on Friday, Abiad said 55 attacks on hospitals had been recorded, including 36 direct hits. Eight hospitals were forcibly closed down, while seven are partially operating. The attacks resulted in 'the martyrdom of 12 health workers, the injury of 60 people and the damage of 24 vehicles,' Abiad said. According to the minister, the latest Israeli attacks targeted '201 emergency response teams, bringing the total of casualties in the health and hospital sector to 163 martyred and 272 injured.' He said 51 emergency response centers, 158 ambulances, 57 fire trucks, and 15 rescue vehicles have been targeted. 'Two weeks ago, eight paramedics were martyred in the triangle of Odaisseh-Taybeh-Rab El-Thalathine. Their bodies are still in three ambulances due to the enemy’s refusal to allow the retrieval of their bodies. In addition, six firefighters are still under the rubble in Baraachit,' Abiad said. The Israeli military has targeted health workers, claiming that Hezbollah 'uses ambulances to transport members and weapons.' Avichay Adraee, spokesperson for the Israeli military, warned on Friday that troops could target medical personnel carrying out their duty of helping the injured in southern Lebanon. Adraee called on medical personnel to 'avoid engaging with Hezbollah members and cooperating with them. Otherwise, necessary action will be taken against any vehicle transporting armed people regardless of its type.' Adraee’s warning came as the UN Interim Force in Lebanon said that its peacekeepers withdrew from a watchtower in one of its posts near Dhayra in south Lebanon on Tuesday, after Israeli forces fired at it. UNIFIL senior leadership announced in a statement on Friday that 'peacekeepers on duty at a permanent observation post near Dhayra were observing Israeli soldiers conducting house clearing operations nearby.' The statement added: 'Upon realizing they were being observed, the soldiers fired at the post.' UNIFIL clarified that the duty guards 'withdrew following the incident to avoid being shot.' It also pointed out that the Israeli military had 'repeatedly demanded that UNIFIL vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged camera, lighting, and communications equipment at some of these positions.' UNIFIL added: 'Despite the pressure exerted on the mission and our troop-contributing countries, peacekeepers remain in position and on task. 'We remind the Israeli army and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property. Any deliberate attack on them is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Resolution 1701.' These developments were preceded and followed by Israeli raids on the southern suburbs of Beirut and towns in the south, in addition to the shelling of a second border crossing between Lebanon and Syria in the Qaa region in the Bekaa. The Masnaa border crossing was targeted once again, which limited the movement of cars and trucks between Lebanon and Syria to one crossing in northern Lebanon after the raids blocked traffic on the Masnaa crossing. People could only cross the border on foot and under the surveillance of Israeli reconnaissance aircraft. Hezbollah, meanwhile, launched a series of military operations targeting northern Israel. Israeli media reported that 'a state of emergency was declared in Nahariya Hospital due to a security event in Shomera in Western Galilee.' The party said it hit 'a gathering of soldiers who were sheltering inside a place considered to be safe. Additionally, a truck and several vehicles were hit by rockets launched from Lebanon.' Israeli media reported that 'four wounded people were in critical condition, in addition to other injuries of varying degrees, as a result of rockets fired by Hezbollah on the Shomera area.' Fires were still raging in the morning after Israeli airstrikes on Thursday night in El-Aamroussieh, Haret Hrek, and the Sainte Therese area, reaching Burj Al-Barajneh in Beirut’s southern suburbs. In the south, the Israeli military used phosphorous bombs to burn forests and olive groves in the border areas in the western sector. An airstrike on a house in the town of Bazourieh killed three people, whilst clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued in the towns of Aitaroun, Taybeh, and Marwahin. Hezbollah said that it targeted Israeli military sites in the settlements of Al-Malikiyah and Al-Baghdadi. Relief efforts between Lebanon and international partners continued as a UAE ship docked at Beirut Port, delivering 2,000 tons of aid. This shipment, provided by the UAE, includes food supplies and essential equipment for shelter centers, offering critical support to the people of Lebanon. The Army Command announced the arrival of a donation from the Malta-Lebanon Organization to the Lebanese Army. A UNHCR spokeswoman estimated that around one-fifth of the Lebanese population has been displaced from their homes so far. She said the government-run displacement centers in Lebanon had become overcrowded, and that the number of people fleeing from Lebanon to Syria had reached 430,000. The Crisis and Disaster Management Room in the Beirut Governorate — in collaboration with the Farah Al-Ataa Association, a civil society organization, successfully relocated displaced people from tents along the Beirut waterfront to a shelter center in the Karantina area. In the initial phase, more than 400 displaced people were transferred, with the second phase set to be completed in the coming days.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe05rN-WDpCO3iqiiu3Ckk3	2024-10-25T15:37:22-07:00	
Increasing Sign-Up Bonuses For Russian Soldiers Signal Falling Su...	Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of a partial mobilization in September 2022 backfired and sparked widespread anger, causing the emigration of more than a million young and educated people the Russian Federation could not afford to lose (see EDM, September 22, 2022, June 26, 2023). The Kremlin leader has since tried a variety of alternative tactics to fill the constantly depleting ranks of his invasion force in Ukraine. These have ranged from releasing convicts from prisons if they agree to serve in the army, to using immigrants or foreigners as soldiers, to raising the age limits on those subject to the draft or allowed to serve in the military (see EDM, October 31, 2023;Doxa, January 15; Verstka, October 9). By far, the most successful of these new approaches has been the increase in the number of signing bonuses for 'contract service' in the military (the Russian term for volunteers). The bonus system that has emerged over the last two years is run by the central government, which continues to announce large and ever-increasing sign-on payments and directs federal workers to continue increasing them. Russia’s wealthier regions now offer even more money in bonuses than the central government, often becoming the primary locations where poorer people sign up for contract service. Meanwhile, the poorer regions and republics are asking Moscow for additional assistance to boost their recruitment numbers. In the absence of federal assistance, these regions are forced to use coercion or offer bounties to relatives and acquaintances of men who bring such people to recruitment offices (Sibreal.org, April 27; Idelreal.org, July 14; see EDM, August 7). This is further dividing the Russian Federation between the urban haves and the rural have-nots, leading Russian political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov to suggest that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has become Russia’s last 'peasant war,' one fought not by the urban majority but by the country’s relatively small rural population, a group that disproportionately includes the non-Russian minorities (see EDM, October 4, 2022, April 4, July 16; Echofm.online, March 4, 2023). In recent months, the bonuses offered by Moscow and regional governments have reached an average of more than five million rubles ($50,000)—potentially more, depending on the region. This amounts to vastly more than most civilians in the Russian Federation can expect to earn over many years (T.me/svobodnieslova, September 4). The size of such payments has prompted some to suggest that, in rural Russia at least, most people have 'never had it so good,' and that people there have become and will remain loyal to Putin (Sibreal.org, September 17, 2023;Russia.post, September 19, 2023). This demonstrates how the bonus initiative is a success for Putin, who is more interested in having mercenaries than he is in having ideologically committed patriots who might begin asking the wrong questions (Window on Eurasia, March 6, 2023). Consequently, Vladislav Inozemtsev, the director of the Center of Research of Post-Industrial Society, speculates that the system is likely to remain in place well into 2025 because the population likes it and the Kremlin can afford it (Riddle, April 11). The rise in bonus payments reflects attitudes and trends in the Russian population that can hardly make the Kremlin happy. The fact that Moscow has to pay bonuses at all, and even more that they are compelled to raise these rates constantly, is a clear sign that there is decreasing enthusiasm for the war, however much polls suggest otherwise. The Kremlin’s need to continue raising bonus payments proves the lack of public support for Putin’s war. If support among the public was high, Russian men would be signing up out of patriotic enthusiasm, not for money (T.me/anatoly_nesmiyan, August 31, reposted at Charter97, August 31). Any real enthusiasm for the war has dissipated (if there ever was any at all), prompting Moscow to launch this unprecedented policy. Regardless of how happy Russians who do take the money may be, they and their countrymen can easily see that such payments reveal that the Kremlin’s situation has shifted. This has been exacerbated by the two groups of Russians most directly affected by the bonus system (Sibreal.org, October 17). The first, those who signed up earlier when bonuses were less, are currently suffering buyer’s remorse and are angry that they did not wait to get the larger payments. The second group, who may be considering signing up and getting the larger bonuses, is deciding to wait until the payments become even larger. Both are talking about their situations publicly, and that alone makes the bonus system increasingly counterproductive from the Kremlin’s point of view, possibly making it unsustainable far sooner than many now suggest. If that proves to be the case, then Putin will soon face a Hobson’s choice between carrying out a real mobilization and applying ever more repression. Doing so could possibly involve closing the borders to prevent Russians from fleeing, an action that could trigger his downfall. The other option is to change his approach in Ukraine altogether so that the Russian military’s need for soldiers would ease or even cease (The Moscow Times, August 21). As striking as the consequences of the bonus system are for the Russian military and the future of Putin’s war, his decision to offer them at all and then to regularly increase the size of the bonus may prove even more significant for the future of his political regime. Not only is the necessary boosting of such payments a real measure of declining Russian support for his war in Ukraine, but this trend shows to the Russian population that Putin is now ready to use cash and not just force to respond to resistance—something that makes opposition to his policies less risky. That will almost certainly encourage resistance to other parts of Putin’s political program, which, in turn, could form the roots of new and more serious challenges to the Putin regime (NG.ru, September 26).

Germany’s New Focus On India – Analysis	By Tobias Scholz Just one week ahead of the annual intergovernmental consultations, the German government published its first strategic document solely focused on its engagement with India. Although not officially labelled a strategy, the paper’s cabinet-level-involvement and clear prioritisation of policy domains make 'Focus on India' a comprehensive manual outlining Germany’s planned approach towards India. In laying out Germany’s ideas about the imagined future of Indo-German foreign, security, and trade relations, the public document has both a domestic and an external function. Domestically, the key role of 'Focus on India' is to bring all government departments on the same page. Externally, it sends a strong message of assurance to India, signalling the high standing India currently enjoys among political decision-makers in Germany. The 'new focus': A result of geopolitical threats While trade, migration, and technology cooperation have undoubtedly become more significant for German-Indian relations, security concerns have recently introduced a strategic depth into the partnership. For the past few years, both partners have been geopolitically threatened by revisionist powers. The Galwan skirmishes with China in 2020 made India rethink its China policy. For Germany, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 challenged the 'Wandel durch Handel' (change through trade) approach towards Russia. Furthermore, subsequent attempts to condemn Russia’s behaviour at the United Nations (UN) illustrated to Germany how strong and long-standing New Delhi’s partnership with Moscow has been in the past. Neighbourhood challenges were central for both Germany and India to find new interest in each other as they sought to identify new partners as well as diversify their external dependencies. India’s behaviour towards Russia posed a dilemma for Germany’s foreign policy. On the one hand, the German government realised that India was not a geopolitical ally when it came to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. On the other hand, Germany viewed India as a key strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific and an important representative of the Global South. In other words, Germany had to consider how to deal with a partner that also partners with its geopolitical rival. India’s multi-aligned preferences have, in particular, been at odds with Germany’s established strategic practice, which centres on treaty-based alliance cooperation. The first-ever public strategic document by Germany to describe foreign policy priorities towards India can be read as a recognition of India’s relevance in balancing China, as well as the complexities of dealing with a strategically autonomous India. Strategic depth through security cooperation 'Focus on India' fulfils two functions: firstly, it offers a comprehensive inventory of the existing partnership, covering policy domains as diverse as judicial, civil society, and sub-national cooperation. Secondly, and perhaps more relevant for the upcoming government consultations, the Federal Foreign Office-led approach aims to advance new partnership propositions. Three sets of suggestions stand out: the upsizing of government consultations, the willingness to become a major security partner, and a more strategic view on climate and energy cooperation. If the suggestions from the federal government in Berlin are enacted, the bilateral relations could soon become far more comprehensive. A key proposition is introducing the Indo-German dialogue forum to enrich the bi-annual government consultations with more input and feedback. While the dialogue forum is proposed to become the overarching discussion platform, 'Focus on India' emphasises the need to expand on former or existing dialogues across several issues, ranging from cybersecurity to climate policy. What is not mentioned, however, is the required structure to manage the multitude of dialogues. The most feasible path appears to be that all sectoral dialogue formats are forth on held as sub-tracks of the overarching dialogue forum. At least some coordination between the dialogue forum and the policy tracks will be needed to ensure efficiency and coherence. The strategic document’s most significant policy announcements relate to bilateral security relations. Most far-reaching, the German Federal Government seeks to establish an agreement on reciprocal logistical support between the German and Indian armed forces. The proposition ties into Germany’s interest in strengthening India’s defensive capacities in the Indo-Pacific and reducing its military dependence on Russia. Germany’s interest to second a Bundeswehr liaison officer to the Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region in New Delhi underlines the growing interest in understanding India’s concerns in the Indo-Pacific. These efforts build on Germany’s broader Indo-Pacific approachpublishedin 2020 and its commissioning of a frigate into the region in 2021. The document’s commitment to ease arms export control procedures, however, raises more questions than it answers. While the announcement aligns with the prevailing tonality of 'Focus on India', the types of arms are not specified, which could fuel domestic debates in Germany about the scope of its new arms export policy to India. A narrower focus on arms cooperation to advance each other’s defensive capabilities may be more realistic. A final novelty of 'Focus on India' is the strategic depth which it provides to the partnership by drawing connections between interests in different policy areas. The most remarkable example is the direct linkage of climate cooperation and energy security. Publicly linking these two goals indicates that the rationale of Germany’s development partnership with India could become far more geo-economically aware. The proposed dialogue platform would be an ideal venue to explore further synergies between policy domains. Beyond good vibes 'Focus on India' combines an interests-based approach with a good amount of pragmatism. In areas where cooperation is already increasing, like in security, climate, and technology policy, the German government makes pertinent new suggestions. However, in areas where the partnership previously faced challenges, like in multilateral cooperation or the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, the strategic document does not pitch completely new ideas. Essentially, 'Focus on India' addresses the bilateral partnership by reinforcing those policy domains where Germany already sees progress and opportunities. The advantage of such an approach is that the strategic document can certainly prove a useful conversation starter for the seventh governmental consultation this week. For the strategic partnership to mature more progressively and withstand pressure, however, frank discussions on the areas of discern remain paramount. This includes a clear idea of each other’s red lines as well as an understanding of the involved risks for the partnership. It is therefore important that the suggested Indo-German dialogue forum, if implemented, becomes a multistakeholder platform in which candid conversations about progress as much as challenges are invited to take place. Equally important, Germany’s approach can benefit from and learn from the experiences of EU-India relations, which remain pivotal in shaping trade relations between the two powers.

Malaysia’s New Citizenship Law Maintains Regressive Measures – An...	By Bridget Welsh Last week Malaysia passed a new Constitutional amendment correcting a gender discriminatory measure that denied citizenship to children born to Malaysian mothers overseas. Malaysian fathers whose children were born abroad always had that right, which had been denied to mothers. Now children born overseas to both Malaysian women and men can become citizens. The legislation was portrayed as a reason to celebrate. Indeed, for mothers, it corrects a long-standing injustice. The other amendments and details of the legislation, however, suggest the opposite. Anwar Ibrahim’s government packed the legislation with measures that increase statelessness, extend gender discrimination, and harm children, especially from minority and vulnerable communities. The associated amendments to the Constitution are among the most regressive in Malaysian history, curtailing the ability to address the serious problem of more than 1 million undocumented persons in the country, including over 100,000 undocumented children born in Malaysia. Rather than give citizenship to more people, the new legislation takes it away from individuals. First of all, the provisions related to mothers whose children are born overseas, do not apply retroactively. This leaves the thousands of children born to Malaysian mothers overseas before the bill’s passage without legal protections to acquire Malaysian citizenship. Activists advocating for equality of citizenship laws highlighted the anguish of families divided by the inability to live as a unit and the discrimination faced by siblings born overseas who are denied the same rights and access to public education, health care and other services. Children born overseas to Malaysian mothers have also faced psychological harm, been branded as unworthy and excluded in the country’s society. These families and children will continue to suffer. Regressive measures One of the newamendments also target women, bringing back gender discrimination. The government can now revoke the citizenship of foreign spouses of Malaysian men if their marriage ends within two years of their citizenship application, rather than within two years of the marriage itself. The measure expands the power of the Malaysian government to control the citizenship status of foreign wives. This leaves women in abusive marriages and children from the marriage highly vulnerable. Women in Malaysia in abusive marriages have disproportionately received little support from Malaysian authorities. The case of M. Indira Gandhi whose daughter was abducted by her ex-husband in 2009 is illustrative. Authorities failed to issue an arrest warrant on the father to return their daughter to the mother’s custody despite multiple court orders, including a landmark decision by the Federal Court in 2018. A civil suit against the police claiming they were acting in bad faith by supporting the husband was dismissed last July. She has not seen her daughter for over fifteen years. There are concerns that the new citizenship amendments give additional leverage to abusive men to hold over their spouses. To make matters worse, the amendments make it more difficult for children to apply for citizenship by reducing the age limit for applying, to 18 years old from 21. Given that applications take on average five years for review, this limits the ability of children to address issues in the review process. Clearly, one of the aims of the legislation was to reduce pathways to citizenship, and in fact, to make them harder. This most devastating measure involves the denial of citizenship for foundlings, orphans and children of permanent residents born in Malaysia. This change will particularly impact children of the indigenous Orang Asli communities, whose lack of proper citizenship documentation reflects endemic neglect of this community. Other minorities, such as the Indians and the ethnic communities in Borneo, face similar exclusion. The bill’s anti-minority overtones have created considerable disquiet. Growing statelessness problem Worryingly, these amendments add to the already serious problem of statelessness, and make solutions to it more difficult. The primary reason these measures denying citizenship for foundlings and permanent residents’ children were included in the legislation stems from 40 years of mismanagement of migration in the state of Sabah. From the 1980s, migrants were brought in to marginalize the political influence of local ethnic minorities and to strengthen the political position of the federal government under what was called Project IC, one of the darkest projects of the tenure of the former Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Not only did Project IC change the demography of Sabah, it also left a horrible legacy. Now, over an estimated 1 million people, including around 100,000 children, without proper documentation live in desolate poverty, and are denied public education and health care. They are subject to greater labour exploitation and abuse than most others as they try to eke out a precarious living. And with multiple generations condemned to repeat this cycle, they have been condemned to a life of criminality and marginality. At the same time, undocumented persons are deeply resented by indigenous communities that have been politically displaced. They are also demonised as they are perceived as adding to Sabah’s border security problems. This issue remains emotive among Sabahans. The legislation’s inclusion of amendments that target children was part of a compromise to ensure the support of enough politicians so the law could pass. Tragically, the legislation targets and perpetuates statelessness for future generations. Rather than work to undo the dark legacy of Mahathir’s Project IC in Sabah, Malaysia’s new citizenship legislation makes problems worse. Beyond adding to the numbers of undocumented persons, targeting children creates another excluded generation that will tear at the fabric of Sabah society and be detrimental to the goal of sustainable development. When civil society began to push for changes in the citizenship law, the aim was to expand citizenship, especially for children and families. Malaysia’s regressive new measures do not do this. Many in Malaysian civil society are devastated by how the legislation was hijacked to curtail rights. The bill was an opportunity to correct injustices. Instead, Anwar Ibrahim’s government has widened them.

Vietnam’s Cross-Border Trade Regulation Adjustments Impact China’...	By He Yan At the invitation of Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính, Chinese Premier Li Qiang made an official visit to Vietnam from October 12 to 14. In a joint statement released by the two countries on the 14th, they emphasized the importance of leveraging the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA), utilizing platforms like e-commerce and exhibitions, enhancing customs cooperation, and expanding the export of each country's competitive products to the other. The Vietnamese government recently issued Decree No. 122 concerning small-scale exports to China to promote long-term sustainable trade development between the two countries. According to this decree, Vietnam will officially cease unofficial-quota exports to China on January 1, 2030, and all import and export activities must be conducted through international ports or major bilateral ports. Additionally, it supplements and revises several provisions regarding trade standards and payment methods, aiming to improve the standardization of border trade between Vietnam and China. It is reported that this resolution will take effect on December 1, 2024. The Vietnamese government has previously promoted trade with China through cross-border small-scale trade. Such unofficial quota exports refer to a trade method where residents or businesses in border areas conduct small-scale trade by exporting goods in limited quantities to neighboring markets. Over the years, Vietnam's small-scale quota exports to China have been very active, with products mainly including durians, bird's nests, sweet potatoes, dragon fruits, longans, passion fruits, and other agricultural products, as well as shrimps, crabs, salmons, squids, pollocks, cod, and hawthorn fish. However, with the expansion of trade scale and increasing congestion at border ports, the Vietnamese government has begun to gradually tighten relevant policies. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam stated that tightening small-scale goods exports aims to bring daily commodity exchanges and sales activities among border residents back on track. This ensures that exports to China comply with international practices, meet quality requirements, and can be traced back to their origin, thereby avoiding the congestion of agricultural products at border ports as seen in the past. In the short term, the implementation of Vietnam's Decree No. 122 will have a significant impact on the current trade pattern between the two countries, placing adjustment pressures on businesses and individuals that rely on cross-border small-scale trade, as well as on border cities. According to surveys, Vietnam's regulations on cross-border goods transactions are relatively lenient, especially regarding exports. Therefore, individual traders who do not have business registration can engage in cross-border export activities as long as they reside in border areas, provided they do not involve prohibited export goods. These traders are allowed to create their own lists of goods, which serve as substitutes for contracts, eliminating the need to submit formal export documents such as sales contracts or invoices to customs. The payment methods also demonstrate considerable flexibility, including various forms such as bank transfers, cash transactions, and bartering. As a result, even though certain Vietnamese agricultural products, for instance, various fruits and pork, have not yet received formal import permits from China, these products can still be sold in the Chinese market through small-scale trade quotas among border residents. Moreover, many traders are leveraging the small-scale quota export method to conduct large-scale trade activities. They do this by establishing lists of regular border residents and pooling their duty-free allowances to import large quantities of goods. Even for products that have already received formal export permits to China (such as cassava products and lychees), there is a tendency to export them through small-scale quotas. For example, Vietnam exports over 3 million tons of cassava starch to China each year, with 60% of that amount exported via small-scale quotas. Although small-scale quota exports account for only a small portion of Vietnam's official total exports to China, they have become an important channel for products that have not yet received formal export permits to China or that do not meet export requirements. Currently, the new regulations mandate that border residents must be physically present to complete the goods handover procedures, which will undoubtedly increase their participation costs and time expenses. For those accustomed to convenient and flexible trading, this requirement may diminish their enthusiasm for participating in mutual trade, thereby affecting the activity levels of border trade. Border trade not only provides an economic source for residents in border areas but also promotes commercial exchanges and local economic development between Vietnam and China. If the scale of border trade shrinks, the local business environment and residents' income could suffer negative impacts. Clearly, the mutual trade activities of border residents are being disrupted, which will significantly impact the border trade cities in China. Taking the Dongxing Port in Guangxi as an example, it is the only first-class port in China that connects with Vietnam by land and sea, located just 100 meters from Móng Cái in Vietnam. Previously, Dongxing Port offered convenient services such as self-service customs clearance, allowing both travelers and those engaged in cross-border trade to come and go easily. Dongxing Port sees a high volume of border trade personnel, with its inbound and outbound passenger flow ranking first among land border ports in Guangxi. Such border port cities are significantly affected by the adjustments in Vietnam's border trade policies. In addition to the port cities, other nearby cities reliant on the ports, such as Kunming, Ruili, Pu'er, Wenshan, Baise, and Chongzuo, will also be impacted to varying degrees. However, from a long-term perspective, the new regulations also provide opportunities for standardization, industrial upgrading, and infrastructure improvement in the Vietnam-China cross-border trade. Firstly, there is a tightening of payment methods and product standards. Vietnam's Decree No. 122 supplements Decree No. 14 from 2018, explicitly outlining the payment methods for cross-border trade activities. It also introduces Article 4a regarding product standards, requiring that all goods involved in cross-border transactions must meet the legal standards and quality requirements of the importing country. This regulation aims to enhance the traceability and overall quality of traded goods. According to the resolution, the main payment methods for border trade activities include bank payments, settlement payments between exported goods and services and imported goods and services (with any differences settled through bank payments), as well as cash payments. However, under the new regulations, cash payment methods are only applicable to the buying, selling, and exchanging of goods by border residents. Secondly, Decree No. 122 will focus on promoting the upgrading and structural optimization of industries along Vietnam's border. Specifically, this resolution aims to encourage Vietnamese border enterprises to continually enhance the quality and standards of their products to better meet the growing demand in the Chinese market. Through this process, companies will place greater emphasis on managing production processes and fostering technological innovation, thereby improving overall production efficiency and product quality. This will not only enhance the competitiveness of Vietnamese products in the Chinese market but also drive economic development in border areas, achieving optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure. In addition, China and Vietnam may further enhance the construction and investment in border ports to adapt to the changes in trade patterns brought about by the new regulations. This includes large-scale improvements and upgrades to the infrastructure of border ports to enhance the customs clearance environment and efficiency. Particularly for specific ports that require centralized processing of import and export procedures, improving customs clearance efficiency and cargo transport capacity is especially important. This will not only facilitate trade between the two countries but also further strengthen economic cooperation and exchanges between them. Final analysis conclusion: The recently issued Decree No. 122 by Vietnam will have an impact on Vietnam-China border trade, particularly for border residents, businesses, and cities that rely on small-scale trade, which may face certain adjustment pressures. However, from a long-term perspective, this new regulation will also bring opportunities for standardization, industrial upgrading, and infrastructure improvement in the cross-border trade of both countries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e5z8jCktGlx2y	2024-10-24T16:47:49-07:00	
Gold’s Future Depends Crucially On China – OpEd	By Brendan Brown It is hard to exaggerate the importance of China in the future of gold even if the relationship falls short of monocausal. Beijing’s actual course both in economic policy and geopolitics since its giant bubble economy turned to bust — starting circa 2020 — has had a huge bearing on gold’s super-strong performance. By contrast if the bust were to spark somehow a triumph of economic and political freedom in China, a continuing stellar rise for gold would depend, most likely, on a further collapse of general confidence in fiat money led by the dollar hegemon. The roots of gold’s dependence on China do not figure at all in the conventional IMF/Keynesian analysis of the present 'malinvestment problem' in that country. According to this analysis the huge loss of private wealth corresponding to the suddenly apparent total economic obsolescence of 80 million empty apartments has caused a sharp rise in China’s private sector savings surplus. That presents supposedly a twin menace of internal deflation and trade imbalance with the rest of the world. Markets Are the Solution How to reduce that menace (according to IMF/Keynesians)? Beijing policy makers must unleash giant fiscal and monetary stimulus. And they must not take any actions which would stoke the tendency towards an ever-larger Chinese trade surplus in the wake of bubble-busting. The premise of these prescriptions is plain wrong. They provide no scope for the invisible hands. Yes, the revelation of pervasive malinvestment goes along with a widespread loss of perceived well-being in China. That means in the first instance a sogginess of consumer spending. The invisible hands, however, in a well-functioning market economy with sound money, should operate in the direction of incentivizing new capital spending amidst the destruction of much old capital stock. A fall in wage-rates across important sectors of the economy, accompanied by a widening of perceived profit opportunities, would bring an upturn in business investment, much of it in new areas of activity. Foreign firms would participate alongside domestic ones. The bust — and related wipe-out of capital stock — means China would have retreated down the list of emerging market economies to where capital is scarcer as a factor of production. In this situation, China would attract enhanced capital inflows with a counterpart in smaller trade surpluses or even trade deficits. More generally, in the post-bubble Chinese economy many prices of goods and services under sound money would have fallen to well below their long-run path, incentivizing individuals and businesses to bring forward spending. The Keynesians who revile 'deflation' just do not get the plot and instead perversely welcome evidence of price rises. These are, in fact, symptomatic of new supply restraints including the fall-out from trade confrontation. There has been little prospect of invisible hands operating in the ways described for China. Foreign investors, most of all in the US, are highly risk-averse regarding ploughing capital into the post-bust Chinese economy — whether due to the hostile attitude of Beijing or out of fear about actions by the US authorities. The Chinese Regime Sees More Inflation as the Solution In view of actual foreign restrictions on Chinese export growth and the serious handicaps to a spontaneous upturn in business investment, policy makers in Beijing see only one possible exit from the economic doldrums. This is an increase in state spending paid for by camouflaged monetary taxation (inflation tax and financial repression). The prospect of likely inflation becomes even stronger when we consider the squeeze on real incomes in China due to stepped up economic warfare with the US. Lowered incomes with no solid hope of improvement ahead surely add to political discontent below the surface. The hierarchy in Beijing will counter this by so-called monetary stimulus or by command-economy measures. No wonder Chinese savers who imagine any of this either explicitly or intuitively see gold as the sparkling refuge —much more so than the dollar in any form. Chinese savers, like other foreign savers, are also aware that that the US will act where possible against local deposit-taking institutions suspected of financing proscribed activities (for example aiding the Russian war economy). Yes, there is the possibility, in principle, of seeking refuge in the wild digital space of crypto assets; in practice, though, this has faced bans in China for many years. A China-Based Network of 'Gold Banks'? The Chinese authorities have no problem with the 'flight into gold' in this nation where private and government sectors together hold the yellow metal to a greater extent than in any other nation including the US; total private and state holdings could be as high as 15% of above ground gold stocks worldwide. Perhaps they appreciate the feel-good factor in gold holdings for the ordinary citizen and how this might dampen political discontent. It is possible that the Chinese authorities could take their sponsorship of gold as safe haven a stage further. They could tolerate and indeed encourage the growth of a payments network based on gold. In effect this would consist of safekeeping institutions that issue certificates of deposits with high mandatory physical gold backing (even 100 per cent for the safest certificates). This payments network could extend to countries friendly with China (who refuse to side with US in trade policy), many in the emerging market world. Shanghai would be the likely point of delivery in this network for physical gold against deposits. Japan’s Limited Options For obvious reasons, as a US ally, Japan could not be part of the network. But in general, the demand for gold as haven has a growing and weighty Asian component, including Japan. That country finds itself exposed to peril in a US-China economic war. For example, US prohibitive actions against China imports may well have a counterpart in Chinese enterprises stepping up their sales efforts in third party countries of which Japan would be top of the list. Japanese investors have every reason to fear that a cheap yen and monetary inflation would become the staple response of their government, especially given its massive debts. Unlike for China, US dollar securities held in Japan are not subject to political risk and have functioned well as a haven in recent years. But doubts may well grow amongst the Japanese that such a one-way track can continue and there are scenarios where Tokyo-Washington relations could become much more tense. Despite much of the public talk about US-Japan closeness, a third way for Tokyo is not foreclosed. The builder of scenarios about US-Japan frictions, including Japan’s continuing and likely growing dependence on Sakhalin oil and gas, could question Japan’s participation in a military response to potential Chinese aggression against Taiwan. Bottom line: the huge importance of China to the future of gold does not just lie in the impoverishing of that country by economic war with the US and the devastation of mal investment. The demand for safe haven amongst savers generally in East Asia who are only too aware of risks stemming from the China-US economic war is also highly relevant.

Pakistan’s Struggle To Secure Gulf Investments Amid Economic Cris...	By Saima Nawaz Pakistan’s economic situation is teetering on the brink as the country is facing a perilous financial crisis, scrambling to secure external financing to meet growing obligations. The country has received only temporary relief from a US$7 billionstaff-level agreementwith the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan’s financing need for the 2023–2024 fiscal year is estimated atUS$25 billion. To bridge this gap, Pakistan has turned to its traditional allies — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China — to seek additional financial support, debt restructuring and foreign direct investment (FDI). Pakistan aims to re-profile US$12 billionin bilateral debt, with US$3 billion owed to the UAE, US$4 billion to China and US$5 billion to Saudi Arabia. The goal is to extend the repayment of these loans over the next three to five years, providing Pakistan with a more stable financial foundation. Pakistan has opened the door to Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, through theSpecial Investment Facilitation Council— a platform to attract FDI in key sectors such as agriculture, mining, energy and infrastructure.FDI increasedto US$1.9 billion in 2023–2024 fiscal year compared to US$1.6 billion in 2022–23 fiscal year, a 17 per cent increase. Although China remains the largest contributor, there has been an increase in FDI from Saudi Arabia and UAE, rising from US$1 million to US$10 million over the 2022–2023 fiscal year. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have shown interest in agriculture and mining, sectors where significant investment opportunities exist. These investments align with their broader strategies —Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030and the UAE’s post-oil economy strategy — to diversify their economy away from oil dependency and expand their global influence. By investing in Pakistan, both nations seek to strengthen their diplomatic ties and economic presence in South Asia, tap into new markets and expand their geopolitical reach. Pakistan has actively invitedSaudi Arabia and the UAEto invest in specific projects identified through thePakistan Sovereign Wealth Fund, which includes state-owned enterprises. Pakistan hopes these countries will make significant investments as iturgently needsforeign exchange and economic stimulus. The strong historical ties, people-to-people connections and growing alignment of business interests between Pakistan and these Gulf nations provide an additional layer of optimism. The government believes that attracting investments from Saudi Arabia and the UAE would significantly boost Pakistan’s economic activity and provide much needed support during these difficult times. But Pakistan has yet to make significant improvement in its investment environment. In May 2024, a Saudi delegationvisited Pakistanto evaluate the proposed investments but chose not to proceed, citing that the projects did not meet their investment criteria. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE are looking for well-structured and high-yield investments, not ventures driven solely by historical ties. Saudi Arabiamade it clearthat ‘We are taxing our people, we are expecting also others to do the same, to do their efforts. We want to help but we want you also to do your part’. This response underscores the structural issue and distrust within Saudi financial circles towards Pakistan’s fiscal management. Pakistan must improve its presentation of investment opportunities to meet international standards and attract investors seeking robust returns, independent of geo-political and historical pressures. Several systemic problems in Pakistan need to be addressed to attract and retain significant investments. Regulatory inefficiencies and a burdensome taxation system are major barriers. Investors often only realise these challenges after committing, finding themselves entangled in a complex web of predatory tax regimes, rent-seeking practices, elite captures, capital and financial market issues, and unpredictable exchange rate policies. These issues force companies to spend considerable time and resources seeking exemptions or other forms of relief, a process that is inefficient and unattractive at the international level. Investors seek policy certainty, long-term stability and aconducive political environment. The economic cost ofpolitical instabilityisaround 3 per cent of GDP. To attract investments from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other potential investors, Pakistan must create a more stable, transparent and investor-friendly environment. Its regulatory framework, particularly regarding foreign investment and funds repatriation, may not be sufficiently conducive to attract Gulf capital. High debt levels and concerns about financial management could further deter Gulf investors. The potential for attracting investment from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE is promising, especially as these nations actively expand their global economic footprint. If Pakistan can present attractive and well-structured projects, it could encourage these countries to increase their investment levels. But the focus must be on greenfield investments — those that create new infrastructure and opportunities in sectors with minimal domestic competition. Brownfield investments through partnerships with local businesses also have potential, as local businesses can provide the trust required within the system. When foreign investments are heavily incentivised by the government, it is more difficult for local businesses to remain competitive. Foreign investors may be drawn more by the incentive than the business opportunity, leading to market imbalance where foreign entities dominate at the expense of local industries. A cautionary example is theKarachi Electric Supply Company, where ongoing subsidies to private investors have become a financial burden rather than an asset. Such investments create liabilities without offering long-term economic benefits. Pakistan must carefully evaluate the nature of the investments it seeks. The government should prioritise projects that contribute positively to the economy, avoid creating perpetual financial liabilities and ensure that any sale or lease of national assets does not prioritise short-term gains over long-term economic growth. FDI can only come as complementary to domestic investment efforts. Thoughtful planning and strategic alignment with domestic market dynamics will be essential to ensuring that investments benefit the country’s future.

Women Killed In Armed Conflicts Doubles In 2023 – OpEd	By Caroline Mawanga New York | 23 October 2024 (IDN) — A new UN report onWomen, Peace, and Security, led byUN Women, has painted dismal picture: The effects of war and conflict on women and girls are worsening. In 2023, the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled compared to 2022. Four out of every ten people who died because of conflict in 2023 were women. UN-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence swelled by 50 per cent. These increases in deaths during war and in violence against women are taking place against a backdrop of increasing blatant disregard of international law designed to protect women and children during war, says the report by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. The report comes 24 years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325, which called for all parties to conflicts to ensure the safety of women and girls, and for women’s full involvement in peace processes. For example, women in war zones are also increasingly suffering from restricted access to healthcare. Every day, 500 women and girls in conflict-affected countries die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. By the end of 2023, 180 women were giving birth every day in war-torn Gaza—most without necessities or medical care. 'Women continue to pay the price of the wars of men,' said UN Women Executive Director, Sima Bahous. 'This is happening in the context of a larger war on women. The deliberate targeting of women’s rights is not unique to conflict-affected countries but is even more lethal in those settings. We are witnessing the weaponization of gender equality on many fronts, if we do not stand up and demand change, the consequences will be felt for decades, and peace will remain elusive' she added. Despite commitments to ensure women’s full and meaningful participation in peace and security matters made over many years, political and military power and decision-making around conflicts continue to be overwhelmingly dominated by men. Women comprised only 9.6 per cent of negotiators in peace processes in 2023, even though studies show that when women are involved, peace agreements last longer and are better implemented. Severe lack of funding In Yemen, for example, women-led negotiations resulted in safe access to a water source for civilians. In Sudan, 49 women-led organizations are pushing for a more inclusive peace process. These efforts are largely unsupported or unrecognized in formal peace negotiations. The UN report identifies the severe lack of funding as one of the key challenges in realizing women, peace and security commitments. In 2023, global military expenditures reached a record $2.44 trillion. In contrast, funding for organizations and movements supporting women’s rights continues to fall short, averaging just 0.3 per cent of total aid annually—especially in conflict-affected areas. Investments in gender-based violence prevention and response make up less than one per cent of all humanitarian spending. In 2025, the world will reach a series of anniversaries of significant global actions that were intended to promote gender equality and human rights for everybody, most notably the 30th commemoration of the Beijing Platform for Action, the most visionary blueprint on women’s rights ever adopted by 189 countries. The report concludes that only through bold political action and increased funding, will women’s equal and meaningful participation in peace and security become a reality: a reality that is essential for achieving lasting peace for all. In the Ukraine war, women are on the front lines and leading recovery Women have been on the front lines of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Their suffering has been disproportionate and relentless, withwomen and children making up almost 90 per cent of people fleeing the war. But that is not the whole picture. Women are also humanitarian actors, community leaders, and providers for their families. One in every two businesses in Ukraine is founded by a woman. Ukrainian women are also taking on more roles in traditionally male-dominated professions, such as the security sector, transit, and demining. Since Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, women’s rights organizations and women leaders have been providing humanitarian assistance, advocating for women’s rights, taking on leadership roles in business and in politics, and many have joined the armed forces.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e5whpai894sOD	2024-10-24T16:44:34-07:00	
CNBC Hides Extent To Which Trump Tax Proposal Would Hurt Moderate...	CNBC, which is owned and controlled by people who will pay lower taxes with Donald Trump back in the White House, ran a PRpiecefor Donald Trump’s tax agenda. The piece is headlined 'Trump Tax Plans Could Exempt 93 Million Americans From Income Tax.' The piece highlights several proposals that Trump has thrown out with virtually no specifics, such as exempting firefighters, police, and veterans from taxes as well as overtime wages. It concludes that this could exempt 93 million people from income taxes. Trump has proposed to offset this lost revenue with taxes on imports. Since most of the people who CNBC now says would be exempt from income tax already pay little or no income tax, they would almost certainly be paying far more money in taxes on imports than they pay now in income tax. For example, a family of four with an income of $60,000 and two kids, would currently pay nothing in income taxes. We don’t know how high Trump will actually make his import taxes (he keeps throwing out higher numbers), but if we start with his 20 percent and 60 percent on China, this would come to an average of close to 30 percent. With goods imports at roughly 13 percent of GDP, this would translate into a tax of roughly 4.0 percent. If this family spends all their income this would come to a tax burden of $2,400 a year. This family, as well as most other moderate and middle-income families, would fare much worse under the Trump tax plan than the current system. CNBC has managed to flip reality on its head and imply that these people will somehow be better off with the more regressive tax plan Trump is putting forward. It is unfortunate that they could not present the views ofsomeonefamiliar with the tax code.

The Collapse Of Tehran’s Strategic Depth – OpEd	The political balance of power in the Middle East has dramatically shifted against Iran’s regime. Continuous blows to the regime’s proxy forces have created an unprecedented situation for the regime, one that it has never experienced before. These changes are happening at a time when the regime neither has the capacity to respond to these challenges nor can it afford to sit idly by. In both cases, the outcome spells defeat for the regime. For more than three decades, the regime survived through its proxy forces, trying to expand its influence and operational reach. But now, these forces are constantly under pressure and are being damaged. This situation has created serious challenges for the regime, directly impacting on its internal stability and security. The regime is more aware than anyone of the simmering unrest at home, and in fact, all its recent provocations have been aimed at diverting attention away from Iran’s internal problems. Democratic or even semi-democratic governments derive their survival and legitimacy from the votes of their citizens. These governments step aside after their term of power ends. They either exit the political stage or retreat into the background, waiting for the next cycle. However, in dictatorial regimes, there are no fundamental changes. The tyrant remains at the top of the hierarchy and rules as long as possible. The so-called elected officials only serve the purposes of the unelected leaders. In such dictatorships, the regime’s stability and survival depend on factors outside the people’s will. For the mullahs’ regime, the motivating factor for its forces and agents is embodied in 'exporting terrorism and warmongering.' This is why regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei considers Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Palestine as his regime’s 'strategic depth' and uses this as a pretext to mobilize his Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and Basij forces. He needs to show his power in tangible ways to keep the repressive forces and criminals around him to defend his regime. As a result, he constantly boasted that he had control over four Arab capitals, and he ordered his proxies to publicly declare his support for them at every platform. In other words, Khamenei has kept the IRGC, Basij, and plainclothes agents active for all these years by inflating the role of his proxy forces. The propaganda surrounding Hezbollah’s 150,000 missiles ready to launch was part of this strategy. He knew that if he stopped terrorism and warmongering through his proxies, as the regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini put it, the 'spirit of Supreme Leader' would deflate. He knew that the criminals who keep his regime in power are all slaves to power. If they sense that their Supreme Leader is politically and militarily powerless, they will disintegrate quickly. It is due to the collapse of this strategic depth and the disintegration of its proxies that fear has engulfed the regime. With the regime losing its regional power, no one has hope for tomorrow anymore. In a speech to the regime’s loyal base, Majlis (Parliament) speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf repeatedly used the phrase 'let’s not be afraid!' At the same time, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has resorted to trips in the region, pleading with various countries to mediate and prevent the outbreak of war. A country like Lebanon, which was once under the regime’s control, is now packing up its relationship with the regime and summoning its ambassador for every misstep. Even Syria is no longer showing a friendly face to the regime and is quietly distancing itself from the regime and its so-called 'Resistance Axis.' One of the regime’s experts expressed fear on television, saying: 'Today the situation is more dangerous than last year. The U.S. has brought it refueling planes to the region, and the B-52 bomber has entered the area!' (Source: Regime TV – October 17) The regime’s Friday prayer leaders are also lamenting the wave of defections and 'hopelessness' among the regime’s loyal forces, complaining that 'some of these analyses come from cowardly people and are driven by enemy threats and exaggerations… These analyses lead to hopelessness, negativity, and the weakening of officials, and sometimes even our most loyal forces fall into the trap of these analyses.' Thus, the regime’s strongholds in the Middle East are collapsing one after another, and this is the same 'strategic defeat' that the Iranian Resistance predicted a year ago at the beginning of Khamenei’s warmongering. Now, with protests flaring up and the people’s anger exploding in this volatile society, we will witness even more waves of fear, hopelessness, demotivation, and defections within the regime’s internal forces.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e59RPCjlhk9FW	2024-10-24T16:39:10-07:00	
Has MBS Paved Way For Netanyahu To Target Iran Through A Fictitio...	Ever since Iran launched on 1 October, an unparalleled large-scale attack - using a barrage of nearly 200 ballistic missiles - against Israel, the Middle East has been holding its breath in anticipation of a swift and crushing Israeli retaliation. Iran said its long-awaited attack was in response to Israel's assassinations of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) officer in Beirut, and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran US President Joe Biden has made no secret that - unlike in April when he asked Israel to refrain from responding to Iran's first ever direct attack on Israel- he would support Israel's decision to retaliate, however he has insisted it should be proportionate, thus ensuring the US would not be dragged into an all-out confrontation with Iran. After a week of total secrecy following a phone call between Bidenand Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 October, in which the discussions were largely centred on agreeing a range of mutually acceptable targets, Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying: 'We listen to the American government’s thoughts, but will make our final decisions based on Israel’s national security needs'. This statement was in response to a Washington Post story, highlighting thatNetanyahu had told Biden during the call that he would limit Isreal's retaliation to military sites. But while Biden has all along vehemently opposed targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, he suggested on 3 October that he was engaged in discussions related to striking Iran’s oil facilities, thereby sparking a 5% surge in oil prices. As a result, Biden scrambled immediately to make a screeching turnabout emphasizing: 'If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oil fields '. Given that the US presidential election is edging ever closer and with the polls indicating a tight racebetween Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, it is hardly surprising to see Biden working tirelessly to steer Netanyahu away from targeting Iran's oil facilities as this would doubtlessly fuel a dramatic surge in oil price, leading to a devastating blow to the US economy and therefore scupper Harris’s prospects of winning the elections. it is worth noting that Netanyahu's steadfast determination to fatally undermine all US-led attempts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or Lebanon has not only aimed to shore up his own political survival by preserving his right wing government - which would unravel in the event of a ceasefire - but more significantly todeprive Biden's democratic administration from any major diplomaticachievement in the Middle East, as opposed to Trump's spectacular breakthrough in normalising Isreal's relations with UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. And while it is abundantly clear that Netanyahu would prefer to see Trump in power,particularly given that Trump had - during his presidency - bent backwards to appease him, yet despite being confident that targeting Iran's oil facilities would boost Trump's campaign, Netanyahu would most likely refrain from such action, fearing accusations of meddling in US election. In a show of defiance Netanyahu has pressed ahead with his relentless campaign by storming Gaza and then invading Lebanon despite Biden's growing concern regarding the shockingly unjustifiable huge number of civilian casualties, especiallywoman and children, as well as the woefully inadequate amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Clearly Biden's refusal to put his money where his mouth is by condemning Netanyahu let alone threatening to halt weapon shipments - which is what the French president Emmanuel Macron has called for - has emboldened Netanyahu. Netanyahu's initial reaction to Iran's attack by forcefully stating: Iran had made a 'big mistake' and would 'pay for it' has implied a rapid response, however when it comes to targeting Iran, Netanyahu is acutely aware that he can ill-afford to defy Washington, given that Israel has become increasingly dependent, even in its own defence, on the US. In stark contrast to the grinding war of attrition in Gaza, where Netanyahu has failed to accomplish his central goals of completely dismantling Hamas and returning Israel's hostages home, in Lebanon he has undoubtedly been empowered by a series of unimaginable tactical successes culminating in the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. Surely, this prompted Netanyahu to invade Lebanon, hoping to secure his new strategic goal of compelling Hezbollah to cease its ongoing year-long strikes on northern Israel, thus facilitating the return of thousands of displaced citizens to their homes. And amid the uncontainable sense of euphoria, some leading Israeli politicians have pushed hard for Netanyahu to exploit what they perceived as Iran's growing vulnerability - due to the weakening of Hezbollah and Hamas - by striking Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. Yet, such calls have increasingly abated in light of Hezbollah’s remarkably stiff resistance, which has derailed Israel's attempts to make any meaningful headway, while also striking deeper and more frequently into Israel - including targets such as a military base adjacent to Binyamina and even targeting Netanyahu's house in Caesarea. As expected, Netanyahu has adamantly refused on 17 October, to stop the war in Gaza or Lebanon even after killingYahya Sinwar Hamas's leader, who was the mastermind behind the 7 October attacks on Isreal. Even though Mohamed bin Salman [MBS] - Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de facto ruler - has left no doubt that he wouldprefer to see Trump - who unlike Biden had shielded him by suppressing a CIA report blaming him for ordering the killing ofJamal Khashoggi in 2018 - in power, but he was deeply disheartened when Trump shied away from taking decisive action against Iran - which Riyadh blamed - for an assault in 2019 by the Houthis on its oil facilities. As ever Trump cited the disastrous implications to global economy if Iran executes its enduring threat to target Riyadh's oil fields or the flow of Gulf oil through the strait of Hormuz, as the perfect excuse for inaction. Consequently, in the absence of such a wholehearted US support, MBS agreed in March 2023 - albeit grudgingly - to a Chinese-brokered rapprochement with Iran, aiming to not merely break free from the futile and unwinnable war that he waged on Yemen but more significantly to strip Iran of its formidable oil deterrence, therefore pave the way for the US and Israel to target Iran with impunity. In the eyes of MBS, Israel’s abrupt shiftfrom focusing solely on Hamas to taking on Hezbollah, including taking out its leader marked an excellent opportunity to spur Biden into not just giving Israel the green light but also to spearhead the targeting of Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. To this end Riyadh signalled on 26 September that it intends to ramp up its oil production in December in what it portrayed as an attempt to retain its share of the market but in reality it is a brazen move designed tonot only appease Biden, who has relentlessly called on MBS to curb oil prices in order to ease inflation in the US and hammer Russia's war machine in Ukraine, but also tounderline that there is sufficient oil in the market to offset any reduction in supply in the event of striking Iran. Even with all these extraordinary inducements Biden-Harris have remained disinterested, as it is clear that any misstep would fatally sabotage Harris's campaign. Iran meanwhile pulled no punches, bluntly warning Riyadh and Gulf states that opening their airspace or military basis to Israel would amount to an act of war, while also activating its oil deterrence by starkly threatening Riyadh that it could not guarantee the safety of its oil facilities. To avoid being plunged into a regional conflagration Riyadh and the Gulf states have informed Israel that they will not allow it to use their air space and also urged the US to push Israel to carefully calibrate its retaliation. Both Netanyahu and MBS want Hamas and Hezbollah eradicated. They both want Trump to win the elections, thereby set the stage for them to normalise their relations. But most crucially they strive to goad the US into confronting Iran. In practice, they both have faced an insurmountable hurdle: Neither Trump nor Biden or Harris have any appetite to be embroiled in such a daunting conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e50i83i92uZvE	2024-10-24T16:30:59-07:00	
Vaccines And The Length Of Our Lives – OpEd	The commercial imperative to extract money from human bodies is playing havoc with medical education, and the body of knowledge through which the medical professions operate. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the field of vaccines, and their place in determining the length of our lives. The History of Living Longer As a medical student, I was taught that the reason we in wealthy countries now live far longer than our forebears was improvements in living conditions, sanitation, and nutrition. We don’t walk through sewage and horse dung each day, eat fly-blown meat, drink water from below the nearest latrines, or sleep eight to a room on rancid bedding. We get beaten less often and have more leisure time. Antibiotics also helped but came after most of these gains had been achieved. Most vaccination came even later, mopping up some residual mortality in ‘vaccine-preventable diseases.’ This was all stated in a lecture hall of 300 medical students, with the relevant data to back it up, and accepted as fact. Because for wealthier countries it was, and is, undeniably true. I recently asked a small group of students the major reasons for improved life expectancy, and was told 'vaccination.' In a subsequent session, I showed some of the graphs laid out below. The students were shocked and asked where I obtained this information. It was actually fairly difficult to find. I remember searching 20 years ago and readily finding it on the web. In 2024, it took a lot of sifting through information explaining how vaccinations have apparently saved humanity, and how those repeating what I was taught as a student were a subversive element undermining the greater good, spreading misinformation or similar daft claims. We have certainly not progressed. This does not mean vaccines are not a great idea. Providing some immunity before an infection can mitigate much of its harm by giving the body a head start in fighting back. It just means their usefulness must be understood in context, as must their harms. Somewhat strangely, discussion of vaccines has become increasingly controversial within the medical establishment. It is as if an Inquisition has been imposed over the profession, seeking out anyone still prioritizing calm rational thought over a dogma dictated from above. However, if truth and calm discussion can form an anchor for policy, vaccination will be more effective. The charts shown here, from Australia, the United States, and England, reflect those of other wealthy countries. The same findings are reflected in various published papers. Facts are facts, even if they may with time become harder to find, buried under Big Search algorithms to keep us safe. They remain facts even if medical students are taught to believe alternate realities. Such false teaching, coupled with large financial incentives, drive their desire to ensure children be ‘fully vaccinated’ according to their country’s childhood schedule. They increasingly believe a lie, undeniable misinformation, that this is why most children in our countries now grow up without experiencing the death of a friend or sibling. Vaccines in Context The medical world calls these 'vaccine-preventable diseases' because companies sell vaccines that can prevent them. They are vaccine-preventable to a large extent, and vaccines do stop them from killing people. But in wealthy countries, truthfully, the numbers they save are very low. Vaccination probably had a major role in the elimination of smallpox. We cannot, of course, be absolutely sure, as there was no control group. Smallpox caused outbreaks that decimated populations isolated for thousands of years from the virus, such as Native Americans, where a vaccine would have made a massive difference. However, smallpox also had the hallmarks of a disease that might actually disappear through good public health education and improved living standards; it lacked an animal reservoir, required close contact with body fluids to spread, and was usually easy to recognize. It is probable that the vaccine considerably accelerated its decline, especially in poorer countries. Measles is similarly interesting. As the graphic shows, most decline was long before mass vaccination. Like whooping cough, mortality was probably partly reduced through the advent of oxygen therapy, but mainly people just appear to have become less susceptible to its complications. It could nonetheless be a devastating disease, which decimated isolated, immunologically-naïve populations in thePacific Islandsand elsewhere that had no history of contact, and still causes avoidable child death in low-income countries today. Measles deaths are often associated with micronutrient malnutrition, such as vitamin A deficiency, and fixing that would also address many other health risks. This used to be emphasized 30 years ago. However, the measles vaccine is also very effective at stopping measles deaths in susceptible populations. It has very little impact on mortality in wealthy countries where it mainly stops infection and annoying sickness, as few kids are so micronutrient-deficient to be susceptible to very severe diseases. It is so good at stopping actual infection that mandates for measles vaccines that some countries impose are more about authoritarianism than public health. If you don’t want your child to risk measles and decide that vaccination is a lesser risk, you can have your child vaccinated. Your child is now protected from those who are unvaccinated, so there should be no interest in mandating it for them. Rational free people could live with that. Hepatitis B and HPV vaccination (for Human Papilloma Virus) are two further curiosities. We schedule Hep B vaccination on the first day of life, even though it is mainly spread in Western countries through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. If the parents are not infected (and all mothers are screened), then there is not really a risk until the late teenage years, when the person can make their own informed choice. For a child born in a country with 30% Hepatitis B positivity rates and poor healthcare, the risk-benefit calculation may produce a different result. Dying of liver failure or liver cancer is not pleasant. The HPV vaccine, intended to prevent cervical cancer, has a complicated picture. It will have limited mortality impact in Western countries where cervical cancer mortality has already declined through regular screening. Elsewhere the situation is very different, with over300,000women dying annually from this agonizing disease, mostly in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa where only about12% are screened. This is not through choice but because screening is poorly accessible. As development of cancer can take about 20 years after HPV infection, we must also rely on (reasonable) assumptions about causality when calculating benefits. So, the equation clearly varies between women. Calculating risk versus benefit in order to ensure clear informed consent (or even medical ethical competency) would require consideration of age, behavior, access to screening, and adverse event rates. To know adverse event rates, a comparison would logically be necessary between the vaccine and something neutral like saline (rather than other vaccine constituents). Because this is still awaited, women should of course be informed of this data gap. Therefore, a blanket policy on HPV vaccination would be illogical. The story of diphtheria suggests that medical management may have had a major role in its decline. The decline coincided with the introduction of antibody therapy (anti-toxin), and later decline with the toxoid vaccine. However, it also coincided with the decline of other respiratory diseases of childhood that did not have such interventions. So, we simply cannot be sure. Tetanus toxoid may also have had an impact, especially for people at higher risk, such as plumbers and farmers. However, accountants no longer navigate dung-paved streets on the way to the office and this general cleaning up of the environment will have driven much of the change. For business reasons that are slightly unclear, boosters are available only combined with diphtheria and pertussis vaccines in many Western countries, which adds nothing to an adult’s benefit but adds to their risk. It’s hard to claim safety and benefit are the main drivers in the face of such an anomaly. Knowing What We Don’t Know All vaccines also have adverse effects. While not discussed here, they are real and I know people whose health was wrecked by vaccination. Assessment of risk is difficult as no childhood vaccines on the US schedule have been through a true placebo-controlled trial – they are usually compared against the rest of the contents of the vial (chemicals such as adjuvants and preservatives but lacking the antigen or inactivated virus – a mixture that may be the cause of most of the side effects) or against another vaccine. By doing this, they can be shown to be no worse than the comparator, which would be fine if we actually had decent placebo-controlled trials of the comparators. Most doctors who prescribe vaccines almost certainly don’t know this. (There is agood, evidence-based explanationof this issue which is well worth reading). Most doctors probably also pay little attention to the lack of trials determining the effect of giving dozens of doses of immune-stimulating adjuvants and preservatives, including aluminum salts, to growing children across their formative years. It is likely to be relatively harmless to many children, but harmful to some, as biology tends to work that way. However, if the disease that it addresses is hardly ever severe, then that ‘some’ can become very significant. Each ‘some’ is a child whose parents are trying to do the right thing, and trusting the medical establishment that this is indeed being done. None of this would be new to a lot of people, as interest in vaccines and their harms and benefits is growing. However, most doctors performing vaccinations are probably unaware of much of the above, especially those graduating in the past couple of decades. If they are aware, they will likely be scared to discuss it as this would risk being labeled a 'vaccine denier' or similarly childish term, or seen as promoting 'vaccine hesitancy.' Vaccine hesitancy is what we once referred to as informed consent (or thinking before doing). After World War Two, we decided that informed consent was essential for ethical medicine. Now, the World Health Organization considers such independent thought a particularlydangerous threatto their interests and those of their sponsors. Many recently trained doctors would consider the lecture I attended 40 years ago a public health risk, and the facts we were shown ‘misinformation.’ They will, at least in the US, also graduate with massive debt and be quite dependent onthe subsidiesthey can receive from medical insurers, which includeoffering or givingvaccinations. This is why they can be so dismissive of intelligent people who spend time reading up on, and questioning, such things. They are not being aggressive or intentionally batting for Big Pharma; they are just so indoctrinated in the selling of these health commodities, and so financially and professionally dependent on this being the best course, that they are unable to articulate an independent, rational, evidence-based stance. Navigating a Rational Path To understand the vaccination issue, the public needs to understand that the medical and public health professions have lost their ability to reason. They are experts in repeating what they were taught, but not in deciphering reality. There are also fanatics and dogmatic people on the other side of the vaccine divide that can see the harms, but not the good. They downplay a few hundred thousand cervical cancer deaths per year, and have not witnessed the gut-wrenching sight of a baby dying of tetanus in a low-income country with no ability to address her pain. They have not had to send a rabies sufferer home to die because there is simply nothing the local medical system can do for them once they are symptomatic. On vaccination policy, the public mostly needs to go it alone. Understand there are real risks and real benefits, like any pharmaceutical. Understand that the main reason why we don’t die from many of the infectious diseases that we used to has little to do with vaccination. Listen to a doctor, then ask them some pointed questions to ascertain whether they are looking at your child in context and weighing both sides or simply reciting a script. When the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, vaccines make sense. They are a foolish idea when the opposite applies. It’s difficult to navigate the information out there, but the public must do so until the medical establishment frees itself from the shackles of its sponsors and catches up. Everyone should be hesitant to have stuff injected into them for commercial profit. We should hesitate more when the person injecting it is also rewarded for their compliance. Doctors should be hesitant about injecting chemicals and metal salts into anyone unless they have strong expectations of net benefit. With vaccines, as with antibiotics and almost any other pharmaceutical, sometimes they will have and sometimes they won’t. Obviously, governments should not be mandating the injection of commercial chemicals as a requirement to participate in society – that would be ridiculous. A State can never make such individual cost-benefit assessments, and in a democracy, we certainly don’t pay the government to own and direct our bodies. This is all so obvious, and inline with conventional evidence-based practice, that you really wonder what all the fuss is about.

Hamas Without Sinwar: A Setback Or A Catalyst? – OpEd	Ever since the October 7 attack last year, Israeli intelligence claimed that Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s military leader, was hiding deep within Gaza’s complex underground tunnels, using Israeli hostages as a strategic shield. They alleged that he was using these hostages as a deterrent to complicate any rescue attempt or targeted strike. Sinwar’s elusiveness became almost mythic. Yet, his death has proven that narrative wrong. Contrary to prior assessments, Sinwar wasn’t hiding underground. Instead, Israeli forces found him above ground, dressed in military attire, in the rubble of a building. He was actively participating on the battlefield, not cowering in tunnels. This revelation has generated some prickly questions about the credibility of Israel’s intelligence agencies. How much does Israel truly know about the remaining hostages’ whereabouts? This question will intensify the pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to present a viable strategy for their rescue. Sinwar’s death has also prompted deeper concerns. For instance, can Israel effectively monitor and control the situation in Gaza, especially when its intelligence regarding key figures like Sinwar appears flawed? Indeed, with Sinwar’s killing, new uncertainties have emerged about the fate of the hostages, the leadership of Hamas, and the broader trajectory of this protracted conflict. Revolutionary movements often revolve around their charismatic leaders, whether in the shadows or out in the open. The reality is that Hamas has now lost one of its key figures. But this isn’t the first time Hamas has faced such a blow. The organization has a long history of surviving and recalibrating after losing its leaders. The list is not short: Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Abdel Aziz el-Rantisi, and, more recently, Ismail Haniyeh. These figures have spanned the spiritual, political, and military realms. Yet, Sinwar’s death carries unique weight, not just because of his position, but due to his personal trajectory. He wasn’t just a figurehead within a militant group. He was a hardliner, even by Hamas’ standards. He also carried unique clout, largely because of his deep ties to Hamas’s military wing, having served as the head of its counterintelligence. What set Sinwar apart from other leaders, many of whom operated in exile, was his physical presence in Gaza. While some in the upper echelons of Hamas led from afar, Sinwar remained entrenched in the heart of the besieged Strip. His leadership style reflected the intractable realities of life under siege, making him a figure of both fear and respect within the organization. Replacing a leader in Hamas is not as simple as swapping one face for another. Each time a leader is killed, the spiritual, political, and military forces within the group must realign. What’s different now, however, is the fluid nature of the struggle itself. For nearly 80 years, Palestinians have remained trapped in a conflict that defies political or diplomatic resolution. Sinwar, like others before him, envisioned a way forward. With his death, Hamas faces a critical crossroads. The world is changing, and Hamas must change with it or risk becoming irrelevant. New leaders will undoubtedly rise. To be successful, they’ll need to align their strategies to a rapidly shifting global and regional landscape. Israel’s current military campaign appears aimed at dismantling the leadership of groups like Hamas, a reflection of its long-standing struggle to resolve the Palestinian question. The devastation of Gaza and the suffering of its people speak to the brutal nature of this conflict. In many ways, the region has been caught in a vicious cycle of violence, where the killing of a leader like Sinwar doesn’t quell the resistance but adds fuel to the fire. The echoes of past conflicts—like those in Lebanon—continue to shape this grim and unresolved narrative as war appears only to breed more war. Yet, despite these seemingly decisive blows, Hamas endures. Each fallen leader’s story becomes legend, inspiring a new generation that is often more militant, more extreme, and even harder to negotiate with. Sinwar’s demise does not signal the end of Hamas at all. Sure, it will temporarily reduce the immediate threat, offering Israel a brief sense of tactical respite. But it is unlikely to end the war or halt the bloodshed in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed 40,000. And it certainly doesn’t suggest that peace, or a two-state solution, is suddenly on the horizon. The hard truth remains: the occupation persists, and the establishment of a Palestinian state is as distant a dream as ever.

MEPs Seek Solutions On Russia’s Shadow Oil Tankers	By Nathan Canas (EurActiv) -- The European Parliament debated on Wednesday evening (23 October) the necessary actions to address the issue of Russia exporting oil using 'shadow tankers' to circumvent EU sanctions and continue to supply it to third countries. Shadow tankers are often old vessels with unclear ownership, which typically sail underthe flags of countrieswith quality controls that are considered poor.These vessels also lack satellite tracking, and operate without insurance, posing a major ecological threat. Until now, these vessels had mainly been used to transport Iranian and Venezuelan goods under sanctions and occasionally for drug trafficking.However, this changed following EU sanctions on Russia. The EU halted 90% of its oil imports from Russiain December 2022and established, alongside the G7 countries, a price ceiling of US$60a barrel to limit Moscow's profits. According toa studyby S&P Global, around 591 of these shadow tankers are in operation, and responsible for transporting up to 70% of Russian oil by sea. Ecological bombs While the number of shadow tankers continues to rise, they also represent a major environmental risk. Many of these ageing vessels lackregistrationwith the AIS tracking system, heightening the threat of maritime collisions. During the Parliament debate on Wednesday, Latvian MEP Sandra Kalniete (EPP) described them as 'ecological time bombs that threaten the world's waters with oil spills.' One EU sea is particularly threatened: the Baltic Sea. Already considered one ofthe most polluted seasin the world, 50% of Russian oil exports transit through it. For Swedish MEP Isabella Lövin (Greens/EFA), 'We need to stop importing fossil fuels, not just for the Baltic, but also for Ukraine and for peace.' '[We should] refuse access to the Baltic Sea to all these ships,' recommended for its part Swedish MEP Jonas Sjöstedt (The Left). According toAllianz, these shadow ships were involved in at least 50 accidents at sea, complicating compensation efforts due to their lack of insurance. Dutch MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy (Renew) pointed out, 'European taxpayers will ultimately have to pay the bill once the disaster is a reality.' The European institutions, together with the Member States, have joined the UK government's call to the relevant stakeholders to 'adhere to their relevant obligations and support the prevention, detection and reporting of 'shadow fleet' activities', reads apolicy paperpublished on 17 October. A difficult equation The EU cannot simply ban these ships from its waters, the European Commission explained in its Maywritten responseto MEPs Pernille Weiss (PPE) and Niels Fuglsang (S&D) who were asking questions about Russian shadow fleet in Union waters. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ships are granted the right of innocent passage, allowing them to 'navigate freely in territorial seas.' 'Preventing shadow fleet vessels from entering territorial waters or exclusive economic zones faces significant challenges,' wrote current Commissioner for financial services and stability Mairead McGuinness. Another challenge concerns non-EU countries, which continue to demand Russian oil and see the Ukrainian conflict as a European concern. On this point, Hungarian MEP András László (PfE) declared that 'the idea of fighting against an energy giant was madness,' and added that 'apart from the Western countries, no others have joined the sanctions.' A resolution on this will be put to a vote of MEPs during the 13-14 November plenary session in Brussels.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e50P4yrQaDPjO	2024-10-24T16:17:04-07:00	
Rent Control Is Not A Solution: It’s A Recipe For Exacerbating Th...	Utah is an increasingly costly place to live. It’s ranked thethird most expensivestate to buy a home. A staggering80% of Utahnsbelieve that housing prices are too high, and the complaint isn’t limited to homebuyers. Rental rates have also surged dramatically, jumping 34% to 41% inSalt Lake Countysince 2018. Some politicians argue that high housing costs are driven by sellers’ and landlords’ greed, but the real reasons behind high prices are far more complex.Inflation,regulatory barriersthat limit the supply of affordable housing andpopulation growthhave inflated costs, putting immense pressure on renters and property owners.High energy prices,labor shortagesandsupply chain issueshave compounded the challenges. In other words, the root of the problem lies in supply and demand, yet many of the proposed solutions ignore that basic economic principle. The worst policy response thus far has already been proven to fail for eons: rent control. President Joe Bidenproposed a federal versionof rent control earlier this year. In addition, his Department of Justice isattemptingto enact backdoor rent control by challenging algorithmic pricing software that assists landlords in determining the market price at which to list their property. After accepting nomination for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris similarlyembraced rent controlandpledgedto 'take on corporate landlords.' While rent control may seem like immediate relief for struggling renters, it backfires by chilling developers’ incentives to build new housing and landlords to maintain existing properties. The supply of rental units falls, making housing even scarcer while driving up prices in the long term. In areas where rent control has been implemented, such asNew York CityandSan Francisco, landlords often respond by pulling units from the market or converting them into condominiums, further shrinking the rental supply. It is not a solution—it’s a recipe for exacerbating the problem. Rent controls force rental rates below market-clearing levels and lead to excess demand for apartments. Landlords can react by charging extra for parking, furnishings and even keys. Since not enough units are available, landlords are freer to discriminate in favor of tenants they prefer (no pets, no children, no students). Renters are forced to find places to live outside rent-controlled areas, lengthening commutes. Vacancy rates in rent-controlled apartments shrink because favored tenants understandably are reluctant to move out. None of the adverse consequences of rent controls are 'unintended' or 'unexpected;' they are predictable and confirmed by evidence. The only workable solution is to increase the supply of new homes and apartments. In fact, Utah’s rental market has already begun showing signs of improvement, thanks to local leaders’ support for new construction. AsDejan Eskic, a housing analyst at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah, noted, 'There are now more apartments available than people looking for apartments.' As a result, asking rents have dropped by around 2.5% to 3.5% since January, and many landlords are now offering economic incentives to attract tenants. That’s good news. However, if the Biden administration implements rent controls, that progress could be undone, discouraging further construction and creating disincentives for owners to maintain or improve their properties. Photographs of rent-controlled areas of New York City look like bombed German cities during World War II. Rather than imposing federal rent caps, which would only aggravate the situation, policymakers should focus on solutions that have already been proven to workin places like Argentina—removing rent controls, building more housing, cutting red tape, and making it easier to become a landlord. Let housing markets work for Utah, not against Utahns.

Thousands Of North Korean Troops Set To Deploy Alongside Russian ...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. A New Enemy at the Gates: The North Korean Military on the Ground in Europe Further evidence has emerged that North Korea’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has extended beyond ammunition transfers and diplomatic support, and now involves North Korean troops in Europe. On October 21,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeolparticipated in a telephone conversation at the request of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The two leaders exchanged critical intelligence on North Korean combat formations within the Russian military and the formations’ potential roles in the war. South Korea also summoned Georgy Zinoviev, Russia’s ambassador to Seoul, to protest the troubling new ties between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea’sdemandthat North Korea immediately withdraw its troops underscored the urgency of the situation. General Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR), revealed that a division-size North Korean force of approximately 11,000 servicemen is currently training in Russia to prepare for deployment in Ukraine. Of these personnel, a regiment-size unit of 2,600 troops isreportedly soon heading to the Russian region of Kursk. Intelligence from South Korea, which aligns with reports from Ukraine, detected the presence oftraining facilities in Russiacapable of accommodating up to 12,000 North Korean servicemen. South Korean officials also disclosed that Pyongyang has dispatched a 1,500-person special forces detachment to Russia, further highlighting the scale of North Korea’s commitment. North Korea’s involvement has given a significant boost to Russia’s effort in Ukraine. Someintelligence assessmentshave concluded that half of the three million artillery shells the Russian military has used yearly in Ukraine have come from Pyongyang. Furthermore, a technical analysis of a North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missile recently shot down in Ukraine has revealed that Pyongyang’s munition uses components from Western systems. In return for this support, Moscow has rewarded Pyongyang with technical assistance for its own weapons systems. Cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a dangeroustrend that this report will continue to monitor. 2. Battlefield Assessment Russian forces continued offensive efforts on the Kharkiv front, where they launched waves of attacks to capture the critical hub ofVovchansk. Elite Russian combat formations, including detachments from the 1st Guards Tank Army and special operations units from the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU), participated in the fighting. Kupiansk has also seen heavy combat that has increased pressure on Ukraine. Furthermore, declassified intelligence from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence revealed that Russian combat formations have reachedthe Oskil River. The September 25, 2024,editionof this report highlighted how the Oskil could provide the Russian General Staff with a natural barrier to stabilize the front and cement its territorial gains. Additionally, the Russian military intensified offensive combat action around the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar. Pokrovsk and Toretsk also remain under heavy pressure, withUkrainian defensiveswavering there. Visual evidence shows that the Ukrainian military has combat-deployed sub-units of the38th Marine Brigadeto the Pokrovsk front. Meanwhile, the 36th Ukrainian Marine Brigade continued to operate in the Russian region of Kursk. Open-source intelligence suggests that the Ukrainian military has fielded Abrams main battle tanks, its principal high-end Western armor, as well as Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in itsKursk campaign. After bolstering its force-on-force and force-to-terrain ratios in Kursk, the Russian military has been on a counteroffensive footing for several weeks. Unfortunately, evidence is mounting that Russia’s 155th Marine Brigade, infamous for conducting massacres in the Ukrainian cities of Bucha and Irpin in the early stages of the war, has again committed war crimes, killing several Ukrainianprisoners of war(POWs) in Kursk. The Ukrainian military continued to conduct long-range strikes to attempt to gain an asymmetric advantage in the face of Russia’s conventional superiority on land. Last week, Ukraine’s drones hammered the Russian state-owned Sverdlov plant, one ofRussia’s largest manufacturers of military explosives, near Nizhny Novgorod over 450 miles inside Russia. Kyiv’s drone and missile forces also struck the Lipetsk-2 military airport, located 240 miles from the Ukrainian front. TheUkrainian General Staffreported that the salvo targeted ammunition depots and fuel storage centers that supply Russia’s Su-35 fighters, MiG-31 interceptors, and Su-34 fighter-bombers. Ukraine also used American-provided High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to pound a Russianmilitary trainingground on the southern front.

Iran, Israel Have Formidable Militaries With Different Strengths ...	As tensions between Israel and the Iranian government escalate, the conflict is moving beyond mere asymmetric warfare toward direct strikes on each other’s soil. This new phase of hostilities raises concerns about the military capabilities of both countries, as analysts and experts assess the strengths and weaknesses of their armed forces. To understand the full scope of the potential confrontation, it is essential to recognize that any war between these two nations would not only devastate them, but could also draw in other regional and global players, including state and non-state actors. The strategic importance of both Israel and Iran makes this conflict a potential trigger for wider regional instability. Military capabilities can be analyzed through several categories that reveal the operational readiness and strategic power of a nation. These categories provide a framework to evaluate how Israel and Iran compare. A country’s defense budget serves as a crucial indicator of its military strength and priorities. It reflects the resources dedicated to developing and maintaining military assets, such as personnel, technology and weapons systems. Israel’s defense budget is significantly larger than Iran’s, bolstered by substantial US military aid. Israel’s annual defensespendingis currently $23.4 billion, with an additional $3.18 billion annually provided by the US as part of a decade-long agreement. This financial backing enables Israel to procure advanced weapons systems, such as the Iron Dome and F-35 stealth fighters, meaning it is most likely the technologically superior force. Iran spends considerably less due to international sanctions and economic constraints. Its 2023 defense spending wasreportedto be $10.3 billion, although it might be higher due to undisclosed funds used for its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran compensates for its lower budget by relying on asymmetric tactics, such as using proxies and deploying missile forces capable of striking its regional adversaries. Manpower is a vital component of military strength. In terms of active personnel, Israelmaintainsabout 170,000 soldiers in its defense forces, with a reserve force that can quickly be mobilized, bringing the total potential military manpower to about 465,000. The Israeli military is highly trained, with mandatory military service ensuring a constant supply of well-prepared soldiers. However, Iran’s available manpower significantly surpasses Israel’s. It has an estimated 587,000 active personnel across its regular army, IRGC and paramilitary forces. The IRGC, a powerful institution within Iran, also oversees the country’s regional proxy forces, allowing it to extend its military reach beyond its borders. In terms of force readiness, however, both countries are generally considered trained and equipped due to continuous engagements and modern training programs. When it comes to weapons systems, Israel appears to enjoy a technological edge, particularly in terms of air power. It possesses 339 combat aircraft, including F-35s and F-16s, alongside various advanced drones, allowing it to maintain air superiority in the region. Israel also has cutting-edge missile defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow, which can intercept short- and medium-range missiles. Its logistical network is robust, ensuring rapid mobility and deployment of forces. Irancompensatesfor its lack of air superiority with a vast arsenal of ballistic missiles, including the Shahab-3 and Fateh-110, which are capable of reaching targets across the Middle East. Iran also has a growing drone capability and relies heavily on its ability to deploy asymmetric warfare tactics. Its logistical capabilities, while not as advanced as Israel’s, are boosted by its network of regional proxies, particularly in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. Geographically, Iran has a strategic advantage due to its location along the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway through which a significant portion of the world’s oil supply passes. In the event of conflict, Iran could threaten or disrupt global oil supplies by blocking or attacking ships in this region. Israel, on the other hand, has a smaller geographical footprint, although its proximity to other countries allows it to rapidly project military power in the Middle East. One of the key advantages for Iran is its ability to leverage regional proxies. Israel, meanwhile, benefits from its close alliances with the US, which guarantees it superior military technology and intelligence support. When it comes to technical sophistication, Israel’s military is considered to be one of the most advanced in the world. Its intelligence services, cyber capabilities and precision-guided weaponry give it a qualitative edge in modern warfare. It is also regarded as one of the globe’s top countries in terms of missile defense technology, electronic warfare and intelligence gathering, supported by satellite technology. Meanwhile, Iran, although not on par with Israel’s advanced technologies, has made significant strides in developing its own indigenous defense technologies. Iran’s cyberwarfare capabilities are growing and its missile technology is considered among the most advanced in the region. While lacking the sophistication of Israel’s military, Iran compensates with its sheer number of missiles and a capacity to disrupt its enemies through unconventional warfare. Lastly, alliances and partnerships play a critical role in shaping military capabilities. Iran’s primary ally, Russia, has for yearsprovidedit with military equipment and political support. But Moscow’s involvement in Ukraine has somewhat constrained its ability to focus on the Middle East. Tehran also maintains ties with China, although this relationship appears less focused on military support. Israel, on the other hand, enjoys an unparalleled alliance with the US, which provides it with both military hardware and political backing. In the event of a conflict, American support for Israel could tip the balance in its favor, as seen in previous wars. In conclusion, while a full-scale war between Israel and Iran would be devastating for these two countries and the broader region, their military capabilities reveal different strengths and weaknesses. Both remain formidable in their own right, but their strategies and military doctrines reflect very different approaches to warfare.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e52ZUeETBuXim	2024-10-24T16:06:43-07:00	
What Will The Final Document Of The Synod On Synodality Be Like? ...	By Andrea Gagliarducci A year ago, at the end of the Synod on Synodality’s first general assembly, electronic versions of a draft of the confidential summary report were circulated among the media and others, as inevitably happens, in the days leading up to the delegates’ last amendments and final vote. This year, apparently to discourage such leaks, synod organizers only provided participants with hard copies of the draft report, which aren’t as easily disseminated. The irony is that there may not be much to share. Internally and externally over the past several weeks, the assembly has come under intense pressure to change the Church’s governing structures and even some of its basic doctrines. Theologian Myriam Wijlens, a synod consultant, emphasized at an Oct. 23 press briefing that Pope Francis has called for 'reconfiguring the Church in a synodal way.' Doing so would require changes to canon law to, for example, make parish or diocesan councils mandatory. But bigger changes, such as opening the diaconate to women or allowing exceptions to priestly celibacy, to cite two issues that were promoted publicly this month, appear off the table. According to sources who have spoken to CNA, what’s left is a draft report that is generating disappointment in progressive quarters but very little buzz. Titled 'Communion, Mission, and Participation,' it’s a short document — 152 paragraphs, for the time being, covering about 47 pages. According to synod sources, it is divided into five parts. The first part deals with the shared understanding of synodality and its theological principles. The second concerns what is called a 'relational conversion.' The third part speaks of ecclesial discernment, decision-making processes, the culture of transparency, accountability, and evaluation. The fourth part seeks to understand how to cultivate the exchange of gifts in new ways. Finally, the fifth part speaks of formation in and for missionary synodality. The synod’s final document, one delegate told CNA, appears to be strongly borrowed from the document on synodality that the International Theological Commission published in 2018, titled 'Synodality in the Life and Mission of the Church.' After reviewing it the synod delegates can propose amendments, which the assembly will discuss and vote on this Saturday. Two-thirds of the assembly must approve a paragraph for it to be retained. In the past, if a paragraph did not reach even two-thirds, it would not be published. It was said that it did not represent synodal communion. Pope Francis has instead wanted each paragraph of the final document to be published and that votes for or against be indicated together with the paragraph. Beyond the talks about healthy decentrality, the draft document addresses how this decentralization should be addressed. In particular, there is a paragraph that says that in a synodal Church, the decision-making competence of the bishop and of the bishop of Rome is 'inalienable' while proposing some good practices to make the diocesan and parish council representative of all the people of God, women included. Some describe the document as interlocutory rather than definitive. One bishop observed that 'the document allows everyone to manage things as they wish.' But, he added, showing some disappointment, 'So what were we discussing?' If these are the results of two synodal stages in Rome and a three-year journey of dialogue and listening before that, it’s clear that many will be disappointed. There are no revolutions, but rather a call for a change of mentality in the Church grounded in the idea that synodality has always been present in the Church. This will be the starting point for Saturday’s concluding session. After the publication of the final document we will have to wait for Pope Francis to act. The Holy Father could decide to adopt the final document in full as a postsynodal exhortation or he could draft a postsynodal exhortation himself, either before or after the various study groups of experts deliver their final reports in May. In the end, everything depends on the pope.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e591siAvHAKPk	2024-10-24T16:02:15-07:00	
Why Is Prehistory Inspiring So Many Artists? – Analysis	What draws us to such a distant and long-gone time? A fruitful relationship has always existed between prehistory (a scientific discipline constantly refreshed by new discoveries) and the visual artists who interpret it. Prehistory is a modern idea. The word was 'coined' only in the 1830s. Before the 19th century, we didn't know much about dinosaurs or cavemen, and fossils remained a scientific curiosity. When French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon published his notoriousHistoire naturelle(1749–1788), suggesting that nature had a history and proposing the first reproduction theory, the faculty of theology at the Sorbonne University in France condemned it and threatened him with repercussions. He eventually had to publish a retraction. Similarly, when Charles Darwin (1809–1882) published hisOn the Origin of Species(1859), his compatriots in the United Kingdom and Europe still believed that God made man 'in his own image,' as stated in the Bible (Genesis 1:27). Anyone claiming that all animals came from the same origin, and apes were somehow our distant cousins, was considered a fool or a heretic. Then the first caves were excavated revealing extensive and intricate artwork on their walls. In 1879, archeologist Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola explored a new cave in Altamira, northern Spain, and brought his young daughter, Maria, with him. She spotted vivid depictions of bison and masterfully painted scenes on the cave's ceiling. These cave paintings were initially dismissed as forgeries, as scholars of the time, with the positivist mindset,could not imagine that people from the Paleolithic were sophisticated enoughto produce such complex artworks. By the early 20th century, however, as archaeologists uncovered more ancient skeletons, bones, fossils, and early human art in caves and other sites, their discoveries started to raise curiosity beyond the scientific community. Writers, intellectuals, and the public were captivated by these glimpses into our distant past. Artists were intrigued, sometimes amazed by the mind-blowing quality of parietal art, indecipherable, complex abstract shapes and objects, and what was perceived as scenes depicting animals and humans in rituals or sacrifices. The drawings, paintings, and etchings that endlessly decorated the walls, ceilings, and floors of caves in subtle colors were often mesmerizing. Picasso was particularly inspired by various prehistoric elements, as the 2023 exhibitionNo Past in Art: How Prehistory Inspired Picasso's Workat the Musée de l'Homme in Paris showed. Gauguin, Cézanne, and later the symbolists and primitivists, also dedicated various paintings and sculptures to what they perceived as representations of our origins, rituals, and myths. Prehistory has never stopped inspiring artists since then, captivating the most important modern art figures like Jean Arp, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee, Joan Miró; Joseph Beuys, Louise Bourgeois, Jean Dubuffet, Marguerite Duras, Barbara Hepworth, Yves Klein, and Robert Smithson. It continues to be an inspiration among our contemporaries, including Dove Allouche, Miquel Barceló, Tacita Dean, Marguerite Humeau, Pierre Huyghe, and Giuseppe Penone, to name just a few, whose works were showcased during the 2019 exhibition,Préhistoire, une énigme moderne(Prehistory, a Modern Enigma). This landmark exhibition, which took place at the Pompidou Center in Paris, inspired me and initiated my interest in prehistory. It is not the first museum show dedicated to the topic: fossils, artifacts, and artworks discovered in caves, as well as tools, ornaments, and sculptures made from natural rocks, have been exhibited in major art institutions since the end of the 19th century. Most of these exhibitions have already created fruitful dialogues between the past and present and parietal art and its representation by contemporary artists. When it opened its Gallery of Comparative Anatomy and Paleontology in 1898, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris commissioned the sculptor Emmanuel Frémiet and the painter Fernand Cormon to create a vast decorative program.Prehistoric Rock Pictures in Europe and Africaat the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA, New York, 1937) showed monumental surveys of cave paintings with a selection of contemporary works by Miró, Klee, and Ernst, among others, in echo. 'That an institution devoted to the most recent in the art should concern itself with the most ancient may seem something of a paradox,' MoMA's founding director Alfred H. Barr Jr. wrote in his preface to the exhibition catalogue.'Yet, for Barr, this past had already influenced modern art, and could potentially offer museum visitors a prehistoric pedigree for it,'statesthe MoMA website. Another major exhibition,40,000 Years of Modern Art, organized by Herbert Read and Roland Penrose at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1948, mixed prehistory and non-Western art with surrealist, expressionist, and abstract works. But there is a major problem, particularly, concerning the so-called 'primitive art,'—a highly contested term now. The clichés and stereotypes that this notion implies were also abundant in the early 'scientific' literature dedicated to our ancestors. The first paleontologists were poisoned by plain racist prejudices,explainspaleo artist and authorMark P. Wittonin his 2020 blog. George Cuvier (1769–1832), the father of vertebrate paleontology whose famous taxonomy incorporated both fossils and living species, 'viewed whites as the pinnacle of creation, but Blacks as ugly, barbaric persons of monkey-like appearance,' writes Witton. 'His work on dividing humans into 'scientifically validated' races was instrumental in later attempts at biological justifications of racism.' In the United States, the influential president of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857–1935) was a supporter of Hitler. He exploited his research to promote racist and eugenicist ideas,points outWitton. Osborn commissioned one of the earliest depictions of prehistoric life, Charles Knight's mural 'Neanderthal Flintworkers' (1924), hung in AMNH's Hall of the Age of Man. Many of Osborn's contemporaries, including Margaret Mead, weretroubled by the racist character of the imagery. The faces and looks of the Neanderthal men and women depicted in this iconic—though controversial and scientifically incorrect work—were inspired by features of non-white peoples, instead of being deduced from their bones. A Eurocentric mindset has continued to characterize the collective representation of prehistory until recently, sometimes reducing it to a more subtle form of 'primitive art.' In 1984, MoMA dedicated a survey exhibition to'Primitivism' in 20th Century Art. MoMA bragged about being the first institution to 'juxtapose modern and tribal objects in the light of informed art history.' But the exhibition omitted dates of the Indigenous works and explanations of their functions, as art historian Thomas McEvilly remarked in hisArtforum review of the show. He criticizedPrimitivism in 20th Century Artas expressing 'Western egotism still as unbridled as in the centuries of colonialism and souvenirism.' Since then, the museum has made itsmea culpa, addressing thecontroversyon its website. The Pompidou exhibition's three curators, Cécile Debray, Rémi Labrusse, and Maria Stavrinaki,write on the museum websitethatPrimitivism in the 20th Century Artdid not include prehistory 'which, in fact, is fundamentally different from it. For the modern Western world, the 'primitive' is generally rooted in specific cultures, usually described as exotic; the question of temporality is secondary to its geographical and cultural otherness. Prehistory, on the other hand, is seen above all as an indefinitely stretched time span, and thus largely indecipherable (whether in terms of nature or the first human cultures).' Labrussededicated a book to this paradoxical situation. 'Prehistory is precisely what ispre, meaningout ofhistory,' he told me in an interview in October 2024. It 'radically overturned our dream of mastering linear time, as 19th-century historicism chose to formulate it.' Here lies the paradox that attracts so many artists to prehistory, according to Labrusse: 'Because it is largely indecipherable (whether in terms of nature or the first human cultures), it remains fascinating.' FromPrehistory, a Modern Enigma, I remember the scenography. Tall walls, obscure corridors, grandiose frescos, and a prehistoric cave reconstituted at the center of it. In this spectacular setting, amid fossils, Cro-Magnon skulls, tools, and Paleolithic carvings, there were more than 300 works of art by modern and contemporary artists. Plus elements of popular culture: surveys of archaeological excavations, advertisements, and extracts from books (The Quest for Fire, a hugely popular Belgian 1911 fantasy novel) and cult films such asThe Lost World(1925),King Kong(1933), or2001: A Space Odyssey(1968). This undertone in the exhibitions shows what the curators of the Pompidou exhibitiondescribeas the 'invention of the concept of prehistory.' How artists and society have succumbed to the appeal of origins in the modern era, 'yielding to a fantasized vision of what came before history.' The exhibition opened with Odilon Redon and Paul Cézanne, at the turn of the 20th century. Cézanne was an amateur student of geology and paleontology. He visited prehistoric caves and painted the rocks on the Mediterranean coast with hisclose friendAntoine-Fortuné Marion (1846–1900), who later became a noted geologist and paleontologist. The show also exposed the Venus of Lespugue, the famous prehistoric ivory statuette,dated around 23,000 years ago, which inspired Picasso and Giacometti (both owned plaster casts of it). She stands there, in an exhibition room at the Musée de l'Homme, surrounded by bronzes from Matisse, Miró, and other modern artists who were equally fascinated by her and other statues from that time. 'Préhistoire, une énigme moderne' brilliantly demonstrated how prehistory inspired modernity, an artistic movement that was, paradoxically, about the future. Photos of the 1889 Paris World's Fair show how the Eiffel Tower and various cutting-edge technologies were exhibited alongside Neanderthal skeletons. A Max Ernst painting of 'petrified forests, glacialized landscapes, and sedimented earth,' created after World War I, raised questions about whether these were depictions 'from after humanity, or before it?' as modernism developed toward 'a prehistoric vision of time before humankind,' according to a 2019 New York Timesarticle. This feeling got stronger with the tragedies of World War II when many intellectuals and artists turned their back on the notion of progress, digging in reverse into the beginning of life, extinct species, the first hominids, the lost cultures of the Paleolithic era, and the Neolithic revolution to grapple with the possibility of extinction, of earth without humankind. 'Nourished by archaeological discoveries, but far from simply reflecting on them,... prehistory...[functioning] as a powerful machine for stirring up time,'writethe curators. 'This time machine constantly shapes the mental boundaries of modernity and provides concrete models for all sorts of experiments.' The exhibition also explores the mysteries of shaped rocks and tools, an intimate relationship to animals, ecological issues, and apocalyptic wonder in chronological and thematic parcourse. These themes are part of the collective representation, the idea of what prehistory is and how the inspired artists, whose works were exhibited, felt from Louise Bourgeois, Joseph Beuys, Lucio Fontana, Max Penck, Robert Morris, Robert Smithson in the 1980s, the Chapman brothers, Pierre Huyghe, Tacita Dean, Marguerite Humeau, Dove Allouche, Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, Jean-Pascal Flavien, and Bertrand Lavier in the last few years. 'Prehistory is not an object given to artists to interpret; it is created by them' states Labrusse. 'I think artists are either Paleolithic or Neolithic. I am decidedly the lattersaidminimalist artist Carl Andre, according to the previously mentioned NYT article. HisStone Field Sculpturein Hartford, Connecticut, could have belonged to the Neolithic times. Painters and sculptors sometimes like to experiment with the artistic canons and the tradition of 'getting back to our roots,' to the 'early man,' asa 2024 exhibition at the Hole Galleryshows. 'Based around an out-of-print anthology devoted to prehistoric collections unearthed by archaeological expeditions in Algeria, French artist Camille Henrot's... [Prehistoric Collections] treats this ethnographic material as motifs of a contemporary grotesque,' states the Perimeter Books's website. Meanwhile, Mark Dion's immersive, uncanny installation at La Brea Tar Pits and Museum in September 2024,Excavations, displayed new work alongside 'early museum murals, dioramas, and maquettes of Ice Age mammals in a playful... presentation,' the museum website states. Labrusse recalls feeling 'powerless' when he started applying his scientific skills and methods to prehistoric art (he is a professor of art history atÉcole des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales). 'History requires context, facts, and elements to narrate it. These things are almost nonexistent when one looks back so far behind in time,' he explains. Many social scientists who study prehistoric history testify to a similar challenge. There is little evidence from prehistoric times and huge gaps of time for which the evidence is completely missing. 'Prehistorians have the scientific honesty to recognize an irreducible ignorance, an impossibility of bringing out meaning,' notes Labrusse. 'It is impossible to give a social, political, or aesthetic meaning to these societies.' During apodcast interviewin 2019, he explained feeling first 'like falling into a hole, caught up in an abyss of darkness. Then, as inAlice in Wonderland, you start to see through the looking glass.' For him, the turning point came while exploring a prehistoric cave, a 'very intimate, life-changing experience,' he says during the interview with me. Discovering parietal scenes in the cave of Roucadour, Labrusse felt 'as if they were contemporary. There is no context there, and things seem to float outside of any attributable meaning, so their appropriation is immediate, easy.' I learned this way to 'let go of the burden of history,' which 'dissolved like a soap bubble.' He recalls being tempted to touch these walls, reproducing these same gestures that the first men did back then. 'Science now tells us thatHomos sapienshas been the same for 100,000 years, even 300,000 years. Individuals have the same capacities, even possibly the same feelings as us today.' The limits of science, when confronted with prehistory, are also an opportunity that artists have often seized to contribute to the field in their own way. It gives them a chance to tell this story differently. Aware of this, contemporary prehistorians sometimes invite painters or sculptors to work with them to create interdisciplinary meaning, an epistemology articulating a subjective point of view (art) with an objective approach (science). The French government invited artists Ernest Pignon-Ernest, Giuseppe Penone, and Miquel Barceló, among others, to bring 'Other Perspectives' to theChauvet-Pont d'Arc cave. To understand how a howl decorating the cave had been originally drawn, Barceló recreated first the same wet surface that was used by his predecessor as a canvas 35,5000 years ago. He then drew a few lines like a graffiti artist in less than 10 seconds. His audacious and instinctive gesture was brilliant: the resulting drawing looked remarkably similar to the original one. 'Only an artist can do this with his subjective impulsivity,' comments Labrusse. 'A historian would not have dared to do it, keeping a rigorous mindset in his attempt to reproduce the drawing and, ultimately, failing to do so.' In another style, the notoriousAdrie and Alfons Kennis, twin brothers who are 'paleo artists,' are creating lifelike figures of early man that are touring museums and galleries around the world. Their hominids are fascinating and are another example of what art and science can do when working hand in hand.

Blinken Says ‘Now Is The Time’ To End War In Gaza	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called on Israel and the Iran-backed groups it is fighting in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon to call a truce after the Israeli military said it had killedatop officialfor Hezbollah, a militant group and political party that controls much of southern Lebanon, who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader. 'Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success,' Blinken told reporters as he prepared to leave Jordan on October 23 for Saudi Arabia on a tour of the region for talks on how to bring the current fighting to an end. Late on October 22, Israel said Hashem Safieddine, a senior figure inside Hezbollah, waskilledin an air strike on the Lebanese capital on October 3, ending weeks ofspeculationas to whether the man expected to take over the group was alive. The previous Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in Israeli air strikes in Beirut on September 27.Safieddine headed Hezbollah's executive branch, which oversees the group's political affairs. He was also a member of the decision-making Shura Council as well as the Jihad Council, which runs the group's military operations.The United States designated Safieddine a terrorist in 2017. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by Washington, although the European Union has only blacklisted its armed wing. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament. The current war between Israel and the Iran-backed groups Hezbollah and Hamas -- which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union -- was triggered after Hamas militants made an incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people. They also took some 240 people back to Gaza as hostages.Israel has since launched a withering offensive that, according to the Hamas-led Heath Ministry in Gaza, has seen almost 43,000 people killed while displacing virtually all of Gaza's 2.3 million people.Israeli forces have killed many senior figures from Hezbollah and Hamas, including the Palestinian militant group's leader, Yahya Sinwar, who was suspected of being the mastermind behind the October 7 attacks. Sinwar waskilled last weekby the Israeli Defense Forces, prompting senior officials from the United States and other Israeli allies to seize on what they see as an opportunity for a new scenario for the region. Israel has also been under pressure from many allies, including the United States, for the rising number of civilian casualties in Gaza as a result of the war, and accusations that it has been hindering aid supplies to the territory, where hundreds of thousands are living in a growing humanitarian crisis. 'The focus needs to be on getting the hostages home, ending this war and having a clear plan for what follows,' Blinken said on October 23.Neither side, however, appears prepared, at least publicly, to seize on the so-called opportunity Blinken and others say is there for the taking.Just hours before Blinken spoke, the Israeli military leveled a suburban Beirut building that it said housed Hezbollah facilities. The strikes and a later one that sent thick columns of flames shooting into the night sky came shortly after an Israeli military spokesman issued evacuation warnings for the neighborhood.Another strike came with no warning hitting the nearby office of a pro-Iran broadcaster, the station said. It said the office had been empty since the conflict began. Lebanon's Health Ministry said one person was killed and five others, including a child, were wounded.Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a statement late on October 23 that it had escalated its attacks on Israel, using 'precision missiles' for the first time, and launched new types of drones on Israeli targets.It later said it had targeted an Israeli military factory on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.The Israeli military said four projectiles were identified as having been fired from Lebanon. Two were intercepted and one fell in an open area. There was no immediate indication of any defense facility around Tel Aviv having been hit. Meanwhile, Hamas continues to refuse to release the remaining hostages it holds unless Israel stops its attacks in Gaza.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfH5j0G0v_e58ek8dPn3ySr	2024-10-24T15:54:03-07:00	
Parliamentary Elections 2024: Choice Time For Georgia	By Giorgi Lomsadze (Eurasianet) -- An image of a bombed-out church in Ukraine sits next to a picture of a perfectly intact Georgian church on a large billboard cantilevered over one of Tbilisi’s main thoroughfares. 'No to War, Choose Peace!' the billboard warns drivers and pedestrians that pass under it. Banners that contrast the visuals of the war-ravaged Ukraine to peaceful Georgia hang all over Georgian cities and towns as the nation enters the homestretch to a fiercely fought parliamentary campaign. The message of the incumbent Georgian Dream party, which is responsible for the political ads, is simple: if you vote for anyone else but us, Georgia will become embroiled in warfare. Many Georgians were outraged by the posters that they find preposterous and exploitative. 'They might as well place pictures of their dead [Ukrainian] children next to our live children,' civil rights activist Giorgi Kikonishvili wrote on Facebook. Popular journalist Merab Metreveli described the posters as 'amoral and nauseating.' The Ukrainian government also condemned the use of Ukraine’s suffering for campaign purposes in Georgia. Political parties that are challenging Georgian Dream in the October 26electionssay the scare-mongering tactics are meant to distract voters’ attention from Georgia’s real issues, in particular democratic backsliding, growing isolation from the West and state-capture by the country’s richest man,BidzinaIvanishvili. But the campaign, carefully crafted by Georgian Dream and its foreign PR advisers, does the trick on some voters. 'God knows, I don’t like Georgian Dream as there is not a single, even remotely pleasant person left in there, but I will still vote for them because my main priority is peace for my country, my children and my grandchildren,' said a 60-year-old Neli, who runs a flower kiosk in Tbilisi and agreed to share her voting plans without giving her full name. 'These posters are ugly, but it is also true that they [Georgian Dream] have managed to maintain peace so far, which is more than you can say about any other government we’ve had,' she said. Chiming in on the conversation, a middle-aged male customer said: 'I believe they will continue to maintain peace, not for our sake, no, but for their own sake and for the sake of Bidzina’s [Ivanishvili] millions.' The controversial ads could serve as an illustration of the wholesale political change that has occurred in Georgia in the shadow of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. The nation arrives at the 26 October pollsunrecognizablefrom the Georgia of 12 years ago, when Ivanishvili and his Georgian Dream came to power. Today, all government institutions are in a thrall to Ivanishvili’s personal interests and those interests appear to be at odds with Georgia’s longtime goals of democracy-building and integration with the West. Recent adoption of repressive laws, harassment of civil society, belligerent rhetoric toward the West and threats tobanoppositionparties have all but undone the years of work toward Georgia’s integration in the EU. Partnership with the United States – once Georgia’s top ally and supporter –hangsby the thread. The parties challenging Georgian Dream say that the elections offer a crucial and perhaps last chance to step back from the spiral toward autocracy and international isolation, and the imminent geopolitical volte-face toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia. 'Today, Georgian government is a part of the same threat that Russia poses to the civilized world,'saidAna Natsvlishvili, member of opposition party Lelo. Georgian Dream denies all of this. The party insists that Georgia is still going to join the EU – the stars of the EU flag stubbornly adorn the party’s many campaign posters – but will do so on its own terms. 'To Europe with Dignity,' as the campaign slogan specifies. Yet, at the same time, Georgian Dream makes moves that make Georgiaincompatiblewith the EU membership. The party offers homophobic laws and rhetoric, stokes fears of potential Western-provoked war with Russia, upbraids European ambassadors publicly, attacks democracy watchdogs and demands that the EU accept Georgia with its odd oligarchic rule. 'Georgia-EU relations, unfortunately, are at a historic minimum,' EU Ambassador Paweł Herczyńskisaidon October 22. 'EU leaders have clearly stated that this is a result of the actions of the Georgian government.' Ivanishvili is widely viewed as the guiding force of Georgian Dream and his ideas of how the world works is another can of worms. Ivanishvili is convinced that the West, especially the United States, has a hand in his personal financial troubles. As he fights in foreign courts to recover his assets from the troubled Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse, Ivanishvili keeps insinuating that Washington is somehow preventing him from getting his money back: denials from Washington cannot convince him otherwise. Five days before the vote, Ivanishvili appeared on TV to voice his party’s main campaign points. He accused the West of fomenting conflict and gender confusion around the world, and described his opponents as lackeys of foreign powers. But he also launched into a long account of his legal battles in the courts of Switzerland, Singapore and Bermuda, listing various bureaucratic, financial and legal delays he had faced. Without providing any evidence or any specific connection, he suggested the US authorities are somehow responsible for all these delays. In one instance, a financial expert hired by the defendant, Credit Suisse, took suspiciously long time to do his job, the billionaire said. 'The expert spent two months making calculations that should’ve taken two hours, and he even took a vacation in the middle,' Ivanishvili said. 'This is the reality and so do you still think that I’m imagining things?' Critics variously ascribe Ivanishvili’s conspiracy claims to delusions, or a calculated play. But most agree that the nation and its future are now dependent on one rich man’s personal views and interests. 'He is willing to sell Georgia’s geopolitical orientation for money,' said Giorgi Gakharia, former prime minister-turned-opposition leader. Georgia’s democratic, liberal and pro-EU forces have coalesced around severaloppositiongroupsthat intend to wrest a legislative majority away from Georgian Dream. The nation’s maverick, but ardently pro-Europe president Salome Zourabichvili has emerged as the effective leader of the opposition to Ivanishvili. Although not directly involved in the race, Zourabichvili has helped forge opposition’s unity around the goal of unseating Georgian Dream and getting Georgia back on track toward European integration. 'A new Georgia is coming,' Zourabichvili told a pro-EU demonstration in Tbilisi on October 20. 'Today, here are Georgians who are joining Europe in a peaceful, dignified and Georgian way,' she told a cheering crowd. The crowd at the demonstration was massive, illustrating Georgia’s strong desire to remove Ivanishvili from power. But the outcome of the election remains up in the air. Georgian Dream has its own support base, and also holds considerable sway over public-sector employees across Georgia. The party may still earn more seats than any individual opposition group, but the opposition parties can coalesce and, through a shared majority of votes, exclude Georgian Dream from governance. The wild card in this election is whether voting will be deemed free and fair. Fears of vote manipulation and reluctance to accept results are very much in the air.

Malaysia’s Confusing Foreign Policy – Analysis	Anwar’s non-appearance at the Kazan BRICS meeting raises some interesting questions When Malaysian prime minister Anwar Ibrahim announced and personally thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invitation to personally join the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, this was a clear message that Malaysia was pivoting towards the economic and trading based block. Traditionally, Malaysia has espoused itself as a non-aligned nation with sympathies towards Muslim nations, it considered as brothers. Under prime minister Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysia took in humanitarian refugees from Bosnia during the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995. Malaysia’s stance was somewhat critical of US policy. However, Malaysia voted in the United Nations Security Council (Malaysia was a rotational member at the time) for military action against Iraq in the first Gulf War during 1990-1991. While prime minister, Najib Razak tilted Malaysia towards China, attracting investment in a number of Belt and Road (BRI) projects. One of the Barisan Nasional partners, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) became very close to the CCP United Front at the time. When Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022, he very quickly announced that he saw Malaysian coexisting and cooperating with all nations in a multi-polar world. Anuar’s first trip was symbolically made to Saudi Arabia, and he later quickly travelled to Turkey during the earthquake in February 2023. Later in March 2023, Anwar made what was portrayed in the Malaysian government-controlled media as a highly successful trip. Interestingly enough, Anwar never visited the White House during his tenure as prime minister. However, while Malaysia’s non-alignment in a multi-polar world was publicly espoused, Malaysia had been cooperating with the US in surveillance flights over the South China Sea. The largely unreported Ops Hadir, originated during the Ismail Sabri Yaakob administration, and continued under Anwar. Ops Hadir is conducted between the Research Division of the Prime Minister’s Department, also known as the Malaysian External Intelligence Organization (MEIO) and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in areas adjacent to Sarawak has been very beneficial to Malaysia as Chinese Coast guard operations are frequently occurring in the area. This indicates Malaysia’s continued cooperation with US intelligence. The Kazan BRICS Summit The September 5 announcement by Anwar Malaysia would seek membership of BRICS came as a welcome surprise to many in Malaysia, who see the distinct economic and trade benefits. Although it was well publicised that Malaysia was seeking BRICS membership, where Bernama the official Malaysian news agency stated Malaysia was prioritised for BRICS membership, the Russian media contradicted this. RT on October 3, clearly indicated that Malaysia was not seeking membership of BRICS, this time round at least. Observers really don’t know whether Anwar’s absence is because of this, or whether he had not been formally invited as a national leader to the summit. Malaysia’s presence is very low key. Economy minister Rafizi Ramli is attending to summit to deliver a speech at a coordinated conference (BRICS Outreach), running parallel to the summit. While Anwar is not attending the BRICS Summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisel bin Farhan Al Saud is leading the Saudi delegation, Pham Minh Chinh Prime Minister of Vietnam, Recap Tayyip Erdogan President of Turkey, President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran, Abiy Ahmad prime minister of Ethiopia, and a large delegation from Palestine led by President Mahmoud Abbas, the executive committee of the PLO and five ministers are attending the summit. This doesn’t include the leaders of 24 other nations at the summit. Some suspect Anwar’s recent meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on October 10, on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting in Vientiane has something to do with his decision not to attend the BRICS Summit. This can only be speculation, but those advocating this point, look to Anwar’s very strong relationships with leaders within the Washington establishment, who supported him strongly during his days in opposition. Malaysia’s foreign policy appears to be driven by relationship under Anwar Since Anwar has become prime minister, there have been two foreign ministers in the relatively low ranked cabinet portfolio. Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir was replaced by Anwar with UMNO vice president Mohamad Hasan, after heavily public criticisms of Anwar’s visit to Saudi Arabia where he failed to secure a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Saman Al Saud, and China where there were criticisms over the authenticity of the reported RM 170 billion in direct foreign investment Anwar secured during his visit in April 2023. One can get a glimpse of Anwar’s foreign policy judgements with the differences in his reactions towards the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a pronounced good personal friend of Anwar, and the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, just recently, which was much more low key. That clearly indicates that Anwar’s personal relationships play some role in the foreign policy decisions he makes. The implications of this can be clearly seen in the approach many nations are making towards the issue of Palestine. Russian President Putin warmly welcomed the President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas as the legitimate leader of Palestine. Even though the Palestinian National Authority has an official embassy in Kuala Lumpur, all Anwar’s government efforts have been focused upon Hamas. While the BRICS summit is in play, there are calls for Anwar while Malaysia is chair of ASEAN in 2025, to go on and lead the global. BRICS is clearly taking up this role now. There can be a lot of truth that many of Anwar’s announcements on foreign policy, particularly during his numerous overseas trips are aimed at domestic consumption than actual long-term policy. Under Anwar, as it has been during previous administrations, foreign policy will continue to be more ad hoc than ideologically based. Only this time, observers will be able to see where Malaysian foreign policy stands through Anwar’s personal relationships.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd0NgXJ5ecW8jJIJpcVaipe	2024-10-24T09:48:15-07:00	
Indonesia And BRICS: Balancing Economic Opportunities With Geopol...	The recent meeting of BRICS (comprising Russia, Brazil, China, India, and South Africa) in Kazan in October 2024 has significant implications for the evolving dynamics of global governance. As there are increasing demands for a multipolar world to counter Western hegemony, BRICS has emerged as a critical platform for nations aiming to reshape global power structures. Indonesia, recognized as Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is meticulously evaluating the benefits and risks of joining BRICS, with an emphasis on enhancing its global influence while adhering to its longstanding policy of non-alignment. This essay analyzes how Indonesia could derive benefits from economic, political, and technological cooperation within BRICS while concurrently confronting challenges associated with its geopolitical position and commitments to ASEAN. The potential outcomes of the Kazan meeting—particularly concerning the expansion of BRICS membership—situate Indonesia at a pivotal crossroads between its traditional non-aligned posture and the prospect of adopting a more proactive role in international affairs. Economic Cooperation: Prospects and Pitfalls Indonesia’s aspiration to join BRICS is largely motivated by the bloc’s potential to facilitate economic diversification and resilience. As BRICS member countries grapple with vulnerabilities stemming from Western-dominated financial systems, the bloc is actively pursuing strategies to diminish dependence on the US dollar and Western markets through initiatives such as currency swaps and intra-bloc trade agreements. For Indonesia, these initiatives represent a substantial opportunity to fortify its trade relationships with emerging markets while mitigating its reliance on conventional Western partners. Membership in BRICS would also provide Indonesia with access to the New Development Bank, enabling the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects, and thereby delivering a crucial impetus to national development. However, the economic benefits are accompanied by potential drawbacks. Indonesia’s extensive trade ties with Western economies, notably the European Union and the United States, could be jeopardized if Jakarta aligns too closely with BRICS. Given that Western nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and maintained strained relations with China, Indonesia must navigate this landscape judiciously to avoid compromising its economic connections with these essential markets. Furthermore, joining BRICS could complicate Indonesia’s position within ASEAN, as it would necessitate a careful balancing act between regional cooperation and participation in a bloc that occasionally operates in contradiction to ASEAN’s principles of neutrality and non-interference. Geopolitical Alignment: Balancing BRICS, ASEAN and Politics BRICS presents an attractive platform for Indonesia to assert its leadership on the global stage. As the group advocates for a multipolar world order, Indonesia could amplify its voice in global governance, contributing to discussions on key issues such as global security, climate change, and economic inequality. Furthermore, membership in BRICS would allow Indonesia to strengthen ties with China and Russia, two major global powers that possess significant strategic interests in Southeast Asia. However, Indonesia’s entry into BRICS poses substantial diplomatic challenges. Indonesia’s foreign policy, which is deeply rooted in non-alignment, could be tested by BRICS’ more assertive political stance. For instance, BRICS has expressed varying degrees of support for Russia amid the Ukraine conflict, a position that may conflict with Indonesia’s emphasis on peace, dialogue, and non-intervention. Moreover, Indonesia’s leadership role within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) could be compromised, as ASEAN has traditionally prioritized regional consensus and neutrality. If Indonesia joins BRICS, it risks being perceived as aligning with a bloc that occasionally challenges Western-led international norms. The delicate balance between these two roles—being a leader in ASEAN and a BRICS member—will require Indonesia to maintain diplomatic flexibility, ensuring that its engagement with BRICS aligns with both its national interests and regional responsibilities. Technological Innovation: A Path to Development One of the most promising areas for Indonesia’s potential collaboration within BRICS is technological innovation. The bloc has made significant strides in promoting digital currencies, cybersecurity, and advanced research and development (R&D). As Indonesia aims to enhance its digital economy and technological capabilities, BRICS could provide a platform for greater cooperation in these domains. Joint R&D initiatives with BRICS nations could accelerate Indonesia’s progress in key sectors such as fintech, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, enabling the country to catch up with more technologically advanced nations. Nevertheless, the technological benefits of BRICS membership are contingent upon Indonesia’s capacity to scale up its technological infrastructure. While BRICS can offer partnerships and support, Indonesia will need to invest significantly in its digital infrastructure and workforce development to fully leverage these opportunities. Additionally, Indonesia must navigate the geopolitical dimensions of technology cooperation. As Western nations increase scrutiny of BRICS technology initiatives—particularly those led by China and Russia—Indonesia may face pressures to limit its engagement in certain technology partnerships within BRICS. Cultural and Social Cooperation: Power, Soft Diplomacy and Economics Beyond geopolitics, BRICS provides Indonesia with an opportunity to enhance its soft power through cultural and social exchanges. As a member of BRICS, Indonesia could engage in educational and cultural initiatives designed to foster greater understanding among member states. Such exchanges would enable Indonesia to project its cultural influence on a global stage, thereby strengthening its image as a diverse and inclusive society. However, Indonesia must also navigate cultural differences within BRICS, particularly given the varied political systems and societal norms of the member countries. By promoting its values of democracy, pluralism, and tolerance, Indonesia could position itself as a cultural bridge within the bloc. Concurrently, Indonesia needs to exercise caution to avoid compromising its principles while engaging with BRICS members who may adhere to different governance and human rights standards. Recommendations In deciding to join BRICS, Indonesia should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of its strategic priorities. First, Indonesia must ensure that BRICS membership aligns with its economic objectives of diversification and technological advancement without jeopardizing its relationships with Western markets and ASEAN. Second, Indonesia should advocate for diplomatic flexibility within BRICS, maintaining its non-aligned stance while contributing to the bloc’s broader geopolitical objectives. Finally, Indonesia must invest in its technological infrastructure to maximize the benefits of cooperation with BRICS in innovation research and development. Conclusion The BRICS meeting in Kazan in October 2024 represents a pivotal moment for Indonesia as it deliberates on joining the bloc. While BRICS offers Indonesia opportunities for economic diversification, geopolitical influence, and technological cooperation, these advantages must be weighed against the potential risks of alienating Western partners and straining its position within ASEAN. To succeed within BRICS, Indonesia will need to maintain a careful balance between its national interests, regional responsibilities, and global ambitions. Ultimately, Indonesia’s participation in BRICS could enhance its position in a multipolar world, provided that it effectively navigates the challenges of alignment and cooperation.

Bangladesh And Pakistan Pay The Price For Rejecting British Const...	Bangladeshi public intellectual Afsan Chowdhury says that constitutional transfer of power eludes Bangladesh and Pakistan because these countries failed to imbibe the constitutional norms of British rule, unlike India and Sri Lanka. Even 53 years after becoming an independent country, Bangladesh has not developed a stable system of transfer of power from one government to another. Bangladeshi public intellectual Afsan Chowdhury says that constitutional transfer of power has been eluding Bangladesh and Pakistan because these countries failed to imbibe the constitutional norms of British rule, unlike India and Sri Lanka. Bangladeshi Governments have been shaky, fearing either the restive masses or the powerful military. Even military rulers were insecure because of factionalism within the ranks, which was often violent and murderous. From 1971 to 1990, governance was patently undemocratic. The very first Bangladeshi regime led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was anything but democratic. It was also violently overthrown by a faction of the army in August 1975. But Sheikh Mujib's removal did not bring stability. There were two more military coups in 1975. Finally, Army Chief Gen. Ziaur Rahman took over and restored order assuming full power in 1977. Zia purged the army of revolutionary, leftist and pro-Mujib officers. However, Zia put Bangladesh on the geopolitical map of South Asia,by founding SAARC, Islamizing the country, and moving close to Pakistan in preference to India. In 1978, he created the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to compete with Sheikh Hasina's pro-Indian Awami League in elections. But his intolerant streak crushed dissent had bred intolerance inturn. He was assassinated by a faction of the army in 1981. Zia was replaced by another military dictator, Gen. H.M.Ershad. Hecontributed to Bangladesh in the field of economic development. But he was a dictator. A massive all party agitation forced him to quit in 1990 handing over power to a non-party Caretaker Government. In the 1991 elections, the BNP led by Khaleda Zia got 30.81% and the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina got 30.03%. But under the First Past the Post System, BNP won more seats and formed the government with Khaleda Zia as Prime Minister. The Awami League demanded that Bangladesh switch from the Presidential to the parliamentary system with the Prime Minister as the Chief Executive. Accordingly, the BNP government passed the Twelfth Constitutional Amendment, which restored the parliamentary form of government. After 15 years of military rule, Bangladesh appeared to be on the way to becoming a democracy with a broad consensus on governance. But anxieties about the neutrality of electoral institutions and the need to sustain patron–client relations fuelled political antagonism and violence. Ruling parties attempted to weaken the opposition through human rights violations. In 1994, the Awami League accused the ruling BNP of political thuggery and held mass protests, strikes, and blockades demanding anon-partisan Caretaker Government that would ensure free and fair elections. The BNP argued that such an unelected body would be unconstitutional. The Awami League boycotted the February 1996 elections. So, unopposed, the BNP was back in power. But BNP rule was unpopular. It was forced to submit to the Awami League's demand for a Caretaker Government to conduct elections. Parliament passed the Thirteenth Amendment for this purpose. In the June 1996 re-elections, under a Caretaker Government, the Awami League won. Ahead of the 2001 elections, the Awami League handed over power to a Caretaker Government. The BNP won the 2001 elections. But the BNP regime was unpopular. In 2006, ahead of the 2007 elections, political turmoil erupted. The BNP and the Awami League locked horns over choosing a candidate to head the Caretaker Government before fresh elections could take place. In October 2006, President Iajuddin Ahmed declared himself head ofthe Caretaker Government, and announced that elections would be held in January 2007. However, on January 11, 2007, Army Chief Lt General Moeen Ahmed staged a military coup .He formed a military-backed Caretaker Government with Fakhruddin Ahmed, an economist, as its head. President Iajuddin Ahmed remained President of the country. The Fakhruddin Ahmed's Caretaker Government launched an anti-corruption drive imprisoning several prominent politicians, including Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia of BNP. This alienated the public. In the 2008 elections, the Awami League was swept to power. In June 2011, the Awami League dominated parliament passed the Fifteenth Constitutional Amendment, which abolished the Caretaker Government system. As a consequence, the BNP boycotted the parliamentary elections in January 2014. In January 2015, antagonisms between political partiesdrew Bangladesh into yet another round of intense violence. The Awami League accused the BNP of terrorism and arrested over 10,000 opposition activists. Over 60 people were killed.The BNP then felt that there was no option but to boycott elections all elections not conducted under a new Caretaker Government. Thus, Bangladesh came to be run as a de-facto one-party Awami League government under Sheikh Hasina. This lasted till August 2024. The absolute power that Hasina acquired, corrupted her absolutely. In the absence of a functioning opposition party, the BNP having been crippled by arrests of its leaders, the aggrieved masses had to take the law into their hands and unseat Hasina. On August 5, 2024, following a month and a half long widespread agitation in which more than 1000 were killed, Sheikh Hasina fled the country. The university student-led mass movement was meant to restore democracy. But till date, it has not been restored. Parliament was dissolved and MPs fled for their lives. A Council was formed to advice President Mohammed Shahabuddin, with Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus as Chief Advisor. The Advisory Council is planning structural reforms through six committees. It has ruled out elections before reforming the system. But democracy lovers said that this is putting the cart before the horse. The whole purpose of the protest movement was to restore democracy and take decisions on the basis of consultations and not postponing elections. Recently, President Mohammed Shahabuddin threw a spanner in the works, when he told Matiur Rahan Chowdhury, the editor of 'Manab Zamin' that he had 'no documentary evidence of Sheikh Hasina's resignation.' The President told Chowdhury that he was expecting Hasina to call on him and submit a resignation letter on August 5. Butthe Army Chief Gen.Waker-uz-Zamam came instead and said that Hasina had left the country. The President's interview to Manab Zamin was interpreted to mean that he deemed Sheikh Hasina to be Prime Minister of Bangladesh still, and that the interim government and the Council of Advisors lacked legality. Some even darkly hinted that the President, having been an appointee of Sheikh Hasina, was part of a plot to bring her back and thwart the move to drag her before the Bangladesh War Crime Tribunal to answer serious charges. Others said that this was army's move to bring Hasina back because the Editor of Manab Zamin is 'close' to the army and Army chief Gen.Waker-uz-Zamam is a relation of Hasina's. Those who had agitated for a month to oust Hasina stormed the Presidential palace 'Bangababon' calling for Shahabuddin's resignation. The police opened fire injuring at least three youngsters. The Law Advisor in the Council of Advisors declared President Shahabuddin as being unfit to hold the high office. Eventually, President Shahabuddin apologised for what he said. But to his credit he never said that the successor Interim Government led by Muhammad Yunus is illegitimate. As a jurist himself, Shahabuddin knew that Bangladesh courts had, multiple times in the past, legitimized governments that had come into being by unorthodox means like a military coup. Challenges to state authority in Bangladesh have generally stemmed from the inability of institutions to adequately ensure power sharing and consensual decision making. Political will for electoral reform has been elusive because an alternative system might dim the prospect of controlling state resources for personal benefit. Greed has become the basic motivation in Bangladesh politics. According to Bangladeshi public intellectual Afsan Chowdhury, if constitutional transfer of power continues to elude Bangladesh, it is because it had not adopted the constitutional values British rule had given India and Sri Lanka. India and Sri Lanka had faithfully adopted the British legacy while Pakistan and Bangladesh charted a different path.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcboBDWImDqhXLCA9Q3uRBm	2024-10-24T09:44:33-07:00	
China, Russia, North Korea And Iran Described As New ‘Axis Of Evi...	By Xiaoshan Xue U.S. officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the emerging partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – a bloc being talked about by some in Washington as a new 'axis of evil.' Those worries got a major boost on Wednesday with confirmation by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a trip to Rome that North Korean troops are now present in Russia, presumably preparing to participate in Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Just days earlier, Russia was a participant in naval drills hosted by Iran. China, North Korea and Iran all have supported Russia's war machine in different ways during its war on Ukraine. Iran has provided missiles and drones. North Korea has sent artillery shells. And China has provided dual-use technology and industrial products, including semiconductors and drone engines. 'We've seen the emergence of Axis of Evil back in the late 1930s, 1938, 1939. We saw what the world did at that particular point to come together,' said Republican congressman Rob Wittman, vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during an online discussion last month hosted by the Center for a New American Security. 'We find ourselves at that same crossroads today where we have nations that do not believe in the same things that we believe in, do not believe in the rule of law, do not believe in protecting the rights and dignity of human beings.' In 2002, former U.S. President George W. Bush used the term 'axis of evil' in his State of the Union address to describe countries supporting terrorism, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. More recently, it is being applied in Washington to describe China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken describes these four countries as revisionist powers. He wrote that a fierce competition to define a new era of international affairs is under way, and a few countries are determined to change the basic principles of the international system. 'While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome,'Blinken wrotein the November/December issue of the publicationForeign Affairs. Wittman does use the term 'Axis of Evil' and said the countries involved are more capable of destabilizing the world than were Nazi Germany and its allies in 1939, especially as they cooperate and share technology at all levels. 'So, as you look at drones that have been taken out in Ukraine, you find Chinese printed circuit boards in there, Chinese systems on board those drones,' Wittman told VOA. 'You also see the arms that are being fired into Ukraine from Russian artillery pieces are being manufactured in North Korea. You see the drones that are being used by Russians in the battle space there are being manufactured by Iran.' He also said the new partnership is learning from the Ukrainian war at a rate that keeps pace with the times, gaining capabilities that cannot be achieved in normal testing and development processes in a peaceful environment. 'The biggest difference in the 2024 Axis of Evil is that at least three of the four countries are in expansionist mode,'wrote Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation earlier this year. 'They want much more land and power. And they are coordinating their efforts to benefit each country’s goals. It’s a very dangerous development.' Matthews told VOA this group is working to create a largely self-sufficient economic zone — out of both necessity and desire — that does not rely on Western economies for survival. Christopher S. Chivvis, a senior fellow and director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told VOA that China is key to the strength of the four-way relationship. 'If China were not part of this four, it would look like three countries that are highly isolated from the world cooperating with each other. We would have much less to worry about. It's China's participation in this grouping that is really has the potential to make it very problematic for the United States,' he said. Chivvis added that the four countries can use a crisis in one region to launch a war, coordinate actions, or create chaos in another. For example, Chivvis lays out a more extreme version of this scenarioin his recent report— were China to attempt a military operation against Taiwan, Russia might seek to take advantage of the strain on U.S. resources with an even more aggressive military campaign in Ukraine or even with an incursion into NATO territory. Similarly, a major escalation with Iran in the Middle East that draws in more U.S. naval and air forces could also embolden China to take a more aggressive approach to Taiwan. 'It would be difficult for these four countries to sign a formal treaty that would commit them to doing that kind of thing, but you can see it emerging spontaneously or organically out of a crisis situation,' Chivvis said. And a crisis in one region can spill over to another part of the world. 'If you look at, for example, the Gulf Arab states, they're critical energy suppliers to both China and Taiwan,' said Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'If you look at Iran, Iran has the capabilities we've seen through proxies like the Houthis to disrupt international waterways. So, to think that a conflict over Taiwan will be restricted to the Indo-Pacific is, I think at this stage, simply naive and ignoring.' Blinken describes the relationship among the four countries as 'largely transactional,' adding that their cooperation 'entails tradeoffs and risks that each may find more distasteful over time.' 'And yet all four revisionists share an abiding commitment to the overarching objective of challenging the United States and the international system,' Blinken wrote. 'That will continue to drive their cooperation, especially as the United States and other countries stand up to their revisionism.' Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcboBDWImDqhQLaPCXiUbt3	2024-10-24T09:43:10-07:00	
Japan Goes To Polls: Political Instability Feared – Analysis	After succeeding Fumio Kishida as the Prime Minister of Japan, Shigeru Ishida called for a snap election on 28 October 2024. But it soon dawned on him and the ruling coalition government that his popularity rating had dramatically plummeted. With several opinion surveys indicating that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito coalition could possibly lose its majority. If that actually happens, what could be the possible strategy for the LDP? One possibility is the LDP might rope in a third party to form a government. A total of 233 seats are needed in the 465-seat chamber for a majority. When it was dissolved on 9 October, the LDP held 256 seats and Komeito 32, for a total of 288. But the public backlash over an LDP-centered slush funds scandal has put the ruling bloc’s 55 seat majority in jeopardy. An opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun daily suggested the final tally for both parties could be less than 233 seats, prompting questions over what would happen next in such a scenario. The poll said that 33 per cent of voters support the Ishiba Cabinet, which is lower than the support rate for the previous Kishida Cabinet in 2021. This was against 39 per cent endorsed by the non-supporters. In a speech delivered on 15 October, Ishiba promised to release 'new economic policies'. But the poll revealed that 53 per cent said they do not have high expectations for Ishiba’s economic policies as against 24 per cent expressed optimism. In a similar survey conducted in 2021 before the previous Lower House election soon after Kishida became the Prime Minister, 42 per cent expressed support for Kishida, while 31 per cent said they did not support. However, 45 per cent said they did not have high expectations for Kishida’s economic policies. In the latest survey, twenty-eight percent of voters who said they do not support the Ishiba Cabinet chose the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Eleven percent selected the Democratic Party for the People, and 10 percent picked Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party). Interestingly, sixty-three percent of voters who expressed support for the Ishiba Cabinet and 61 percent of voters who said they have high expectations for Ishiba’s economic policies said they would vote for the LDP. Thirty-two percent of voters said they are greatly interested in the 27 October election, and 66 percent said they will definitely go to the polls. Both figures are at low levels, compared with results of similar surveys between 2005 and 2021. Since the survey methods and targets were different from earlier surveys, a close parallel between the two surveys need not be seen as same indicators. It transpires therefore that the LDP is shaken by low public support rating for the Ishiba Cabinet. The LDP undoubtedly is heading towards unexpected headwinds when polls are held on 28 October. Ishiba seeking forgiveness from the voters for his party’s massive slush fund scandal is not going to help him or the party. Like the Asahi opinion survey, there was another survey conducted by the Jiji. Its results announced days before the election revealed that public support for the Ishiba Cabinet stood at 28 per cent. This alarmed many in the LDP since a support rating under 30 per cent is said to signal that the administration is in the 'danger zone'. Just a month ago, when Ishiba won the LDP Presidential race on 27 September, Ishiba was the top pick for the next prime minister but public expectations soon faded. This was solely because of the peoples’ frustration with the unabated criticism of the LDP over the fund scandal. Viewed critically, the scandal does not seem to be the only reason for Ishiba's low initial rating. It was even lower than the previous lowest starting rating since 2000, which was 33.3% marked by former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's Cabinet just after its April 2000 launch. What worked against Ishiba is that during the LDP presidential race before he became Prime Minister, he made bold proposals but soon wavered over key issue. This was a major reason of the trust deficit as revealed by the survey. In a quirk of political misfortune for Ishiba, after being elected as the LDP president and thereby becoming the prime minister, his honeymoon period seems to have already expired. Ishiba made mistakes. Much against his promise for full-scale debates with opposition parties at the budget committees of both of Diet’s chambers he closed the extraordinary parliamentary session without any such debates. He promised to strengthen financial income taxation and introduce a selective dual surname system for married couples, but he soon back-peddled on contentious issues. Thus, besides the slush fund scandal, Ishiba’s wavering stance and unclear statements led to the decline of public support for his Cabinet. These raise the spectre of the LDP losing its single-handed majority in the Lower House. As indicated by the surveys, maintaining a majority together with Komeito could be a tough call for Ishiba. If the LDP loses many seats, public support for Ishiba's Cabinet is likely to fall. With fragile power base Ishiba could be heading towards a critical moment. From all indicators, it seems to emerge that the LDP is heading towards an electoral bleeding. After trying for five times for the LDP presidential bid, when he finally won, the veteran Ishiba was seen as a fresh face but he could quickly end up being a forgotten one. The red alert signals are already sounding in Tokyo’s corridors of power. Ishiba’s hasty call for snap election now seems to backfire. If the LDP fails to keep a majority, it could be difficult for Ishiba to hold on to power with its long-standing coalition partner Komeito. As said in the beginning, a new partner needs to be searched, which would mean more compromise and slow decision-making. Though such a possibility may not happen given the opposition’s weak political base, it would not be unthinkable either. If that happens, it would be the first time in over a decade when Japan shall enter into a phase of political instability and revolving prime minister.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf13_asNBrtabsp7eEW8h66	2024-10-24T09:40:18-07:00	
Report Shows NASA’s $75.6 Billion Boost To US Economy	NASA's work, including its Moon to Mars exploration approach, is advancing science and technology for the Artemis Generation, while also driving significant economic growth across the United States, the agency announced Thursday. In its third agencywide economic impact report, NASA highlighted how its Moon to Mars activities, climate change research and technology development, and other projects generated more than $75.6 billion in economic output across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., in fiscal year 2023. 'To invest in NASA is to invest in American workers, American innovation, the American economy, and American economic competitiveness,' says NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'Our work doesn't just expand our understanding of the universe — it fuels economic growth, inspires future generations, and improves our quality of life. As we embark on the next great chapter of exploration, we are proud to help power economic strength, job creation, scientific progress, and American leadership on Earth, in the skies, and in the stars.' Combined, NASA's missions supported 304,803 jobs nationwide, and generated an estimated $9.5 billion in federal, state, and local taxes throughout the United States. The study found NASA's Moon to Mars activities generated more than $23.8 billion in total economic output and supported an estimated 96,479 jobs nationwide. For investments in climate research and technology, the agency's activities generated more than $7.9 billion in total economic output and supported an estimated 32,900 jobs in the U.S. Additional key findings of the study include: Every state in the country benefits economically through NASA activities. Forty-five states have an economic impact of more than $10 million. Of those 45 states, eight have an economic impact of $1 billion or more. The agency's Moon to Mars initiative, which includes the Artemis missions, generated nearly $2.9 billion in tax revenue. These activities provided about 32% of NASA's economic impact. The agency's investments in climate change research and technology generated more than $1 billion in tax revenue. Approximately 11% of NASA's economic impacts are attributable to its investments in climate change research and technology. NASA had more than 644 active international agreements for various scientific research and technology development activities in the 2023 fiscal year. The International Space Station, representing 15 countries and five space agencies, has a predominant role in the agency's international partnerships. In fiscal year 2023, NASA oversaw 2,628 active domestic and international non-procurement partnership agreements, which included 629 new domestic and 109 new international agreements, active partnerships with 587 different non-federal partners across the U.S., and partnerships in 47 of 50 states. NASA Spinoffs, which are public products and processes that are developed with NASA technology, funding, or expertise, provide a benefit to American lives beyond dollars and jobs. As of result of NASA missions, our fiscal year 2023 tech transfer activities produced 1,564 new technology reports, 40 new patent applications, 69 patents issued, and established 5,277 software usage agreements. Scientific research and development, which fuels advancements in science and technology that can help improve daily life on Earth and for humanity, is the largest single-sector benefitting from NASA's work, accounting for 19% of NASA's total economic impact. Thestudywas conducted by the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement at the University of Illinois at Chicago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf13_asNBrtaYGaAZ49YBuA	2024-10-24T09:37:41-07:00	
AUKUS Partners Complete Successful Tests Of Autonomous And Networ...	In a significant development for maritime security, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom (AUKUS) have completed successful tests of several autonomous and networked systems during a three-week maritime experimentation called Autonomous Warrior 24 in Australia, the US Department of Defense said Thursday. The event was part of the Maritime Big Play (MBP) initiative and ongoing efforts to develop AUKUS Pillar II capabilities, a trilateral collaboration to improve maritime awareness through networked autonomy, decision advantage, and enhanced strike. The Maritime Big Play is a series of integrated trilateral experiments and exercises that are enhancing capability development, improving interoperability, and increasing the sophistication and scale of autonomous systems in the maritime domain. Australia led the Autonomous Warrior event, the signature MBP event in 2024. Other events associated with Maritime Big Play included the Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping Augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems (REPMUS); and Technology Readiness Experimentation (T-REX). Through these experiments and exercises, AUKUS partners are further testing and refining the ability to jointly operate uncrewed maritime systems, share and process maritime data from all three nations, and provide real-time maritime domain awareness to support decision-making. 'Autonomous Warrior/Maritime Big Play creates a unique opportunity for our three countries to work together, which will ultimately improve operational efficiency and allow us to work more cohesively against common threats,' said Heidi Shyu, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale.' The technologies tested during the October event support operations from deep under water to the edge of space. This included software-defined acoustic modems, multi-model autonomous underwater and surface vessels, and low-cost attritable unmanned surface vehicles. The tests also featured a low-cost gondola, which supports operations in the upper stratosphere with minimum manpower or logistics requirements, and T-200 high-altitude balloons, which provide resilient communications in denied environments from the stratosphere. A versatile and robust software-defined network architecture called Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC) was tested for its ability to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments. The Common Control System (CCS) was also featured in the exercise, built on an open architecture to provide uncrewed vehicles hardware and software that works across several different systems. This effort supports future work to create an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing best elements of the three countries’ existing systems. 'AUKUS partners have long histories of working together on defense and security issues, and have deep, enduring partnerships based on shared values, said Shyu. 'By investing in novel and innovative capabilities directly aligned to AUKUS mission priorities, as well as making future advancements in emerging technologies like AI and Quantum, we support a more stable region — one where all nations are empowered to make their own sovereign decisions free from coercion — a world that centers on hope for the opportunity and prosperity of the future.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf13_asNBrtaSsAGWefyARB	2024-10-24T09:35:29-07:00	
Kaab’a And Jerusalem Temple Mount Linked By Holiness – OpEd	There is a Holy Link between the Muslim Kaab'a and the Jewish Jerusalem Temple. Shamefully, politicalized religious leaders have turned sacred sites in both India and Israel into battlegrounds for their brand of religious exclusivity. Yet an ancient Jewish legend predicts that when the Messiah comes and resurrection day occurs; the Kaab'a in holy Mecca, will go to join the Temple Mount's Foundation Stone in holy Jerusalem, bringing the inhabitants of Mecca, and they shall be joined together. When the Foundation Stone sees the Kaab'a approaching, it shall cry out, 'Peace be to the great guest'. (Zev Vilnay, Legends of Jerusalem) The Muslim Kaab'a in Mecca was a very ancient ruined holy site that was rebuilt under God's direction by Prophets Abraham and his oldest son Ishmael. The Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was built on a site God chose for an offering of Prophet Abraham's youngest son, and built by Prophet Solomon the son of King David, more than four centuries after Prophet Abraham. There is a wonderful legend that explains what linked these two sacred sites that had become holy to the descendants of the two sons of Prophet Abraham. 'Two brothers who inherited a valley to hilltop farm from their father, divided the land in half so each one could farm his own section. Over time, the older brother married and had four children, while the younger brother was still not married. One year there was very little rain, and the crop was very meager. The younger brother lay awake one night praying and thought. 'My brother has a wife and four children to feed and I have no children. He needs more grain than I do; especially now when grain is scarce.' So that night the younger brother went to his barn, gathered a large sack of wheat, and left his wheat in his brother's barn. Then he returned home, feeling pleased with himself. Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake praying for rain when he thought: 'In my old age my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, as well as grandchildren to enjoy, while my brother may have no children. He should at least sell more grain from his fields now, so he can provide for himself in his old age.' So that night, the older brother also gathered a large sack of wheat, and left it in his brother's barn, and returned home, feeling pleased with himself. The next morning, the younger brother, surprised to see the amount of grain in his barn seemed unchanged said 'I did not take as much wheat as I thought. Tonight I'll take more.' That same morning, the older brother standing in his barn, was thinking the same thoughts. After night fell, each brother gathered a greater amount of wheat from his barn and in the dark, secretly delivered it to his brother's barn. The next morning, the brothers were again puzzled and perplexed. 'How can I be mistaken?' each one thought. 'There's the same amount of grain here as there was before. This is impossible! Tonight I'll make no mistake - I'll take two large sacks.' The third night, more determined than ever, each brother gathered two large sacks of wheat from his barn, loaded them onto a cart, and slowly pulled his cart toward his brother's barn. In the moonlight, each brother noticed a figure in the distance. When the two brothers got closer, each recognized the form of the other and the load he was pulling, and they both realized what had happened. Without a word, they dropped the ropes of their carts, ran to each other and embraced.' God looked down at the two brothers thinking 'Their love and concern for each other has made these two places worthy of becoming a linked holy sanctuary. Someday their descendants will each build and rebuild a holy House in this valley and on this hill. Very few Jews and Muslims realize that for more than 1,000 years, while Jerusalem's First and Second Temple--Bait ul Muqaddas-Beit HaMiqdash stood, the Jewish festival of Hag Sukkot was celebrated as a Hajj, a pilgrimage festival. The Hebrew word Hag comes from hagag to circle; and the Arabic word Hajj literally means 'to set out for a special place'. For Muslims, the Furthest Sanctuary is located in Jerusalem. 'Glory to He Who carried His servant by night, from the Holy Sanctuary to the Furthest Sanctuary, the precincts of which We have blessed. So that We might show him some of Our signs. Surely He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. (Qur'an 17:1) It is significant that the ruins of the Jerusalem Temple was the site of Prophet Muhammad's ascension—miraj-- up to the heavens. The Kaa'ba built by Abraham and Ishmael, was some centuries later polluted by the introduction of idols. Some centuries later King Solomon built a Temple on the site where Prophet Abraham bound Isaac as an offering. Then four and a half centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed by the Babylonians. It was then rebuilt only to again be destroyed some centuries later by the Romans (in 70 CE), who would later pollute the whole site with a Roman city whose buildings and streets were filled with idols. One might say the destruction of the Furthest Sanctuary center of monotheistic pilgrimage in Jerusalem by the pagan Romans, was five and a half centuries afterward overcome by Prophet Muhammad's ascension-miraj up to the heavens, and the soon to be realized removal by Prophet Muhammad of the 360 idols around the paganized Kaa'ba (Holy Sanctuary) in Makkah. The Prophet Zechariah envisions a future time when God helps humans establish worldwide peace. All the nations in the world then may travel to Makkah and Jerusalem to worship God in peace. It is important for Muslims to realize that during this prophesied future Hajj Sukkot, the future city of Jerusalem (without a physically rebuilt Temple) will welcome both Jews and non-Jews, just as it did in the days when Prophet David (before King Solomon built the Temple) wrote in his Zabur: 'I rejoiced with those who said to me, 'Let us go up to the house of the LORD...There the (12) tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, as it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 122:1-4) Orthodox Jews still pray for the ancient Temple to be rebuilt. But Reform Jews stopped doing that two centuries ago. The place is holy; not the building. This is the feeling of the great majority of Jews today who are not Orthodox Jews. Just as the Kaa'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. So, when all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Adam and Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. This narration, transmitted orally in both Arabic and Hebrew for many centuries, was finally written down in several versions in the 19th century. Jews believe the hill is Jerusalem. Muslims believe the valley is Mecca. I believe, God willing, someday we all will see both beliefs as correct. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (Qur'an 16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. The Qur'an states: 'For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in prayer). So hasten towards all that is good. Wherever you may be, Allâh will bring you together. Truly, Allâh is able to do all things.' (2:148) The commentary/Tafsir of al-Jalalayn states: 'Every person, of every community, has his direction/qibla, to which he turns in prayer, so compete with one another in good works; strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together, gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.' Now, which way you face during community prayer, is not the most important thing. The Qur'an (2:177) tells us: 'Righteous is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but righteous is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, the Prophets; and gives wealth in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives Zakah; fulfilling their promise when they promise; and are patient in poverty, hardship and during battle. These are the ones who have been true, and it is these who are the righteous.' Prophet Zechariah in chapter 14 foresees a day when many gentiles will celebrate Sukkot alongside Jews, not by building booths on their diaspora residences, but by converging annually upon Jerusalem to worship God—a time when 'Adonaiwill be one, and his name one' (Zechariah 14:9). Survivors from the non-Jewish nations flock to Jerusalem annually to observe Sukkot; those who do not are punished with drought; (14:16). 'All who survive of all those nations that came up against Jerusalem shall make a pilgrimage year by year to bow down to YHWH of Hosts and to observe the Feast of Booths.' If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we can help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.On thatdayIsrael will joina three-partyalliance with Egyptand Assyria,a blessing uponthe heart. 'The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWezbJNaVwS7ph7kAreIioAv	2024-10-24T09:32:33-07:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: There Is No Need For AUSSOM – OpEd	A seventeen-year-old operation which has not achieved its goal can only be considered a total failure, which by all standards and common sense, must be discontinued, unless the original goal was not as defined as it is and it is doing a project that is hidden and covert, and it looks likely this is probably the case. It is being renewed under a different name, the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). It is clear that it will not stabilize nor support Somalia but would be doing some other undisclosed mandate. This is the AMISOM project – an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, renamed some two years ago as the African Transition Mission in Somalia and whose mandate is ending on December 31st, 2024. It is the same mission under a different cover. All missions have been authorized by the United Nations Security Council, under again, different UN names. It started as UNSOA in 2009, standing for the United nations Organization Office for AMISOM and was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1863 (2009) to provide logistics support to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which was changed to UNSOS or the United nations Support office for Somalia, following the adoption of resolution 2628 (2022) on 31 March 2022, which brought in ATMIS in the place of AMISOM. Somalia can only be supported and stabilized by its own people and citizens but this will happen only when the malignant interventions of other countries stop, and when the Somali citizen realizes that it is time to reconcile and close the old painful pages and move on. Civil wars happen and happened in many countries. They are still happening in other countries at the time of this writing. Neighboring Ethiopia is but a great example. It appears to be going the way of Somalia over the next several decades, anyway. The current mandate of UNSOS as elaborated in the Security Council resolution 2748 (2024), will only add to the continuation of the miseries of the Somali people, whose politicians all vie to be the receiving party of the aid coming from other nations, the main culprit at the center of the problems of Somalia – the aid and grants from donor countries. Many of the local politicians have stopped working for the nation long ago and vie and compete for being the Somali parties receiving the assistance on behalf of the Somali people and pocketing it along with the UN and AU missions in the country, while the resources of the country are being exploited by others or being prepared for others to take. It is why such names as support systems and stabilization programs for Somalia do not hold any such meaning for Somalis. They know that such support has not been given to them and will not reach them anyway. So why do donor countries pay these monies to NGOs including the world’s large organizations such as the United Nations and the African Union? It is known that both organizations only fatten their administrations and have not achieved their mandates anywhere, except perhaps in the very beginning of each organization when sentimental issues were driving their creation. That they were not able to build a functioning Somali government with its policing forces, its military forces and its functioning administration throughout the country is unbelievable and unworthy of further discussion through a span of some seventeen years (17). The irony is that they still repeat that they support and stabilize Somalia, which is simply a ploy to receive donor monies and fatten their administrations and the salaries of their large staff at the expense of the Somali people. The UNSOS was to help create a Somali National Army (SNA) of some10,900 soldiers in 2013. This was expanded to be some 20,900 Somali soldiers including police forces at both the federal and state levels. But apparently this has not happened. If they have done their job, there would not have been any need for extensions or change of missions involving foreign soldiers. The terror element and terrorists in the country have increased since the entry of international forces into the country. There were no terror groups before IGADSOM, which was replaced by AMISOM and was further replaced by ATMIS and is now being replaced by AUSSOM. The terror activities only increase when the mandates of these missions are coming to an end. Is the terror and terrorism in the country a function of the presence of foreign forces in the country? It could probably and possibly be so, and if so, then there is no need to renew the mandates of these missions. There would no terror or terrorism in the country and Somalis would live with what they have. Some ask themselves how different AUSSOM could be from its predecessors? This is an irrelevant question for they would not be different. ATMIS was not different from AMISOM and AMISOM was not different from IGADSOM. UNSOS is not different from UNSOA. These are all same forces with fancy names doing the same jobs. At the end of the new forces mandate, we may still be hearing the same arguments. The argument would be the same. Somalia will need to be supported and the UN and the AU along with whatever administration is in the country at that time, will all agree to have a new force to replace AUSSOM. Another fancy name with a new abbreviation would be brought on to the table and perhaps would be approved. Why are these unworkable programs being rehashed and reshaped? It must have to do with money, which makes the world turn and spin, when it comes into the picture. The African soldiers in Somalia earn much more in Somalia than in their countries and much, much more than a Somali soldier in his own country. This is, indeed so, because they are endangering themselves on behalf of Somalis and putting their countries on the goodwill of the world’s multilateral organizations – the UN and the AU and the European Union, which pays for most missions. This is far from the truth for they do not help Somalia and Somalis and are exposed less than a poor Somali soldier who is not paid enough to feed his family and is asked to do most of the fighting in the country. The UN and the AU and the Somali government all know this! Should there have not been the presence of these foreign soldiers, there would probably be no terrorism. The terror groups use the presence of these foreign soldiers, most of them from neighboring countries, which have still many issues to grind with Somalia, as the raison d’etre for their existence. Perhaps, this should be taken seriously unless the terror groups themselves represent, as they seem to be, another face of the foreign intervention in the country, to exploit the resources of the country. In either case, there seems to be no need for AUSSOM or for that matter, any such force in Somalia. The UN and the AU both failed Somalia. They failed other countries too. The DR Congo mission is coming to an end and the Malians put an end to the UN mission there. What makes the UN believe that they can succeed in Somalia? They will not and the AU will not. Somalia and Somalis should be left alone to their wiles. They will find their way to stabilize themselves and live together as they always used to do in the leopard-colored country of theirs, in the very Horn of Africa States region. The previous missions failed for if they succeeded there would be no need for the creation of a new mission. Things would have been settled long ago and Somalia should have been standing on its feet taking into considerations the billions of United States Dollars that are claimed to have been spent on the country, which did not happen. The terror groups are still present in the country and have increased their terror activities since we are getting closer to the end of the ATMIS mandate. The international community, if it is genuinely supporting Somalia, should not approve the presence of foreign forces in the country. Somalia should be working to govern itself and make bilateral arrangements with other countries which can really help it to stand on its feet but should not seek any UN and African Union help and support. These are toothless and corrupt bureaucrats who cannot change one iota of any country. A discontinuation of the AU mission of Somalia will also put an end to the disputes between Ethiopia and Somalia and between Kenya and Somalia with respect to territorial and other claims. Each country will have to stay in its turf as per international law. Neighboring countries should never have been allowed to participate in peacemaking operations in countries with which they have a lot to grind. Kenya and Ethiopia are such countries when it comes to Somalia. It was a mistake as Kofi Annan, the Ex-UN Secretary General warned Kenya in 2011 not go into Somalia. He further noted that it is always better in peacekeeping not to use the soldiers of neighboring countries but soldiers from further afield. Kenya’s operation 'Operation Lindi Nchi' or Protect the Nation of 2011 was not in line with the United Nations charter, which prohibits the use of force in international relations. Perhaps this is what Ethiopia, another neighboring country of Somalia, is currently thinking, to invade Somalia as soon as the ATMIS mandate ends to supposedly protect its country from the terror groups which itself appears to have armed and weaponized against their own government. The AUSSOM operation to start on the first day of 2025 and last until the end of 2028, will make the AU mission in Somalia last from 2007 to 2028, a long period of failures and corruption at the very highest levels of international governance in the world. Why would a mission last that long unless there is corruption at the very highest levels?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO1SEd2L15neTHqhU8ytQd	2024-10-24T09:30:53-07:00	
How Can Security Vulnerabilities Revealed By TUSAŞ Terror Attack ...	The attack on Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) headquarters in Ankara Kahramankazan on October 23, 2024, was seen as a serious threat to Turkey's defense industry. The tragic event, which resulted in the loss of five lives and left 22 injured, highlighted significant security failures. Senior officials emphasized that the attack directly targeted Turkey's strategic defense capabilities. Causes of the Security Lapse One of the primary issues was the hesitation of security personnel during the attack regarding how and when to respond. This uncertainty revealed a lack of adequate training and preparedness. Additionally, the delayed review of surveillance footage and the failure to activate early warning systems underscored shortcomings in the security protocols, particularly in addressing current threats. The ineffective use of technology and the absence of preventive measures before the attack pointed to a serious security gap. Recommendations for Addressing the Security Vulnerabilities Training of Security Personnel:Security staff must undergo regular training to prepare for threats. Physical and psychological resilience training, as well as developing quick decision-making and calm response skills during crises, are crucial. Technological Improvements:Security cameras and early warning systems should be upgraded with more advanced artificial intelligence-supported systems. This will make it easier to detect unusual activity before an attack and enable quicker responses to potential threats. Physical Security Measures:The security surrounding critical defense industry facilities should be enhanced. Higher walls, electronic barriers, and intrusion detection sensors can make it more difficult for potential attackers to reach the facility. Integration of Internal and External Security:Defense industry facilities should not only rely on internal security but also maintain constant communication with intelligence agencies. Sharing intelligence on terrorist threats is essential for preventing attacks before they occur. Regular Security Drills:Periodic security drills are necessary to identify and address security weaknesses. These exercises will test the readiness of personnel and evaluate the effectiveness of technological systems. Comprehensive Threat Analysis:Security policies should take a proactive approach to address not only existing threats but also potential new ones in the future. In addition to terrorist groups like the PKK, digital threats such as cyberattacks must also be considered. The TUSAŞ attack has highlighted the critical importance of securing Turkey's strategic defense facilities. Implementing these recommendations to address security gaps will ensure a safer environment for the defense industry and help prevent similar attacks in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfM_RTOEUjIGinuBJxanUmg	2024-10-24T09:29:04-07:00	
How To Think Impossibly: Towards A Scientific UFOlogy – OpEd	People believe impossible things because impossible things happen to people. You don't need to believe any of the belief systems that build up around such extraordinary experiences to acknowledge that the experiences in fact happened. If there is indeedtruth to astrology, then I think it's axiomatic that we are wittingly or otherwise in touch with other 'universals', beings from the elite of all those trillions of stars around us. Impossible? Given our Cartesian thinking, yes. The unknown otherworldiness behind any such communication—and there is lots of evidence that something unknown and otherworldy is going on—requires impossible thinking. During the past two 'scientific' centuries, but in fact going back to the time of Plato, we have accumulated a huge amount of inexplicable, impossible personal experiences of otherworldly phenomena, events. The first recorded near-death experience was told by Plato inThe Republic, the myth of Er (why 'myth'?), the account by soldier left for dead who awakens on the funeral pyre 12 days later, and gave a detailed account of his time there, much like those who survive a lightning strike or a near-death experience today. You've never heard of Er? Neither had I. Like the thousands (millions?) of UFO experiences, it is ignored, dismissed, blotted out. Our monotheisms were founded on such sightings, such 'myths' – Ezekiel's wheels, Elija's departure in a fiery chariot. Kripal tries to put some epistemological order into what to date is a junkyard straight out of a sci fi movie by Lem,Stalker II. This requires wrestling withthe nature of consciousness, belief, reality itself.All of this happens because of altered states ofconsciousness. So we begin with consciousness, which we don't understand, but can fiddle with usingpsychedelics to open a door in the mind to interact with actual entities through hallucinations.Or discipline using religious ritual. Both license and discipline can achieve states of consciousness that defy reality. 1/ Before we get to the little green men, we must deal withprecognitive events, which transform the entire order of knowledge upon which our present culture depends, the sciences included. They are well documented though left as bizarre footnotes rather than given the attention they deserve. My interest in all this is prompted by my own precognitive nightmare predicting my father's sudden death a few months later. Looking back now, it indeed transformed my life, though I was clearly moving towards these changes unconsciously. Who knows? When you have such an experience, it is one to respect. They call into question: the practice of history (time goes both ways), the history of religions (divination is globally distributed, relies on human abilities), the philosophy of mind (consciousness and cognition are not stuck in the present skull cavity or this temporal slice of a body), causality itself (agency can act from the future). linear time vs block time.i Documented testimonies from Zora Hurston (12 predictions ending with Mrs Osgood Mason), Kipling, Twain, Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Tolkien, Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Lem, Philip K Dick. Schopenhauer coinedWahrtraumen(dreaming the truth) to describe his many precognitive dreams that contained perfectly precise and banal details about the next day's events. 2/ Second on the list of weird things is lightning. There are many instances of survivors who have had an after-death experience, where they could choose to stay or return (though warned that would be painful). Coppola's Youth without Youth (1976) is based on Mircea Eliade's last novel, explaining time, consciousness, and the fantastic foundations of reality. The novel follows the life of Dominic Matei, an elderly Romanian intellectual, Eliade's hero-doppleganger, who is struck by lightning, which allows him to live a new life with startling intellectual, paranormal, capacity, anamnesis,ii instant recall. Kripal befriended one of these lightning survivors, Elizabeth Krohn, struck by lightning in 1988. She was gone two weeks in afterlife time, but only a few seconds eastern standard time. She became a celebrated children's author, and was notable for blowing out lightbulbs in her presence, getting a phone call from her deceased grandfather, and precognitive dreaming of major historical events. 3/ Lightning leads us tonear-death experiences (NDE). From Plato's Er to the popularization of climbers' testimonies in the 1890s and the explosion of literature in recent years, with better scientific equipment and knowledge of the brain providing more explanatory power. 4/ Which brings us to the little green men andabductions, visitations. This is not just a space age phenomenon. Abductions are integral to all religions. The form of alien is insectoid, the vehicles space age long before airplanes. They are too many, too intensely experienced, too similar for all to be frauds. 5/ And finally religions. Lourdes, Fatima, Our Lady of Guadaloupe, Maria do Agreda (the Lady in Blue). Islam is a world of the seen and unseen, with jinns and angels in constant communion with humans and God. To Vaeni, they are 'midwives birthing us out of our egos.'iii Left/ right hemisphere duality If anamnesis is possible for many (most? all?), then we can conceive of a new humanity with a more evolved psycho-mental life, with encyclopedic recovery of the past, through a regime of concentration which allows direct access to the wealth of information of the past. Even if this is possible only to a small adaptive elite, then these humans can be considered evolved mutants, harbingers of a new post-historic superrace. We have two domains, material and mental, mediated by the imagination. Duality got a bad name with Descartes. Mind-body, subject-object. Brain research settles the matter with left-right hemispheres as digital-analog, the left cold and rational, the right so otherworldly (holistic, pictorial, atemporal). We know now that our current dismissal of Descartes' 'ghost in the machine' to be just a bad case of throwing the baby soul-spirit out with the materialist bathwater. It turns out the bathwater doesn't even exist (in our quantum world), that the only reality we know for sure is Descartes 'I think', or rather consciousness itself, so we now must apologize to poor baby, dust him/her off and try to figure out how to educate him/her to become that inner-outer superperson, subject-object together. i.e., the bathwater gets an honorable mention.All this involves impossible thinking, reliance on imagination that is mediating, translating and expressing something superreal, surreal. The Catholics have lots of 'freakish folk', documented by fellow UFOlogist CarlosEire. They are in fact the main event, however embarrassing. Two centuries ago, before secular materialism took hold, they were mainstream, though just accepted as miracles. We still hear about such freaks, but only in scandal sheets. Think of a religious eccentric like St Teresa of Avila (d 1582), who levitated uncontrollably during mass or whenever. This ability to levitate is mentioned in one sentence in Wikipedia as if embarrassing, but is central to her life and sainthood. (She was embarrassed and prayed that it would stop, which it did.) The 17th century Fransciscan friar Joseph of Cupertino (d 1663) experienced miraculous levitation and ecstatic visions throughout his life, famously perching on delicate limbs of olive trees, which made him the object of scorn. He was rejected then reluctantly admitted to the Franciscan Order. His superiors tried to hide him away in a remote monastery but the people came to relish his miracles. He was canonized a century later, having narrowly escaping the Inquisition. Kripal suspects such weirdos see and know asif revealed to them by some other form of mind or intelligence that is also them in some paradoxical quantum sense. Such a form of mind uses the cultural bits and pieces that are lying around to express itself. Strugatsky'sRoadside Picnic,Lem'sStalker.We confuse the bits and pieces (thrown plates, flying saucers) with whatever message, meaning is intended. Lots of hermeneutics. Just as we canreconsider astrologyin our age of computers and orbiting telescopes, we can amass the thousands of weird otherworldly experiences documented and try to 'break the code', put the weirdos in context and use imaginationandreason to shape a technology that combines our mind-body duality in an all-purpose monism. The impossible emerges from a knowing place before and beyond the subject/object split, in ourAge of Separation. Towards a scientific UFOlogy We can start with 'experience' vs 'event'. There is nothing without me-us in the middle. That nonmaterial 'I-me' is now back at the center, pre-Copernicus and post-Einstein. The universe is conscious and so are we. We live in a participatory universe. The cosmos is conscious. Yikes! our tiny (but egotistical) ego protests. The impossibleness is a function not of reality but of our own present social constructions, perceptions. In reality space, time and mind are all one. Past, present and future are all one big, fat 'thing', block time, constantly interacting outside of us. Future is already present in past, just as notes of musical phrase though played successively persist together in the present and thus form a phrase. In a sense, music creates historical time. Our sense oflineartime is a neurological illusion produced as we experience ourselves moving through this eternal and unchanging spatiotemporal block, like a 4-D worm wiggling out from conception to its disappearance in death. Mystical experiences point at the truth, give the impression that past, present and future exist together in an Eternal Now. Kripal argues our nonphysical mind processes are ultimately centered on a monistic ground (Godhead?), beyond time-space, that your physical emanation is the confused, neurotic, superficial chattering time-space version of the real you. Quantum mechanics and mystical literature speak to the different sides, the same deeper reality, one 'from the outside' (physics), the other 'from the inside (mystical). Bohr and Schrodinger turned to comparative mystical literature to make human sense of what the quantum mechanics implied. Modern physics and psychics have been reflecting each other from the start. Quantumness redefines 'real'. Kevin: 'Reality is what two or more can experience together.' Subject-object, mind-matter melt away in our most elevated (or deepest) connections with the Other. The Matrix is a good starting point, where physical objects 'out there' are merely icons on the screen of our virtual reality game of perception that lets us maneuver through the world, survive, reproduce and so 'win' the game. Fitness beats truth.iv We evolved to 'win the game', not to perceive reality as it really is. The Matrixplot centers on aliens using us as a power source, a fuel, but Kripal points to some abduction experiences to suggest cold, insectoid aliens get off on our flashy inner worlds, full of very colorful flights of fancy. It is our Godlike consciousness that is so special. We are like babies with joy sticks and a hard drive beyond our ken, but now, Kripal argues, we have matured enough to do both—win the game and perceive reality as it really is—as part of a newScience of Man. Kripal sees hints of the new science not only in weird experiences, but in myths, religions, the humanities, which are in fact inspired by past weird experiences. Consciousness is not to be dismissed as an afterthought to materialist science. It is the center of our science, with our factoid obsession really only playing a subordinate role. Contact events, especially shamanic, are a passport to the cosmos, inhabiting an actual third space neither objective nor subjective. As with all scientific revolutions, a new paradigm is taking shape. Kripal uses new terms to shake us up. Learn-with, experiencers. The weird things straddle both natural science events as well as humanities-type experiences. To think impossibly is a kind of return to origins (mystery, miracles) smarter, more jaded, wiser. His mentors include Nietzsche, and Husserl with his transcendental phenomenology, not Heidegger and Sartre's material atheistic version. And Henry Corbin (d 1978), Henry James, Frederic Meyers, and Karl Jung. Corbin, through his study Iranian Shia mysticism, posited the human as bi-unity, a paradoxical complex of the conscious person and the largely unconscious, superconscious angelic twin. He combines imagination and reality, the socially active and mystically transcendent, with theangelic twin, doppleganger. We function in a material world according to a nonmaterial alter-ego (which we berate, occasionally compliment). The point ultimately is to align your mind with the universal mind. Stoicism. The outer you and its angelic twin do not always appear together in ways that we can appreciate. They work in different dimensions and scales, horizontally (in our five sense dimensions) and vertically (other dimensions, spiritual). Kripal was raised a Catholic and both deplores the Protestant reformation and the loss of the sacred that Protestantism ushered in with the Renaissance and rise of Science. Our angelic twin lost its moral compass, leaving behind only the confused chatterer. Eire documents how ruthless religions were to persecute weirdos, witches and homosexuals (50,000 witches executed gruesomely from 1400-1600), though a handful like Teresa of Avila and Joseph of Cupertino managed to dodge the bullet. He respects religion (not so much religions) as an important vehicle for the weird, but is an important figure in Esalen, where he launched his book Esalen (2008) with the subtitle America and the Religion of No Religion. 19th century romanticism reveled in a revolution of consciousness. The literature of the period was full of striving to transcend. Coleridge focused on Ezekiel's wheel in the sky. But scientism left no room and it was not until Raymond Moody's Life after Life (1975) that serious consideration began. As an undergraduate at the University of Virginia in 1965, Moody encountered psychiatrist, Dr. George Ritchie, who told Moody about an incident in which he believed he had journeyed into the afterlife while dead for nearly nine minutes at the age of 20. Life after Life became a bestseller and was translated into numerous languages. Christians were not happy as there was no hell or creedal requirement for salvation. So we witnessed the reenactment of past inquisitions, though now, without deadly consequences. Kripal is keen to formulate a new methodology, starting with *The use of altered states of consciousness as generators of a philosophy of mind and a truly scientific modeling of the physical cosmos.v *Theexperience-source hypothesis, that basic religious convictions are cultural reworkings of a recurring set of direct experiences and not just reworkings of indirect historical contexts or psychosocial constructions. Experiences are direct, embodied connection with the Real, which can be ordinary things, but perceived with heightened awareness, not our regular 5-senses surface perceptions. Whatever presences interact with humans, it is through our imagination, i.e., our consciousness. Reason is mostly impotent. Language and grammar something of a joke (Derrida). The senses are not reliable. They evolved for other much more practical and adaptive reasons. Clearly the imagination shows every sign of being capable of affecting physical objects and events, even the workings of space and time, toward some symbolic meaning or communication. *Perennialismincorporates a global phenomenology of religious experience, comparing them to determine real differences and genuine similarities. *Thegardenis a central symbol, always appearing in heightened NDEs, hinting at Eden as the Alpha where we began and the Omega whence we return, a portal, gate. *Kripal likes to'think-with'hisexperiencers, emulate, empathize, adopt, mix their thought with his. As I read, I realized why I/many are fascinated by the Middle Ages. People took for granted spirits, jinn, angels. I.e., people intuited, believed there were other forces at work than those we can 5-sense-with. Religion is an evolutionary adaptation to what are occult or hidden presences. We lost religion and our awareness of this hidden world, became the hostage of materialist science, which literally killed all the jinn when we desacrilized the universe, so we no long have access to channel them. I have always been suspicious of facts, number-crunching, as missing the point. Facts are boring, soulless, but life is exciting, full of …life! Over my lifetime, science has matured to acknowledging that weird idea. Some more ideas for a new epistemology: *Kripal asserts that laughter is essential to the new way of being/ thinking. His heroes,Stuart Davis, Jeremy Vaeni and experiencer Kevin all insist that laughter is philosophically important. It makes fun of and so transcends the silly social ego. Impossible thinking involves not just a thinking-with but also a laughing-with. *There can be no communication from a distance (tele-), much less a shared emotional entanglement (-pathos) unless something fundamental is shared, i.e.,love. A subjectivity cannot possess another subjectivity unless they share the same basic nature. The demon is human too. We intuit this in education, the teacher drawing out the unconscious knowledge, the student draws out the inspiration of the teacher, both connecting in love. *Corbin understood that theimaginal worldwas a noetic organ/place or intellectual-spiritual capacity that was mediating an actual dimension of reality, Jung'screative imagination, a mythmaking dimension of consciousness, where myth and symbol happen, where they are true, where visions occur and the spiritual body is resurrected. Aphenomenology of revelation. Humans are a bi-unity, the human person accompanied by an angelic twin who mediates between our dimension and the other(s). *A sign is a simple referent, arbitrary and ultimately meaningless, whereas asymbolparticipates in that which it expresses, an anthropomorphic hang-up, a projection, a mishmash of culturally determined signs. Gospel of Philip: Truth did not come into the world naked but in symbols and images. It is implicitly religious, revealed, supermeaningful to us. Without us/some listener listening for the symbol, there is no sound. Words are experiences. Symbols are not God, who cannot be imagined, but neither are they products of reason. They are consubstantial with the truths of which they are the conductors. Wolfson: no naked truth. truth can only appear to a human in form of an image, through a veil. Profound truths cannot be clean and clear. Only narrative, symbol, image, poetry. To insist on clarity is to replace one set of standards on another, a form of tyranny. The problem, not the solution. We need both sides of the brain firing at once and in concert, talking together through reason and imagination, rational clarity and intuitive symbol. Words are experiences. 'Real' must be 'imagined', embody meanings and subtilize the sensory thing, bring it to life. Corbin's imaginal follows Christian Docetism, that the incarnation should be treated symbolically, not literally, which agrees with the Quranic passage about how they did not really kill Jesus but another person or an appearance. Once you accept that weird is not so weird, that flying plates, crucifixion are indeed facts but we haven't figured out what theymean, that the world, world history is full of impossible things, the messy details of religions take on less import. The message is the message. The symbol is true. Kevin: Humans are analog/digital processing units for the cosmic unconscious of platonic surrealism. The digital interface was under darwinian evolution at first, but now with the modern world, it's becoming self-directed evolution. Better yet, we are like shortwave radio transmitter-receivers. There is a shared but largely unconscious experience-source hypothesis, a 'gnostic spirituality' that is universal. Different sets of cultural materials resonate so strongly because they are all based on the same kinds of human experiences, which themselves correlate very strongly with a shared neurobiology or human mind.vi The right hemisphere mediates Mind to the left hemisphere which constructs and projects the rational ego as a still-evolving and now self-directed cosmic interface. We must move back to right hemisphere-dominant as at birth. The otherworldy role of brain is to mediate and translate Mind. This is how one becomes the universe, because one already is the universe.vii If you manage to go offline, turn your whiny social ego off, then a deeper or higher form of being might appear (Real Awareness) entirely independent of your biology. Awareness of the whole by the whole. Awareness as the fundament, the ground of impossible thinking. But too much of this and you are a nutcase, schizo, autistic. That's why 'God hides.' Platonic surrealism: Platonic for insistence on a deeper level of truth and reality, surreal for the wildly symbolic, irrational, nonrational, and playful ways it expresses its endless possibilities.viii Vaeni suggests that the aliens might be us from another time, dropping in to help out, with hints that the laws of physics are not really laws 'but actually mere suggestions.'ix Guardian angels? He excuses their flying plates as happening from different times, 'coming into space and time from outside space and time.' We need to think of time hermeneutically, block time (me/you from dust to dust), stop blocking out meaning 'with our crap including our intellectual crap.'x Vaeni thinks that we speak and imagine the aliens into existence. We let them in, as it were. This is about as hermeneutical as it gets: they are real, and they are here because we believe they are here. We speak them into existence, so that they can speak us out of existence.xi As for the practicality of Kripal's project, the idea of an elite superperson (thank you Neitzsche) makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. Nature is full of hierarchy and misfits. The most intriguing in human society is the stable 5% of males who end up homosexual. Hardly an elite, but the evolutionary purpose still defies explanation. Other misfits, also more for the more complex males, include schizophrenia, color blindness, autism. Are these just faulty evolution or do they have hidden meaning? Kripal focuses on autism as a possible evolutionary step towards nonhuman intelligence, devoid of messy emotions. Again, not all autistics, as there are many reasons for autism. He speculates about the rocketing rates of autism coinciding with the sharp rise of alien abduction experiences. Finally, for those of us who can't boast of possessing direct gnosis,xii we can still use our intellect, hermeneutical sympathy to others and texts, to explore our dreams, relish the gnostic experiences and mystical thoughts of past experiencers, ponder the magical unknown as our own dark matter/ energy that we can't usually see but that influences us, begin to believe again in our spiritual guardians, our local aliens, speak them into existence. My favorite Kripal 'proofs': Re little green men, in Zimbabwe in 1994, the otherworldly craft and its alien occupants appeared to a group of more than 60 racially diverse school children (no abductions). There's a documentary Ariel Phenomenon (2022) linking it to their African ancestors. Re time travel, John Allison. Saw male in red shorts outside his basement window at night. Voice in head 'you're going to be okay.' 4 yrs later after illness, depression, feeling better, saw light in apt as he came home and saw his younger self inside. He remembered his vision and came up to the window and sent him that feeling of love and comfort. Consciousness is expansive. Here a meaningful sign of a future form of consciousness trying to take shape. Re telepathy, Karin Austin. Her vision ended in an abandoned theme park, the opening in the trees and an old rollercoaster. She later found it in Connecticut with Google maps. It was closed 1992-4. Her vision in 1993. Another unrelated person also saw the same theme park. The imagined is the real. Superphyiscal in hyperdimenionsal ways that we cannot imagine with the three dimensions in which our brains and cognitive capacities have evolved and to which we have culturally adapted.xiii Endnotes: i Time and space is/are not 'out there'. Everything is happening over and over in block time. One gigantic deja vu. i.e., deja vu is a hint at block time. The future sometimes flows back into the present as a kind of apparitional self-guiding adjustment of the meanings of history. ii Originally referring to remembering past lives, but Kripal uses more broadly as 'reading without reading''. Its use exploded from the 1890s. iii Jeremy Vaeni, I know why the aliens don't' land, 2003, 373. iv Donald Hoffman, The Case Against Reality: Why evolution hid the truth from our eyes, 2019. v Jeffrey Kripal, How to think impossibly about souls, UFOs, time, belief, and everything else, 2024, 244. vi Ibid., 91. vii Ibid., 104. viii Ibid., 107. ix Jeremy Vaeni, Aliens: The first and final disclosure, 2022, 149. x Ibid., 259. xi Kripal, op.cit.,, 83. xii Direct spiritual, experiential knowledge. xiii Kripal, op.cit., 199, 89, 150.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9No6l_DJZ_OOB	2024-10-24T09:26:28-07:00	
Ottawa’s Path Forward: Are US-Driven Tariffs Undermining Canada’s...	Canada’s decision to impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, with 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum to follow, reflects a critical moment in Sino-Canadian relations. From Beijing’s perspective, these measures are not merely economic sanctions - they represent a broader alignment of Canadian policies with those of the United States. Historically, Canada had pursued a more diversified trade policy, leveraging China’s economic rise to reduce its reliance on U.S. markets. But recent actions indicate a significant shift. Ever since the U.S. scrapped NAFTA in favor of the USMCA, Canada has increasingly copied American policy, especially regarding China. These tariffs, echoing Washington’s protectionist stance, further solidify Canada’s dependency on U.S. policy directions, rather than forging an independent path in its dealings with China. China’s Ministry of Commerce has called on the WTO to investigate, but the broader question remains - how long will Canada prioritize U.S. interests over its own strategic autonomy? For China, the Trudeau government’s actions are part of a larger geopolitical maneuver, one that risks not only trade relations but Canada’s broader global standing. In this increasingly multipolar world, can Canada afford to be seen as an extension of U.S. policy, particularly when it comes to a powerhouse like China? Canada’s decision to align with the U.S. on tariffs against Chinese electric vehicles, under the urging of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, is a troubling signal for Beijing. While Canada's deep economic ties with the U.S. are undeniable, the speed with which Ottawa complied reveals a dangerous erosion of its autonomy in foreign policy. In a world where diversification is key to economic resilience, Canada's mirroring of Washington’s trade policy is particularly questionable. From China’s perspective, these tariffs - meant to 'protect' Canadian manufacturers from supposedly unfair Chinese competition - are little more than a knee-jerk response to American pressure. The tariffs, especially on electric vehicles, are not just economically unsound but strategically harmful. They expose Canada’s much smaller economy to retaliation, without the cushion of a diversified trade portfolio. Experts within Canada's own auto industry are already warning that these measures will backfire, leading to higher costs and diminished market access. Moreover, Canada’s embrace of the U.S. strategy of securitizing economic policy raises further concerns. This practice, which frames trade disputes as national security issues, risks neither bolstering Canada’s security nor enhancing its economic prosperity. Instead, it locks Canada into a punitive approach that diminishes its bargaining power and complicates future diplomatic engagements. For China, the question is simple: why should we engage with a country that so readily follows another’s lead? Canada must reconsider if this path truly serves its long-term national interest. Canada’s decision to impose heavy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles reveals much about its shifting allegiances and the precarious balancing act it now faces. While its economic dependence on the U.S. cannot be easily severed, the eagerness with which Ottawa followed Washington’s lead raises eyebrows. From Beijing’s perspective, this move is as much about U.S. electoral politics as it is about trade. Beyond politics, Canada’s ambitions to foster its own electric vehicle industry appear misguided. The notion of replicating industries within national borders is a relic of a bygone era. Since the Second World War, major industrialized nations - including China - have thrived by specializing in certain sectors, benefiting from economies of scale. Canada’s attempt to conjure up a homegrown EV industry from scratch, especially in the face of established giants like China, seems an uphill battle, if not outright folly. China’s dominance in electric vehicles is the result of years of patient, strategic investment - a competitive edge that other nations simply cannot replicate. Canada, instead of attempting to challenge this supremacy, would be wiser to cultivate its own strengths in other high-tech industries. By trying to imitate China, Ottawa risks squandering its resources on a losing battle. If the Trudeau government truly aims to protect Canada’s industrial sector, it must reconsider its broader tariff strategy. Plans to target products like solar cells, computer chips, and lithium-ion batteries will choke vital supply chains, drive up costs, and potentially lead to job losses - only deepening the country's industrial decline. From Beijing’s perspective, Canada’s move on EVs is not just a policy misstep, but a potential setback in the fight against climate change. Tariffs that make electric vehicles more expensive will only delay Canadians from replacing gas-powered cars, ultimately undermining global climate goals. For China, it’s clear: Canada’s economic and environmental strategies are heading down a perilous road. Meanwhile, China has achieved something that deserves recognition. Through deliberate policies, it has raised the living standards of millions of workers and made strides toward environmental sustainability - both within its borders and through its global initiatives. In contrast, Canada’s newly imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles seem to do little more than undermine its own interests. These tariffs won’t strengthen Canadian sovereignty, help its workforce, or revive its struggling industrial sector. If anything, they will push Canada further down the road of dependency and economic vulnerability. Even more concerning, from China’s vantage point, is the impact these actions could have on the fight against climate change. By making electric vehicles less affordable, Canada risks stalling progress on one of the most urgent issues of our time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NjcPzvhvkqXA	2024-10-24T09:24:35-07:00	
From Colonial Legacies To Contemporary Strategic Evolution Of Ind...	The Indian ocean spreads all the way south to Antarctica, covering almost 27 percent of the maritime space of the world and 14 percent of the total globe. It is described as a water-body between Africa,the Antarctic Ocean, Asia, and Australia. For centuries, the Indian Ocean Region has been a great spectator of the fall and rise of civilizations, various empires including the Phoenicians, the Arabs, the Chinese, and the Portuguese-as an eternal quest for spices, textiles and precious stones. The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has a long history of cultural exchange, dating back over 4,000 years before the Vikings' arrival in North America. The region has been a hub of trade activity, both coastal and transoceanic, since around 5000 BC. By the start of the common era (CE), ancient port cities like Berenike and Hormos on the Red Sea had established significant trade connections with India, facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas across the region. The ancient Sassanian Empire's patronage (224-651) propelled Persian traders to dominance in the Gulf and Western Indian Ocean, their mercantile prowess rivaled only by the seafaring Arabs. The Arabs' extensive reach spanned India, East Africa, and the East Indies, a testament to their maritime expertise. However, the Sassanian dynasty's downfall at the hands of Muslim Arabs between 637-651 marked a turning point. The Arabs' commercial ascendancy peaked in the 9th century, with Ceylon and Calicut emerging as crucial entrepots, bridging the eastern and western oceanic trade routes. Vasco de Gama, was a Portuguese navigator whose voyage to India between 1497-99 and 1502-03 opened up a sea route from Western Europe to the East, by way of Cape of Good Hope. This pioneering feat heralded a new epoch in world history, as the Portuguese navigator was elevated to the esteemed rank of Admiral in 1502. The arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean marked the dawn of a new era, as they established themselves as the first Europeans to set foot in this realm. Their intentions were clear: to assert economic dominance over the coveted Asian trade, with a particular penchant for pepper and spices. Fuelled by an animosity towards the Muslims, the Portuguese embarked on a strategic conquest, claiming key ports such as Colombo, Socotra, Goa, Melaka, Hormuz, and Diu between 1505 and 1535. This calculated expansion enabled them to wield control over the Indian Ocean's trade, imposing licenses, customs duties, and stringent regulations on merchandise. The Portuguese grip was unyielding, dictating the flow of commerce and stifling the aspirations of rival nations. The Portuguese monopoly was a goldmine, flooding their coffers with wealth as they exploited Europe's craving for Asian spices. It also allowed them to simultaneously sideline Muslim traders who had thus far been dominating regional trade. The markets dealing with these commodities namely Aden, Jeddah, Basra, Cairo,Alexandria, Aleppo, Sofala, Hormuz, Diu and Melaka, consequently fell into decline. By early 17th century, however the Portuguese hold in the IOR was in shreds, dwindling rapidly as they lost major ports including Cochin and Colombo. As the 16th century drew to a close, the Dutch astutely capitalized on the burgeoning opportunities in the Indian Ocean, inaugurating their mercantile endeavors in this lucrative region. In 1604, they forged a strategic alliance with the Zamorin, the venerable Emperor of Malabar, united in their quest to expel the entrenched Portuguese presence. Recognizing the formidable Portuguese stronghold at pivotal locations, the Dutch devised a sagacious plan to establish a foothold in Java, whence they would launch a concerted effort to infiltrate and dismantle the Portuguese dominion. The Dutch mercantile agenda was singularly focused on the coveted spice trade, encompassing cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and nutmeg. The establishment of the Dutch East India Company in 1602 was a deliberate measure to regulate intra-Dutch competition, mitigating the uneven distribution of profits garnered from the lucrative Indian spice trade. State encouragement prompted merchants to consolidate their resources, culminating in the grant of a trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean to the Dutch East India Company. Following their conquest of Malacca in 1641, the Dutch allied themselves with the formidable King of Ceylon, collaborating to vanquish the Portuguese. The culmination of this campaign was the protracted siege of Colombo by the Dutch fleet, ultimately resulting in its capitulation in 1654. The French, thwarted in their attempts to gain a foothold in Ceylon in 1670 against the indomitable Dutch, redirected their ambitions towards the fertile shores of Madagascar and Mauritius. The French fleet saw it’s best days under Admira de Suffren in 1782-84. During this epoch, the French forged a strategic alliance with the redoubtable Hyder Ali, supporting his Carnatic Campaigns - a series of epic struggles that convulsed the 18th century, as the British, French, Marhatas, and Mysore vied for dominance over the coveted coastal strip. Subsequently, French also managed to capture Trincomalee port in Sri Lanka. As the 18th century dawned, the once-mighty Mughal Empire began to exhibit fissures, its grandeur slowly succumbing to the ravages of time. The decline of Mughal Empire and the rise of British in India, amongst other fates is attributable to the former’s obsession landward concerns. Their obsession with terrestrial conquests led them to neglect the vast expanse of Indian shores, forsaking the strategic advantages afforded by their extensive coastline. This shortsightedness, aptly described as 'sea blindness', afflicted not only the ruling elite but also large swaths of the population, leaving them oblivious to the maritime future. This vacuum enabled outside powers with strong commercial interests and potent navies to exploit the subcontinental riches and thus establish a foothold in India. The English and French commenced their Indian Ocean trading activities in the wake of Dutch. Following the Dutch example, they set their own East India Companies in 1600 and 1664 respectively. The Dutch East India Company, like Portuguese desired control of spice and pepper trade. Dutch were initially more successful than British East India Company. The two had dissimilarity as well. While the Dutch East India Company concentrated on in-country and inter Asian Trade, the British East India focused on trade to Europe. Using the seapower effectively, the British gradually built up their land power, through Madras in 1749 and Bengal in 1756. The Napoleonic wars in Europe helped the British take over Ceylon, Java, Malacca and the Cape from Dutch and French possessions, especially Mauritius, from the French. The ports of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta were established by British in mid to late 17th Century to wean the transoceanic trade away from traditional port cities. Despite careful application of coercion to attract Asian traders, it still look a good seventy odd years to Bombay to become more formidable than its neighbouring port Surat. By 1800, another commodity tea had entered the trade market in a big way. British exported opium (cultivated in Bihar, East India) to China in return for tea. This trade and its revenge grew sharply with a rise in tea consumption throughout the European Market. After setting up factories in port cities, the British proceeded to set these further inland near the production centres. It sent the clear message that the British were in it for the long haul. The advent of steamships and opening of the Suez Canal (1869) were two major developments that transformed trading patterns in the region by shortening the time and distances involved. Moving on the trail of timeline, 20th century witnessed the birth of two new yet currently regional stakeholders of Indian Ocean - Pakistan and India. In contemporary world shaped by China – U.S. power struggle, the pursuit of control over the Indian Ocean and its crucial trade routes has significantly elevated its strategic significance. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a physical demonstration how Beijing is building up infrastructure and gradually expanding its presence in its surrounding regions, particularly Indian Ocean Region (IOR). To protect its economic interests in Indian Ocean, China is gradually increasing its naval capabilities and outreach. In essence, as the tides of the time continue to shift, the region’s importance remains constant, beckoning new stakeholders to its shores.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NmgdGGFF4uP9	2024-10-24T09:21:26-07:00	
Sustaining Peace: Pakistan’s UN Engagement – OpEd	On October 24th, the world comes together to celebrate the founding of the United Nations (UN) and to reflect on the core principles that have shaped global governance for nearly eight decades. UN Day marks the anniversary of the entry into force of the UN Charter in 1945, a monumental moment that established a framework for international cooperation in an increasingly interconnected world. In 2024, the theme 'The Future We Want; the UN We Need! Reaffirming Our Collective Commitments to Multilateralism' serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of global solidarity and cooperation in addressing the challenges that lie ahead. UN Day is more than a celebration; it is a reaffirmation of the global community’s shared values of peace, justice, human rights, and sustainable development. As the UN navigates new challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and growing inequality, this day allows the world to reflect on how multilateralism can address these complex issues. The UN's foundational purpose, as enshrined in its Charter, is to prevent conflicts, promote peace, and protect the rights and dignity of people everywhere. Over the years, the organization has served as a platform for dialogue, bringing together nations to discuss and resolve pressing global concerns. Today, in a world that is more interconnected than ever, the relevance of the UN cannot be overstated. The organization's commitment to 'leaving no one behind' resonates deeply as nations grapple with issues that transcend borders, such as climate change, terrorism, and public health crises. Multilateralism is the key to achieving the collective goals of peace, security, and prosperity for all. Since joining the UN in 1947, Pakistan has consistently advocated for peace, security, and cooperation. Its foreign policy has been deeply rooted in the principles of multilateralism, emphasizing the need for collective global efforts to address challenges ranging from conflict resolution to sustainable development. Pakistan's active participation in UN forums and initiatives highlights its belief in the power of diplomacy and international cooperation to foster global harmony. One of Pakistan's most significant contributions to the UN is its role in peacekeeping operations. As one of the largest troop-contributing countries, Pakistan has deployed more than 235,000 troops to 48 missions across 29 countries. Pakistani peacekeepers have operated in some of the most dangerous conflict zones, consistently demonstrating bravery and professionalism. Their efforts have been pivotal in stabilizing war-torn societies, maintaining law and order, and enabling successful political transitions. Currently, over 2,600 Pakistani peacekeepers are deployed in seven UN missions, contributing as part of infantry battalions, engineering companies, aviation units, artillery batteries, and as military staff officers and observers. The spirit of sacrifice shown by Pakistani peacekeepers, with 181 having laid down their lives in the line of duty, underscores Pakistan's unwavering commitment to global peace. Pakistan’s dedication to the peaceful resolution of disputes has been a central tenet of its foreign policy. This is evident in its longstanding advocacy for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute in line with UN Security Council resolutions. Pakistan has consistently emphasized the need for diplomatic solutions to conflicts and has played an active role in promoting peace in various international forums. The country believes that the UN remains the most legitimate platform for conflict resolution and global diplomacy, and it continues to call for stronger multilateral efforts to address unresolved conflicts. Despite facing challenges, such as the shrinking space for peacekeeping operations due to changing global dynamics, Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the UN’s peacekeeping agenda. The country’s troops have played an integral role in normalizing societies that have been torn apart by war, ensuring that law and order are restored and that political processes can proceed in a stable environment. This commitment reflects Pakistan’s belief in the UN’s ability to prevent conflicts, protect civilians, and maintain peace through collective efforts. Pakistan is not only a proponent of peace but also a strong advocate for the UN's 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a developing country facing its own challenges, including poverty, inequality, and energy insecurity, Pakistan has made significant strides in integrating the SDGs into its national development agenda. The country recognizes that achieving sustainable development requires a concerted effort from all nations and continues to push for global cooperation in areas such as poverty eradication, quality education, gender equality, and clean energy. Moreover, Pakistan is a vocal advocate for reforms within the UN to ensure that global governance structures are more inclusive and representative of the modern world. The current imbalances in political and economic power in international institutions are a cause for concern, and Pakistan has consistently called for just and equitable reforms. It stresses that reform should not only benefit a few powerful member states but should include the voices of smaller, less developed nations. This aligns with Pakistan's broader vision for a more equitable and just international order, where marginalized populations are empowered and included in global decision-making processes. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for global cooperation in addressing transnational threats. Pakistan played a proactive role during the pandemic, advocating for equitable access to vaccines and financial support for developing nations. The pandemic demonstrated that no country, regardless of its wealth or resources, can tackle global challenges alone. Pakistan supports the idea that multilateral institutions like the UN are critical platforms for shared responsibility and joint action in the face of challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and international terrorism. As the world faces the growing threat of climate change, Pakistan is increasingly vocal about the need for global cooperation to mitigate its impacts. The country has already experienced the devastating effects of climate-related disasters, such as floods and droughts, and recognizes that climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. Pakistan remains committed to working with the international community to address these and other emerging challenges, reaffirming its belief in the power of multilateralism to build a better future for all. On this UN Day, Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to the principles of multilateralism, cooperation, and collective action. The world is facing unprecedented challenges, but through institutions like the UN, there is hope for a safer, more equitable, and sustainable future. As a staunch advocate of peace, diplomacy, and sustainable development, Pakistan remains dedicated to working with the global community to achieve the goals of peace, security, and prosperity for all.

Pakistan’s UN Voyage – OpEd	As we observe United Nations Day, it is crucial to reflect on the significant contributions made by Pakistan to the UN and its mission to foster global peace and stability. Since joining the UN in 1947, Pakistan has not only embraced the principles articulated in the UN Charter but has also taken a proactive stance in addressing global challenges. Through extensive involvement in peacekeeping missions, steadfast advocacy for human rights, and commitment to humanitarian efforts, Pakistan exemplifies a nation dedicated to fostering a safer, more equitable world. This commitment is particularly evident in Pakistan’s robust participation in UN peacekeeping efforts. This journey in UN peacekeeping began in 1960 during the Congo Crisis, marking its first deployment in a multinational peacekeeping mission. Over the decades, Pakistan has deployed more than 235,000 peacekeepers to 48 missions worldwide, establishing itself as one of the largest troop-contributing countries (TCCs) to UN operations. As of 2024, approximately 8,200 Pakistani personnel are actively engaged in peacekeeping missions, underscoring the nation’s unwavering resolve to stabilize conflict-affected regions. In 2023, Pakistan sent 1,600 peacekeepers to various missions, contributing to operations in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mali. The diversity of Pakistan's peacekeeping contingents—comprising infantry battalions, engineering units, aviation squadron, and military observers—illustrates its comprehensive approach to peacekeeping. This versatility enables Pakistan to address various facets of peacekeeping, ranging from combat to humanitarian assistance. However, this dedication has not come without sacrifice; 181 Pakistani personnel have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty, defending civilians and upholding UN mandates. Their bravery resonates not only within Pakistan but is also acknowledged internationally, highlighting the risks that peacekeepers face in the pursuit of global security. Moreover, Pakistan takes pride in promoting the role of women in peacekeeping. Over 500 Pakistani women have served in various missions, and the country was one of the first to achieve the UN's target of ensuring at least 15% female staff officers in peacekeeping contingents. This commitment to gender equality has garnered recognition from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who praised Pakistan as a leader in advancing the role of women in peacekeeping. Pakistan's influence extends beyond its peacekeeping efforts. The nation has been elected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) five times, advocating for critical human rights issues, including the rights of children, women, and minorities, while persistently drawing attention to the humanitarian crisis in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. In 2023, Pakistan urged the international community to take notice of the human rights violations and state-sponsored terrorism in this region. In addition to its advocacy within the HRC, Pakistan has presided over the UN Security Council on multiple occasions, most recently in January 2023. During this term, Pakistan prioritized discussions on regional peace and security, particularly concerning Afghanistan and the Kashmir conflict​. This leadership role has enabled Pakistan to shape key global security discussions and advocate for the perspectives and needs of developing nations. Pakistan is also a staunch advocate for disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, reflecting its commitment to a secure global environment. Engaging in dialogues that promote collective security, especially within South Asia's unique security landscape, Pakistan actively supports the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and advocates for nuclear disarmament​. Furthermore, the country is dedicated to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), implementing initiatives aimed at eradicating poverty, promoting gender equality, and ensuring access to quality education, aligning with its objectives of sustainable development​. Beyond peacekeeping, Pakistan has played a vital role in humanitarian aid and crisis response, offering assistance during global emergencies, such as the Ebola outbreak, and contributing to humanitarian efforts in Yemen and Syria​. Pakistan's commitment to the Palestinian cause is evident as it consistently advocates for Palestinian rights and addresses the humanitarian crises resulting from Israeli occupation. Alongside this, Pakistan has been a vocal supporter of the Kashmiri people's plight, framing their struggle within the context of international law and human rights. Pakistan has solidified its reputation as a responsible member of the international community, dedicated to promoting peace, security, and humanitarian well-being on a global scale through these multifaceted contributions. Its proactive engagement in diverse UN initiatives not only bolsters its international standing but also sets a powerful example for other nations striving toward similar goals. On this United Nations Day, Pakistan’s longstanding commitment to peacekeeping serves as a testament to its dedication to global stability and cooperation. By actively embracing its responsibilities and participating in peacekeeping efforts, Pakistan exemplifies how nations can collaborate to tackle common challenges. As global conflicts persist, Pakistan’s proactive approach to peace and justice remains essential, reflecting its unwavering resolve to contribute to a more harmonious future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9NuOMCyjc_4aQ	2024-10-24T09:17:49-07:00	
Regionalism Of The New Era: A Community Of Shared Future Between ...	Nationalism, regionalism and globalism are three paramount forces in contemporary international relations. But regionalism has experienced tremendous resurgence with the formation of old and new regionalism. Old regionalism started in Europe after the Second World War with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the forerunner of European Economic Community (EEC) that has evolved into the present-day European Union (EU). During the cold war, European regionalism inspired previously-colonized states in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and beyond to also form their own regional groupings for purposes of economic cooperation and even integration while protecting their political freedom and national sovereignty. Arguably, the most successful regional organization outside of Europe is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which at present is at the driver’s seat of many regional efforts in the Asia Pacific and even Indian Ocean regions. Old regionalism of the cold war was based on Western model exported to other regions of the world. There was a thought during that time that mimicking European style of regionalism was the best model for other regions to promote world peace and achieve regional prosperity. Old regionalism of Europe emphasized economic integration through free trade leading to social, cultural, political and even security integration by upholding Western values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. While old regionalism may have worked in Europe, it became problematic when practiced in other regions. Thus, a new type of regionalism emerged in Asia after the end of the cold war. Compared with the old regionalism of Europe, which is restrictive and exclusive, the new regionalism of Asia is more open and inclusive leading to the creation of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and other similar regional undertakings. While the old regionalism of Europe is driven by the interests of major powers seeking peace and prosperity through economic integration and political homogenization, the new regionalism of Asia is driven by the interests of developing states seeking peace and prosperity through development cooperation, political coordination, mutual respects, common benefits, peaceful coexistence and decolonization. The new regionalism of Asia attracted the attention of old regionalism in Europe leading to current process of inter-regionalism. But another regionalism has developed in the 21st century championed by China with the Global South. I call this as the 'Regionalism of the New Era' or the RNE. Like the new regionalism of Asia, the RNE provides an alternative to the old regionalism of Europe. But the RNE embraces the many ideas of the new regionalism of the developing world and learns lessons from the old regionalism of developed countries, especially in Europe. The RNE is the regionalism of the Global South and emerging economies with China as the main driving force. The creation of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the first indication of the rise the RNE. The BRI upholds a model of regionalism that connects Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime trade regardless of economic status, level of political development, socio-cultural make-up and religious preferences. The BRI is an open and inclusive mega-region that aims to promote sustainable economic development through inter-regional connectivity with states initially in Asia, Africa and Europe and now encompassing Latin America and the Pacific regions. The BRI originally represents around 75 percent of the global population covering initially 60 countries during its infancy but now covering more than 150 countries and international organizations. As such, the BRI has become the RNE of the Global South. The World Bank reports that by 2030, the BRI will create a yearly growth of US$1.6 trilllion to the world’ s economy. But other estimates say that the BRI can boost world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $US7 trillion annually by 2040. Whatever the estimates are, the BRI aims to develop regional infrastructures, enhance regional economic activities, raise peoples’ income, and contribute to the reduction of global poverty. The BRI is being bankrolled by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) now headquartered in Beijing. Another strong indication of the rise of RNE is the establishment of the BRICS originally founded by emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa representing 30 percent of the world’s land area, 45 percent of the global population and more than 30 percent of global GDP. BRICS has expanded to other emerging economies of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Many countries from the Global South like Algeria, Bolivia, Cuba, Turkiye Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and others have applied for BRICS membership because of its huge potential to bring prosperity to its members and raise the quality of life of their peoples. BRICS has the New Development Bank (NDB) in Shanghai. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is also an indication of the RNE. In terms of geography and demography, the SCO is one of the world’s largest regional groupings of states representing 42 percent of the world population and 24 percent of the global land area. Compared with BRICS and the BRI, the SCO has a strong security agenda while pursuing economic cooperation. From original members of five composed of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, the SCO has extended to five other permanent members to include Belarus, India, Iran, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Other countries from Central Asia, Eurasia and South Asia have applied for accession to the SCO. Since the RNE is the regionalism of the Global South and the emerging economies, China has enunciated another idea that reinforces this type of regionalism to the international society by building a community of shared future for mankind. The goal of building a community of shared future is upholding the fundamental tenet of RNE by establishing an open and inclusive community of the peoples of the world through common development and shared prosperity; common, cooperative and sustainable security; and, harmony of all civilizations. China’s Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI), and Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) are China’s three global initiatives that support the RNE and even the United Nation’s campaign for a Better World, which is consistent with China’s vision of a community of shared future for mankind. Comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Southeast Asian countries is the cornerstone of the RNE. The success of China-Southeast Asia regional cooperation is important to inspire success in other regions in the Global South. In fact. existing evidences show that deeper economic integration between China and Southeast Asian countries can fuel Asian growth that is essential for global economic development. Even the New York-based Mckinsey Global Institute admits that a regionalized Asia through greater China-Southeast Asia integration serves at the hub of the global trade. Asia now accounts around 60 percent of world’s trade growth fueled by stronger China-Southeast Asia economic relations. It is therefore imperative for China and Southeast Asia to enhance their comprehensive strategic partnership to sustain its positive contribution to global economic development. A community of shared future between China and Southeast Asia is vital for the building of a community of shared future for all mankind. The ASEAN-China Free Trade Area and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) involving China, ASEAN countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand can accelerate Asian growth for global prosperity and peace. The RCEP is another expression of the RNE involving China, Southeast Asia and other members towards a community of shared future.

Moscow’s Anti-Migrant Campaign Accelerating Formation Of Ethnic G...	Prior to the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russian cities had ethnic quarters, or ghettos, where members of some minorities lived to maintain their ethnic identities and protect themselves against Russification. Between 1917 and 1991, such ghettos largely disappeared as a result of Soviet policies such as the propiska system, which allowed officials to determine who lived where. Following 1991, the propiska system was formally banned, and neighborhoods began gradually separating themselves again. Russian officials continue to insist that their country does not have any ghettos. In recent years, however, research and reality have forced them to acknowledge that there are, in fact, 'ethnic enclaves,' a euphemism for ghettos, a word few are prepared to use (Window on Eurasia, February 23, 2023). The influx of migrant workers from Central Asia and the Caucasus into Russian cities has subsequently caused growing anger among the population and policies against immigrant workers. As a result, real ghettos have emerged in Russian cities, exacerbating tensions between their residents and the surrounding Russian community and creating conditions in which tensions spill over into violence that even the increasingly repressive Putin regime is finding difficult to subdue (see EDM, May 9, 15). Most discussions about the reappearance of ghettos in Russian cities have suggested this development is simply the result of slums transforming into ghettos, a process in which poorer migrants replace ethnic Russian residents in poorer parts of urban areas (Natsional’nyi Aktsent, February 2, 2023). There can be little doubt that this is the primary factor in the recent rise of ghettos in Russian cities. It is increasingly evident, however, that this issue has been exacerbated by Moscow’s anti-immigrant campaign and how Russian officials and the Russian population have responded. This includes not only refusing to rent to migrants but also educators’ and parents’ attitudes toward the increasing number of migrants’ children in schools who do not know Russian well (Window on Eurasia, May 29, 2016). A common narrative is that their presence has the effect of slowing the education for others, leading to declines in all-important test scores—upon which teachers’ and administrators’ salaries depend (RIA Novosti, April 8, 2021; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, April 12, 2021; Zavtra.ru, April 14, 2021). Declining test scores have led to calls by some Russian nationalists that the children of immigrants be excluded from Russian public schools. These appeals have been dismissed as political grandstanding from parties that would like to expel all migrant workers from Russia, something that the Kremlin cannot afford to do. Such dismissals, however, have failed to recognize that these attitudes are already having an effect, keeping immigrant children from attending many schools. This is such a politically explosive topic that few studies have been conducted on how ghettoization is affecting urban life in Russia. One study on the situation in St. Petersburg recently released by Russian independent news agency Bumaga provides the clearest indication of just how far ghettoization has progressed. The study found that the situation was developing due to political reasons connected to anti-immigrant campaigns, rather than for economic ones. These campaigns have been carried out in response to a call from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) to strip children without Russian citizenship of the right to free public education (TASS, September 5). The Bumaga investigation found that in the wake of the Crocus City Hall bombing in March 2024, many Russian public schools are now refusing to admit immigrant children, citing overcrowding or other more spurious reasons. This has led to younger immigrant children being concentrated in certain schools and, in numerous cases, older immigrant children not attending at all, being left to their own devices on the streets (Bumaga, October 17). Both of these consequences,Bumagaresearchers conclude, are leading to the rapid ghettoization of immigrants, to an even slower adaptation of migrant children to Russian life, and perhaps most disturbingly of all, to the emergence of sometimes violent and often fanatically politically radical youth culture (seeEDM, March 22, 2018). While there are fewer immigrants to Russia now than in the past, the problems they pose are growing. This conclusion is supported by reports concerning increasing clashes between migrant youth and their Russian counterparts and even the formation of militias by each group to defend against the other (Svobodnaya Pressa, July 24, 2021;Window on Eurasia, September 15, 2023). Despite these risks, there is broad support both within the educational system and by the ethnic Russian majority for exclusionary policies, according toBumaga. As previously stated, schools, teachers, and parents of non-immigrant children support excluding immigrant children because their presence means that teachers have to devote more attention and time to those who do not know Russian well. This redirection of educators’ attention means that all get relatively less preparation for government-tested subjects—something which is already sparking calls for the number of immigrant children to be limited to only a handful in each class. As discussed earlier, school directors and teachers’ pay is threatened by a lower average score on said tests, which likewise determine other students’ opportunities to move on to higher education. As a result of this, there is a large group of people whose interests oppose admitting children of non-citizenship immigrants to schools. The solution in the educational system, activists and experts tellBumaga, is to establish special schools for immigrants to provide them with the Russian language education they need if they are to remain in Russia. Some acknowledge, however, that there is a danger to setting up such schools, as it could also lead to further ghettoization. While there are no statistics available on how large either of these trends has become due to its controversy,Bumagasuggests that both are large and growing. The issue is expected to negatively impact migrant and non-migrant children in schools and Russian society overall. In the broader problem of ghettoization, migrant children play only a small part, but the Putin regime has been presented with a Hobson’s choice about migrant workers. On the one hand, the Kremlin recognizes that Russia cannot afford to expel migrants or their children. On the other hand, the Putin leadership has yet to develop a strategy to curb the growth of ghettos and the violence their rise may provoke, especially amid the increasingly nationalist attitudes among the Russian population. Relying solely on repression—a tactic that proved ineffective in controlling such conflicts during the late imperial period—is unlikely to succeed in the current crisis (on that history and that prospect, seeEDM, October 15).

Turkish Intelligence In The New Era: Transformation And Expansion...	By John Hatzadony and Spyrion Plakoudas Turkish foreign policy has undergone fundamental change under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Less understood is the rise of the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) as a tool of Turkish foreign policy. The expanded scope and sophistication of Turkey’s intelligence and clandestine1 operations have become integral to its foreign and security policy. This paper examines how clandestine intelligence operations have increasingly become a tool of and reflect Turkey’s evolving geopolitical position. Finally, it examines the implications these increased clandestine activities have for regional and international dynamics and highlights the critical interplay between enhanced intelligence activities and Turkish foreign policy objectives. Historical Context of Turkish Intelligence The story of Turkish intelligence, tracing its origins from the late Ottoman Empire to its sophisticated contemporary operations, reflects Turkey’s complex history. The Turkish intelligence community can trace its roots as far back as 1299 to the early administrative organs of the Ottoman Empire. The empire’s intelligence apparatus was primarily centered around the general administration department, known as the divan-i hümayun kalemi (Imperial Chancery). The divan-i hümayun kalemi was primarily focused on gathering intelligence on foreign powers and internal threats.2 In the waning years of the Ottoman Empire, various attempts to reform and make relevant the intelligence capacity by various sultans were initiated. The first real precursor to the current incarnation of Turkish intelligence came with the establishment of the Yıldız (Star) Organization (1880-1908) under Sultan Abdulhamid II.3 As the empire engaged in World War I, the Teşkilât-ı Mahsûsa (Special Organization, c1913-1920), led by Enver Paşa, played a crucial role in intelligence and special operations, navigating through the complexities of a global conflict and a crumbling empire.4 Intelligence activities during the period from the end of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the republic, between 1918 and 1923, quite rightly refocused the operational mission as various intelligence incarnations became focused primarily on internal consolidation and responding to external security issues that threatened the nascent Republic of Turkey. This period became critical in shaping the Republic’s future, both in terms of internal stability and foreign policy direction.5 The transition to the Republic of Turkey naturally brought transition and reforms to the intelligence services, most importantly being the institutionalization of intelligence operations. The new republic established the Millî Emniyet Hizmeti Riyâseti (M.E.H./MAH) in 19266 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who centralized security intelligence collection and operations but the focus clearly remained on domestic security issues.7 As the republic found its footing from 1923 to 1947, the intelligence apparatus began to take a more defined shape. This era was marked by efforts to strengthen the newly founded state and navigate the complexities of an evolving international scene, particularly multiple efforts to draw the nation into World War II.8 The Cold War years saw a significant expansion and adaptation of Turkey’s intelligence capabilities to meet these strategic needs. The era presented new challenges and necessitated a strategic shift in intelligence activities. Turkey, straddling the Western bloc and the Soviet Union, needed to manage its foreign policy while keeping a keen eye on both internal and external threats. However, NATO accession provided access to new training, resources, and cooperation, in particular with the United States and the Central Intelligence Agency.9 This culminated in 1965, when the MAH underwent a significant transformation, evolving into the current National Intelligence Organization (MİT).10 The changes represented a strategic refinement of intelligence priorities to meet the republic’s expanding domestic security needs and foreign policy objectives. The newly formed MİT11 became responsible for collecting and analyzing both domestic and foreign intelligence, domestic security intelligence, and military co-ordination. The latter having major and lasting influence on the organization until the twenty-first century as leadership of the MİT was dominated by military officers.12 Clandestine operations are not new to Turkish foreign and security policy. An early example of Turkish intelligence’s clandestine operations can be seen in military intelligence and MAH activities against Bulgaria that provided support to NATO collection priorities.13 However, Turkey also targeted Greece during the Cyprus conflict from 1953 to 1970. This period marked a strategic use of clandestine activities by Turkish intelligence within the NATO alliance and against an erstwhile ally. The MİT operations were multifaceted, including: support for resistance movements, providing operational assistance, and evaluating military capabilities and readiness. As Sabri Yirmobeşoğlu, an ex general of the Turkish Armed Forces and ex secretary general of Turkey’s National Security Council (MGK) confided in an interview a few years ago, the MIT was responsible for the arming of Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries and the bombing of Turkish Cypriot targets,14 some to good effect in stoking unrest and building the basis for potential intervention. The bombing of the Bayraktar and Omeriye Mosques in Nikosia on March 25, 1962, was blamed squarely on the EOKA, the Greek Cypriot resistance organization, in order to sow the seeds of division among the island’s communities. A few years earlier, the detonation of a bomb in 1958 outside the Turkish consulate in Nikosia had sparked violent clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. These clandestine operations solidified the rift between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots before the events in 1963 and 1974.15 The case highlights the developing role of clandestine intelligence operations in its immediate geography, in what the Turks considered a near domestic issue, and underscores the early use of clandestine action in contemporary Turkish foreign policy.16 By the end of the Cold War, the global geopolitical landscape underwent a dramatic transformation, and so did Turkey’s intelligence focus. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of new international dynamics required a re-evaluation and transition in intelligence operations. Turkish foreign policy during this period adapted to these new challenges and opportunities, reflecting the changing geopolitical environment. Even before the events of September 11, 2001, Turkey had been dealing with an active PKK terror campaign. The Turkish intelligence community focus on domestic threats, however, did not preclude out of area operations. This was most demonstrably expressed in the 1999 rendition of PKK leader Abdulla Ocalan from Nairobi.17 Like other NATO members, Turkey faced a significant shift in its security landscape with the 9/11 attacks on the United States and the first use of NATO Article 5. Although having a vast amount of experience in counter-terrorism, 2001-2020 saw a particular rise of expanded terrorist and asymmetric threats. This necessitated an evolution in Turkey’s intelligence community, significantly influencing its foreign policy to align more closely with global counter-terrorism initiatives and regional dynamics. Integral institutions, such as the MİT, as well as other security and intelligence agencies such as the chief of general staff, the ministry of interior, the ministry of foreign affairs, and the undersecretariat of public order and Security (KDGM) have been pivotal in this transformation. Their adaptive roles and contributions mirror the changing domestic and international challenges faced by Turkish security. It is in this historical context that sets the stage for understanding the subsequent developments in Turkish intelligence and its broader implications. Transition and Reformation: The Hakan Fidan Era The appointment of Hakan Fidan, a known Erdogan loyalist, did not initially appear to indicate a major change. Strictly speaking, MİT was not within the ministry of defense. However, historically, almost all senior leadership had come from the military branches. However, Fidan had been preparing for the position and change in Turkish intelligence structure and focus. Indeed, his 1999 master’s thesis compared the Turkish intelligence community to that of the United States and the United Kingdom.18 Fidan began restructuring the MİT along the lines of his 1999 plan by and pushing MİT into the forefront of Turkish foreign policy, resulting in the 2012 establishment of a foreign operations department and absorbing the signals intelligence (SIGINT) role of the military. By 2014, this was further entrenched legally when the Turkish parliament passed a law granting greater autonomy to the MİT and reorganizing its reporting structure. It aimed to address concerns about military dominance and allegations of human rights abuses during previous military leadership. This change has had three major effects on the MİT: Refocus of intelligence priorities. Traditionally the MİT had worked foreign intelligence because there was no other applicable agency. Now it officially included a broader foreign collection mandate. Measures for transparency and accountability to prevent power abuse and ensure operation within legal boundaries. A notable measure was establishing an independent inspector general position within the MİT, allowing internal investigations and monitoring of the agency’s activities for legal and ethical compliance. This oversight also included the establishment of parliamentary committees tasked with monitoring the MİT’s activities. This was the first time elected civilian committees would play a role in intelligence oversight by reviewing and evaluating the MİT’s performance, scrutinizing its budget, and providing a forum for public debate on intelligence matters. MİT Under Hakan Fidan Fidan was assigned 'special tasks' by Erdogan that even ministers within the cabinet were not aware of. That explains why Erdogan called him once as 'my secret-keeper … the state’s secret-keeper'.19 These missions included, for a start, the secret negotiations with the outlawed PKK in Oslo and Imrali20 between 2006 and 2011. Despite the ups and downs, these negotiations eventually resulted in the historic message by Ocalan in March 2013 and the start of the 'solution process' (Çözüm Süreci).21 This was by far the most comprehensive―and ambitious―effort by Turkey to resolve the decades-old Kurdish question through a negotiation and not an armed struggle. But Fidan was not engaged only in peace talks. In 2011, the Syrian Civil War erupted and very quickly metamorphosed, in the words of the ex-director of the CIA, into 'a Geopolitical Chernobyl' with various state and non-state actors locked in a deadly struggle.22 After Erdogan’s public appeal to Assad for reforms and reconciliation ended in a deadlock, Ankara decided to secretly support the rebels within the Free Syrian Army to overthrow the Assad regime. Despite the US open reservations, Turkey delivered weapons and money―and even training to certain militant groups that were not vetted by the CIA such as Ahrar al Sham or Sultan Murad Brigade. There was one critical problem with this approach, however: these rebels, though much more deadly on the battlefield than the de-centralized FSA, mainly consisted of hardliners who sometimes cooperated with Al Qaeda in Syria.23 This support for the rebels was done away from the public spotlight by the only agency that Erdogan could rely on for secrecy and efficacy: the MİT. Despite their best efforts, these clandestine ops were eventually documented and publicized by journalists who were later arrested.24 These leaks to the press did not manifest out of the blue; they were linked to the struggle in the shadows between Erdogan and his erstwhile ally against the Kemalists―Gulen. These power struggles would indeed express themselves over the Gezi Park Protests in 2013 and the Corruption Scandals in 2014.25 The Post-Coup MİT However, these contests would reach a head in July 2016 when a cabal of pro-Gulen military officers allegedly launched an (ultimately unsuccessful) coup d’état against Erdogan. The role of Fidan in these events is still shrouded in mystery; though the country’s spymaster, he failed to detect any signs of the impending coup and, thus, prevent its occurrence.26 Whatever the case, the MİT headquarters was viewed as a nerve center by coup plotters and was targeted by their helicopters. Despite their efforts, the putschists did not seize Fidan―though they did capture Hulusi Akar, chief of the general staff.27 These attacks against the MİT Headquarters promoted an overhaul of the intelligence agency. First of all, a sweeping purge of suspected and real sympathizers of the putschists was unleashed within MİT with thousands of agents ending in prison.28 Secondly, a new MİT headquarters, nicknamed the 'Kale' or 'Fortress', was built outside of Ankara on 5000 acres of land with three-meter high walls and other extensive security.29 Third, the MİT was expanded to include a clandestine paramilitary capability. From then onwards, the MİT would not only be an intelligence agency that collected and analyzed intelligence or co-operated with other services for clandestine operations. It would develop a paramilitary branch with its own direct action capability that would allow the MIT to operate independently in military theaters.30 This has enabled MİT to operate independently of the Turkish military and turn into a more versatile 'third-option'31 of Turkish foreign policy similar to the CIA. The aftershock of the new militarized MİT was nowhere felt as deeply as in Syria. The MİT already engaged in clandestine operations within Syria against the Assad regime. Erdogan imposed an absolute control over the army from 2011, and no one opposed his own plans for a buffer zone in Northern Syria. Only one month after the putsch, Turkey initiated Operation 'Euphrates Shield' in an effort to eject ISIS from Jarablus; in reality, however, Turkey intended to cut off the Kurds of Afrin from those in Manbij.32 Fidan was on the same page as Erdogan: as early as March 2014, he had suggested a false flag op in order to justify an armed incursion into Northern Syria.33 During the same period that Operation 'Euphrates Shield' unfolded, Fidan went to great lengths to foster a revolt within the Kurdish-controlled territory of Northern Syria; these pro-Turkey Arab and Kurdish militant groups (e.g. the Ahfad Salah al-Din Brigade) failed, however, and thus, vanished from the scene.34 In mid-2015, changing dynamics in Idlib Province had implications for regional stability.35 Besides, these hardliners were considered by Turkey a far lesser evil to the YPG, the Syrian offshoot of the PKK, despite the open objections of the USA.36 MIT was instrumental in the establishment of the Syrian National Army in December 2017―this umbrella organization for the anti-ISIS and anti-YPG militant groups (e.g. Hamza Division and al-Mu‘tasim Division).37 MIT reserved a preferential treatment for the Turkmens of Syria within the newly-formed SNA.38 In time, these Turkmen-heavy militant groups comprised the nucleus of the mercenaries that MIT employed in war theaters outside Syria itself.39 After Operation 'Euphrates Shield' (2016–2017), Turkey intervened again in Northern Syria thrice: twice against the Kurds (2018 and 2019), and once against the Assad regime (2020) to solidify its buffer zone along its southern border. Turkey utilized these rebels as auxiliaries or proxies for its own wars against the YPG and Assad; and MIT ensured that the rebel commanders toed the line; those who did not comply, were simply replaced by compliant ones.40 Challenges and Issues for MİT These secret networks in Idlib and Northern Syria would serve Turkey well in its interventions in other war theaters. The MIT recruited and transported thousands of rebels from Syria to Western Libya in late 2019 as mercenaries in order to lift the Siege of Tripoli by Haftar.41 Actually, the only casualties ever reported by Turkey in Operation 'Peace Storm' in Libya included an agent of and translator for MIT.42 The same story repeated itself in the 2ndKarabakh War: the MIT arranged for the recruitment and transport of these rebels from Syria (or Libya) to the mountains of Azerbaijan where they were utilized in human waves to overrun Armenian military outposts.43 In other words, the MIT acted as the tip of the spear in the policy doctrine that Erdogan implemented from Operation 'Olive Branch' in 2018 onwards: that of 'surrogate warfare'.44 In this version a la Turca, rebels or mercenaries from Syria acted as the human surrogates with the drones (especially the by now world famous Bayraktar TB2)45 as the technological ones. The MIT was an integral element in both versions of these surrogates: it recruited the rebels as proxies, on the one hand, and it provided the drones with the necessary critical intel for the targeted killings, on the other hand. However, three challenges emerged from the continued use of clandestine operations: The primary concern revolved around the political authorization of the National Intelligence Organization’s (MİT) clandestine activities, directed by the presidency. These operations sparked intense debates within the Turkish Parliament regarding appropriate oversight for the intelligence service.46 Secondly, the proxies frequently faced accusations of committing severe human rights violations against civilians in Northern Syria, particularly in Afrin. The inability or reluctance of MİT to control these undisciplined militias has marred the organization’s reputation.47 Finally, Turkey’s engagements with hardline militias in Northern Syria have caused concerns in both Washington and Moscow.48 In addition to these, the MİT organized a witch-hunt against supporters of the self-exiled imam, Fetullah Gulen, all over the world in the aftermath of the failed coup d’état. This witch-hunt resulted in renditions without due process from several countries (e.g. Kazakhstan, Moldova) and, according to the victims’ own testimonies, in torture and solitary confinement in 'black sites'.49 These clandestine programs, operated exclusively by the MİT strained Turkey’s relationship with the West.50 These renditions were not the sole instances where MİT’s actions strained its traditional relationships with Western and Western-aligned states. Such activities underscored the growing significance of clandestine intelligence operations’ role in shaping Turkish foreign policy. This change underscores a pivotal shift towards a more assertive and independent stance in Turkey’s international strategy. Turkish clandestine operations in Northern Syria serve as another example. Throughout 2023, MİT targeted both the military and civil leadership of the Kurds with its own agents and drones. In April 2023, a strike by an MİT-operated drone almost neutralized Mazlum Kobane–the commander-in-chief of the Kurdish YPG/SDF in Northern Syria. The attempted murder of a well-known US ally was not the only affront to the USA: at the time, Kobane was stationed in a US military base in Northern Syria and, thus, the safety of the US Marines was jeopardized.51 This attack prompted a complaint by the USA―both in public and in private―toward Turkey. But it did little to deter the MİT. Indeed, agents of the MİT continue to stir up the rebellious Arab tribes in Deir-ez-Zor against the Kurds to the extent than an armed uprising―eventually unsuccessful―flared up between August and September 2023.52 The Future of Turkish Intelligence Erdogan won the presidential election in May 2023 despite the alliance of the six opposition parties. He appointed his trusted 'keeper of secrets', Fidan, to the post of foreign minister. Ibrahim Kalin, the national security advisor, took over as head of MIT. These changes signaled that hawks would reign on issues of intelligence and diplomacy. Indeed, this was evident in the ongoing operations in Northern Iraq and Syria. In 2023, the MİT neutralized 201 fighters of the PKK and YPG in total in 181 clandestine ops that involved the use of UCAVs and destroyed 45 targets of critical infrastructure (e.g. oil wells in Northern Syria).53 These operations occurred despite the protests of Washington that resulted in a 'blue on blue' incident in October 2023 when the United States downed a Turkish UCAV to protect is soldiers in Northern Syria.54 This incident, however, did little to deter the MİT, which continued its campaign of targeted killings. Implications for Turkish Foreign Policy The appointment of İbrahim Kalın as the new head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization marks another significant transition in the landscape of Turkish intelligence and foreign policy since 2010. Kalin brings a distinct background to his new role as the intelligence chief, having previously served as the chief presidential advisor and spokesperson. Kalin’s elevation to the head of the MİT could signal a nuanced shift in the strategic direction of Turkish intelligence. Given his previous role, Kalin is expected to maintain a close alignment with Erdoğan’s foreign policy objectives. This alignment might lead to a more synchronized and coherent strategy between the presidential office and intelligence operations, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of Turkish foreign policy, particularly with Fidan now heading the foreign ministry. Kalin’s deep involvement in diplomatic and advisory roles suggests a possible emphasis on integrating intelligence findings more directly into foreign policy decision-making. This could result in a more proactive and strategic use of intelligence in shaping Turkey’s international relations, especially in its dealings with neighboring regions and global powers. It should be noted that both Fidan and Kalin share the same vision with Erdogan about Turkey’s place in this ever-changing international environment: namely, that Turkey should not stick to its old orientation to the West but side with the rising Euro-Asian powers such as Russia and China which, just like Erdogan, challenge the current status quo. The Future of MİT Clandestine Operations Under Kalin’s leadership, the MİT is likely to continue its active role in clandestine operations, which have been a significant aspect of Turkey’s assertive foreign policy under Erdoğan. These operations, particularly those aimed at countering terrorism and protecting national interests, are expected to remain a priority. However, Kalin’s approach to such operations might differ from his predecessor’s, potentially focusing more on strategic intelligence gathering and less on high-profile operations, depending on the evolving geopolitical landscape. Kalin’s tenure could also see a continued emphasis on technological advancements in intelligence, particularly in cyber intelligence and surveillance capabilities. This would align with the global trend of increasing reliance on technological means for intelligence gathering and analysis. Conclusion One of the primary challenges Kalin will face is navigating the complex regional dynamics, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean. How he manages relationships with key players in these regions, while advancing Turkey’s interests, will be a critical aspect of his tenure. Additionally, Kalin will need to address the evolving nature of security threats, including cyber threats and the shifting landscape of terrorism and extremism. Balancing traditional intelligence methods with innovative approaches will be key to effectively countering these challenges. The appointment of Kalin as the new head of the MİT represents a pivotal moment for Turkish intelligence. His background and close ties to the presidency suggest a potential shift in the operational and strategic focus of the organization. As Kalin takes on this role, his decisions and strategies will not only shape the future trajectory of the MİT but also play a significant role in Turkish foreign policy and its clandestine operations. His leadership will be instrumental in determining how Turkey navigates its complex regional and international environment in the coming years.55 About the authors: Dr. John Hatzadony is Program Chair at Rabdan Academy.

Demilitarizing Environmental Protection Will Benefit Colombia’s B...	By Dr Caroline Delgado and Tatjana Edle von Peter The peace process in Colombia has transformed the country’s security landscape. With the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC), once the largest guerrilla force in the Western hemisphere, laying down its arms, environmental degradation has become a major national security concern, fuelled by illegal logging, deforestation, wildlife trafficking, mining, and the cultivation and processing of coca and other drug crops. The rise in environmental crime not only endangers Colombia’s rich biodiversity but also risks destabilizing the fragile peace. Successive Colombian governments have pursued an increasingly militarized approach to environmental protectionsince 2010. This has exacerbated the suffering of marginalized ethnic communities and subsistence farmers—who are vital to environmental stewardship and conservation and have already endured some of the harshestimpactsof over 50 years of armed conflict. The militarized approach perpetuates cycles of violence and neglect, reinforcing the historical power imbalances that have driven Colombia’s past conflicts and could well drive new ones, while the scale of environmental degradation has grown. By undermining and even criminalizing those who have sustainably managed the land for generations, the militarized approach not only deepens their marginalization but also threatens the ecosystems that sustain them and the well-being of future generations. This blog explores why this is happening and what needs to be done. The peace process and the rise of environmental crime A 2016 peace agreement formally ended over 50 years of armed conflict between FARC and the Colombian government. FARC had already declared a unilateral indefinite ceasefire inDecember 2014, which—although it was occasionally breached—significantly de-escalated the conflict, particularly in the rural areas where the conflict had been most intense. These areas were predominantly inhabited by marginalized small-scale subsistence farmers (campesinos) and ethnic communities, including Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities. The agreement explicitly recognized these communities as some of the main victims of the armed conflict, due to both direct violence and state neglect. Social inclusion and the integration of Colombia’s peripheral and conflict-affected regions are at the heart of the agreement’s ‘territorial-based approach’; a chapter on comprehensive rural reform seeks to close the gap between marginalized rural areas and prosperous urban centres. By mid 2017, FARC had ceased to exist and by 2020, more than 13000 former FARC combatants had demobilized. However, around800former FARC members rejected the peace agreement andthousandswho initially demobilized havetaken up armsagain, joining either FARC dissident groups—whose members are believed to total more than5200—or other non-state armed groups. Before the peace process, FARC’s control over certain regions of Colombia—many of them environmentally sensitive—unintentionally acted as a safeguard for biodiversity bylimiting deforestation. FARC forces used theforest canopyto provide cover and in some cases protected the environment for local farmers, penalizing excessive logging and hunting. Their presence alsoblockedinfrastructure development, industrial agriculture, and resource extraction by national or foreign companies. FARC’s demobilization, however, created a security vacuum that criminal organizations, including FARC dissident groups, were quick to exploit for unsustainable resource extraction. FARC’s departure also provided smallholders, large landowners and international companies with opportunities to expand into remote forest areas that had previously been toodangerous. Post-conflict investment and economic expectations led to land grabbing, speculation and conversion. Amid these changes environmental crime surged. Between 2015 and 2017, deforestation—driven mainly by cattle ranching, illegal mining and drug trafficking—increased by 77 per cent and only in2022did rates come back down to the 2015 level. From2016to2020, areas impacted by alluvial gold mining rose by 20 per cent, withtwo thirdsof the mining being illegal. Despite a slight decline in the total area used for mining in 2022, the share of mining that was illegal grew to73 per centbetween 2021 and 2022.Nearly halfof all alluvial gold mining sites overlap with coca cultivation areas, which themselves expanded by140 per centbetween 2015 and 2022. Deforestation is also tied to illegal land grabbing, where state-owned land, forest reserves and Indigenous territories are cleared and occupied. By converting forested land into, for example, cattle pasture, land grabbers gain short-term profits and lay the groundwork for future legalownership. Militarized environmental protection In response to these developments, as well as mounting international pressure on the Colombian government to protect the Amazon as a crucial carbon sink, Colombia’s armed forces have become deeply involved in environmental protection and the fight against environmental crime. In 2018 the government created the Comprehensive Environmental Protection Force (Fuerza Integral de Protección Ambiental). This body, involving the Ministry of National Defence along with environmental authorities and the Attorney General’s Office,was tasked with safeguarding ecosystems, biodiversity and natural resources. A year later, a military operation, Operación Artemisa, was launched to combat deforestation, illegal mining and wildlife trafficking, deploying23000 membersof Colombia’s police and armed forces during its first year. Although the operation recovered 21480 hectares of forest, it faced strong opposition and criticism for targeting smallholder farmers and violating their human rights while failing to stop the larger financiers ofdeforestation. Thedefence and security policyadopted under the presidency of Iván Duque Márquez (2018–22) emphasized the protection of water, biodiversity and natural resources as a strategic priority. It created specialized military units focused on environmental protection. TheZonas Futuro strategy, launched in 2019 as part of the peace process implementation, further intensified militarization by integratingarmy, navy and police effortsto bolster security presence and intelligence in violence-prone areas. Despite criticism of militarized approaches to environmental protection, the government formed in 2022 has maintained environmental security as a central element of itssecurity and defence strategy. Mixed results and unintended consequences Data suggests that, aside from the recent decline in deforestation, the militarized approach has largely failed not only to curb environmental crime but also to protect its victims. Since the peace agreement was signed, more than1200human rights defenders andlíderes sociales(social leaders) have been killed, and in 2023 alone,79environmental human rights defenders were killed, most of them members of ethnic communities andcampesinosfighting to defend their land. The main perpetrators of the violence are non-state armed groups that drive and profit from environmental crime and the shadow economy it supports. They also commit kidnappings, child recruitment, coercive displacement or confinement, and other abuses. However, the armed forces have also been accused of victimizing marginalized ethnic groups and subsistence farming communities, employingexcessive force,sexual violence,unlawful killings,arbitrary arrests, and the destruction of homes andlivelihoods. Much of this has been officially justified as part of combating environmental crime, but many claim that it has been used as a means torepress, silence and stigmatizethose exercising their rights. While somecampesinosand members of ethnic communities do engage in illegal activities such as land clearing, coca cultivation and informal mining, this has often been a survival strategy in response to long-standing state neglect in rural areas. Despite this, and the fact that they play only aminor rolein large-scale environmental destruction and are oftencoercedby armed groups, the militarized response has disproportionately targeted small-scale farmers at the lowest echelons of criminal enterprises or who are simply farming in protected areas. Ways forward Since the new government took office in 2022, there has been growing recognition of the challenges marginalized communities face in relation to environmental crime and official responses to it. The latest national developmentplanandsecurity policyemphasize a people-centred, community-based approach focused on addressing the root causes of conflict and crime. This hopefully heralds a shift from prosecuting small-scale farmers to targeting the criminal organizations behind illegal economies, including those funding deforestation. While this is a welcome development, it is essential that the role of the armed forces in environmental protection is reduced to a minimum. Striking a balance between enforcing environmental laws and safeguarding human rights is crucial. Although the military may be necessary to confront non-state armed groups contributing to violence and fuelling environmental crime, the marginalized populations who feel the most negative effects from these activities should instead be supported by strong, democratic institutions that prioritize equity as well assecurity. At the heart of this issue lies the need toprotectbiodiversity and the people safeguarding these areas. Colombia’s struggles against deforestation and environmental crime stem from a complex interplay of legal and illegal activities, sociopolitical dynamics, and economic incentives. These challenges are deeply rooted in more than half a century of armed conflict, including the profound disconnect between the socio-economic models shaped by the state and elites—often enforced through violence by the illegal armed groups, in particularparamilitaries—and the survival strategies of marginalized local communities. Ethnic groups, particularly Indigenous peoples, andcampesinosare among the most committed defenders of biodiversity. Their ancestral practices and traditional knowledge could be crucial to preserving ecosystems. Although Indigenous knowledge systems are diverse, many share a common understanding of ecological degradation: it stems from the denial of the interdependence betweenhumans and nature. Indigenous worldviews emphasize this interconnectedness and the responsibilities that flow from it. In Colombia’s struggle to address its environmental challenges, these communities, alongside other ethnic minorities andcampesinos, should be treated as partners in conservation efforts, not penalized by a militarized response.

Sudan Chaos Could Create Terrorism Haven – Analysis	The chaos that has engulfed Sudan since war broke out in April 2023 could make the country a nexus for terrorism that connects violent extremists in the Sahel with terror groups in Somalia and even Yemen, observers say. 'I really feel quite frightened about this,' Abdalla Hamdok, Sudan’s former prime minister, told the Financial Times. 'With Sudan bordering seven countries, it will become fertile ground for terrorism in a region that is very fragile.' Hamdok said a return to civilian rule is the best way to prevent terrorism from taking root in Sudan. After he took the reins of a short-lived civilian government in 2020, the international community eased decades-old terrorism-related restrictions on Sudan. Sudan’s military leaders deposed Hamdok in 2021 as civilians were about to take control of the government as part of the transition from 30 years of rule by dictator Omar al-Bashir. Less than two years later, those military leaders — Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) leader Gen. Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagalo — turned on each other. Since then, 150,000 people have been killed, more than 10 million have fled their homes and half of the country’s 49 million residents face famine. Sudan under al-Bashir was an extremist haven. The country hosted al-Qaida and its founder, Osama bin Laden, for many years in the 1990s before bin Laden moved to Afghanistan. 'The political conditions in Sudan in the 1990s were similar in some respects to the situation today: Sudan was riven by civil war and ruled by a military dictatorship that had only recently come to power,' analyst Suliman Baldo wrote in the Sudan War Monitor. Sudan’s civil war has drawn the attention of extremist groups, particularly social media channels aligned with the Islamic State group (IS). 'These outlets see the violent clashes between the SAF and RSF as an opportunity to exploit the chaos and discredit its rivals, from local governments to other jihadist groups, like the Afghan Taliban,' analyst Herbert Maack wrote recently for the Jamestown Foundation. IS encourages supporters to take weapons from the SAF and RSF and to fight to impose Shariah in Sudan, according to Maack. After it emerged in Iraq and Syria a decade ago, IS drew hundreds of radicalized Sudanese citizens to its cause. Sudanese extremists also have joined Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region and terrorist groups in Libya. Sudanese native Bilal al-Sudani rose to a leadership position in IS’s Somali branch before he was killed in a counterterrorism action in 2023. Sudan’s location between the Sahel and the Red Sea already has made it a logistical hub for terrorists across the region. According to the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, IS has financial operations in Sudan and up to 200 veteran fighters on the ground who coordinate logistics, including moving other extremists into southern Libya, Mali and beyond. Sudan’s IS operatives recently announced on Telegram that they pledged allegiance to the organization’s new caliph, Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The presence of IS-aligned fighters in Sudan creates the potential that Sudanese fighters outside the country could return and boost the existing groups, expanding Sudan’s role as a bridge between terrorists in the Sahel, Somalia and even Yemen, according to Maack. 'This increases the risk of Sudan’s re-emergence as an African hub for jihadist terrorism,' Maack wrote.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfAk3VI56g9Nm0w25waxoWd	2024-10-23T17:00:41-07:00
