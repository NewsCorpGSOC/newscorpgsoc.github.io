The Man In The Iron Musk: Billionaire Behind Trump Comeback – Ana...	When Donald Trump announced his 'great victory' as the results of the US presidential election started coming in, he specifically thanked one person who had played a key role in helping him return to presidency. In a speech at West Palm Beach, Florida, he praised Elon Musk, calling him his strongest supporter in the presidential race. He referred to Musk as 'a star', highlighting the impact of the billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk has been a major force in Trump's return—not only by investing millions into his campaign, but also by advising on policy and promoting his ideas. He has even used his X social media platform as a strong supporter of the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) movement. Elon Musk shared on X that the future would be 'amazing' as it became clear that Donald Trump would be back in the White House. This statement hints at Musk's optimistic view on the direction America may take with Trump's return, signalling his belief in positive changes ahead. The billionaire's influence could grow significantly with Trump in office again, as Trump once hinted that his supporter may take on a role like 'secretary of cost-cutting' in his Cabinet. This shows Trump's confidence in the billionaire's skills to help reduce government spending. Experts caution that Musk, whose company, SpaceX, already holds significant influence as a key defence contractor for the government, could potentially gain the power to 'oversee those who typically set the rules'. This suggests he may have an unusual level of control over the authorities who usually regulate businesses. Now that the election dust has settled, here is a simple lowdown on how the world's wealthiest person played a key role in creating one of the most unexpected political comebacks in history. How did Musk use his wealth and influence to help Trump regain his position and what motivated him to do so? Musk's Contribution to Trump's Campaign It is clear that billionaires had more influence than ever in both the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Microsoft's Bill Gates and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Vice-President Kamala Harris. However, it was Musk's broad support for Trump that truly made an impact. Musk's influence and resources played a significant role in shaping Trump's comeback. According to the Federal Election Commission's ((FEC's) final disclosures last month before election day, Musk contributed around $132 million to Trump and other Republicans leading up to the 2024 election. The FEC is a government agency that oversees, and enforces, rules on campaign funding in US elections, ensuring donations and spending are transparent and legal. Two major donations—$43.6 million and $75 million—were channelled directly into Trump's campaign efforts, particularly benefiting the America Political Action Committee (PAC) founded by Musk. The America PAC is a fundraising group that supports political campaigns, such as Trump's, by collecting donations. PACs help gather, and spend, money to promote specific candidates and political causes. In a controversial move, Musk started a cash giveaway in important swing states. Registered voters who signed a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments—which protect free speech and the right to own firearms—were given a chance to win $1 million each day. Musk announced at a campaign event on October 19, 'Every day from now until the election, we'll randomly award $1 million to people who have signed the petition.' The action faced a legal challenge in Pennsylvania after the US Justice Department cautioned that the group may be violating election laws, which prohibit offering payments to encourage people to register to vote. On Monday, November 4, judges allowed Musk's cash giveaway to continue after his lawyers clarified how winners were chosen. Instead of being picked randomly, the winners were selected as 'vetted spokespeople', meaning they were carefully chosen based on specific criteria. This approach, possibly, ensured they would promote the campaign in a controlled and positive way, rather than just handing money to anyone who signed the petition. The court accepted this method, giving Musk the green light to keep the giveaway running. Musk is now facing a class-action lawsuit—a legal case filed by a group of people with similar complaints—from voters who say he misled them into signing the petition by making them believe they had a real chance of winning the $1 million. According to Al-Jazeera, the lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty, who also claimed that Musk used the giveaway to gather personal data and boost traffic to X. This was possible because people who signed up for the giveaway possibly had to provide personal details, such as their contact information or social media profiles. By collecting this data, Musk's team could build a list of contacts and use it to reach more people on X, increasing the platform's traffic and visibility. This strategy could help promote X, while also gaining valuable information about the participants. FEC records revealed that Musk had donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee (PAC) focused on 'protecting and expanding the Republican Senate Majority'. This support could potentially help Republicans regain control of the Senate in this election. FEC filings are official records that track donations to political campaigns and committees, showing who is funding political activities and how much they are giving. Musk is said to have made additional donations to Republican candidates that have not been reported. Ways X Was Used to Promote MAGA Views It may seem unusual now, but Elon Musk was once seen as a liberal and a supporter of renewable energy. He even said he had voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Since taking over Twitter in 2022, which has since been renamed X, this image has changed. After promising to make Twitter a 'politically neutral' platform, Musk let go of the employees who were in charge of checking for false information. He also reinstated over 62,000 accounts that had been suspended, including those linked to white nationalists and neo-Nazis—groups that promote hatred and racism, often targeting people of colour, Jews and other minorities—known for spreading hate speech and conspiracy theories. Importantly, he also lifted the ban on Trump's account, which had been suspended by the platform following the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol—a situation many believe Trump influenced. As the election approached, critics argued that X had essentially turned into an unofficial platform promoting the MAGA side of the Republican Party. The owner himself faced accusations of openly supporting Trump and sharing misleading information with his 200 million followers, with X's algorithm boosting his influence even further. One example involved a fake video of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, edited with a false voiceover saying, 'I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire' (meaning choosing someone for a job partly to increase variety in backgrounds, such as race or gender). Musk shared this video in July, commenting 'this is amazing' with a laughing emoji. This re-post added 136 million more views to the video. False information about 'illegal immigrants' voting in the election spread across X. This claim was shared widely, although, in the US, only citizens can vote in federal elections. Non-citizens, regardless of their immigration status, are not allowed to participate in these elections. Studies from both conservative and liberal groups show this offence is very rare. While breaking this law can lead to serious consequences, such as up to a year in jail, fines, or even deportation, the research suggests that very few people actually commit this offence. A conspiracy theory spread on X, with Musk, himself, promoting it, claimed that Democrats were bringing in undocumented immigrants and planning to grant them amnesty to increase their voter base in future elections. After Trump's debate with Harris in September, where he falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio town were eating cats and dogs, Musk shared a meme featuring a cat holding a sign that said, 'Kamala hates me', followed by a laughing emoji. Although Musk claims to support free speech, he has blocked some news stories, including one by journalist Ken Klippenstein, as reported by Al-Jazeera. This article discussed the weaknesses of Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, reportedly based on leaked documents. Although the journalist's account was eventually restored, access to the article's links remained blocked. A survey by the Pew Research Center in March showed the platform's rising popularity with Republican supporters. About 53% felt it was 'good for democracy', nearly three times the 17% who had said the same in 2021. Musk's Reasons for Aligning with Trump The combined support from their fan bases strengthened the Trump-Musk alliance. Not too long ago, Trump and Musk did not use to get along. In 2022, Trump called Musk a 'bulls**t artist', accusing him of lying about supporting him in the 2016 election. Musk replied on Twitter that it was 'time for Trump to retire and ride off into the sunset'. Two years later, the tech mogul stood alongside Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wearing a black MAGA hat. Musk's shift towards more conservative views is often linked to the forced shutdown of his Tesla factories during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, he defied orders by reopening a plant in Fremont, California, saying he was prepared to face arrest. This move was seen as a stance against what he viewed as excessive government control and red tape. Musk's move towards conservative views is evident in his connections with leaders who also oppose regulations, such as Argentina's President, Javier Milei. Musk has also formed connections with conservative leaders around the world, including Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. This shows his growing alignment with Right-wing viewpoints on the global stage. Several American media outlets, including Vanity Fair and the Washington Post, have suggested that a significant reason behind this situation may be connected to one of Musk's children coming out as transgender in 2022. This child decided to distance from Musk and changed the last name to Wilson. In an interview with Jordan Peterson—a Canadian psychologist, professor and author known for his views on culture, politics and personal responsibility who gained attention for his opposition to certain gender identity policies in Canada, arguing they infringed on free speech—Musk shared that he felt 'tricked' into agreeing to his child's medical treatment. Following this, he announced a mission against what he called the 'woke mind virus', a term used to describe what some people see as strict or extreme ideas about social issues, which they feel spread like a 'virus' and may limit free speech or push certain beliefs too strongly. The medical treatment Musk mentioned, possibly, relates to gender-affirming care—support that helps a person's physical characteristics align with their gender identity—for his transgender child. This type of care can include counselling, hormone therapy, or other steps to support their gender identity. Musk's statement about feeling 'tricked' suggests he felt pressured or misled into agreeing to this care without fully understanding it or feeling comfortable with the decision. In 2021, Musk moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto, California, located in Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas. At the same time, he also relocated his own residence from California to Texas. In July, Musk announced plans to move his companies, SpaceX and X, from California to Texas. This move is linked to a recent California law that stops schools from requiring teachers to inform parents if a student changes their gender identity. Musk's decision highlights his disagreement with this policy, as he believes that parents should be kept informed of such changes. By relocating, Musk is signalling his stance on the importance of parental involvement in these sensitive matters. Helping Trump Connect with Young Men Some people believe that Musk and Donald Trump, who act bold and different from others, have connected with many American men who feel left out or misunderstood. Movements like #MeToo, which highlight harassment issues and talk about 'toxic masculinity', have left some men feeling judged or ignored. Musk and Trump's strong, rule-breaking personalities appeal to these men, who see them as leaders speaking to their concerns and frustrations. Last month, in The New York Times, John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard's Institute of Politics, described Trump's efforts to attract young male voters as a 'master class in connecting with men'. Trump's strategy to win over young male voters seems to be working. A recent Harvard Youth Poll showed that 35% of men aged 18-24 expressed support for Trump, an increase of 5% over a survey in 2020. This attitude is often reflected in popular 'bro' podcasts, such as the 'Joe Rogan Experience'. Joe Rogan is a popular podcast host, comedian and former TV personality known for his above-mentioned show. On his podcast, he talks with a wide range of guests, including celebrities, scientists and political figures, discussing topics from current events to science, health and culture. Known for his casual, conversational style, he is popular among young men. After interviewing Musk, Rogan gave his support to Trump on Monday (November 4). Rogan shared on X, praising Musk, saying, 'Elon Musk is truly incredible. Without him, we'd be in trouble. He presents what I believe is the strongest argument for supporting Trump, and I agree with him completely.' This message struck a chord with many people. Just two days later, Trump was elected as the 47th President of the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-11-09T17:57:24-08:00	
The Influence Of Political Psychology On Energy Diplomacy: Unpack...	In an increasingly interdependent world, energy resources have become essential bargaining chips in international relations. Countries engage in energy diplomacy to secure access to these vital resources, balancing national interests with global alliances. While economic factors traditionally dominate discussions on energy diplomacy, political psychology offers a unique lens to understand the motivations and strategies driving these complex negotiations. Political psychology examines how cognitive biases, perceptions of threat, social identity, and leadership psychology influence decisions. This perspective is essential for understanding how psychological factors shape the strategies and outcomes of energy diplomacy worldwide. Defining Political Psychology in the Context of Energy Diplomacy Political psychology combines insights from psychology and political science to understand how leaders and nations make decisions under uncertainty, stress, and competitive pressure. In energy diplomacy, psychological factors such as risk perception, threat assessment, and identity politics play a crucial role in shaping diplomatic behavior. Political psychology addresses questions like: How do leaders perceive energy security risks? How do cognitive biases impact the negotiation strategies of different nations? By exploring these questions, political psychology can provide deeper insight into the drivers of energy diplomacy. 1. Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making in Energy Diplomacy Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking that influence how individuals interpret and act on information. In energy diplomacy, common biases can significantly shape decision-making. a. Status Quo Bias Status quo bias can cause countries to favor familiar energy sources and partners, even when alternative strategies may offer long-term benefits. This reluctance to change existing energy arrangements often stems from the psychological comfort of maintaining predictable alliances. Example: European Union countries' historical reliance on Russian gas can be partially attributed to status quo bias. Despite growing concerns over energy security, these countries were initially hesitant to diversify energy sources due to the perceived risks of changing an established supply relationship. b. Anchoring Bias Anchoring bias can lead negotiators to focus on specific numbers or initial conditions in a negotiation, potentially overlooking other relevant factors. This bias can be particularly influential in energy pricing negotiations, where early price offers may set a psychological anchor, making it challenging to reach more flexible or advantageous agreements. Example: In negotiations on oil prices, initial figures proposed by a supplier may anchor the perceptions of buyers, making it difficult for them to negotiate significantly lower prices even if market conditions change. c. Availability Heuristic The availability heuristic leads individuals to base judgments on recent or easily recalled events rather than on comprehensive data. In energy diplomacy, leaders might overemphasize recent energy crises, leading to heightened perceptions of energy security risks. Example: Following disruptions in oil supply chains, policymakers may over-prioritize securing stable oil sources at the expense of exploring renewable options, influenced by the availability of recent disruptions. 2. Threat Perception and National Identity in Energy Diplomacy Threat perception plays a central role in how countries approach energy diplomacy, influencing both defensive and offensive strategies. The psychological dimensions of national identity and perceived threats often shape a country's approach to securing energy resources. a. Energy Security as a National Identity Component In many countries, energy self-sufficiency is closely tied to national identity and pride. Countries with limited energy resources may perceive their dependence on foreign energy as a threat to sovereignty. This perception can lead to aggressive efforts to secure diversified energy sources, often through high-stakes diplomacy or even militarization of energy corridors. Example: China's Belt and Road Initiative, which includes strategic investments in energy infrastructure across Asia and Africa, is partly driven by a perceived need to secure energy independence, which is viewed as essential to national identity and long-term security. b. Social Identity Theory in Regional Energy Alliances Social identity theory suggests that people derive a sense of self from group memberships, leading to in-group favoritism and out-group hostility. In energy diplomacy, this manifests in regional alliances where countries with shared identity markers (such as cultural or ideological commonalities) collaborate on energy projects to counter perceived threats from opposing blocs. Example: The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries often collaborate on oil and gas projects based on shared cultural, religious, and geopolitical identities. This alliance serves as a counterbalance to perceived threats from neighboring regions, particularly in maintaining influence in global energy markets. 3. The Role of Leadership Psychology in Energy Diplomacy Political psychology also focuses on how leaders' personal characteristics, cognitive styles, and stress tolerance influence energy diplomacy. Leaders bring their unique psychological profiles to the table, impacting decisions and shaping diplomatic relationships. a. Cognitive Complexity in Diplomatic Negotiations Cognitive complexity refers to an individual's ability to understand and integrate multiple perspectives. Leaders with high cognitive complexity are often better equipped to navigate the intricacies of energy diplomacy, finding compromises that benefit both parties. In contrast, leaders with low cognitive complexity may approach negotiations with rigid, black-and-white thinking. Example: The contrasting styles of U.S. presidents regarding Middle East energy policies show the impact of cognitive complexity. Presidents with higher cognitive complexity, such as Barack Obama, have tended to pursue nuanced, multilateral strategies, whereas those with more straightforward views have favored aggressive, unilateral approaches. b. Risk Tolerance and Crisis Response Energy diplomacy often involves high-stakes negotiations under significant pressure, where leaders' tolerance for risk plays a critical role. Leaders with high risk tolerance may be more willing to explore new energy partnerships or take bold steps toward energy independence, while those with low risk tolerance may prefer stability over innovation. Example: Leaders in countries with volatile energy supplies, such as Venezuela, often exhibit high-risk tolerance in seeking alternative energy alliances, reflecting a willingness to experiment with unconventional partnerships to secure national energy needs. 4. Public Opinion and Domestic Psychological Pressures Domestic public opinion and the collective psychological state of a nation significantly influence energy diplomacy. Politicians may adopt strategies that align with public attitudes toward energy security and national sovereignty, especially when energy diplomacy affects employment, the cost of living, or environmental sustainability. a. Nationalism and Energy Independence In many countries, energy independence is seen as a source of national pride. Politicians may respond to nationalist sentiments by pursuing energy policies that prioritize self-sufficiency, even at the expense of cost-effectiveness or environmental impact. Nationalism can push leaders toward aggressive energy policies that emphasize independence over international collaboration. Example: The 'America First' policy during Donald Trump's presidency saw increased investment in U.S. fossil fuel industries, with the goal of reducing dependency on foreign oil—a strategy driven by nationalist appeals to energy independence. b. Environmental Psychology and Public Support for Green Energy Diplomacy As climate change awareness grows, public support for renewable energy has increased. Environmental psychology shows that when people feel directly impacted by environmental degradation, they are more likely to support sustainable energy policies. This shift in public opinion influences political leaders to adopt energy diplomacy strategies that favor renewable energy partnerships. Example: In Europe, where public concern for climate change is high, governments are more inclined to form alliances for renewable energy projects, aligning diplomatic efforts with public demand for sustainability. 5. Psychological Impact of Historical Events on Energy Diplomacy Historical events, particularly energy crises, can have long-lasting psychological impacts on a nation's energy policy. Collective memory of energy shortages or price spikes can lead to heightened vigilance and preventive diplomacy aimed at mitigating future risks. a. The Legacy of the 1970s Oil Crisis The oil crisis of the 1970s left a psychological imprint on many countries, particularly in the West, leading to a collective desire for energy independence. This historical memory influences current energy diplomacy, motivating countries to avoid over-reliance on single suppliers. Example: Japan's energy policies are heavily influenced by the 1970s oil crisis, with efforts to secure diversified energy sources and pursue diplomatic ties with various energy-exporting nations to avoid dependency on any single country. b. Psychological Trauma of Energy Disruptions in Developing Nations In developing nations that have experienced energy shortages, psychological trauma from these events can drive policies aimed at securing stable and affordable energy sources. This may involve alliances with energy-rich countries, even if these relationships are politically complicated. Example: Bangladesh's efforts to secure steady natural gas supplies through diplomatic negotiations with neighboring countries are partially driven by the collective memory of frequent power outages that disrupted daily life and economic growth. Conclusion Political psychology offers invaluable insights into the underlying motivations and strategic decisions that drive energy diplomacy. By analyzing cognitive biases, national identity, leadership psychology, and public opinion, political psychology provides a nuanced understanding of how countries navigate the complex landscape of global energy relations. For policymakers, incorporating psychological insights into diplomatic strategy can lead to more effective, resilient, and adaptive approaches to securing energy resources. As nations continue to grapple with the challenges of energy security in a rapidly changing world, the psychological dimensions of diplomacy will play an increasingly central role in shaping the future of international energy relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-11-09T17:55:16-08:00	
Education Under Siege: Examining Taliban’s Restrictions On Female...	The return of the Taliban in August 2021 marked a critical turning point for Afghanistan, especially in the realm of women’s rights and education. Historically, women’s education in Afghanistan has been a contested domain, marked by ideological conflicts and restrictive measures, with significant progress achieved during the last two decades under international support (UNICEF, 2015). The Taliban’s rapid imposition of bans on secondary education for girls and university access for women not only signals a severe policy regression but also intensifies a cultural shift that reinforces gender-based segregation (Amnesty International, 2022). These restrictions, justified by the Taliban as aligned with Islamic values, have faced widespread criticism from scholars who argue that Islamic teachings support education for all genders, revealing inconsistencies in the Taliban’s rationale (Quraishi-Landes, 2021). The socio-cultural implications of these restrictions are profound, as education is globally recognized as vital for individual and societal development. The World Bank (2018) and UNESCO (2020) emphasize that access to education correlates with economic stability, lower poverty, and better health outcomes, all of which become increasingly inaccessible for Afghan society under the Taliban's restrictive policies. The Taliban’s limitations on female employment in the education and public sectors further exacerbate economic insecurity, disempowering educated women and limiting household economic contributions. This has resulted in broader social consequences, as educated Afghan women have historically contributed significantly to essential fields like healthcare and civil services (Human Rights Watch, 2021). At the community level, restricting female education is linked to increased rates of early marriage and domestic violence, as economic dependence and constrained options heighten vulnerability (UN Women, 2022). Psychologically, the loss of educational opportunities has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and identity crises among young Afghan girls, undermining their sense of autonomy and purpose (Medica Mondiale, 2023). In denying women education, the Taliban constrains not only individual development but also community progress, as research indicates educated women enhance community well-being and civic engagement (World Bank, 2018). The theoretical framework of this analysis draws from feminist and human rights perspectives. Feminist theory reveals the Taliban’s restrictions as reflective of systemic patriarchy, imposing limitations on women’s public roles while confining them to traditional domestic spheres (hooks, 2000). In parallel, a human rights perspective frames education as a fundamental right, essential for autonomy and societal participation, and emphasizes that the Taliban’s policies infringe upon international human rights standards (CEDAW, 1979; OHCHR, 2021). This analysis integrates both quantitative data and qualitative accounts, using a mixed-methods approach. By combining primary sources, such as Afghan government and international organization reports, with secondary research, the study provides a comprehensive examination of both policy impacts and societal responses (Amnesty International, 2023). While the Taliban contends that these educational restrictions reflect cultural values, critics argue this defense misrepresents both Islamic and Afghan values, suggesting instead that these policies serve as mechanisms of control rather than religious adherence (Abu-Lughod, 2002; Aslan, 2005). The ramifications of these policies extend beyond the education sector, with adverse effects on Afghanistan’s socio-economic stability and gender equality. For these reasons, international advocacy is essential to restore educational access for Afghan girls, bolstering societal resilience against gender oppression and reversing regressive policies. In conclusion, the Taliban’s restrictions on female education represent an infringement on basic human rights and a hindrance to Afghanistan’s societal progress, underscoring the need for sustained global intervention and support for Afghan women’s right to education. Taliban’s Restrictions on Female Education The Taliban’s restrictive policies on female education in Afghanistan are profoundly impactful, with wide-ranging consequences on Afghan society. Their policies, enforced by the Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, prohibit girls from attending secondary school and restrict women's participation in higher education. These bans are unprecedented in scale, severely limiting the educational aspirations and career potential of Afghan girls and women. Historically, the Taliban's ideology has opposed Western-style education, and since 2021, they have systematically dismantled educational access for females, contrary to the significant strides made toward gender equality in Afghanistan over the previous two decades (Human Rights Watch, 2022). According to Amnesty International (2023), these bans have impacted over one million Afghan girls, denying them the fundamental right to education. As noted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2023), these restrictions significantly set back Afghanistan’s educational and economic progress, with potential generational consequences for the well-being and socio-economic standing of Afghan families and communities. The Taliban’s Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice enforces these policies through various mechanisms, including surveillance, fear tactics, and public shaming. The Ministry’s role is crucial in ensuring compliance with Taliban decrees, as officials patrol schools and universities, often imposing fines or punitive measures on educators or families who attempt to bypass restrictions (UN Women, 2022). This institutionalized surveillance and control over female education have cultivated an environment of fear and uncertainty. Female students and educators report feeling constantly watched and intimidated, leading many to self-censor or withdraw from education out of concern for personal and family safety (Medica Mondiale, 2023). This intimidation strategy has been particularly effective, as families often choose to keep girls at home, prioritizing security over educational opportunities. In assessing the impacts of these policies, specific cases reveal both the persistence of Afghan girls and women and the oppressive reactions they face. For example, small, covert networks of teachers in Afghanistan have been reported to organize secret schooling initiatives for girls barred from formal education. Such efforts demonstrate resilience, yet they are met with repression. Reports document cases where teachers and students involved in clandestine education initiatives face threats, physical violence, or detention, underscoring the severe limitations on educational resistance (BBC, 2023). Moreover, testimonies from affected women highlight the deep psychological toll of these restrictions. One Afghan girl, Fatima, explained, 'I feel like my future has been stolen from me… I cannot dream of becoming a doctor or a teacher now because I am not allowed to study' (Amnesty International, 2023). Such narratives exemplify the intense psychological distress and sense of hopelessness experienced by many Afghan girls, who, deprived of education, see few paths to personal or economic independence. From a feminist theoretical perspective, the Taliban’s policies on female education can be viewed as a means of enforcing patriarchal control, aiming to maintain traditional gender hierarchies by confining women to domestic roles. This approach aligns with feminist critiques of institutionalized patriarchy, which argue that restricting women’s access to education perpetuates social structures that keep them economically and socially dependent on men (hooks, 2000). In parallel, a human rights framework further emphasizes that the right to education is protected under international conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979). By denying education to girls and women, the Taliban’s policies constitute a clear violation of this fundamental right. The broader societal consequences of these policies are grave: without education, Afghan girls are more susceptible to forced marriages, health complications, and economic dependency, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social inequality (World Bank, 2018). So, the Taliban’s policies on female education not only infringe upon individual rights but also erode the social and economic fabric of Afghan society. By analyzing these restrictions through feminist and human rights lenses, it is clear that education for Afghan girls is not merely about schooling but about the broader societal empowerment and progress of Afghan communities. These policies, therefore, represent a profound setback, both in terms of Afghanistan’s development and in the global fight for gender equality. Given the dire implications, continued international advocacy and support for Afghan girls' right to education are essential to challenge and ultimately reverse these regressive policies. Socio-Cultural Implications of Restricted Female Education in Afghanistan The Taliban’s policies restricting female education have far-reaching socio-cultural consequences that extend beyond the classroom, impacting women’s empowerment, family dynamics, and community structures in Afghanistan. First, the long-term restriction of education significantly diminishes women's roles in society, perpetuating a cycle of dependence and limiting opportunities for individual and collective empowerment. Without access to education, women lack the skills needed for economic independence, perpetuating a reliance on male family members. According to UNESCO (2023), limiting female education directly impacts women's employment rates and constrains their participation in the workforce, exacerbating poverty and widening gender inequalities. This impact is particularly concerning when considered through feminist theoretical perspectives that highlight education as a fundamental pathway to self-empowerment and social mobility (hooks, 2000). Denying Afghan girls this pathway restricts not only their potential but also their capacity to contribute meaningfully to Afghanistan’s economic and social development. Broader societal consequences include profound shifts in family dynamics and the structure of community relationships. In Afghan society, women’s traditional roles are already constrained by conservative interpretations of gender roles, but the Taliban’s policies deepen this marginalization. Research has shown that educated women tend to make more informed choices regarding family planning and health, leading to healthier families and higher child survival rates (World Bank, 2018). Restricting education undermines this potential, leading to communities with limited access to health and wellness knowledge, which can perpetuate cycles of poor health and high dependency rates. In areas where female education was previously more accessible, families now struggle to adjust to restrictions that limit young women’s futures, which has led to increases in early and forced marriages as parents seek security for their daughters in the absence of education (Amnesty International, 2023). This shift reflects an alteration in cultural norms, reinforcing gender-specific expectations and lowering aspirations for young girls, who come to see these marriages as their only feasible path. The psychological impact on female students deprived of education is severe. Studies indicate that educational deprivation contributes to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and a diminished sense of self-worth, particularly in societies where education is a primary avenue for personal growth and social integration (Medica Mondiale, 2023). Many Afghan girls and young women express feelings of hopelessness and frustration, as described by UN Women (2022), which captures testimonies of Afghan girls who fear a future of 'enforced ignorance' and lost potential. Psychological theories on self-determination suggest that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are essential for psychological health, all of which are compromised when education is restricted (Ryan & Deci, 2000). In Afghanistan, where these educational restrictions are tied to policies of control rather than individual choice, the resultant impact on mental health is particularly profound. A generation of girls deprived of education may be at risk of internalizing low self-esteem and diminished agency, further entrenching the cultural narrative that women’s roles should be confined to the domestic sphere. This enforced ignorance has implications for future generations as well. Restricted access to education limits not only women’s immediate prospects but also their ability to educate their own children, passing down cycles of restricted knowledge and opportunity. According to UNICEF (2023), educated mothers are more likely to invest in their children's education, thereby raising future generations that value and pursue knowledge. By denying women the chance to learn, the Taliban’s policies disrupt these positive generational cycles, perpetuating poverty and dependency. Consequently, the broader societal effects of these restrictions hinder Afghanistan’s progress toward an equitable society and sustainable development, reinforcing patterns of economic underperformance and social stagnation. The Taliban’s restrictions on female education, therefore, carry implications that reverberate through individual lives, families, and society, ultimately setting Afghanistan on a path that undermines both its human capital and potential for inclusive growth. Thus, the socio-cultural implications of restricted female education in Afghanistan are deeply interconnected, affecting women's empowerment, family structures, and psychological well-being, as well as the future cultural and economic trajectory of Afghan society. The denial of education to Afghan girls not only infringes upon individual rights but also reinforces structural gender inequalities, with implications that threaten the well-being of entire communities and hinder the nation’s development. Addressing these educational restrictions is critical not only for the rights of Afghan girls but also for the broader goal of achieving sustainable, inclusive progress in Afghanistan. Resistance and Resilience amid Educational Restrictions in Afghanistan The resilience of Afghan women in the face of the Taliban’s educational restrictions underscores their commitment to self-determination and societal contribution, despite severe limitations on their autonomy. Afghan women have adopted various strategies of resistance, leveraging both visible and underground forms of activism to challenge these oppressive policies. Notably, protests organized by Afghan women and girls, though often met with violent repression, exemplify a defiant stance against the Taliban’s restrictions. For example, in Kabul, groups of women have gathered to demand access to education, often carrying banners with slogans like 'Education is our right,' despite facing significant personal risks (Human Rights Watch, 2023). These public protests highlight the ongoing agency of Afghan women, who continue to advocate for their rights, thereby underscoring the relevance of human agency within the broader feminist framework that sees such acts as essential to fostering social change (hooks, 2000). Another prominent strategy of resistance is the establishment of underground educational initiatives, where Afghan women educators clandestinely gather students in private homes or safe spaces to continue their studies. These informal networks provide educational resources, instruction, and support, maintaining an educational lifeline for Afghan girls. According to Medica Mondiale (2023), these underground classes, though small and limited, serve as a critical tool for resilience, preserving a semblance of intellectual engagement and community solidarity. In these settings, women are defying not only the Taliban’s mandates but also cultural constraints by fostering environments where girls can learn and interact, albeit discreetly. This form of resistance aligns with feminist theory's emphasis on collective resilience and adaptability as women utilize available resources to protect their rights within restrictive environments (UN Women, 2022). The international community has responded with varied strategies of support, ranging from direct advocacy to funding underground initiatives and providing psychological and educational resources. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the United Nations have issued strong statements condemning the Taliban’s restrictions, labeling them as violations of international human rights standards, particularly concerning the right to education for girls and women (Amnesty International, 2023). These organizations have also actively lobbied for international pressure on the Taliban, urging governments to tie foreign aid and diplomatic recognition to the restoration of women’s rights, including access to education. Such advocacy is rooted in global gender equality principles outlined in documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which highlights education as fundamental to personal and societal development (United Nations, 1948). In addition to advocacy, certain NGOs and international entities have provided material support for underground education efforts within Afghanistan. Organizations like UNICEF and UN Women have contributed educational materials, supplies, and financial support to groups operating discreetly in Taliban-controlled regions. These efforts emphasize the broader socio-political consensus that educational access is integral to human rights, bolstering feminist perspectives that prioritize equal educational opportunities as a foundation for gender parity and self-empowerment (hooks, 2000). However, despite these efforts, challenges remain, as international support is often constrained by political concerns, security risks, and limited access to Taliban-controlled regions, thus complicating the delivery and sustainability of these resources (Crisis Group, 2023). Nevertheless, criticism exists regarding the efficacy of the international response, with some arguing that diplomatic pressure has been inadequate and insufficiently coordinated. Opponents of current approaches argue that without stronger measures—such as economic sanctions or concerted multilateral action—the Taliban is unlikely to modify its policies. This counterpoint suggests that the international community’s responses lack the intensity needed to achieve meaningful change, reflecting a gap in political will rather than a lack of resources (International Crisis Group, 2023). Yet, advocates maintain that consistent international pressure and support, however limited, still offer crucial reinforcement to Afghan women’s resistance, providing psychological and moral support that signals global solidarity with their struggle. Hence, Afghan women’s resistance to educational restrictions, expressed through both public protests and underground schooling, reflects their resilience and unyielding demand for autonomy and equality. The international community’s support, while crucial, remains a complex and challenging endeavor, often falling short of the robust response many activists argue is necessary. Together, these acts of resilience underscore the determination of Afghan women to assert their right to education, despite facing one of the world’s most repressive regimes for women’s rights. Thus, the collective efforts of Afghan women, bolstered by international support, highlight the enduring power of human agency and solidarity in the struggle for gender equity. Future Prospects for Female Education in Afghanistan: Pathways for Change and Action The future of female education in Afghanistan rests on a complex interplay of international policy, grassroots resistance, and sustained advocacy. Despite the severe restrictions imposed by the Taliban, the potential for change remains viable through strategic international shifts and strengthened support for Afghan activists. Analyzing these dimensions in light of feminist theory and international human rights principles reveals the importance of multifaceted, globally coordinated efforts to address the systemic denial of education to Afghan girls and women. Potential for Change through International Policy Shifts and Grassroots Activism International policy shifts carry significant implications for the future of women’s rights and educational access in Afghanistan. The international community's stance towards the Taliban has so far been a mixture of condemnation and selective engagement, with countries balancing humanitarian assistance against political pressure (Crisis Group, 2023). Recent recommendations from organizations like the United Nations and Amnesty International have emphasized leveraging foreign aid as a bargaining tool, with several governments proposing that the restoration of educational rights should be a prerequisite for any diplomatic recognition or developmental aid (UN Women, 2023). Such approaches align with political consensus-based frameworks within feminist theory, where global cooperation is critical to enforcing gender equality norms, particularly when local systems systematically violate women’s rights (hooks, 2000). If implemented consistently, these policies have the potential to pressure the Taliban into reconsidering its stance on female education, especially if they are supported by comprehensive sanctions and clear accountability mechanisms for human rights abuses. Meanwhile, grassroots movements and community-based activism within Afghanistan serve as crucial avenues for sustaining women’s educational aspirations in the immediate term. Despite the Taliban’s attempts to stifle dissent, Afghan women have organized small-scale, localized movements, often in the form of underground educational programs that cater to girls who have been excluded from formal schooling (Human Rights Watch, 2023). These initiatives highlight the agency and resilience of Afghan women in reclaiming their rights, even under stringent societal constraints, and resonate with feminist perspectives on empowerment and human agency, where local activism provides a foundation for broader societal change (hooks, 2000). While these movements face enormous risks, their persistence has garnered international attention, demonstrating that grassroots activism can serve as both a form of resistance and a powerful symbol for global solidarity with Afghan women. Recommendations for Action: Supporting Female Education and Global Solidarity To secure lasting change, actionable strategies must be developed and sustained by both local and international actors. Key recommendations for supporting female education in Afghanistan include increasing financial and logistical support for underground education initiatives, improving mental health resources for affected women and girls, and enhancing secure channels for local activists to communicate with international supporters. Organizations such as Medica Mondiale (2023) have already begun funding programs aimed at providing educational materials and psychological support to Afghan women, ensuring that even informal educational spaces can deliver critical resources. Further, the development of secure communication platforms and community networks could enable Afghan activists to coordinate more effectively with international allies, allowing for real-time collaboration and access to information on global legal and human rights developments (UNICEF, 2022). Such efforts reinforce the necessity of collective support mechanisms within the feminist framework, emphasizing the role of institutional design in fostering inclusive education and gender parity even under adverse political conditions. Global solidarity and advocacy are equally essential for advancing Afghan women’s rights. Ongoing campaigns led by NGOs, international legal bodies, and academic institutions emphasize the need for unified international condemnation of Taliban policies, coupled with diplomatic efforts that explicitly prioritize female education (Amnesty International, 2023). These strategies include lobbying for special provisions within international human rights law that recognize gender apartheid as a prosecutable crime, as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, thereby establishing a legal precedent for intervening in countries where women are systematically oppressed (UN, 1948). By framing the issue within global gender equality norms, such advocacy amplifies Afghan women’s voices, ensuring that their plight remains prominent in international forums. As a result, the future of female education in Afghanistan depends on the successful convergence of international pressure, grassroots resilience, and sustained advocacy. A comprehensive approach that includes strict international policies, targeted support for local activists, and unwavering global solidarity offers the most promising pathway to restore and protect Afghan women’s educational rights. Although significant challenges persist, the combined strength of these efforts represents a robust foundation for eventual change. Such a multifaceted response underscores the enduring relevance of feminist theories that advocate for global cooperation, human agency, and collective resilience, demonstrating that even in the face of extreme repression, the fight for gender equality and education can continue. Conclusion The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan since August 2021 has led to one of the most profound and alarming crises regarding women's rights and gender equality in recent history. This article has examined the multifaceted impacts of Taliban policies on female education and the broader implications for Afghan society. The systematic erosion of hard-won educational gains has not only restricted access to learning for girls and women but has also entrenched a culture of gender apartheid that perpetuates inequality and marginalization. The findings highlight that the Taliban's restrictions extend far beyond education; they encompass significant mental health implications for Afghan women, a deterioration of family dynamics, and a chilling effect on community structures. The psychological burden of enforced ignorance and oppression is profound, contributing to a cycle of despair that threatens the very fabric of Afghan society. Despite these overwhelming challenges, the resilience and agency of Afghan women shine through. Grassroots movements, underground educational initiatives, and acts of defiance reflect a commitment to reclaiming rights and freedoms. However, the international community's response has often been criticized as inadequate, with calls for more robust and coordinated advocacy to hold the Taliban accountable for human rights violations and to support Afghan women's rights activists. The urgency of addressing female education and empowerment in Afghanistan cannot be overstated. Restoring access to education and ensuring the fundamental rights of Afghan women is not only a moral imperative but also critical for the country’s socio-economic development and stability. As Afghanistan faces a precarious future, the role of global solidarity and action becomes essential in advocating for the rights of women and fostering an environment where gender equality can thrive. Therefore, the situation demands immediate and sustained international attention to dismantle the barriers imposed by the Taliban and to support the ongoing struggles of Afghan women. Without concerted efforts, the potential for progress remains bleak, and the aspirations of a generation of Afghan girls may be irrevocably thwarted. It is through this collective commitment to justice and equity that a more hopeful future for Afghanistan can be forged. References Abu-Lughod, L. (2002). Do Muslim Women Need Saving?

Defunding NPR – OpEd	Elon Musk has talked about eliminating at least two trillion dollars of United States government yearly spending. While it would contribute a small portion toward this grand goal, a spending cut that jumps out as among the most obvious for Musk and the incoming Donald Trump administration to pursue is eliminating all US government support for National Public Radio (NPR) and its affiliated programing and radio stations. The most convincing argument for US government funding of NPR has faded away over the decades since the media organization’s creation in the pre-internet and even quite limited cable television age. Nowadays, there is easy access to news and entertainment sources aplenty at the click of the mouse or remote control. There is no arguable need for Uncle Sam to provide a helping hand to a select media organization. Fundamentally, though, the US government supporting NPR has been wrong from the beginning. Providing news and entertainment to Americans is an activity many steps removed from the few powers the US Constitution sets forward as delegated to the US government. Further, it is inconsistent with the tenor of the First Amendment for the US government that is prohibited from making any law abridging the freedom of the press to be selectively providing funding for one media organization, thus giving it a leg up on the competition. Relevant for the Trump administration and Republicans in the US House of Representatives and Senate as well would be that NPR, since the 2016 presidential election, has placed a target on Trump’s back. Attacking Trump relentlessly has been pursued across NPR programs for the past eight years. How is it acceptable for the US government to be funding a media organization that has as part of its editorial policy the belittling and demonizing of this man who for most of this time period was either serving as president or running for president? Election interference anyone? Hopefully, some Democratic Congress members would join in condemning the unfairness of the situation even though their presidential candidates were the beneficiaries. On April 9, longtime NPR employee Uri Berliner went public with his insights on how 'an open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR' and how instead there is a 'distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.' He also discussed how NPR engaged in 'efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency.' If, like most Americans, you listen little or not at all to NPR, Berliner’s article, which you can read here, is a good introduction to some of the intense bias you have missed out on hearing. To reach two trillion in savings, Musk and Trump would certainly find some spending cuts difficult. Eliminating US government support for NPR, in contrast, seems like something that should be an easy choice.

The Complex Legacy Of George Orwell – OpEd	By Allen Gindler George Orwell, one of the most influential political writers of the 20th century, is widely recognized for his searing critiques of totalitarian regimes in his novels Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell’s portrayal of state control, propaganda, and the manipulation of truth has resonated with readers across the political spectrum. However, Orwell’s personal political ideology and his critiques of totalitarianism are far more complex than is often acknowledged. Rather than being a passive observer or simply an opponent of dictatorship, Orwell was deeply involved in the socialist movements of his time, aligning himself—whether accidentally or intentionally—with Trotskyist circles. Orwell was a powerful voice of the left, despite being a target in the war among socialist factions. Orwell’s Political Ideology and Alignment with Trotskyism While Orwell is best remembered for his criticism of authoritarianism and totalitarianism, it is essential to understand that he was, first and foremost, a committed socialist. Despite never formally joining a political party, Orwell was an active and vocal participant in the socialist movement. This may surprise those who associate Orwell solely with his critiques of state tyranny. Indeed, Orwell’s disdain for the left dictatorship did not extend to all forms of socialism, and his political writings often reflect an internal critique of socialist regimes rather than a wholesale rejection of socialist principles. Orwell’s critique of Stalinist totalitarianism is best understood as part of a broader ideological struggle within the socialist movement itself. Specifically, Orwell’s critiques echo the views of Leon Trotsky, a key figure in early Soviet history and one of Stalin’s most prominent critics. Trotsky was a revolutionary Marxist who played a crucial role in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent civil war. He was instrumental in founding the Red Army, which secured the Bolshevik victory over the anti-communist White Army during the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky’s theory of 'permanent revolution' set him at odds with Stalin, who favored the consolidation of socialism in one country—namely, the Soviet Union—before pursuing global revolution. Trotsky’s insistence that socialism must be spread worldwide made him a figure of suspicion within the Soviet hierarchy. In the early 1920s, Stalin consolidated power, leading to Trotsky’s exile in 1929. Despite this, Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin’s policies from abroad, particularly through his writings. Trotsky’s critique of Stalinism included accusations that Stalin had betrayed the original goals of the Russian Revolution. According to Trotsky, Stalin had established a bureaucratic dictatorship rather than a dictatorship of the proletariat, as envisioned by Marxist theory. He argued that Stalin’s regime represented, not the rule of the working class, but the rise of a privileged bureaucratic elite, a 'nomenklatura,' that dominated Soviet society. In addition, Trotsky accused Stalin of fostering a cult of personality, suppressing political opposition, and betraying the internationalist principles of socialism. Orwell and the Spanish Civil War In 1936, when the Spanish Civil War broke out, Orwell made the fateful decision to join the Republican side, fighting against Francisco Franco’s Nationalista forces. What makes Orwell’s involvement particularly significant is his choice of faction. Rather than aligning himself with the International Brigades, Orwell joined the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a Marxist faction heavily influenced by Trotskyist ideas. Orwell’s decision to fight with the POUM speaks volumes about his political leanings during this period. The Spanish Civil War was not simply a battle between Republicans and Nationalistas; it was also an ideological battleground for various factions of the international left. The Republican side was a coalition of various socialist, communist, and anarchist groups. The POUM, with which Orwell fought, was aligned with Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist factions, while the Communist Party of Spain, supported by Stalin, took a hard line against any left-wing groups that did not adhere to Moscow’s policies. As Orwell would later write in Homage to Catalonia, his firsthand experience in Spain profoundly influenced his understanding of the brutal dynamics of power within the left. This dynamic reflects what biologists refer to as 'intraspecific struggle,' where members of the same species (or political movement, in this case) compete most aggressively with each other for dominance. While Orwell fought against Franco’s Nationalistas at the front, Stalin’s agents were conducting a purge of Trotskyist and anarchist factions behind the lines. The NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, were sent to Spain to suppress all non-Bolshevik leftist elements within the Republican forces. This included the POUM, which was eventually outlawed by the Stalinist-backed Republican leadership. NKVD agents kidnapped and killed the head of POUM, Andreu Nin. Orwell himself narrowly escaped assassination by the NKVD and covertly fled to England. These experiences deepened his disillusionment with Stalinism and reinforced his belief that the Soviet regime had betrayed the original ideals of socialism. Orwell’s Literary Response: Animal Farm and 1984 Orwell’s experiences in Spain and his understanding of the internal conflicts within socialism found their most potent expression in his literary works. Animal Farm, published in 1945, is widely understood as an allegory of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism. Because of this, he struggled to find a publisher willing to take on the book, as many feared the political consequences of criticizing Stalin at the time of WWII. In the novella, Orwell portrays the betrayal of revolutionary ideals through the story of a group of farm animals who overthrow their human owner, only to see their new leaders—the pigs—become as oppressive as the humans they replaced. The pig Napoleon, who represents Stalin, manipulates the other animals, gradually consolidating power and rewriting the revolution’s history to justify his dictatorship. What is often overlooked in discussions of Animal Farm is the role of Trotsky’s ideas in shaping Orwell’s narrative. The character of Snowball—who is expelled from the farm by Napoleon—represents Trotsky. Snowball, like Trotsky, is portrayed as an idealistic, but ultimately powerless figure, who is demonized by the regime in power. Orwell’s depiction of Snowball’s exile and the subsequent demonization of his legacy mirrors Trotsky’s real-life expulsion and assassination by Stalin’s agents in 1940. In this sense, Animal Farm can be read as an artistic rendering of Trotsky’s The Revolution Betrayed (a critique of Stalinism from the left), with Orwell using the fable to illustrate the broader betrayal of socialist ideals by Stalin’s regime. Yet, Orwell could not grasp that if Trotsky had been the head of the Soviet Union, his regime might have been even more ruthless than the one Stalin built. Proletarian dictatorship is no better than party dictatorship. Orwell’s final novel, 1984, extends his critique of totalitarianism beyond Stalinism to address the broader implications of state control, surveillance, and the manipulation of truth. Although 1984 is not explicitly focused on socialist ideology, its portrayal of a dystopian world ruled by a single party—where dissent is brutally suppressed and history is constantly rewritten—draws heavily on Orwell’s understanding of the Stalinist regime. The famous phrase 'Big Brother is watching you' has since become synonymous with state surveillance and authoritarianism, but in the context of Orwell’s political trajectory, it also serves as a broader warning about the dangers of unchecked power, regardless of ideological orientation. Orwell’s Dilemma: The Limits of Socialist Critique Despite his damning critique of Stalinism, Orwell remained a socialist until the end of his life. His disillusionment with the Soviet Union did not extend to socialism as a whole. In fact, Orwell believed that socialism could still provide the solution to the social and economic problems facing the world, provided it did not fall into the traps of authoritarianism and bureaucracy. This presents a fundamental paradox in Orwell’s thought: while he was acutely aware of the dangers of totalitarianism produced by different currents of socialism, he continued to advocate for a general utopia that, in practice, often led to the very abuses of power he critiqued. Orwell could not comprehend that, regardless of the specific flavor of socialism —whether Trotskyist, Stalinist, or otherwise—given enough time, it would inevitably lead to the same outcome: economic stagnation, moral decadence, and repression. His deep belief in the potential of socialism, particularly in its democratic form, blinded him to the inherent authoritarian tendencies within socialist movements. Orwell’s Legacy George Orwell’s legacy as a writer and political thinker is marked by his commitment to socialist ideals and his fierce opposition to totalitarianism. His engagement with Trotskyist ideas, his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, and his literary responses to Stalinism reveal a nuanced understanding of the complexities within the socialist movement. While Orwell’s critiques of political tyranny remain profoundly relevant today, his continued belief in socialism—even after witnessing its failures—underscores the intricacies of his thought. Therefore, it feels somewhat awkward to rely on a socialist’s critique of the very regimes that socialism consistently produces.

Ukrainian And North Korean Forces Clash In Russian Region Of Kurs...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukraine’s First Encounter with North Korean Troops Marks a Pivotal Moment In the Russian region of Kursk, North Korean combat formations reportedly exchanged fire with Ukrainian servicemen for the first time since Pyongyang deployed its forces to Russia. The limited availability of open-source intelligence makes it difficult to assess this skirmish in detail. But press sources have noted that North Korea’s troops were equipped with assault rifles, 60mm mortars, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), sniper weaponry, night-vision equipment, and hand grenades. This reinforces previous assessments that special forces light infantry units are the backbone of the forward-deployed North Korean presence for now. According to Ukrainian defense intelligence sources, three North Korean generals and up to 500 officers have already made it to Russia to oversee the units deployed there. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that many of these brigades are from Pyongyang’s 11th Corps special forces unit. This corps is considered a strategic force and is trained to open a second front in a conventional conflict or attack an enemy’s rear area. The United States Department of Defense reported that Pyongyang has already fielded around 10,000 troops in Kursk for combat operations. South Korean intelligence services foresaw a total contingent of around 12,000arriving in the region. But force-generation patterns suggest that North Korea’s deployment there may eventually be even more substantial than this estimate. Two questions loom large at this juncture. First, will the North Korean troops’ mandate extend beyond Kursk to fighting in occupied Ukraine? Second, will Pyongyang reinforce its initial deployments with additional troops? Our forecast suggests the answer to both questions is yes, underscoring the potential for a significant escalation of the conflict. 2. Ukraine Conducts Strikes in Geopolitically Crucial Caspian Sea Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) reportedly struck two Gepard-class frigates in the Caspian Sea, showcasing the increasing reach and strength of Ukraine’s drone warfare capabilities. Equipped with Kalibr naval cruise missiles, these frigates play a vital role in the Russian Navy’s long-range strike deterrent. Russia’s Caspian flotilla has previously launched Kalibr missiles to hammer Ukrainian population centers. The Caspian Sea has also become important for strategic transactions between the Russian military and its Iranian partners. The extension of Ukraine’s long-range drone threat to the Caspian marks a meaningful shift in the war—particularly should Kyiv repeat this success and continue to pressure Russian naval warfare capabilities in the basin. 3. Shahed Drone Strikes on Ukraine Have Increased Tenfold from 2023 to 2024 Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sounded the alarm about the worrying rise in Shahed drone salvos, stating that Russian forces have employed the loitering munitions 10 times as often as they did in 2023. According to the Ukrainian high command, the most recent three-month data-collection period featured 4,300 Shahed launches. October was particularly grim, as it saw over 2,000 of the drones rain down on Ukrainian population centers. Russia used 790 Shahed drones in August of this year, and 1,300 in September. This boost in attacks carries implications well beyond Ukraine. Iranian drones are being produced at astronomical levels. When Iran and Russia initially launched their joint drone production plant in the Russian region of Tatarstan in 2023, initial estimates pegged its annual production rate at around 2,500 drones. By exploiting the indigenous Tatar population—and even using child labor—the Kremlin believes it can produce 6,000 Shaheds annually by 2025. Worryingly, current drone warfare trends in Ukraine suggest that Russia and Iran may have already met this production goal. Previous editions of this report have observed that the Islamic Republic and the Kremlin are now capable of producing massive amounts of low-cost loitering munitions on the doorstep of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The two allies can now sustain a high operational tempo of more than 2,000 drones per month. Even if Ukraine intercepts 90 percent of these munitions, it would be allowing 200 hits a month on civilian and military targets. With evolutions including thermobaric and high-explosive-incendiary warhead configurations, Shahed drones have become more destructive than ever. 4. Battlefield Assessment Russian forces have managed to gain territory on multiple fronts. Facing problematic manpower disadvantages, Ukraine has issued a social media summons to personnel who have deserted or are considered absent without leave (AWOL). Ukraine is also bracing for another mobilization. Last week Russia captured the Ukrainian village of Kurakhiva, further boosting its push into Kurakhove. Kurakhove, situated between the Vovcha River and the N-15 Highway, lies south of the strategically important city of Pokrovsk. Another critical flashpoint on the eastern front is Illinka, where the Ukrainian 79th Air Assault Brigade has been trying to hold the line against Russia’s formidable 20th Motor Rifle Division. Available writings suggest that Russian formations have a favorable five-to-one force-on-force ratio here. The Russian offensive has also advanced on other fronts. In Siversk, heightened combat activity and growing material losses have characterized the fighting. In southern Ukraine, Russia has intensified its tactical efforts without tangible success. Finally, in the Russian region of Kursk, the powerful Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade’s Abrams main battle tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles have been engaging Russian heavy armor. North Korean troops face considerable odds as they enter the fray.

The Role Of Data Science In Shaping Bangladesh’s Energy Diplomacy...	As the world transitions to a low-carbon future, energy diplomacy has become a key pillar of international relations, especially for nations like Bangladesh, where energy security and sustainable development are national priorities. Bangladesh, a nation with limited indigenous energy resources, has been strategically engaging with other countries to secure energy resources, including oil, gas, and renewable energy investments. Data science, with its vast potential to gather, analyze, and interpret large volumes of information, can offer Bangladesh powerful insights into global energy markets, demand forecasts, and international relations, enabling more effective and nuanced energy diplomacy. Bangladesh's Energy Diplomacy Landscape Energy diplomacy for Bangladesh primarily involves balancing national energy demands with sustainable and reliable access to energy sources. This requires partnerships, investment strategies, and policy alignments with countries in the region, including the USA, Russia, Qatar, Indonesia, India, China, and so on. Through collaborations, Bangladesh seeks not only to meet its energy requirements but also to position itself as a regional player in the energy market, particularly in the context of renewable energy and climate change initiatives. How Data Science Contributes to Energy Diplomacy Data science can enhance Bangladesh's energy diplomacy by supporting decision-making processes, enabling predictive modeling, and facilitating data-driven engagements with energy stakeholders. Here are some specific areas where data science can make a significant impact. 1. Energy Demand Forecasting and Management Data science can help Bangladesh model its future energy demand, considering variables like population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancement. By utilizing predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, data scientists can create robust models to estimate the country's future energy needs. This insight is crucial for diplomatic negotiations as it allows Bangladesh to approach potential energy suppliers with well-defined demand estimates, improving the bargaining position and making the case for stable, long-term energy agreements. Example: Through machine learning, data scientists can analyze historical consumption patterns, economic trends, and policy impacts to predict future energy needs, informing negotiations with suppliers on a reliable basis. 2. Resource Optimization and Renewable Energy Integration Bangladesh aims to diversify its energy sources, and renewable energy is a cornerstone of this strategy. Data science can optimize the deployment of renewable resources by determining the ideal mix of solar, wind, and hydropower based on geographic and meteorological data. Additionally, data-driven resource optimization can support Bangladesh in its diplomatic engagements with countries that have advanced renewable technology. Example: Using geospatial analysis, Bangladesh can identify the most suitable locations for solar and wind farms, supporting its push for investments from foreign nations that specialize in renewable technology. 3. Understanding Global Energy Market Trends Data science can process and analyze vast amounts of market data, providing insights into global trends, price fluctuations, and geopolitical events that impact the energy sector. For Bangladesh, understanding these dynamics is essential for forming effective energy alliances and negotiating favorable terms in international energy agreements. By analyzing real-time and historical data, Bangladeshi diplomats can stay ahead of market trends and tailor their strategies accordingly. Example: Data-driven insights into oil price volatility and supply chain shifts help Bangladesh make informed choices about when to buy or negotiate long-term contracts, potentially reducing energy costs. 4. Risk Assessment in Energy Investments Foreign investments in Bangladesh's energy sector often come with risks, including political instability, market volatility, and policy changes. Data science tools, particularly those focused on risk analysis and financial modeling, can help identify and mitigate these risks. By understanding these risks, Bangladesh can present a clear, data-backed assessment to potential investors, ensuring more secure and stable energy investments. Example: Predictive models assessing political and economic risks can give international investors a clear picture of the energy landscape in Bangladesh, thereby enhancing the country's credibility as a reliable energy partner. 5. Mapping Diplomatic Networks and Trade Relationships Data science, through network analysis and social graphing, can map Bangladesh's current diplomatic and trade relationships in the energy sector, identifying key partners and potential allies. This analysis helps in understanding where Bangladesh's energy diplomacy can expand or deepen and also provides insights into competitive and cooperative dynamics with neighboring countries. Example: Social network analysis tools can visualize Bangladesh's existing energy ties with regional players, showing where diplomatic efforts may yield more collaborative or competitive outcomes. 6. Environmental Impact Assessment and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Data science can help Bangladesh in monitoring and reducing the environmental impacts of energy projects, aligning with its commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Environmental data analysis provides insights that support responsible energy extraction, carbon reduction, and compliance with international environmental standards—key considerations in forming alliances with countries committed to sustainability. Example: Data-driven environmental monitoring tools can track emissions and environmental degradation from energy projects, helping Bangladesh showcase its commitment to green energy diplomacy on the international stage. 7. Strategic Use of Artificial Intelligence in Energy Negotiations Artificial intelligence (AI) can simulate various negotiation scenarios, helping Bangladeshi diplomats refine strategies for energy talks. AI-driven decision support systems can analyze historical negotiation data, identify patterns, and suggest effective approaches for future engagements. Example: AI models can recommend the most favorable negotiation strategies by analyzing previous energy agreements, benefiting Bangladesh's negotiation efforts with other energy-producing nations. 8. Monitoring Geopolitical Factors Impacting Energy Diplomacy Geopolitical stability is crucial to secure energy resources, and data science enables Bangladesh to monitor factors that could affect energy security, such as conflicts, sanctions, and diplomatic tensions. Using text mining and natural language processing (NLP), data scientists can analyze news reports, social media, and government publications to anticipate potential disruptions in energy supplies. Example: A real-time analysis of diplomatic stances or conflicts in oil-producing regions can help Bangladesh adapt its import strategies quickly, ensuring stable energy supplies. 9. Enhancing Energy Supply Chain Management Data science applications in supply chain management can help Bangladesh streamline its import and export processes, reducing costs and improving energy security. By analyzing logistics data, weather patterns, and international shipping trends, data science can help optimize Bangladesh's energy supply chain, minimizing risks of disruptions. Example: Predictive analytics in supply chain management can forecast potential disruptions, allowing for proactive solutions and ensuring that energy imports reach Bangladesh on time and at optimal costs. 10. Promoting Transparency and Accountability in Energy Deals Transparency is key to building trust in international partnerships, and data science tools, including blockchain technology, can ensure greater transparency in energy transactions. By enabling secure and traceable transactions, data science can reassure international investors about the integrity of Bangladesh's energy deals. Example: Blockchain-based systems for tracking transactions and contracts in the energy sector can provide clear and tamper-proof records, increasing trust among Bangladesh's foreign energy partners. Conclusion The application of data science to energy diplomacy offers Bangladesh transformative opportunities to strengthen its position on the global energy stage. By leveraging predictive models, optimizing resource management, and fostering transparent transactions, Bangladesh can engage in more effective energy diplomacy, achieving long-term energy security and sustainable growth. Through a strategic alignment of data science and energy diplomacy, Bangladesh can ensure that its national interests align with global energy trends, securing a resilient and prosperous energy future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTbdgM6TlnK19	2024-11-09T17:44:26-08:00	
Trump Act II Spells The End Of The American Empire – OpEd	By Susan Thornton Many around the world may joke that they should be allowed to vote in American elections because the results have as big an effect on them as they do on those who live in the United States. The actions of a unipolar superpower reverberate around the world and other countries are forced to respond. But American voters almost never vote based on events happening in the world, on foreign policy issues or even on things that might affect future generations at home. Voting is an emotional, last-minute impulse. During times when there was consensus around the United States’ global roles and responsibilities, the vagaries of elections did not much alter the US approach to the world. But times have changed. The election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term affirms a fundamental shift in America’s relationship with the world. In contrast to other empires, which tended to fall apart slowly over an extended period, Americans themselves have decided they no longer want to bear the burdens and distractions of global hegemony. Americans are no longer confident in the promise and effectiveness of their institutional system, they reject the obligation of answering the world’s fire alarms, they are weary of bearing the cost of global security and they see clearly that other states are free-riding on US largesse. The US electorate has been consistently ahead of its politicians in its rejection of the role of ‘world policeman’. The Biden administration’s claim that costs borne by the United States in these endeavours is more than returned by having global friends and keeping the wars ‘over there’ was not sufficient to overcome nagging doubts and grievances. Political gamesmanship over support for Ukraine and other conflicts contributed to the impression that American commitments were optional or, more problematically, ‘scams’ perpetrated by out-of-touch elites. Those living in other countries, and many living in the United States, might see these issues differently, but they do not vote or they do not vote enough. Trump, and certainly his national security team, does not appreciate that he was put in power to dismantle US global hegemony. But Trump’s bullying transactionalism, his aversion to commitment, his penchant for tariffs and complete indifference to the potential impact that the United States has on other countries can have no other outcome. It is obvious that permanent damage will be done to the United Nations, international economic institutions, multilateral organisations in which the United States is a member and any international effort to combat transnational challenges. The dissolution began during his first term and will be irreversible after the coming four years. The Americans who elected Trump as their standard bearer will cheer their demise. But, more worryingly, Trump’s national security appointees will not accept the message the Trump electorate has sent them. They will cling to American primacy through ever-escalating military deployments under the rubric of ‘deterrence’. Asian partners should steer clear of whiplash from the collision between Trump’s transactionalism and his national security team’s fever dreams. This means allies, especially those in the Pacific, can likely continue to count on US security backing, as long as they can demonstrate that they are not free riding. This has implications for Japan’s financing of its defence budget increase, for Taiwan’s defence reforms and for other partners stepping up their contributions to their own defence (including purchases of US weapons systems through deals like AUKUS). Despite Trump’s claim that he ‘doesn’t start wars, he stops them’, his re-ascension likely portends more turmoil in the world. It is true that Trump’s political invulnerability may allow him to make big moves in foreign policy — cultivating personal diplomacy with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin or expanding Israel’s diplomatic space. But Trump relishes provoking others. His confidence in being able to avert wars by sowing fear is misplaced and likely to backfire. Biden’s modest stabilisation of US–China ties is unlikely to hold and Taiwan is a particularly hot potato in Trump’s hands. The economic implications of the Trump term will of course be significant, especially for Asia — the most globalised part of the international trading system. The playbook here is familiar, and it revolves around tariffs and bilateral negotiations to increase US exports. It is not clear how much room this strategy has to run in Trump II, but a Trump administration may be more welcoming of foreign investment into the United States, which could alleviate pressure on trade for some countries or sectors. There will be a further sharp disconnect of the US and Chinese economies. Trump and the Republican Congress are likely to invoke more tariffs, export controls and sanctions leading to global fragmentation, rising costs and slower growth. Businesses will face an ever more complicated picture and are already strategising how to adjust. Many countries in Asia are devising economic hedging strategies and will try to walk a middle line amid deteriorating US–China relations. Whether and how a Trump administration might impose costs for such an approach remains an open question. We have already entered the transition to a post-Pax Americana world — Trump is an accelerant. This does not mean that the United States will disappear. It will remain the most powerful and wealthy country in the world. But it does leave a vacuum in the international arena and US partners will hopefully step in to provide leadership and public goods. In this more fragmented, disordered world, US partners in Asia should also pursue more networked security cooperation and regional integration to safeguard peace and mitigate the negative effects of deglobalisation for their economies. Such measures are useful on their own merits, no matter who is in the White House, as the world is set to become a more difficult and dangerous place.

Armenia: Government Efforts To Enhance Surveillance Infrastructur...	By Ani Avetisyan (Eurasianet) -- The Armenian government is proceeding cautiously on a security bill that would build up surveillance infrastructure in the capital Yerevan, allowing more time for public discussion of the pros and cons of giving authorities expanded powers to potentially track individuals’ movements. Introduced in the spring, and already approved by parliament in a preliminary reading, the Interior Ministry-drafted bill would grant law enforcement agencies 24/7 access to live feeds and recordings from video cameras installed across the city, providing expansive coverage of all public space in the center of Yerevan. Private businesses, educational institutions, and other entities would be required to install cameras covering all building entrances and surrounding areas, with footage retained for 15 days. Armenia’s deputy interior minister also hinted at plans to use artificial intelligence to analyze footage, something that many privacy experts fear could facilitate the use of biometric and facial recognition technologies in video surveillance. The potential use of widespread surveillance has political ramifications, as opponents of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan have mounted protests against his government in recent months. The bill’s provisions, if enacted, could potentially be used to identify opposition supporters for politically motivated retribution. Officials cast the bill as an anti-crime measure designed to strengthen 'public security.' But it has sparked spirited public debate over privacy concerns and potential rights abuses. Human Rights Watch has urged officials to reconsider their approach, and, at the very least, create guardrails that 'mitigate any human rights risks,' as well as create comprehensive 'plans for oversight and accountability.' 'Widespread, indiscriminate video surveillance would inevitably lead to unjustified intrusions on privacy,' a HRW statement quoted Giorgi Gogia, the organization’s associate director for Europe and Central Asia, as saying. 'Mass surveillance in public spaces would have a chilling effect on fundamental civil and political rights.' Armenian law enforcement authorities have faced increasing public pressure to reduce crime rates, particularly amid a spike in drug trafficking. Proponents of the bill argue that enhanced surveillance could serve as a deterrent and facilitate the more efficient solving of crimes. But the country’s Data Protection Agency has echoed HRW’s concerns, issuing a statement that, in its current form, the bill would cause 'disproportionate interference' with citizens’ privacy rights by enabling 'unlimited and continuous processing of personal data' by authorities. Information Security expert Artur Papyan warned that a rapid expansion in the numbers of CCTV cameras could potentially increase the risks of them being hacked and used for malicious surveillance purposes by third parties. He cited the example of Russian hackers breaking into the database of security cameras in Kyiv prior to an attack earlier this year. The government, which is striving to steer the country away from Russia and enhance tieswith the West, is taking heed of the criticism. Final parliamentary consideration of the bill, originally scheduled for September, has been postponed. Parliament is now expected to consider adoption before the end of the year. The Armenian government’s cautious approach on the surveillance bill contrasts with the behavior of the Georgian Dream leadership in neighboring Georgia, where the ruling party rammed restrictive legislation, known as the 'foreign agents' law, through parliament without public input or legislative debate, sparking mass protests. Unlike Armenia which is aligning itself closer to the West, Georgian Dream has moved in recent years away from the European Union and United States and closer to Russia. Armenian leaders have voiced interest in seeking EU membership. The country’s legal obligations as a signatory to various international treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights, require it to uphold strict privacy protection standards, yet some of the country’s existing laws, as well as pending bills, fall short of meeting EU benchmarks. For example, Armenia’s Electoral Commission has made public the database of all eligible voters in Armenia, including personal information about individuals and the people registered with them at the same address. In 2020, the current government sought to pass a law that would make it easier for the police to access residents’ bank details without a court order, as required by current legislation. The bill, which the government tried to present as a means of combating money laundering, was declared unconstitutional by the country’s Constitutional Court.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTV4dzcu4cO3A	2024-11-09T17:37:47-08:00	
35 Years After Fall Of Berlin Wall, Germany Is In A Funk That Mig...	By Andrew Hammond Ordinarily, Saturday’s 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall might have been expected to be a cause for much joy in Germany. However, celebrations of the milestone will for many people be subdued given the nation’s deep economic and political funk. This was most recently illustrated by the collapse on Wednesday of the three-way governing coalition that included the left-of-center Social Democratic Party (the SPD), the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party. Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leader of the FDP, declaring that there was no longer any 'basis of trust' between them. Scholz, who is leader of the SPD, said he would seek a vote of confidence by Jan. 15 so that MPs 'can decide whether to clear the way for early elections.' These could take place as soon as March, six months earlier than scheduled. Beneath this governmental instability there lies a deeper issue: the breakdown of the traditional duopoly of power between the SPD and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. These parties have been the twin pillars of German politics since the end of the Second World War. But with the SPD now very unpopular and the direction of the CDU/CSU still uncertain since the end of Angela Merkel’s long chancellorship between 2005 and 2021, Germany appears to be moving from de facto two-party politics to a multiparty system. This is illustrated by the growing number of smaller parties that previously functioned as subsidiaries of either the SPD or the CDU/CSU. One of the drivers of this unraveling of traditional German politics and the fracturing of the political landscape has been the fact that the nation’s post-war consensus is eroding on multiple issues, including history, geopolitics, the economy and ethics. These political fractures might mean politics is becoming more generally unstable and less predictable, with significant challenges each election cycle in establishing a governing coalition. So there might be more rotation of ruling coalitions, with all the problems this can bring including, potentially, the prospect of the role of the chancellorship becoming weaker in patchwork governments. For much of the 35 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, many Germans have been mostly content with their post-Cold War lot, seeing themselves in general as beneficiaries of globalization. This might be changing, as evidenced by the rise of smaller parties. The far right Alternative for Deutschland is currently running second in the polls, for instance. It was the first far-right group to gain seats in the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, for six decades. Moreover, in September the party won its first state election, in Thuringia. The AfD campaigns extensively on immigration, an issue that has grown significantly in salience in Germany in recent years. This is in part because of the integration of more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion in 2022, and the arrival of about 1 million migrants, largely from the Middle East, in 2015 and 2016. This political malaise is mirrored on the economic front. The fall of the Berlin Wall hastened the end of Soviet Communism and led to the reunification of Germany, but the nation has more recently been given the moniker of the 'sick man of Europe.' Certainly, Germany has long had the largest economy in the region and is the most powerful nation in the EU, yet it is flatlining. The country has been in a state of ferment now for many years, exacerbated by the pandemic and the energy shocks that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Economically, the latest data shows that Germany very narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter of this year but is still struggling after shrinking last year, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting zero growth in 2024. The challenges the country faces are exemplified by Volkswagen, which has experienced a sharp fall in profits and might decide to close several factories for the first time in its almost 90-year history. Operating profits for the nine months to the end of September fell by more than a fifth compared with the same period a year ago to just under 13 billion euro ($14 billion), the causes of which included weaker demand from China. The company’s problems reflect a wider malaise in the automotive industry, which is Germany’s single largest business sector. With economic confidence weak, there has also been the biggest reduction in employment for about half a decade, according to an S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank index. In addition, the Federation of German Industries has warned that a fifth of the country’s industrial output might be at risk between now and 2030. This is not only because of weaker export markets for German goods (exports account for nearly half of the nation’s gross domestic product, a higher proportion than many other major economies) but also high energy costs. One worrying sign of the declining economic confidence might be German birth rates, which have gone into decline after rising before the pandemic. Between 2011 and 2016, the birth rate rose from 1.38 to 1.59 children per woman. However, it had fallen to only 1.35 in 2023. To rub salt into the wounds, the nation’s troubled public finances could soon become much worse as a result of a Federal Constitutional Court decision that might reduce tax income by up to 75 billion euro. The court case concerns the legality of a so-called 'solidarity surcharge' that was introduced to tackle the burden of German reunification. Reportedly at risk is about &euro;66 billion collected since 2020, and approximately &euro;9 billion in interest. If the court rules against the government on this, it will blow a huge hole in public finances. All of this explains why the nation might now be at a historic crossroads. The danger is that it might result in a significantly weaker Germany, and wider EU, at a time of growing global geopolitical flux and economic uncertainty. • Andrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTQl-xxpaIgOH	2024-11-09T17:36:06-08:00	
Trump Is Expected To Secure US Rights Through Tough But Fair Tran...	US President-elect Donald Trump is feared by some and extolled by others. On the one hand, those who fear him say he will make the US aggressive, impulsive and selfish, driven by the battle cry 'America First' and 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). On the other hand, those who laud him say he will make the US concentrate on pressing domestic issues and not waste resources on saving other countries from authoritarian hegemons in a pretentious colonial-era 'civilizing mission'. While there is a grain of truth in both assessments, overall, Trump has shown through his performance in his previous stint in the White House between 2017 and 2021, that he could be both tough and benign, waging war to assert America's rights on the one hand, and bringing peace if that was the way forward, on the other. Trump is a pragmatic politician, but not an unprincipled one. He has no 'Trump Doctrine' to expound, as he has no fixed notions. He goes mostly by his instinct and assessment of the ground reality. His decisions are 'his' in the true sense of the word. According to Robert C. O'Brien, US National Security Adviser from 2019 to 2021, Trump may replicate President Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) who used US power with panache, but judiciously, to achieve a number of diplomatic triumphs. Like Trump, Jackson believed in give and take. He showed the fist when necessary, and struck a compromise when called for, as he did in the case of disputes with France, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain. Jackson signed trade agreements with Russia, Spain, Turkey, Britain, and Siam. The treaty with Britain reopened American trade with the British West Indies. Overall, US trade boomed in Jackson's time- exports increased by more than 75% and imports by 250%. By the time Jackson retired from the White House in 1837, he had significantly altered the office of the President, expanding its veto power, basing its authority on the will of the people. He dramatically enhanced the chief executive's political and legislative powers, O'Brien recalled. But Jackson was not foolhardy. He would leave some issues to the Congress even if he had strong views on them as he did in the case of the integration of Texas State into the USA. Likewise, Trump would be an aggressive President but would leave some sensitive issues to the legislature. Presently, he has now left the decision on the critical issue of abortion to the States. Indeed, Trump was an aggressive 'Make America Great' proponent. But he was also a peacemaker when he was in office from 2017 to 2021. Listing his achievements, O'Brien says that he facilitated the Abraham Accords, bringing peace to Israel and three of its neighbours and Sudan. He brought about economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo; pushed Egypt and the Gulf states to settle their rift with Qatar and end their blockade of Qatar. More importantly, the US entered into an agreement with the Taliban to being about an American withdrawal. This prevented any American combat deaths there for nearly the entire final year of the Trump administration. Trump ended one war- against the ISIS as an organized military force. He eliminated its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Trump was determined to avoid new wars and endless counterinsurgency operations. According to O'Brien the Trump Presidency was the first since that of Jimmy Carter in which the US did not enter a new war or expand an existing one. O'Brien notes that when Trump was in office, Russia did not press further forward after its 2014 invasion of Ukraine and Iran did not attack Israel, and North Korea stopped testing nuclear weapons after a combination of diplomatic outreach and a U.S. military show of force. But Trump ordered a limited but effective air attack on Syria in 2017, after Bashar al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons against its own people. Trump's critics say that his 'America first' is 'America alone'. But this is debunked by O'Brien. Yes, Trump is critical of NATO and thinks expenditure on it is unwarranted but this is because the European members are not contributing enough for its upkeep. He says that Ukraine's Zelensky is a 'salesman' because every time he came to the US he successfully made a case for billions of dollars. Trump would insist the Taiwan which spends only 3% of its GDP on defence should spend more and not burden the US so much. Trump is all for free international trade but not when some countries raise tariffs and erect other protective barriers, and expect the US not to respond. There is a message here for China and also India. Trump is strongly against making a song and dance about climate change but his views deserve a careful examination and not outright rejection. Perhaps climate change programs could be reassessed taking all views into consideration. For example, the developing countries feel that the developed countries are the major polluters and should do more and also contribute more to the climate change mitigation kitty. Trump was shown to be a man of the White ruling class or the White majority, but the recent election result has shown that his support base spans various ethnicities. Even the Latinos (Mexicans and South Americans) he is trying to bar from entering the US illegally, supported him because everybody wanted America to be free from illegal migration as it was affecting the prospects of locals in the shrinking job markets. Talking of employment, by raising tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump hopes to encourage local American industries that will give Americans job and not Chinese thousands of miles away. All in all, Trump's supporters at home and others abroad can expect the US under Trump to veer from the existing policies of Left–Liberal America to be a more traditional inward-looking America with a calibrated approach to the world to maintain its position as the numero uno.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXTBZNnWOJV6	2024-11-09T17:22:56-08:00	
Interventionism, Sanctions, And Conflict: The Hallmarks Of US For...	Many countries around the world harbor unwarranted fears about the re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024. However, a review of the history of U.S. foreign relations suggests that Trump’s foreign policy may not differ dramatically from that of his predecessors, including the incumbent President Biden. In fact, there are clear continuities in the way U.S. presidents—whether Republican or Democrat—engage with military intervention and the use of force. Take, for example, the military interventions under Republican George W. Bush. Bush invaded Afghanistan in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, occupying the country for nearly 20 years. The U.S.-backed government of Ashraf Ghani collapsed in 2021, leading to a negotiated return to power for the Taliban. Similarly, Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to the deaths of approximately 4.6 million people and inflicted trillions in costs over two decades, consequences that continue to shape the region today. Democrat Barack Obama also authorized military action in Libya in 2011, which further destabilized North Africa and contributed to the growth of extremist groups in the region. Trump, during his first term, explicitly violated international law when he ordered the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, an action that heightened tensions with Tehran. Biden’s administration, meanwhile, has largely continued this trajectory, ignoring Moscow’s security concerns and pushing forward with NATO expansion, which played a significant role in triggering the war in Ukraine. Biden's tough stance toward China—continuing Trump’s aggressive approach—has included military posturing around Taiwan and the expansion of U.S. military bases in the Asia-Pacific region. Biden also continued to engage in proxy conflicts, such as his administration’s ongoing military operations in Yemen alongside the UK. The U.S. has also maintained its unwavering support for Israel, including its controversial actions in Gaza, leading critics to accuse Washington of complicity in war crimes and violations of international law. Life, war, and nothing else: this observation by the renowned Italian historian Oriana Fallaci, in her famous work of the same title, captures a grim reality of U.S. foreign policy, where the instruments of war and military intervention have dominated since the early 21st century. For the U.S., ensuring the loyalty of countries to Washington has long taken precedence over other concerns, driving U.S. presidents to repeatedly engage in military action and intervention around the world. The history of American interventionism is longer and more extensive than that of any other aggressor nation. Washington has frequently disregarded the sovereignty of other countries under the guise of promoting human rights and democracy. In 1953, the U.S. orchestrated a coup in Iran against its democratically elected government, sowing resentment that would culminate in the 1979 hostage crisis. In Vietnam, American forces fought a bloody war for two decades, only to suffer defeat and leave the region in chaos. In the 1980s, the U.S. funded and armed Islamic extremists to counter the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, contributing to the rise of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The 'color revolutions' in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, from 2003 to 2005, highlighted U.S. efforts to intervene in the politics of former Soviet states, often with the aim of establishing governments more aligned with Washington. Moreover, U.S. economic coercion, including secondary sanctions and export controls, continues to undermine the sovereignty of even Washington’s closest allies, leaving many nations vulnerable to American economic power. Given this history, it is clear that whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden is in office, the primary objective of the United States remains the maintenance of global dominance and the subordination of other nations to U.S. geopolitical interests. The differences between these leaders often lie more in rhetoric and style than in substance. Whether under Trump or Biden, the U.S. will continue to pursue aggressive policies toward China, offer unflinching support to Israel, keep Europe under its strategic thumb, and resist demands for more equitable engagement with the 'Global South.' In this sense, the fears surrounding Trump's return to the presidency are often exaggerated. Biden's administration has not been a radical departure from Trump’s foreign policy in many areas, particularly with regard to Russia, China, and the Middle East. Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021—a failure that Trump had similarly prepared for—demonstrated the inability of either party to manage the consequences of two decades of militarism in the region. Biden also escalated Trump’s confrontations with China, while pursuing policies that continue to inflame tensions in the Middle East, including his administration’s role in the normalization of relations between Arab states and Israel, sidelining the Palestinian issue in the process. Trump’s return to power would likely see a continuation of these policies, if not a further escalation. Trump, like Biden, remains committed to NATO expansion, confrontation with Russia, and the use of military force to maintain global hegemony. The U.S. commitment to military intervention and coercion will remain unchanged, and Washington’s role as the global policeman will continue—regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. Ultimately, whether under Biden, Trump, or any other future U.S. president, one principle of U.S. foreign policy remains certain: the reliance on coercive tools—military intervention, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure—will continue to dominate U.S. foreign relations. This strategy has been ingrained in the American political culture for decades, making war, violence, and intervention central tenets of U.S. diplomacy. The instability and crises afflicting the world today are the result of this unrelenting pursuit of dominance, a legacy that seems destined to continue for the foreseeable future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTZspKZPAPln9	2024-11-09T17:14:48-08:00	
Robert Reich: The Lesson – OpEd	A political disaster such as what occurred Tuesday gains significance not simply by virtue of who won or lost, but through how the election is interpreted. This is known as The Lesson of the election. The Lesson explains what happened and why. It deciphers the public’s mood, values, and thoughts. It attributes credit and blame. And therein lies its power. When The Lesson of the election becomes accepted wisdom — when most of the politicians, pundits, and journalists come to believe it — it shapes the future. It determines how parties, candidates, political operatives, and journalists approach future elections. There are many reasons for what occurred on Tuesday and for what the outcome should teach America — about where the nation is and about what Democrats should do in the future. Yet inevitably, one Lesson predominates. Today, I want to share with you six conventional 'lessons' you will hear for Tuesday’s outcome. None is or should be considered The Lesson of the 2024 election. Then I’ll give you what I consider the real Lesson of the election. None of these are The Lesson of the 2024 election: 1. It was a total repudiation of the Democratic Party, a major realignment. Rubbish. Harris would have won had there been a small, less than 1 percent vote shift in the three main battleground states. The biggest shift from 2020 and 2016 was among Latino men. We don’t know yet whether Latino men will return to the Democrats; if they don’t, they will contribute to a small realignment. But the fact is America elected Trump in 2016, almost reelected him in 2020, and elected him again in 2024. We haven't changed much, at least in terms of whom we vote for. 2. If the Dems want to win in the future, they have to move to the right. They should stop talking about 'democracy,' forget 'multiculturalism,' and end their focus on women’s rights, transgender rights, immigrants’ rights, voting rights, civil rights, and America’s shameful history of racism and genocide. Instead, push to strengthen families, cut taxes, allow school choice and prayer in public schools, reduce immigration, minimize our obligations abroad, and put America and Americans first. Wrong. Democrats shouldn’t move to the right if that means giving up on democracy, social justice, civil rights, and equal voting rights. While Democrats might reconsider their use of 'identity' politics (in which people are viewed primarily through the lenses of race, ethnicity, or gender), Democrats must not lose the moral ideals at the heart of the Party and at the core of America. 3. Republicans won because of misinformation and right-wing propaganda. They won over young men because of a vicious alliance between Trump and a vast network of online influencers and podcasts appealing to them. The answer is for Democrats to cultivate an equivalent media ecosystem that rivals what the right has built.Partly true. Misinformation and right-wing propaganda did play a role, particularly in reaching young men. But this hardly means progressives and Democrats should fill the information ecosystem with misinformation or left-wing propaganda. Better messaging, yes. Lies and bigotry, no. We should use our power as consumers to boycott X and all advertisers on X and on Fox News, mount defamation and other lawsuits against platforms that foment hate, and push for regulations (at least at the state level for now) requiring that all platforms achieve minimum standards of moderation and decency. 4. Republicans cheated. Trump, Putin, and election deniers at county and precinct levels engaged in a vast conspiracy to suppress votes. I doubt it. Putin tried, but so far there’s no sign that the Kremlin affected any voting process. There is little or no evidence of widespread cheating by Republicans. Dems should not feed further conspiracy theories about fraudulent voting or tallying. For the most part, the system worked smoothly, and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to election workers and state officials in charge of the process. 5. Harris ran a lousy campaign. She wasn’t a good communicator. She fudged and shifted her positions on issues. She was weighed down by Biden and didn’t sufficiently separate herself from him. Untrue. Harris ran an excellent campaign, but she had only a little over three months to do it. She had to introduce herself to the nation (typically a vice president is almost invisible within an administration) at the same time Trump’s antics sucked most of the oxygen out of the political air. She could have been clearer about her proposals and policies and embraced economic populism (see below on the real lesson), but her debate with Trump was the best debate performance I’ve ever witnessed, and her speeches were pitch perfect. Biden may have weighed her down a bit, but his decision to step down was gracious and selfless. 6. Racism and misogyny. Voters were simply not prepared to elect a Black female president. Partly true. Surely racism and misogyny played a role, but bigotry can’t offer a full explanation. Here’s the real Lesson of the 2024 election: On Tuesday, according to exit polls, Americans voted mainly on the economy — and their votes reflected their class and level of education. While the economy has improved over the last two years according to standard economic measures, most Americans without college degrees — that’s the majority — have not felt it. In fact, most Americans without college degrees have not felt much economic improvement for four decades, and their jobs have grown less secure. The real median wage of the bottom 90 percent is stuck nearly where it was in the early 1990s, even though the economy is more than twice as large. Most of the economy’s gains have gone to the top. This has caused many Americans to feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger. Harris did not. The real lesson of the 2024 election is that Democrats must not just give voice to the anger but also explain how record inequality has corrupted our system, and pledge to limit the political power of big corporations and the super-rich. The basic bargain used to be that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you’d do better and your children would do even better than you. But since 1980, that bargain has become a sham. The middle class has shrunk. Why? While Republicans steadily cut taxes on the wealthy, Democrats abandoned the working class. Democrats embraced NAFTA and lowered tariffs on Chinese goods. They deregulated finance and allowed Wall Street to become a high-stakes gambling casino. They let big corporations gain enough market power to keep prices (and profit margins) high. They let corporations bust unions (with negligible penalties) and slash payrolls. They bailed out Wall Street when its gambling addiction threatened to blow up the entire economy but never bailed out homeowners who lost everything. They welcomed big money into their campaigns — and delivered quid pro quos that rigged the market in favor of big corporations and the wealthy. Joe Biden redirected the Democratic Party back toward its working-class roots, but many of the changes he catalyzed — more vigorous antitrust enforcement, stronger enforcement of labor laws, and major investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, semiconductors, and non-fossil fuels — wouldn’t be evident for years, and he could not communicate effectively about them. The Republican Party says it’s on the side of working people, but its policies will hurt ordinary workers even more. Trump’s tariffs will drive up prices. His expected retreat from vigorous antitrust enforcement will allow giant corporations to drive up prices further. If Republicans gain control over the House as well as the Senate, as looks likely, they will extend Trump’s 2017 tax law and add additional tax cuts. As in 2017, these lower taxes will benefit mainly the wealthy and enlarge the national debt, which will give Republicans an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — their objectives for decades. Democrats must no longer do the bidding of big corporations and the wealthy. They must instead focus on winning back the working class. They should demand paid family leave, Medicare for all, free public higher education, stronger unions, higher taxes on great wealth, and housing credits that will generate the biggest boom in residential home construction since World War II. They should also demand that corporations share their profits with their workers. They should call for limits on CEO pay, eliminate all stock buybacks (as was the SEC rule before 1982), and reject corporate welfare (subsidies and tax credit to particular companies and industries unrelated to the common good). Democrats need to tell Americans why their pay has been lousy for decades and their jobs less secure: not because of immigrants, liberals, people of color, the 'deep state,' or any other Trump Republican bogeyman, but because of the power of large corporations and the rich to rig the market and siphon off most of the economy’s gains. In doing this, Democrats need not turn their backs on democracy. Democracy goes hand-in-hand with a fair economy. Only by reducing the power of big money in our politics can America grow the middle class, reward hard work, and reaffirm the basic bargain at the heart of our system. If the Trump Republicans gain control of the House, as seems likely, they will have complete control of the federal government. That means they will own whatever happens to the economy and will be responsible for whatever happens to America. Notwithstanding all their anti-establishment populist rhetoric, they will become the establishment. The Democratic Party should use this inflection point to shift ground — from being the party of well-off college graduates, big corporations, 'never-Tumpers' like Dick Cheney, and vacuous 'centrism' — to an anti-establishment party ready to shake up the system on behalf of the vast majority of Americans. This is and should be The Lesson of the 2024 election. What do you think?

Sri Lanka’s Parliamentary Election – OpEd	Sri Lanka's President Dissanayake made a smart decision to dissolve parliament after winning the presidential election on September 21. The national legislature was dissolved on September 24, and the election has been scheduled for November 14, 2024. Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are increasingly becoming predictable regarding winners and losers. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) wanted a two-thirds majority in 2020, and the SLPP-led coalition won a two-thirds majority. One of the reasons why the general elections lack excitement and unpredictability is that winning presidential candidates opt to dissolve parliament and go for fresh elections in the hope of capitalizing on the euphoria created by the presidential election results. It is the same logic that prompted President Dissanayake to dissolve parliament. This time, there are hardly any doubts about the victory of the JVP/NPP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna/National People’s Power). It will emerge as the single largest party in the national legislature. However, the question is, would the JVP/NPP win a clear majority on November 14? The JVP/NPP presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake presented himself as the 'change' candidate in the presidential election. However, after winning the presidential election, the Dassanayake administration has not demonstrated a keen interest in any substantial changes to the system. Not even policy changes have been announced as they continue with the key policies and practices of the previous governments, especially the government of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Many examples could be cited. The primary examples include the decision to continue with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) bailout deal, the decision to seek membership in BRICS, an emerging group of powerful states including China, India, and Russia, and the decision to continue with the fuel price formula system. There could be three reasons why the present government has not introduced any significant changes. First, the government is inexperienced. The cabinet of ministers has only three ministers, including the president. This was not by choice because the party had only three members in the previous parliament, and the Sri Lankan constitution does not allow ministers to be appointed from outside parliament. The JVP/NPP was not inclined to partner with like-minded parties in parliament to form a reasonable-sized cabinet because the party believed that all others in parliament were corrupt or unclean except for the JVP members. This is precisely why the party has urged the voters to 'clean' the parliament through their votes on November 14. Nevertheless, the government's inexperience may be preventing it from contemplating structural changes Dissanayake’s voters wanted. The present administration operates like a government with an opposition mentality. More resources and energy have been spent on criticizing the opposition parties rather than addressing administrative issues. Second, the government may be hesitant to introduce any structural changes because it fears that any immediate alterations could create an economic crisis like the one instigated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022. Returning to the era of queues was a slogan Dissanayake’s critics used against him during the presidential election. They argued that voting Dissanayake to power would push the country back to long queues for essential commodities. Third, the government may be waiting until the parliamentary elections are over to initiate structural change. For the moment, the government seems to have considerable support, which could be translated into votes essential to win the election on November 14. The idea is not to rock the boat before the election. In other words, the government may be playing it safe until the parliamentary election. If this is the case, the election results would shed more light on the government's system change plans. Failure to introduce substantial changes immediately could disappoint the JVP/NPP supporters, who expected revolutionary reforms during the presidential election. Would this disappointment damage the JVP/NPP votes in the parliamentary election? It is unlikely because they understand the need to win the parliamentary election. However, continuing Wickremesinghe policies without substantial change, even after the election, could set off resistance from JVP’s grassroots supporters and aragalaya proponents. Therefore, the JVP/NPP government could be under pressure after the parliamentary election. Does this mean the JVP/NPP is entirely safe in the parliamentary election? It is important to note that the government encountered several issues that have the potential to reduce its votes in the parliamentary election. For example, the increasing Israeli presence in Sri Lanka has the potential to dent the Muslim votes of the JVP/NPP slightly. In November 2024, The United States and a small number of Western states publicly warned about an impending attack on Israeli tourist facilities in Sri Lanka, which, on the other hand, exposed the sudden increase of Israeli visitors and Israeli interest in Sri Lanka. The government immediately took action to protect these facilities with enhanced security arrangements to the dissatisfaction of the local Muslim population. In the 2024 presidential election, compared to other minority communities, Muslim voters favored Dissanayake. They vehemently defended and promoted Dissanayake. For example, Dissanayake won Beruwala, a Muslim region, with about 42 percent of the votes. Therefore, one cannot underestimate the Muslim support of the JVP/NPP. The Israeli issue could discourage some Muslim voters from voting for the JVP/NPP on November 14. Another issue that could potentially take some votes from the JVP/NPP column is the government’s inability to control the prices of essential commodities. Reports indicate that rice and coconut prices have skyrocketed. The government also could not reduce fuel (petrol and diesel) prices. These issues can potentially limit the JVP/NPP votes in the parliamentary election. These issues, however, are unlikely to prevent the JVP/NPP from winning the election. Many voters in Sri Lanka currently seem to have a special relationship (based on expectations rather than satisfaction) with the JVP/NPP government. If they believe the government will eventually address their needs, they will continue voting for the JVP/NPP. On the other hand, if one translates Dissanayake’s presidential election votes to parliamentary votes, the JVP/NPP will win about 110 seats, three short of a clear majority. There is no evidence to suggest that the party has substantially increased its support base in the last month and a half. Therefore, the party is highly unlikely to win a two-thirds majority. Last week, a JVP/NPP leader declared that the party is not seeking a two-thirds majority. Perhaps the signals are clear. However, many JVP/NPP supporters and sympathizers strongly believe that the party will easily win the majority in parliament. They argue that no strong opposition exists to challenge the JVP/NPP supremacy. What is important to note is that the opposition votes could be scattered. A striking reality that many JVP/NPP supporters fail to consider is that the party won two elections (the presidential election and the Elpitiya pradeshiya sabha election) in the recent past. The JVP/NPP failed to get 50 percent of the votes in both polls. I believe that a warning shot has already been fired in the Elpitiya election because, compared to the presidential election, the JVP/NPP lost some votes in Elpitiya, and the SLPP managed to increase its share of the votes. Since the Gotabaya Rajapaksa votes transformed into Dissanayake votes in the presidential election, the Elpitiya results should worry the JVP/NPP supporters. Moreover, Elpitiya is a heavily Sinhala region. The parliamentary election includes Tamil voters, who did not prefer Dissanayake in the presidential election. The Tamils in the Northern and Eastern provinces would mostly vote for Tamil political parties. Therefore, theoretically, Sri Lanka could end up with a hung parliament on November 14.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTTsIqpsIDcPn	2024-11-09T17:07:33-08:00	
Tawhid, Torah And Three Unique Abrahamic Religions – OpEd	There are hundreds of millions of people today who have two or three self-identities. This was also true 3,500 years ago; although to a much lesser extent than today. For example, Prophet Abraham is called a Muslim in the Arabic Qur'an; and in the Hebrew Bible he is called a Hebrew [speaker] and a Babylonian immigrant who crossed the Jordan River. The term ivri (the Hebrew) first appears in the Torah, when Prophet Abraham is called 'the Hebrew: 'And it was told to Abram the Hebrew' (Genesis 14:13) Prophet Joseph uses the name Hebrew as both a geographical and an socio-ethnic term: 'I was kidnapped from the land of the ivrim' (Genesis 40:15), and 'The Egyptians would not eat with the ivrim, since that would be an abomination' (Genesis 43:32) The word Muslim is a religious identity term that refers to all faithful monotheistic believers who submit to the one and only God who created the universe. The word Hebrew is a linguistic, geographical and ethnic identity term like German [a language], Germany{a country] and Germans [a people]. The word descendent is a biological inherited birth identity term like nobility or tribe. Islam is a religion designed by God to overcome all other self-identities: 'O mankind, We created you from male and female, and made you (into) peoples and tribes, that you may know (respect) one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.' (Quran 49:13) 'Once all humans were but a single community; then they disagreed (formulating different beliefs and rites). Had it not been that your Lord had already so ordained, a decisive judgement would have been made regarding (the truth of) their disagreements.' (Qur'an 10:19) In those generations all human communities created different religions of their own with different creeds and ways. Now, if you desire that Allah Himself should uncover the truth and present it to you to enable you to decide which religion is the true one, you should know that this will not be done in this lifetime, because God now requires you to decide this yourself by using your own intelligence and your moral kindness. This worldly life is a trial to see whether or not you yourselves recognize truth by competing in doing acts of kindness, toleration and welcoming others who are different into your lands. This is why the Qur'an declares: 'Let there be no compulsion in Religion: truth stands out clear from error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah (one God) has grasped the most trustworthy unbreakable hand hold: Allah hears, and knows all things.' (2:256) The three Abrahamic religions; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, are closer to each other than each of them is to any non-Abrahamic religion. Yet each of the three religions is very unique; and each relates to the other two in its own unique way. 'And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good; and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.' (4:125) There could be no Christians before the birth of Jesus; and although there have been many hanif muslim monotheists, they could not be members of the Muslim Umma prior to the revelation of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad. Judaism is unique because the Jewish People actually proceeded the Jewish religion. Thus Qur'an 3.67 states: Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was one pure of faith and a muslim (submitting to the one God). He was never of those who associate partners with God.' Abraham could not be a Jew or a Christian, because both the Torah and Gospel were revealed centuries after Abraham. Historically, Judaism and Christianity are the names given to the religions revealed to Prophet Moses and Prophet Jesus, respectively by their faithful followers. The diversity among mankind mentioned in Qur'an 49:13 is mentioned with a comprehensive affirmation that its purpose is that different groups and individuals were enabled to learn to know each other. This point is underlined in several verses teaching that diversity in ethnicity, colour, faith and culture was intended by the Creator: 'If God had so willed, He would have made you one community, but He wanted to test you through that which He has given you. (5:48) 'If your Lord had pleased, He would have made all people a single community, but they continue to have their differences. (11:118–19) And 'Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed. So can you [Prophet Muhammad] compel people to believe? (10:99) Among attributes most American Jews consider essential to being Jewish, 82% say caring about Israel, with 58% saying that they feel attached to the nation of Israel; 76% say remembering the Holocaust; 72% say leading an ethical life; and 59% say working for justice and equality. Jews do have many names to self-identify because they have been immigrants for a little more than half of their 36-7 centuries of Jewish history. Even more important, by God's design Prophet Abraham's biological descendants through Isaac and Jacob became the first ongoing monotheistic community to last to this very day. 'And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – those of strength and [religious] vision. Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [the 'safe haven' Land of Israel]. And indeed they are to Us among the chosen and outstanding.' (Qur'an 38:45-7) The Christian community and the Muslim Umma were formed by those individuals who became faithful believers in the Gospel or the Qur'an. But the Banu Israel-the Jewish People only received the Torah after several generations of oppression in Egypt, when the Jewish People escaped and stood at Mount Sinai and received the Torah from Prophets Moses and Aaron. This is why the history of the People of Israel Hebrews makes up such a large place in the Hebrew Bible. Indeed, the name 'Israel' is mentioned 2,319 individual times in the Hebrew Bible because the historical experiences of the nation of Israel (the descendants of Jacob/Israel) is the central focus of most of the books in the Hebrew Scriptures. As the Qur'an states: 'And We certainty settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement [Israel] and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them. So your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ. So if you [Muhammad] are in doubt, about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (Qur'an 10:93-4) Judaism, as the abstract term is understood today, did not exist. There was not even a word for 'religion' in any traditional Jewish language. Rather, what we call 'Judaism' today was generally understood as a complex amalgam of religious belief, practice, and national/ethnic identification. That view prevailed in many Jewish circles until modern times and is best exemplified in the Biblical Book of Ruth. Ruth clearly states that she identifies first with the people of her mother-in-law Naomi, and only after that with Naomi's God (1:16). In other words, Ruth was adopted into the Jewish people first because of her identification with the Jewish people, followed by her attachment to the God of Israel. Ruth's oath is still stated by converts today: Ruth replied, 'Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.' (Ruth 1:16-17) Although most Jews share a common gene pool, they are not a race because any non-Jew who converts to Judaism will be recognized as being Jewish by all those rabbis who share a commitment to the same denomination of Judaism as the rabbi who did the conversion. But what about the Jewish law that defines a Jew as anyone who is born of a Jewish mother. Isn't this evidence of Jewish racial thought? For Christians, who believe that only adult baptism as a result of personal belief (Protestant), or infant/child baptism by an authorized church sacrament (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) makes one a Christian, it seems strange that children of any Jewish mother, religious or not, are Jewish; even if the father was not Jewish and the children know little or nothing about Jewish beliefs. But Muslim law says the same thing for the male gender: children of any Muslim father are Muslim, even if the mother was not Muslim; and Muslims are clearly not racist. In truth, Christianity is an unusually disembodied religion compared to Judaism, Islam and many eastern religions, and there is no reason other religions should be equally disconnected from the ethnic body of their original believers. When it comes to Jews who are non-religious or even anti-religious, they are considered secular or cultural Jews, unless they as adults convert to another religion. Like most nations, Jews have a national language, a shared history, which is much longer than most nations, and a style of cooking and thinking that is as distinctive as that of many other nations. But the Jewish People is a very unusual kind of nation: a transnational mobile nation; what Russian Communists used to call 'unrooted cosmopolitans'. From the very beginning. when Abraham and Sarah left their families and homeland to immigrate to the Land of Israel, the majority of the Jewish People has been subject to major geographic relocations. What the Jewish People have lacked for most of their 3,500 year history was an independent Jewish State located in one geographical area. However, states come and go (Yugoslavia) and go and come (Poland and Israel) so having a state, and a stable territorial location, is not in the Jewish experience, the most important aspect of being a nation. Being a faithful part of the Jewish community in terms of group connection and religious action is more central to being Jewish than adhering to credal statements. That is why the majority of Jews do not view 'Jews for Jesus' or Messianic Jews as belonging to the Jewish community. The answer to the question of what are Jews is that Judaism and the Jewish People are so deeply intertwined they cannot and should not be separated. Individuals Jews act in all kinds of ways, but the historical community of Jews is a blend of Jews by birth (genes) and Jews by belief, behavior and belonging. As anyone who has visited present day Israel knows, Jews come in many shades and looks. This is because even in the diaspora, and even against the will of the ruling religious authorities, Jews have almost always, when they were free to do so, proselytized their neighbors, and quietly welcomed converts into the Jewish community, even against the formal rules of medieval rabbis. That is why most Jews in different geographical locations tend to look similar to the local majority after a few centuries. This could not happen without significant marriage with converts to Judaism. The rabbinical rule that one should not refer to any Jew's convert status is evidence of the desire of Jewish leaders to keep Jewish proselytizing activities hidden from the ruling non-Jewish religious authorities. Yet from the very beginning converts to Judaism and their genes, have entered the Jewish gene pool. In the west today many converts are descendants of ex-Jews from previous generations who are now returning to the Jewish People, and bringing home some lost Jewish genes; as well as some non-Jewish genes with them. This is how it has always been to a greater or lesser extant. Thus it is clear that Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people because non-Jews can always enter the Jewish community, and become a part of the inter-national Jewish community.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTfw6FR-a0AHP	2024-11-09T17:01:35-08:00	
TTP And ISKP: Two Sides Of The Same Coin – OpEd	For over two decades, Pakistan has been embroiled in a battle against groups that cloak their violent actions in religious rhetoric. Among the most notorious of these are TTP and ISKP. Though these groups present themselves as distinct entities, they are two sides of the same coin—both driven by a Khawariji ideology that has been declared un-Islamic by religious scholars. The relationship between TTP and ISKP goes beyond ideological alignment. While each group may superficially claim a unique identity, their origins and leadership have substantial overlap. The first leader of ISKP, Hafiz Saeed Khan, was previously a well-known TTP commander from Pakistan’s Orakzai agency. This connection extends beyond individual members; TTP and ISKP share personnel, tactics, targets, and objectives, leading experts to believe that they are, in essence, two fronts of the same battle against Pakistan. The nexus between these groups extends to their operations and resources. Both TTP and ISKP have found refuge in Afghanistan, where they enjoy safe havens free from conflict with one another, despite their alleged rivalry. While ISKP openly criticizes the Afghan Taliban and has clashed with them physically, it maintains a strangely neutral or even supportive stance toward TTP. This relationship suggests that ISKP and TTP are cooperating at some level, creating a perception that TTP may be using ISKP to deceive and divide Pakistani authorities and the public. The ideological foundation of both TTP and ISKP can be traced back to Khawarijism, a sect that emerged in early Islamic history and was known for its extreme and uncompromising views. The Khawariji ideology advocates the use of violence against Muslims who do not adhere to their narrow interpretation of Islam, labeling them as infidels. This ideology has been denounced by Islamic scholars around the world, including those in Pakistan, who have deemed it un-Islamic and 'haram' (forbidden). The Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa, endorsed by Pakistani scholars from various sects, specifically condemns the actions of groups like TTP and ISKP as haram, asserting that armed struggle within Pakistan is fundamentally against Islamic principles. Yet, TTP and ISKP continue to exploit religion to radicalize young, impressionable minds. They employ twisted interpretations of Islamic teachings to justify heinous acts of terrorism, targeting civilians, religious scholars, mosques, and schools. While these groups claim to fight in the name of Islam, their actions reveal the opposite. They engage in acts of brutality that Islam explicitly condemns, including suicide bombings, which are forbidden in Islamic jurisprudence. Their manipulation of youth into carrying out suicide missions further highlights the hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy of their cause; while young recruits are encouraged to sacrifice their lives, the leaders of these groups rarely, if ever, take such risks themselves. Another factor that binds TTP and ISKP is their role as foreign proxies. Their operational activities and financial resources are largely derived from external sources that have vested interests in destabilizing Pakistan. These foreign backers use these groups to further their own agendas, effectively making TTP and ISKP puppets in a larger geopolitical game. This aspect of their existence further distances them from any legitimate claim to Islamic principles, revealing their true motivations: serving foreign powers rather than pursuing any genuine religious or nationalistic cause. Both TTP and ISKP have been linked to foreign intelligence agencies, which use them to create unrest and destabilize Pakistan. By attacking both civilian and military targets within Pakistan, they attempt to sow fear, undermine public morale, and create an environment of instability. Their continuous efforts to destabilize Pakistan serve only to benefit their foreign handlers, further highlighting the role of these groups as pawns in a broader regional struggle. While TTP and ISKP may appear to target different groups, this distinction is strategic rather than genuine. TTP focuses on security forces, claiming its attacks as part of a 'legitimate' struggle, while ISKP has been known to attack religious gatherings, mosques, and scholars. This tactic serves to deflect public anger from TTP by allowing ISKP to take the blame for civilian-targeted violence. In this way, the TTP presents itself as a group focused solely on attacking state security apparatuses, while ISKP assumes the role of attacking 'soft' targets like religious institutions. This tactic of 'good cop, bad cop' allows them to maintain public confusion, diminishing a unified response against their terrorism. Furthermore, the TTP’s use of ISKP as a proxy allows them to deflect blame and manage public backlash in Pakistan. Whenever a particularly heinous act of terrorism occurs, ISKP often claims responsibility, distancing TTP from the outrage and condemnation that follows. This tactical divide is evidence of their strategic collaboration, and it underscores their shared goal of destabilizing Pakistan through different methods of terror. In sum, TTP and ISKP are two sides of the same coin, sharing a common Khawariji ideology and serving foreign interests in their campaign of terror against Pakistan. Their superficial distinctions are a tactical ploy to deceive the public and divert attention from their unified goal: the destabilization of Pakistan through un-Islamic acts of violence. The only way forward is a combined effort from Pakistan’s government, military, and religious scholars to expose these groups for what they are—agents of destruction who have no legitimate claim to Islam or its teachings. By building on the Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa and fostering public awareness, Pakistan can work towards eradicating these threats and securing a peaceful future for all its citizens.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXOOsbhUF-0y	2024-11-09T16:41:14-08:00	
Bangladesh: The Evil That Was The Behemoth Hasina And Her Gargant...	Shakespeare’s King Lear which, critics think, begins with a climax with the old and frail Lear already falling as he divides his kingdom among his three daughters in the very first scene. Similarly, horrible Hasina’s bloody regime already began to crumble with a climax early on (BDR massacre on 25-26 February 2009), only to end with another climax, the massacre of July-August 2024. This is not to speak of her countless other beastly atrocities and brutal acts of repression committed during more than a decade and a half in between. The almost long 16 years saw the inferno of the monstrous dictator’s barbaric mafia misrule. The carnival of her harrowing tales of oppression reached the finish line in July-August 2024 when the tables were finally turned on her and she, like many other dictators in modern history, had to flee the country for her life on 5 August. Just a few days before, on 23 July, the New York Times reported that 'An unbending leader’s crackdown rains carnage on Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s response to protests has left at least 150 people dead and created the biggest challenge yet to her grip on power.' On 29 July when her bloodthirsty crackdown on the popular students-people uprising was still going on with increasing intensity, (Ret) Col Mohammad Abdul Hoque, one of the best social media influencers, did one of his finest videos in support of the uprising. Many of those young and teenage school and college and university students, along with many nonstudent members of the public were already killed in hundreds, probably over a thousand all across Bangladesh. Although most of the major parties’ participation, including the BNP, was very half-hearted, far below the expectation of the nation, many writers, intellectuals, and social media influencers were highly encouraging and inspiring about the July-August Chatro Janata uprising that finally got the army on their side providing the most crucial help they needed. The works of the writers, intellectuals, and social media influencers were making a significant contribution to the moral, ethical and political reconstruction of Bangladesh and should therefore provide the building blocks in the progress of the foundation of the nation after the Awami destruction of it. All Bangladesh governments, including the present (interim) one and those to come in the future, may benefit from their patriotic and enlightening ideas. All such governments, now and later, should stay, as the majority of those writers and speakers clearly convey, rooted and anchored in Islam and Muslim identity—the identity of the vast majority of the country with justice, safety, peace and security ensured for all, regardless of caste and creed. Unfortunately, fascist Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) was a massively and monstrously Modi-fied ruling machine defrauding the nation right and left all the way. It was so horrendous in its oppression and so highly and hugely Hindu-spirited in its mafia political culture that it has justifiably acquired the humiliating acronym of BAL over the years of its awfully authoritarian rule. That acronym is just an abbreviation of the full name of the party with no cultural connotation or expletive implied. It’s like the last name ‘Chuppu’ of Hasina-appointed ‘President’ Shahabuddin (who rose through filthy and fishy means). চোরের মনে পুলিশ পুলিশ, যারা চুরি করে তাদের মনে সবসময় ভয় থাকে। No wonder, she dropped ‘Chuppu’ from her devilishly loyalist Shahabuddin just as she dropped ‘B’ of Bangladesh from her AL and just as she dropped Bangladesh and ‘Wazed’ to India in her devilish intentions. Barrister Fuaad Abdullah describes the BAL as a party that has existed all these years without their political circumcision (রাজনৈতিকভাবে যারা 'খাৎনা' বা 'মুসলমানি করা' ছাড়া অবস্থান করে আসছে)। BNP MP Rehana Akhtar Ranu’s classic চুদুর বুদুর or the BAL’s Dipu Modi’s নিষিদ্ধ পল্লীর ভাষা (language of the red light district), both told in the parliament in 2013, still rings funny with a hullabaloo. Donald Trump, famous for sharply ridiculing his political opponents by referring to their names, would have attacked the BAL the same way. Almost 16 years of Hasina regime leading up to July-August 2024 were a time of radical opposites and contrasts representing the forces of good and evil--fascist bondage, on the one hand, and freedom and liberation, on the other. As Dickens’s novel A Tale of Two Cities (London and Paris) begins with a famous juxtaposition of a series of paradoxes, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness ….' Dictator Hasina, dubbed a cruel canine crime minister and sadistic she-hyena prime monster, fell a sudden fall on 5 August only to flee away to her evil and egregious political backer India. Well-known journalist Masood Kamal rightly suggests: 'পতিত স্বৈরাচার হাসিনা মানুষ নন তিনি হাজার খুনের আসামি দৈত্ত দানব দুর্গন্ধযুক্ত আবর্জনা। ভারত এই 'মাল' কে কোথাও রপ্তানি করতে পারবেনা।' Barrister Fuaad Abdullah is just brilliant in talking about the need of embargo/moratorium to be imposed on the ‘uncircumcised’ BAL and Sheikh family/dynasty (রাজনৈতিকভাবে যারা 'খাৎনা' বা 'মুসলমানি করা' ছাড়া অবস্থান করে আসছে)। Even after Awami RakkhiBahini’s widespread killings and widespread Awami corruption during Mujib’s not too long reign, they were allowed to walk away without their ‘circumcision’ being complete. They made a comeback in 1996 and again in late 2008. In the words of self-employed Bangladeshi-Canadian A K Delwar Hussain, son of A K Rafiqul Hussain, second Joint Secretary of the then Awami Muslim League in the 1950s, '২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনের ঠিক আগে পরে বাংলাদেশের জয়-বাংলা ব্যবস্থা একটি পরিকল্পনা, সমন্বয় এবং সতর্কতার সাথে বাস্তবায়নের মাধ্যমে BAL এর ক্ষমতায় ফিরে আসার আয়োজন করা হয়েছিল! বাংলাদেশ সশস্ত্র বাহিনীর মূল অংশে আঘাত করে BALএর ষোল বছরের অশুভ যাত্রা শুরু হয়।আমাদের নিরাপত্তা, সার্বভৌমত্ব, সম্মান এবং গর্ব --আমাদের প্রিয় বাংলাদেশের সশস্ত্র বাহিনীকে কেন্দ্র করে ‘মিউটিনি ফর দ্য বাউন্টি'র’ লক্ষ্য করা হয়েছিল। ৫৭ জন অত্যন্ত বীর ও অভিজ্ঞ অফিসারকে অসহায়ভাবে হত্যা করা হয়। যারা এই মর্মান্তিক ঘটনা ঘটিয়েছে তাদের চুল-চেরা বিচার ও শাস্তি ছাড়া জাতি স্বস্তিতে থাকতে পারে না।' This is the voice of reason, voice of Bangladesh. To continue with Hasina the Terrible and her Awami fascists, India is the hiding place of the horrible hyena Hasina (1975-1981, 2024-?). It is also a communal, fanatical and fundamentalist Hindutva country, especially under the BJP-RSS Narendra Modi, known as the 'Butcher of Gujarat', ever hostile and inimical to Bangladesh and the Muslims of his own country. So, 'That is no country' (meaning India here) for patriotic Bangladeshis, regardless of their caste and creed. The quoted phrase is the opening words of W B Yeats’s 'Sailing to Byzantium' that makes an indirect reference to the poet’s country of birth Ireland. It was on 5 August that a 'terrible beauty was born', to borrow the classic oxymoron, again, from Yeats ('Easter 1916'), following an unprecedented bloodshed and genocidal violence starting from around 15-18 July. There was hardly any news leaked then in ​the state-controlled mass media. It was a media running in the heinous Hasina’s Dracula-and-Gestapo-style police and prison state of absolute authoritarianism. The recent spate of chaos and turmoil​--inhuman, blood-clotting, and heartbreaking​ as it was--started when ordinary students from all levels –schools, colleges, and universities--demanded that the ridiculously biased​ and discriminatory job quotas​ (intended for the utterly toxic and autocratic Hasina’s men of crooked and canine loyalty) be done away with so that the​ graduated or graduating students' fair share of jobs and job opportunities based on merit could be ensured and made available to them. But the call for their more than just and fair cause fell on ​the deaf ears of the hooded and horrible Hasina. Awfully authoritarian Hasina has entirely destroyed all kinds of human rights, civil rights, constitutional rights, and individual rights, there being no space for freedom of speech available, no scope for democratic dissent left, no room for free and fair electoral culture remaining and no ‘privilege’ for any opposition politics whatsoever under cultivation. Horrendous Hasina’s fascist ​one-party rule was a rule of ​nepotism, favoritism, cronyism, division, bondage, and state terrorism​ that had no limits during the last sixteen years. She was bent upon eliminating and annihilating the entire range of social justice and rule of law. To repeat after Fyodor Dostoevsky (in his The Brothers Karamazov), she thought that when there was no God (in her case, absence of strong political opposition), everything nefarious, notorious, and anarchically nihilistic was possible. In her enormously gargantuan appetite for power and corruption, she thought, as the French emperor Louis IV did, she was the state. Backed by India with which Hasina, by admission of her own foreign minister, developed a ’husband-wife’ relationship and also agreed to by politicians like Dr Col Oli Ahmad (not to speak of the alleged or fake rumours of her father’s origin of birth), she was gloating in glee in exercising her sole and absolute dictatorial authority and total grip on power. The latest round of slaughter by the ​hooded and hissing Hasina and her canine police was unleashed ​on young protesters from 15-18 July onwards and was still continuing through 5 August. They suddenly lost their tender lives and got their blooming dreams nipped in the bud. The number of casualties stood at least in hundreds (over one thousand killed and many more critically injured and dismembered), even if one goes by the most conservative estimate. No wonder, journalist Masud Kamal says: 'পতিত স্বৈরাচার হাসিনা মানুষ নন তিনি হাজার খুনের আসামি দৈত্ত দানব দুর্গন্ধযুক্ত আবর্জনা। ভারত এই 'মাল' কে কোথাও রপ্তানি করতে পারবেনা।' As the nation has noticed, those few days, especially since 18 July, were as dark and black as those of her bloody and beastly massacres before, one after another and also those of her father in the past, not too long after the birth of Bangladesh. In fact, the father-daughter duo’s days were doomed and dotted (one can’t miss them!) with some of the darkest and blackest and bloodiest in ​the history ​of the nation. Weeks and days of July (and to continue into early August) saw the entire count​ry immersed and engulfed in the loud and legitimate protest cries that were abruptly quelled by live bullets and deafening sound grenades from tanks and armored vehicles of the police (and later some isolated cases from the army too) descending like locusts and vultures on Dhaka streets. The country just witness​ed a wild carnage of school children, college and university students, small boys and girls, and innocent men and women on the​ir rooftops and by the side of their windows at home. That was the latest ​and ugliest manifestation of the idiotically fascist Hasina’s police rule behind the iron curtain she ​established since 2009. In July 2024 the country was bleeding from a brutal crackdown under the darkness of a nationwide curfew when there was a total internet shutdown and complete news blackout imposed by ​illegal, illegitimate and unelected Hasina killing hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed student protesters and the supporting members of the public. The nation is well aware that Hasina came to power in late 2008 for the second time through Indian-orchestrated foul means and was clinging to power since then by using all tools and means available to her in the state machinery—police, army, judiciary and the parliament​. Her cynical and manipulative tactics found ways to bend​ and twist all those ​presumably position hungry and/or ‘willing’ offices and institutions to her personal favor​ and ​her self-serving whim​s and caprices. ​In addition to police and paramilitary forces like RAB and BGB, autocratic Hasina was letting her party cadres armed with lethal weapons to ​ruthlessly assault and suppress the people ​in a deadly manner. By the force of her sheer and sordid authoritarian power, she held sham​ and shoddy​ and shadowy ​and ghostly ‘elections’-cum-selection​s again and again with the people indiscriminately killed and cowed down by her police, RAB and party operatives and apparatchiks. Dictator Hasina had her intelligence, administration and ‘law enforcement’ but actually lawless agents take away the freedom of press and freedom of expression; do blanket detentions, widespread repression, and enforced disappearances; commit rampant human rights violations and indiscriminate murders, and file millions of fake and baseless and harassing court cases against dissenting leaders, activists, journalists, writers, and thinkers, thus completely wiping out the whole range of democratic opposition consisting of numerous parties, big and small, major and minor. Never accountable to anyone, Hasina and her men were widely known to have been involved in massive loot and plunder from bank heists, foreign loans, mega projects, state coffers and state budgets in the name of so-called development, a mirage for the majority facing a complete moral, political, educational and economic decline and deterioration. All this oppression and repression was done by the horribly authoritarian Hasina with the help of her blind puppets and flatterers deployed in all the branches of the government during the last 16 years and also with the help of the government of her dark and evil allies in the neighbouring country. All this was also possible to a great extent by the fact that there was no strong and effective challenge coming from the political opposition. The major party, BNP, highly popular though it was, has been rendered weak and useless, primarily at the top level, due to the regime’s ongoing persecution and prosecution. The top ranks of the party were/are also ideologically lost and floundering, suffering from lack of worthy leadership. Many supporters and sympathizers accuse them of being ignorant, incompetent, compromising, uncommitted, opportunist, and hypocritical, widely rumored to be involved in demoralizing favoritism, nepotism, extortion scams and lucrative ‘businesses’ related to nomination, appointment and committee memberships at every level, from top to bottom. As mentioned at the outset, that was how the Hasina government recently attempted to 5suppress, with dastardly and despicable heavy-handedness, a great and just historic movement -- a movement of memorably 'terrible beauty' -- by millions of students and other people together demanding that the very unjust and unfair quota system for government jobs be scrapped. The evil quota system had earlier been in practice for many years, then dropped in the face of student protest a couple of years ago, then was reintroduced again in July (until it would be gone only after this most unwanted mass slaughter) by the autocratic and unelected government—as fascist and totalitarian as one could imagine, corrupt and rotten to the core. In the quota system, nearly 60% jobs were reserved for the government supporters and sycophants, their crooks and conmen and their dolts and dullards in the guise of different but deceiving, hoodwinking, dust-throwing and eye-washing categories with no true opportunities for merit-and-competition-based selection process. As a result, millions of students and other eligible job seekers found their future to be blank and bleak, and dark and dreary with no real hope and prospect for their dreams to come true. As Bangladesh knows, the Awami government was extremely fetid and fascist. It was intolerably and obnoxiously so since early 2009. Since then, hundreds and thousands of people, including political leaders and activists and journalists, were mercilessly killed and beaten and tortured to death. Since then, not to speak of those perpetrated before by the same party known for their notoriously nihilistic oppression, there were brutal and beastly massacre after massacre--Arson attack on double decker public bus near Hotel Sheraton (4 June 2004); Logi Boitha (Boat Hook and Oar) massacre on 28 October 2006; BDR massacre (25-26 February 2009; Hefazat massacre (5 May 2013); Jamaat-Shibir massacre (17 December 2013; and countless other killings by the Hasina regime throughout the last 16 years. Since 2009, there were hundreds and thousands of premeditated political murders, killings, kidnappings, and enforced disappearances by the Hasina police, Indian-infiltrated Hasina DGFI, and Hasina’s party thugs in separate, yet connected incidents, which became a regular phenomenon of repression made possible by direct state terrorism unleashed by Hasina and her henchmen. Since then, there were thousands and thousands of detentions, including those inmates in the dark dungeon AinaGhor, inhumanly tortuous remands and deadly beatings and incarceration in jail, many dying or getting critically injured due to police brutality while in custody or in open public places. Last two weeks of July and the first few days of August were no different when hundreds and thousands of protesting students and ordinary people joining together in solidarity were being maimed, wounded and shot to death with machetes and live bullets on the streets and even in their homes – bullets coming from the helicopters flying overhead and also the tanks and armored vehicles deceptively carrying the UN signs and logos. All concerned worldwide were then requested to bring that plight and predicament of the people of Bangladesh to the attention of the freedom-loving international news and human rights organizations and ask their respective governments to take necessary punitive and punishing measures against the almost two decades-old Awami regime that had brought the nation of 175 million people to their knees during the regime’s iron-fisted muscle-powered mafia rule of malicious intent for that long duration. All concerned also took the opportunity to sincerely urge the democracy-loving international entities and authorities to take steps to force that utterly obnoxious regime headed by Hasina the Horrible to go. Time was long overdue then to force a regime change with Hasina caught, detained, handcuffed, chained, remanded, imprisoned and brought to justice. Time was overdue to bring to power a third party of honest and committed people drawn from selected politicians, academics, intellectuals, journalists, political analysts and other professionals. We the people of Bangladesh needed the help of Chatro Janata (political parties failing), America and the West to achieve this democratic, patriotic and nationalist goal to save our country from the clutches of a ferociously fascist regime led by Hasina the Horrible, far worse than Hitler, Namroud (Nimrod) and Feraoon (Pharoah)! Thank God the country would be free on 5 August! Post-5 August unacceptable role of the BNP However, it’s unfortunate that the BNP, under its present incompetent leadership, has been playing a mew-mew cowardly and compromising role despite being a target of nonstop ruthless oppression by the fascistically strong BAL. Cowed down by its RAW-BAL-engendered B-team-like ineptitude and inability, BNP has been drifting and deviating far, for well over a decade, from the patriotic, nationalist, pro-Islam, and pro-Bangladesh ideals and legacies of their party’s great and glorious founder late President Ziaur Rahman and then the stellar and spectacular Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. Not only that, they, including her treacherously selfish son, never fought for Begum Zia and against the injustice she suffered for years. It is in this context that the BNP’s Standing Committee Member (Ret) Maj Hafizuddin Ahmad Bir Bikram has recently hurled blistering criticism of the horrible Hasina BAL, praising the students-people movement and vilifying those (maybe some of his own party!), who are shamelessly compromising with the fascist Hasina and her party associates consisting of mafia gangs and goons and hoodlums and hooligans. Barrister Fuaad Abdullah was also brilliant in asking for the political dialysis for the endlessly corrupt and criminal Hasina BAL whose ‘kidney’ (in metaphorical sense) has gone extremely bad. At the same time he also took to task those people and parties (perhaps implying the hopelessly useless BNP leaders like Mirza Fakhrul), who are still trying to play civil and sympathetic to the Hasina BAL. In the name of being so-called civil/সুশীল to the fascist BAL, Mirzas and Fakhruls of the BNP also have become indistinguishable from the forces of Hasina, as Fuaad Abdullah claims. Those who are stupid to the extent of being shamefully soft and weak and compromising with the hugely Modi-fied and highly Hinduized Hasina BAL need to be kicked out immediately. Committing perfidy, they are traitors and betrayers to Zia’s and Begum Zia’s ideals and legacies and thereby to the people of the whole country, who suffered indescribably hard in the hands of the Indianized fascist Hasina BAL. (Ret) Maj Delwar Hussain rightly attacks the mew-mew Mirza Fakhrul. এই প্রসঙ্গে আরো বলতে হয়, এই বিএনপি অমর ও মহান জিয়া ও বেগম জিয়ার আদর্শের দল নয়। অনেকে বলে থাকেন এই বিএনপি ও বাল (BAL) একই মুদ্রার এপিঠ এপিঠ। এই বিএনপির বড় ছোট বিভিন্ন পর্যায়ের অনেকই RAW Mathur India-controlled অযোগ্য, চাঁদাবাজ দখলবাজ, দুর্নীতিপরায়ন, আপোষকামী।এই বিএনপি আবার কখন কোথায় আন্দোলন সংগ্রাম করলো? তাদের লক্ষ লক্ষ লোক থাকা সত্তেও তেনারা হাসিনাকে নামাতে পারে নাই। RAW India-controlled and compromising, তেনারা মুজিব-হাসিনার মতই রাজপথ থেকে বার বার পালিয়েছেন। তেনারা যদি লক্ষ লোক নিয়ে হাসিনার গুনাহভবনের দিকে এগিয়ে যেতেন হাসিনা অনেক আগেইতো পড়ে যেত। হয়তো কিছু লোক মারা যেত। তেনাদের নয়াপলটন বা আরামবাগে সীমাবদ্ধ আন্দোলন ছিল লোকদেখানো। আন্দোলন সংগ্রাম করেছেন ছাত্র জনতা আর দুই GOP। তেনাদের নেতৃত্ব ছুটে যাবে এই আশংকায় ও আপোষকামীতার কারনে তেনারা লক্ষ লোক নিয়ে ঘরে বসেছিলেন। তেনারা তেমন শক্ত করে ডাকও দেননি ঝাঁপিয়েও পড়েননি। দায়সারা গোছের ডাক। ভারতিয় সৈন্যরা যেমন ১৯৭১-এ একদম শেষের দিকে যোগ দিয়েছেন বিনপিও ছাত্র জনতার আন্দোলনে একদম শেষের দিকে কিছুটা হয়তো ছুটে গিয়েছেন। যদি তেনারা জুলাই ১৫ থেকে ইনিয়ে বিনিয়ে যোগ দেয়ার কথা না বলে সমস্ত শক্তি দিয়ে ঝাঁপিয়ে পড়তেন তাহলে হাজার লোকের প্রানহানি হতনা হাজার লোকের অঙ্গহানি হতোনা। কাজটা করলেন ছাত্রজনতা ও GOP উভয় গ্রুপ আর কৃতিত্ব নিতে চাচ্ছেন BNP-র তেনারা। তড়িঘড়ি করে নির্বাচন করে ক্ষমতায় এসে ফাযদা লুটতে চাচ্ছেন। আমরা চাই বর্তমান ইউনুস সরকার অনেক দিন শাসন করুক এবং সব সংস্কার শেষ করুক এবং দেশকে RAW BAL মুক্ত করুক। জুলাই আগস্ট বিপ্লব শুধু তথাকথিত সংখ্যাগরিষ্ঠতার জোরে বিএনপির মত অথর্ব অয়োগ্য ভুয়া ভাঁওতাবাজ অকর্মক দলকে ক্ষমতায় আনার জন্য হয়নি। আমরা BAL-এর মতো BNP-র ও tyranny of the majority চাইনা অথবা দুই পার্টি মিলে মিশে সন্ত্রাস চুরি বাটপারি করে যাবে সেটাও চাইনা। আওয়ামী বালকেতো নিষিদ্ধিই করতে হবে। দেশে ইসলামী মনোভাবসম্পন্ন দেশপ্রেমিক অনেক পার্টি আছে। সবার ক্ষমতার অংশীদার হয়ে দেশের উন্নয়নে অবদান রাখুক সেটাই চাই। আবার হাসিনার গুনাহভবনের মতো কুখ্যাত হাওয়া ভবনের সাথে যারা জড়িত ছিল অথবা তাদের মতো অসাধু এবং অনুপযুক্ত বা আওয়ামী যুক্ত যারা লন্ডনে তারেক রহমান সাহেবকে ১৫ বছর ধরে ঘিরে আছেন এমন লোকদের উত্থান বা পূণর্বাসন চাইনা (শুধু এম এ মালেক একটু ব্যতিক্রম হতে পারেন)। অথচ তিনি তাদের সঙ্গ ছাড়ছেননা যেমন তিনি ঢাকা থেকে শুরু করে লন্ডন পর্যন্ত RAW Mathur-কেও ছাড়েননি। । ১৫ বছর ধরে তিনি লন্ডনে কোন উচ্চ শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের দোরগোড়ায়ও যাননি। দুঃখের বিষয় উনার শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতা ছোটবেলা থেকেই প্রশ্নবিদ্ধ। Enlightened intellectual Azam Mahmud is correct to say that 'মূলত বিএনপি এবং আওয়ামী লীগের ভিতরে তেমন কোন পার্থক্য নাই। দুটোরই বেশিরভাগ বড়-ছোট নেতা সমানভাবে পরিত্যাজ্য। এবং এই অতি ঘৃণ্য এবং অতি নিকৃষ্ট মহিলাকে বাদ দিলে তারা আসলে একই। পরস্পরের প্রতি সত্যিকারের সম্মানবোধ তাদের খুব একটা কখনোই ছিলো না। আর এই মহিলা যখন তার অন্তর ভরা বিষ এবং বিদ্বেষ নিয়ে সামনে আসলো, রাজনীতিবিদদের স্বভাবজাত সম্মান বোধের ঘাটতির কারণে তখন তার দলের অন্যেরাও (নিজস্ব স্বার্থ রক্ষার খাতিরেই) তার সাথে তাল মিলালো। ফলে একটা ভয়াবহ এবং অতি জঘন্য পরিবেশ এবং পরিস্থিতির উদ্ভব হলো। তার অবর্তমানে বিদ্বেষ টুকু যদি কেটে যায়, তারা আগে যেমন *খারাপ ভাবে* চলছিল তেমনি চলতে থাকবে।' People of Bangladesh think that the BNP’s appeasement of the BAL and India is tantamount to national treachery. That’s the view subscribed to by A K Delwar Hussain (identified above), who states that 'At the same time, BNP has played a foul sinister game along with the Awami Bha-RAT-io League in the past 16 years!!! BNP is the very reason by which the BAL perpetrated its ruthless mafia regime over Bangladesh. ‘চোরে চোরে হালি/এক চোরে বিয়া করে/আরেক চোরের শালি’. In hindsight, since Hasina's vacation to her BhaRAT, the role of the BNP has surfaced clearly, particularly through Mirza Fakhrul (whom Donald Trump, J D Vance and Elon Musk would have targeted as ‘fool’ and ‘trash’ and perhaps belittled as Mirza-Far Fake-Rule), Mirza Abbas (same as Fakhrul), Habibur Rahman Ya Habibi, Ya Rumman Farhana and others.' It’s the same view subscribed to by the veteran and highly knowledgeable Bangladeshi-British online activist and campaigner Zoglul Husain, who has this to say: 'স্বাধীনতা ও অর্থনৈতিক মুক্তির জন্য আজ আমাদের জাতীয় করনীয় হচ্ছে, ফ্যাসিবাদ ও আধিপত্যবাদকে সম্পূর্ণ পরাভূত করা এবং একটি দেশপ্রেমিক ও গণতান্ত্রিক সরকার প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। বর্তমান বিএনপি সহ যে সব দল ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদ ও আওয়ামী ফ্যাসিবাদের কাছে নতজানু রয়েছে, এবং ভারত ও আওয়ামী লীগকে তোষণ করে চলেছে, তাদের উচিত আত্মশুদ্ধি করা এবং ফ্যাসিবাদ ও আধিপত্যবাদের বিরুদ্ধে দৃঢ় অবস্থান নেওয়া, তা নাহলে তারা জাতীয় বিশ্বাসঘাতকতার ভূমিকাতে অবস্থান নেবে।' He takes the opportunity of the BNP’s 7 November observation this year (2024) to criticize the party’s ungrateful forgetfulness towards the 15 August heroes asking the Interim Government to withdraw all unjust lawsuits against them and allow them to walk free --- আজ, ৮ নভেম্বর ২০২৪, ঢাকার নয়াপল্টনে বিশাল মিছিল ও র‍্যালি করে বিকাল ৩ টা থেকে বিএনপি, ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর স্মরণে, বিপ্লব ও সংহতি দিবস উদযাপন করছে। কিন্তু, লক্ষ্য করার বিষয়, সেখানে ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান সম্বন্ধে কোন উচ্চবাচ্চ্য নেই। বলা বাহুল্য, ১৯৭৫ এর ১৫ আগস্ট, ৩ নভেম্বর ও ৭ নভেম্বর এক সূত্রে গাঁথা, ১৫ আগস্টের অভ্যুত্থান ৭ নভেম্বরে সম্পন্ন হয়। কাজেই, ১৫ আগস্টের গৌরবজনক অভ্যুত্থানের কথা ভুলে গিয়ে ৭ নভেম্বর উদযাপনে রয়েছে বিশাল ঘাটতি ও অসংগতি। এর কারণ বিএনপির অনেক বড় বড় নেতা আছেন যারা এখনও মুজিবভক্ত। অথচ মুজিব ছিলেন একজন ফ্যাসিবাদী জাতীয় বেঈমান, যিনি কখনো স্বাধীনতা চান নি, কিন্তু ক্ষমতায় এসেই যিনি ভারতের সঙ্গে মৈত্রী ও বন্ধুত্ব নামক ২৫ বছরের গোলামী চুক্তি করেছিলেন, ভারতের তৈরি রক্ষী বাহিনী দিয়ে ৩০ থেকে ৫০ হাজার দেশপ্রেমিক হত্যা করেছিলেন, সীমাহীন দুর্নীতি ও সীমান্ত পাচারের মাধ্যমে মানবসৃষ্ট দুর্ভিক্ষ সৃষ্টি করেছিলেন যাতে মৃত্যু হয় ১৫ লক্ষ মানুষের, যিনি বাকশাল সৃষ্টি করে গণতন্ত্র ধ্বংস করেছিলেন এবং যিনি জনগণের উপর হত্যা, নির্যাতন, নিপীড়নের স্টিমরোলার চালিয়ে জনগণের জীবন দুর্বিষহ করেছিলেন, আওয়ামী-ভারতীয় সীমাহীন লুণ্ঠনে দেশটিকে ঝাঁঝরা করেছিলেন এবং ভারতের কাছে স্বাধীনতা-সার্বভৌমত্ব বিকিয়ে দিয়ে বাংলাদেশকে ভারতের অধীন করেছিলেন, দেশকে ধ্বংসের অতল গহ্বরে ঠেলে দিয়েছিলেন। তখন দেশকে রক্ষা করেছিল ১৫ আগস্ট ও ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর বিষয়ে সেই সব বিএনপি নেতা চুপ থাকেন যারা মুজিবের প্রতি নতশির এবং ভারত ও আওয়ামী লীগের প্রতি নতজানু। তারা ভুলে যান ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ না হলে জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমানের উত্থান হত না বিএনপিও গঠিত হত না, এবং জামায়াতে ইসলামী দলও বাংলাদেশে রাজনীতি করতে পারতনা। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান যারা করেছিলেন তারা সকলেই সূর্য সন্তান, জাতীয় বীর। কিন্তু সাড়ে তিন যুগ পর ফ্যাসিবাদী জাতীয় বেঈমান, মুজিব কন্যা শেখ হাসিনা প্রতিহিংসার বশবর্তী হয়ে একটি প্রহসনের বিচার ঘটিয়ে এই জাতীয় বীরদের ৬ জনকে ফাঁসিতে ঝুলান, এরা সকলেই শহীদ। এছাড়াও অনেকে আছেন যাদের বিরুদ্ধে ফাঁসী অথবা জেলের রায় বলবৎ থাকায় তারা দেশে ফিরতে পারছেন না। আমরা আজ ৫ আগস্ট ২০২৪ এর গৌরবজনক ছাত্র-জনতা-সেনা অভ্যুত্থানের সকল শহীদদের যেমন শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে স্মরণ করি, তেমনি শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে স্মরণ করি ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর শহীদদের, ১৯৫২ র ভাষা শহীদদের, এবং স্বাধীনতা যুদ্ধসহ অন্যান্য সংগ্রামের শহীদদের। আমরা অন্তর্বর্তী সরকারের কাছে আবেদন জানাচ্ছি যে, ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ পর্যন্ত গৌরবময় সংগ্রামে দেশের পক্ষে অবস্থান নেওয়া যেসব বীরগণ, হাসিনার মিথ্যা আদালতের ফাঁসি অথবা জেলের আদেশের কারণে দেশে আসতে পারছেন না, তাদের উপর থেকে ঐসব মিথ্যা আদালতের মিথ্যা আদেশ প্রত্যাহার করা হোক। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ পর্যন্ত গৌরবময় সংগ্রামে দেশের পক্ষে অংশ নেওয়া সকল বীরগণকে জাতীয় বীরের মর্যাদা প্রদান করা হোক। Similarly, the following views of the decorated FF, former diplomat and author of dozens of books and articles, (Ret) Col Rashed Chowdhury also amount to the same line of argument. He comments: এটা বড়োই পরিতাপের বিষয় যে জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমানের সৃষ্ট বিএনপির বর্তমান নেতৃবৃন্দ ১৫ই আগস্টের ঐতিহাসিক অবদানকে অগ্রাহ্য বা অস্বীকার করছে। ১৫ই অগাস্ট না হলে জিয়াউর রহমানের উত্তান ঘটতোনা, বিএনপিরও জন্ম হতোনা। অর্থাৎ, জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমান, বিএনপি, বেগম জিয়া, তারেক রহমান এবং বিএনপির পূর্বাপর নেতৃশ্রেণী ১৫ ই আগস্টের ফসল। তাই ১৫ আগস্টকে অগ্রাহ্য করা মানে নিজ পিতৃত্বকে অস্বীকার করা, জারজ হিসাবে পরিচয় দেয়া। এই ঐতিহাসিক গরমিল ও ন্যাক্কারজনক পরিস্থিতি থেকে বিএনপিকে বেরিয়ে আসতে হবে এবং ঐতিহাসিক সত্যকে স্বীকার করে দেশ ও জাতিকে শুধু আস্বস্তই করতে হবে না, তাদেরকে মুক্তি দিতে হবে। নতুবা তারা দলটিকে কোনোদিন ক্ষমা করবে না। Col Chowdhury goes on commenting What is extremely unfortunate is that the present leadership of the BNP, locally headed by Mirza Fakhrul is making the life of the Interim Government (IG) difficult by continuously giving various threats and asking for a quick election. The whole nation agrees that there should not be election before necessary reforms, but Mirza wants to do the reform themselves. No way. All his threats are mostly in favor of rehabilitating the fascist Hasina regime and its disgraced Awami League. Looks like he didn't have enough of Hasina's fascism in the past 16 years and likes to bring them back to continue the same with perhaps more or increased intensity. Zia's assassination, KZ's suffering under Hasina mean nothing to him. খাল কেটে কুমির আনতে মরিয়া হয়ে উঠেছে। It's a sheer betrayal of not only the ideals of Ziaur Rahman's BNP but also the betrayal to the nation. But I believe the party's grassroots are still strong and are still following the original values enshrined by its founder. As such, I think the BNP grassroots should revolt and reject these pro-Awami, pro-Indian leadership. The BNP must return to Zia's BNP. And, let the IG continue working on its agenda of untangling the knots created by the fascists. I would say, the BNP of today was not so in Zia’s time.Mirza Fakhrul, by extension, maybe TR too, is displaying his pro-Awami, pro-Indian attitude more openly. To me, he is becoming a nuisance, to the extent of being an outright villain against the IG. Today he issued a warning that nothing can be done by the government by sidestepping the BNP. This is an outright rebellion. I think the IG should not ignore such villainous utterances from MF. He could be arrested for such a challenge to the running of the government. The IG and students-people should watch out. Whatever, such hostile challenges should not stop or slow down the necessary reforms that include the removal of Chuppu and impose a moratorium, if not total ban, on the Awami League. Also, I am not unaware of what Mirza Fakhrul has gone through over the years, most of which, according to me, were his/BNP’s own doing and their half-hearted opposition to the Hasina regime, some say India/Awami scripted. Mirza Fakhrul’s Mujib-Hasina-Chuppu-India pleasing attitude now gives credence to that. On the other hand, many of us have been screaming for years for the BNP to form a national unity with all parties, particularly the Jamaat, and create a tsunami to oust the fascists, but the Mirzas failed or did not heed. Now when the students-people did the same and succeeded, the Mirzas are out to grab the pie, to the extent of opposing the students-people and their IG. How can one exonerate this villainous attitude? 'Nothing can be done without BNP' is a thuggish statement. Common BNP members and members of other parties also died in the July/August movement but not a single top leader. They were in their Mujrakhana. That’s why I always say, problem is with the leadership, not with the grassroots, which is still strong and dedicated. It is not the question of election any time soon. The IG is already working on a roadmap. Putting undue pressure is counterproductive. There should be no election without the needed reforms, whatever time it takes. Such criticism of the BNP is in tons in Bangladesh itself as well as abroad. Criticism of patriots abroad cannot be overlooked. In today’s infotech, the diaspora is current with minute-by-minute details or developments back home. They know who is worth what and who sings whose songs. The contribution of Bangladeshi diaspora in the victory of August 5 is no less. And they do have a right to think about the good of the country. Enchanted by Mirza Fakhrul’s pro-Awami stances, Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the fallen Hasina regime, wanted to work with the BNP to establish democracy in Bangladesh. Hah-ha, is the sun rising from the west! First, Awami League’s desire to work for democracy in Bangladesh is as weird and ridiculous as a tiger asking a deer cub for peaceful cohabitation after devouring its parents. Second, this demonstrates how dangerous Mirza Fakhrul is turning the Bangladesh’s post-August 5 politics into the Awami hands. I think the IG, the students-people and the people at large must guard against such dubious characters who want to খাল কেটে কুমির আনতে। People must decide if Bangladesh can be safe in the hands of such dangerous leaders. The hard-earned victory of August 5 cannot be allowed to be hijacked or destroyed by rehabilitating the fallen fascists. Let me clarify. When I am talking about the dubious role of Mirza Fakhrul, I am not talking about the glorious BNP founded and nourished by Ziaur Rahman the Great. A highly intellectual-minded and well-educated business owner Bangladeshi-Canadian Shamim Iqbal Rony finds Bangladeshi-Belgian BAL Hasan Mahmud’s expression of interest to work with the BNP towards the establishment of democracy in Bangladesh deeply disturbing and disgusting. It is out of utter frustration that he says that 'Bangladesh is a bastard child of India and is like Palestine actually. We are basically owned by them and BAL is their slave manager. I don’t have much hope for this county, to be honest, as our people are the problem. We are happy to be slaves and have a memory of a goldfish.' To continue with Col Chowdhury finding the BNP’s post-5 August role highly unacceptable, মনে হচ্ছে বিএনপির বর্তমান নেতৃবৃন্দ, বিশেষ করে মির্জা ফখরুল, প্রফেসর ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে গঠিত এবং পরিচালিত অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের প্রতিপক্ষ হিসাবে অবতীর্ণ হয়েছেন। ছাত্র জনতার বিরুদ্ধে জনগণকে বিষিয়ে তোলার চেষ্টা করছেন। দেশের বৃহত্তম দল হিসাবে দেশ পরিচালনার দায়িত্ব নিতে চেষ্টা করছেন। কতেকটা বিশ্বাসঘাতক মুজিব কাহিনির পুনরাবৃত্তি । স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশ না চেয়ে, স্বাধীনতার ঘোষণা দিতে অস্বীকার করে এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধ থেকে পালানো মুজিব নয় মাস জল্লাদ ইয়াহিয়ার মেহমান খানা থেকে ফিরে এসে বনে গেলেন জাতির পিতা। জাতির কর্ণধার । ৪৪ মাসে দিলেন দেশটাকে বরবাদ করে, বারোটা বাজিয়ে। বিএনপির মির্জারা এখন তারই পায়তারা করছে। (মুজিব হাসিনা) বাপ বেটি যেমন ভারতের কথামত চলে দেশটাকে ভারতের করদ রাজ্য বানিয়েছিল, মির্জারাও সম্ভবত গোপনে তাই করছে। ৫ ই আগস্ট হাসিনা মুজিবের পতনে তার কান্না, হাসিনার বিচার না চাওয়া (বলেছেন তিনি হাসিনার মৃত্যু চান না, অর্থাৎ সহিসালামত চান), এসব কিসের আলামত? গণতন্ত্র বিকাশের দোহাই দিয়ে স্বৈরাচারী আওয়ামী লীগকে পুনপ্রতিঠার চেষ্টা চালাচ্ছে। চুপ্পুকে বিদায় নিতে বাধা দিচ্ছে। গতকাল প্রয়াত সাদেক হোসেন খোকার অনুষ্ঠানে ঔদ্ধ্যাত্বপূর্ণ বক্তৃতা দিয়ে বলেছেন, মাইনাস ফর্মুলা চলবেনা। বিএনপিকে কিছুতেই বাদ দেয়া চলবেনা। এটা দস্তুরমত সরকারকে হুমকি। এ যেন মুজিবের ‘কোথায় সিরাজ সিকদার, লাল ঘোড়া দাবড়াইয়া দিমুর’মতো ঔদ্ধ্যাত্ব। মির্জাই যেন দেশের প্রকৃত শাসক বা শাসনের হকদার। আমার মতে মির্জাদের এসব কর্মকাণ্ডের জন্য আইনী ব্যবস্থা নেয়া অতীব প্রয়োজনীয়। নতুবা ৫ d ই আগস্টের বিজয় নস্যাৎ হয়ে যাবে অতি শীঘ্রই। স্মরণ রাখবেন মুজিবও অনেকবার স্বেচ্ছায় বা নিজ অপকর্মের জন্য জেলে গিয়েছেন। অথচ স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশে তার অপকর্মের জবাব দেশের সিপাহী জনতা দিয়েছে ১৫ ই আগস্ট। পরিশেষে বলি, মির্জারা সাবধান। এবং ছাত্র জনতা এদেরকে চিনতে ভুল করবেন না। Texas-based Senior Engineer Aftab Sheikh (unlike the terrible Tungipara and #32 Sheikhs, some patriotic and sensible Sheikhs still roam the earth!) has this to say: আমার মনে হয় বিএনপি ৫ই আগস্টের চেতনা ধারনে Confidence হারিয়েছে। তার পেছনে বড় কারন হচ্ছে জামায়াতের মত চরিত্রবান, সুশৃংখল, আদর্শিকভাবে সুশিক্ষিত এবং সাংগঠনিক নীতির আনুগত্যকারী নেতা ও কর্মীবাহিনী গড়তে পারেনি । ৫ই আগস্টের পরে দলীয় শৃংখলা ভংগের কারনে বহু নেতাকে বহিস্কারাদেশ সহ শোকজ করতে হয়েছে। তাদের অনেকেই আওয়ামী স্টাইলে লুটপাটের ঘটনাও ঘটিয়েছে। এসব আচরন কেন্দ্রীয় বিএনপির পক্ষে কন্ট্রোল করা দুস্কর হয়ে পড়েছে। এসব থেকে সহজেই আন্দাজ করা যায় যে ক্ষমতায় গেলে কিভাবে বিএনপি এদের ঠেকাবে? অন্যদিকে, ফ্যাসীবাদ উৎখাতে সব দলের ও ছাত্র-জনতার অংশগ্রহন থাকলেও অত্যন্ত কৌশলী ও রিসকী এই আন্দোলেনের মুল নীল নকসা যে জামায়াত ও শিবির নেতারা এঁকেছিল তা দিবালোকের ন্যায় পরিস্কার হওয়ার পর বিএনপি হীনমন্যতায় ভুগছে। যদিও জামায়াত ও শিবির নেতারা এই সফলতার একচ্ছত্র দাবীদার তা ভুলেও করেনি। জামায়াত-এর এই উদারতার কারনে দিন দিন এক ঈর্ষনীয় ও অপ্রতিরোধ্য জনপ্রিয়তা (যেমন পিনাকীর ২ মিলিয়নের বেশী ফলোয়ারদের মধ্যে যে জরীপ তাতে জামায়াত ৫৪% এবং বিএনপি ২০%) আমজনতার মাঝে স্পষ্ট লক্ষনীয়। এতে বিএনপির এই হীনমন্যতা, হিংসা বা ঈর্ষা আরো প্রকট হচ্ছে। তারপর থেকেই লক্ষ্য করা যাচ্ছে বিএনপির নতুন রুপ। আর কেউ ক্ষমতায় গেলেও জামায়াত ক্ষমতায় যাক -- এটা তারা মেনে নিতে পারছেনা। সুতরাং আওয়ামী -- বিএনপি মিলে জামায়াত ঠেকাও আন্দোলন গড়ার ভবিষৎ চিন্তা থেকেই এমন একটি পোলারাইজেশন এর দিকে বিএনপি ধীরে ধীরে অগ্রসর হচ্ছে বলে মনে করার যথেষ্ট কারন রয়েছে। অন্যদিকে, বিএনপির এহেন আচরন জামায়াতকে আরো বেশী জনপ্রিয় করে তুলছে । Gen Z-এর চরিত্র বুঝতে বিএনপির বুডো ও মিশ্র আদর্শের (এক সময় বাম রাজনীতি করেছেন বা অন্যদল করছেন) ধ্বজাধারী নেতারা একেবারেই অক্ষমতার প্রমান দিচ্ছেন । যেমন, মীর্জা ফখরুল যিনি ছাত্র ইউনিয়নের নেতা ছিলেন, বলেছিলেন জামায়াতকে উদদ্যেশ্য করে ‘মৌলবাদী’ যা বাম ও লীগের বয়ানের নির্যাস । মীর্জা আববাস, সালাহউদদীনও এমন মন্তব্য করেছেন। রিজভী একা কুলিয়ে উঠতে না পেরে তিনিও সাথে তাল দিয়ে চলেছেন। এসব খুবই অনভিপ্রেত ছিল। আমার মতে ফখরুল ও আব্বাস এর মত অদুরদর্শী নেতারা বিএনপির হাল ধরে থাকলে কোনদিনই বাংলাদেশের মানুষ জুলাই-আগস্টের চেতনার ফল ভোগ করতে পারবে না। বাংলাদেশ যে তিমিরে ছিল সেখানেই বার বার ঘুরে ফিরে আসবে। আমার ধারনা ভুল হোক, বাংলাদেশ ঘুড়ে দাঁড়াক সেটাই কাম্য। ১৯৭৫ সালে আওয়ামী লীগকে এবং ছাত্রলীগকে শেখ মুজিব নিজ হাতে কবর দিয়ে গেছেন। সেই সংগঠন আর নাই । যেটা আছে সেটা জংগী ও মাফিয়া সংগঠন। অনুরুপভাবে, শহীদ জিয়ার ইনতেকালে মুলত বিএনপি জিয়ার আদর্শ থেকে বিচ্যুত হয়ে গেছে। শুনেছিলাম তিনি দলের নেতা কর্মীদের রাজনৈতিক প্রশিক্ষন দেয়ার মত একটা বিভাগ খুলতে চেয়েছিলেন । কিনতু সে সময় তিনি পাননি। কোন দলের নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে দলের লক্ষ্য, আদর্শ ও মোটিভেশন এ ঐক্য না থাকে ঐ দল দিয়ে আর যাই হোক দেশ গড়ার কোন কাজ করা সম্ভব নয়। ফখরুল সাহেব নিজেই স্বীকার করেছেন জামায়াত ও শিবিরের নেতা কর্মীরা নিয়মিত পড়ালেখা করে সংগঠনের একটা আবশ্যক কাজ হিসেবে——-তিনি প্রশংসা করতে বাধ্য হয়েছেন। কিনতু তার নিজের দলের নেতা কর্মীরা পড়াশোনা করে না সেটাও অকপটে স্বীকার করছেন। এই পড়ালেখার ফল কি হয়েছে জানেন? জামায়াত এর কেন্দ্রীয় আমীর থেকে শুরু করে কর্মী এমনকি সক্রিয় সমর্থক পর্যন্ত সবার মধ্যে চিন্তার ঐক্য আছে। যা একমাত্র কমিউনিস্ট পার্টী ছাড়া আর কোন দলে নেই। কেননা কমিউনিস্টদেরও বই পড়তে হয়। বিএনপি has lost their intrinsic values overtime. তাদের দলে শুদ্ধি অভিযান চালিয়ে জামায়াতের ফর্মুলায় শক্তিশালী জাতীয় সরকার গঠন করা ছাড়া দেশী বিদেশী সকল ষড়যন্ত্র মোকাবেলা করা দুরহ হয়ে পড়বে যে কোন এক দলের পক্ষে। কাজেই সময় থাকতে বিএনপি হাই কমান্ডের উচিত বিভেদ নয় বরং দেশের সার্থে লোভ লালসা ভুলে আপনারা ঐক্যবদ্ধ হোন । কাদা ছোড়াছুড়ি বন্ধ করুন। তাহলেই জংগী ও মাফিয়া আওয়ামী লীগ গং আর কখনই মাথা চারা দিয়ে উঠতে পারবেনা, ইনশাআললাহ। All the above views are the voice of reason, voice of logic, voice of Bangladesh. Like the kaleidoscopic বিশ্ব বেহায়া H M Ershad, pretty much RAW-Indian-looking BNP under its treacherous, incompetent and hypocritical Dhaka-London leadership has been shamelessly compromising its position towards the deeply and directly Indian-looking Hasina BAL, which has become an ‘Alias’ of a possible Indian Awami League for decades. It is as if the BNP hasn’t gotten enough lessons from হাসিনা ওরফে হিন্দুস্তান and her last 16 years of terror and torture. Was it all a prearranged drama staged for a shifting/rotating duty through RAW Mathur India? Both the BNP and the BAL have become indistinguishably synonymous with each other in their respective pro-Indian, anti-Muslim, anti-Islam, anti-Jamaat, anti-patriotic and anti-nationalist thuggish ruffian-type savage ‘gunday’ stance. It’s said that when the late Cuban President Castro was asked about the 1960 US elections between Nixon and Kennedy, his reply was that 'It is not possible to compare the two shoes worn by the same person. America is governed by only one party, which is the Zionist Party, and it has two wings: the Republican wing represents the hard-line Zionist power, and the Democratic wing represents the soft Zionist power.' The same is applicable to the BAL and the BNP, the former representing the hardcore Hindustani hegemony and the latter representing softcore. Is it that there are no differences in the so-called ‘goals and strategies’ of the BAL and the BNP, except that their ‘means and tools’ are to differ slightly to give each other some space to maneuver their respective dirty and devilish aims and intentions through in their own ways? Shouldn’t the BNP refrain and be prevented from becoming an Awami BNP (ABNP)? Or, Basically No Party (BNP)? Or, ⁠Basically Nasty Party (BNP)? Or, Basically Nuisance Party (BNP)?Or, Bangladesh Beiman Party (BNP)? To rephrase, summarize and versify the above: কে আছ জোয়ান হও আগুয়ান ধর জিয়া-খালেদা বিএনপির হাল । লন্ডন-ঢাকা বিএনপি যে হয়ে গেল হাসিনা আর তার বাল। জেনেভা বিমান বন্দরে ড আসিফ নজরুলের উপর আওয়ামি হামলা-হেনস্তার ঘটনায় লক্ষ কোটি বারের মতো আবারো প্রমানিত হল টুংগি হাসিনা বাল কি মাল। আর বিএনপি নির্লজ্জ বেহায়ার মত তাদের সাথে আবার সতীনের ঘর করার আগ্রহ প্রকাশ করছে। However, BNP may like to take a look at the reading of the pulse of the people of Bangladesh, which is as follows: — 1. No Hasina, No Parliament, No Chuppu. The lame and loose and lax and tailored and retailored constitution is to be thrown out. 2. The Interim Government should adopt more revolutionary character with Dr Yunus assuming the Presidency with all executive powers. 3. General Wakeruzzanan, a great hero, should remove all elements suspected of being pro-Hasina BAL from the army and take his patriotic forces above all bad rumours of a coup attempt or counterrevolution, if any. 4. The BAL and all their activities need to be banned with all urgency.5. BNP under the current Dhaka-London leadership with their compromising Awami and Indian dalali remains incompetent, hypocritical, deceiving and untrustworthy. There should be a revolt against this leadership from within the party and a new patriotic and nationalist BNP should emerge.6. TR needs to be challenged as a hypocritical, cowardly and compromising pro-Indian and pro-BAL agent playing a conman drifting away from the ideals of the great and glorious President Zia and Prime Minister Begum Zia. He and the rest of the top BNP leaders should be politically castrated and castigated. He should be vilified as a parricide, patricide and matricide. 7. People don’t want any Awami BAL BNP. They don’t want any treacherous Bangladesh Beiman Party (BNP) in alliance with the RAW India BAL and the secularist leftists, all against Islam and Muslims. Any RAW India BAL-BNP cohabitation as two co-wives of India must be prevented.8. The new revolutionary interim government (RIG) should stay in power for at least 5 years to complete all the necessary reforms inclined and oriented towards the religious faith of the vast majority. No election in 5 years! 9. A due national recognition of President Ziaur Rahman, 15 August heroes, President Khandoker Mushtaq Ahmed, 7 November and 5 August heroes is needed. 10. The name of Sheikh Mujib (who was a national villain, national traitor, national betrayer) should be dropped from the list of true national heroes consisting of H S Suhrawardy, Sher-e-Bangla, Moulana Bhasani, Gen MAG Osmani and Gen Ziaur Rahman. 11. A new Chatro Janata party should be formed under whatever name. 12. An alliance of that new party + the new BNP+Jamaat + GOP both groups + Chor Monai Islami Andolon + Hefazat+Islami Oikkyojote+LDP+AB Party = Allahu Akbar Bangladesh ZindabadIf the TR-Fakhrul BNP soaked and submerged in RAW India is about to forget all the tons and trucks of torture they suffered in the hands of Hasina (looks like they suffered intentionally as part of a prearranged scam or scheme) and is now willing to compromise and work together with Hasina BAL who are more directly and deeply RAW India, who is more নির্লজ্জ বিশ্ববেহায়া—Ershad-GM Qader or TR-Fakhrul BNP? If that is true, let’s say (out of frustration though) that JP deserves to survive and this TR-Fakhrul BNP deserves to be dissipated, dissolved and extinct, while a truly patriotic and nationalist new BNP should arise in the footsteps of Zia and Khaleda. 1.

Asteroid Grains Shed Light On The Outer Solar System’s Origins	Tiny grains from a distant asteroid are revealing clues to the magnetic forces that shaped the far reaches of the solar system over 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists at MIT and elsewhere have analyzed particles of the asteroid Ryugu, which were collected by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission and brought back to Earth in 2020. Scientists believe Ryugu formed on the outskirts of the early solar system before migrating in toward the asteroid belt, eventually settling into an orbit between Earth and Mars. The team analyzed Ryugu’s particles for signs of any ancient magnetic field that might have been present when the asteroid first took shape. Their results suggest that if there was a magnetic field, it would have been very weak. At most, such a field would have been about 15 microtesla. (The Earth’s own magnetic field today is around 50 microtesla.) Even so, the scientists estimate that such a low-grade field intensity would have been enough to pull together primordial gas and dust to form the outer solar system’s asteroids and potentially play a role in giant planet formation, from Jupiter to Neptune. The team’s results, which are published in the journal AGU Advances, show for the first time that the distal solar system likely harbored a weak magnetic field. Scientists have known that a magnetic field shaped the inner solar system, where Earth and the terrestrial planets were formed. But it was unclear whether such a magnetic influence extended into more remote regions, until now. 'We’re showing that, everywhere we look now, there was some sort of magnetic field that was responsible for bringing mass to where the sun and planets were forming,' says study author Benjamin Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. 'That now applies to the outer solar system planets.' The study’s lead author is Elias Mansbach PhD ’24, who is now a postdoc at Cambridge University. MIT co-authors include Eduardo Lima, Saverio Cambioni, and Jodie Ream, along with Michael Sowell and Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech, Roger Fu of Harvard University, Xue-Ning Bai of Tsinghua University, Chisato Anai and Atsuko Kobayashi of the Kochi Advanced Marine Core Research Institute, and Hironori Hidaka of Tokyo Institute of Technology. A far-off field Around 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust, which collapsed into a swirling disk of matter. Most of this material gravitated toward the center of the disk to form the sun. The remaining bits formed a solar nebula of swirling, ionized gas. Scientists suspect that interactions between the newly formed sun and the ionized disk generated a magnetic field that threaded through the nebula, helping to drive accretion and pull matter inward to form the planets, asteroids, and moons. 'This nebular field disappeared around 3 to 4 million years after the solar system’s formation, and we are fascinated with how it played a role in early planetary formation,' Mansbach says. Scientists previously determined that a magnetic field was present throughout the inner solar system — a region that spanned from the sun to about 7 astronomical units (AU), out to where Jupiter is today. (One AU is the distance between the sun and the Earth.) The intensity of this inner nebular field was somewhere between 50 to 200 microtesla, and it likely influenced the formation of the inner terrestrial planets. Such estimates of the early magnetic field are based on meteorites that landed on Earth and are thought to have originated in the inner nebula. 'But how far this magnetic field extended, and what role it played in more distal regions, is still uncertain because there haven’t been many samples that could tell us about the outer solar system,' Mansbach says. Rewinding the tape The team got an opportunity to analyze samples from the outer solar system with Ryugu, an asteroid that is thought to have formed in the early outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, and was eventually brought into orbit near the Earth. In December 2020, JAXA’s Hayabusa 2 mission returned samples of the asteroid to Earth, giving scientists a first look at a potential relic of the early distal solar system. The researchers acquired several grains of the returned samples, each about a millimeter in size. They placed the particles in a magnetometer — an instrument in Weiss’ lab that measures the strength and direction of a sample’s magnetization. They then applied an alternating magnetic field to progressively demagnetize each sample. 'Like a tape recorder, we are slowly rewinding the sample’s magnetic record,' Mansbach explains. 'We then look for consistent trends that tell us if it formed in a magnetic field.' They determined that the samples held no clear sign of a preserved magnetic field. This suggests that either there was no nebular field present in the outer solar system where the asteroid first formed, or the field was so weak that it was not recorded in the asteroid’s grains. If the latter is the case, the team estimates such a weak field would have been no more than 15 microtesla in intensity. The researchers also reexamined data from previously studied meteorites. They specifically looked at 'ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites' — meteorites that have properties that are characteristic of having formed in the distal solar system. Scientists had estimated the samples were not old enough to have formed before the solar nebula disappeared. Any magnetic field record the samples contain, then, would not reflect the nebular field. But Mansbach and his colleagues decided to take a closer look. 'We reanalyzed the ages of these samples and found they are closer to the start of the solar system than previously thought,' Mansbach says. 'We think these samples formed in this distal, outer region. And one of these samples does actually have a positive field detection of about 5 microtesla, which is consistent with an upper limit of 15 microtesla.' This updated sample, combined with the new Ryugu particles, suggest that the outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, hosted a very weak magnetic field, that was nevertheless strong enough to pull matter in from the outskirts to eventually form the outer planetary bodies, from Jupiter to Neptune. 'When you’re further from the sun, a weak magnetic field goes a long way,' Weiss notes. 'It was predicted that it doesn’t need to be that strong out there, and that’s what we’re seeing.' The team plans to look for more evidence of distal nebular fields with samples from another far-off asteroid, Bennu, which were delivered to Earth in September 2023 by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. 'Bennu looks a lot like Ryugu, and we’re eagerly awaiting first results from those samples,' Mansbach says. This research was supported, in part, by NASA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTa6G2VThv7xZ	2024-11-09T16:34:08-08:00	
New Option For Treating Prostate Cancer	Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Despite medical advances in recent years, this type of tumour is still responsible for one in eight male cancer deaths in Austria alone. An international research team led by MedUni Vienna has now investigated a new strategy for the development of treatment options that not only slow tumour growth, but also stimulate the immune system to combat tumour cells. The results of the study have just been published in the top journal Molecular Cancer. The scientific team focused its investigations on the GP130 signalling pathway, which researchers expect to have a major potential in the fight against cancer. The background: the signalling pathway, which is mediated by the protein GP130, plays a central role in cell communication and influences the activity of the transcription factor STAT3, which in turn is associated with the development and spread of tumours. Accordingly, blocking the GP130 signalling pathway is currently seen as a great hope in cancer medicine. Yet the current study proves the opposite: tumour growth can be slowed down not by inhibiting but by activating the GP130 signalling pathway in prostate cells. New hope, especially for aggressive tumours To achieve these new findings, the researchers investigated genetically modified mice in which GP130 was specifically activated in the prostate. 'This allowed us to directly observe the reduction in tumour growth in the cell,' reports Lukas Kenner (Clinical Department of Pathology, MedUni Vienna), who led the study together with Stefan Rose-John (Biochemical Institute, University of Kiel). The results were further backed up by analyses of tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. This showed that high GP130 values correlate with a better survival rate. At the same time, extensive molecular analyses were carried out, including gene expression profiling. 'Our research provides exciting new evidence that the activation of GP130 in prostate cells not only slows tumour growth, but also stimulates the immune system to actively fight the cancer cells,' says Lukas Kenner, summarising the significance of the results, which will now be confirmed in further studies. The research work opens up a promising new therapeutic option, particularly for aggressive prostate cancer, which is still difficult to treat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTVsnRWG5shN0	2024-11-09T16:29:30-08:00	
Up To 30% Of The Power Used To Train AI Is Wasted: Here’s How To ...	A less wasteful way to train large language models, such as the GPT series, finishes in the same amount of time for up to 30% less energy, according to a new study from the University of Michigan. The approach could save enough energy to power 1.1 million U.S. homes in 2026, based on Wells Fargo's projections of AI power demand. It could also take a bite out of the International Monetary Fund's prediction that data centers could account for 1.2% of the world's carbon emissions by 2027—and the water demands that come with that energy use. Some experts say that these costs could be outweighed by environmental benefits. They argue that AI could be a 'game changer' for fighting climate change by identifying ways to optimize supply chains and the grid, manage our energy needs, and improve research on climate change. Still, that doesn't excuse squandering energy, and some of the power used to train AI has zero impact on training time and model accuracy. 'Why spend something when there's no point?' said Mosharaf Chowdhury, U-M associate professor of computer science and engineering and the corresponding author of the study presented at the 30th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. 'We can't keep building bigger and bigger data centers because we won't have the power to run them. If we can reduce the energy consumed by AI, we can reduce AI's carbon footprint and cooling requirements and allow for more computation to fit within our current energy constraints.' The energy waste is created when AI training is unequally divided between GPUs, which are computer processors specialized for large data and graphics applications. Although it opens the door for waste, splitting the work is necessary for processing huge datasets. 'AI models today are so large, they cannot fit inside a single computer processor,' said Jae-Won Chung, U-M doctoral student in computer science and engineering and the first author of the study. 'They need to be divided into tens of thousands of processors to be trained, but dividing the models in perfectly equal sizes across all processors is practically impossible.' The training jobs are so difficult to evenly split up because some tasks need to be grouped together on the same processor—like how each installment of a book series will be grouped together in an organized shelf. Depending on how the tasks are grouped, some processors might get stuck with the AI-training equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica while others get assigned a fantasy trilogy. Because current training methods run each processor at top speed, processors with a lighter load will finish their calculations before other processors. This doesn't speed up training, which isn't complete until every processor finishes its job—but it is wasteful because faster calculations require more energy. In addition, problems such as faulty hardware or network delays create energy waste by slowing down a single processor's computing speed. To save energy, the researchers developed a software tool, called Perseus, that identifies a critical path, or a series of subtasks that will take the longest time to complete. Then, Perseus slows down processors that aren't on the critical path so that they all finish their jobs around the same time—eliminating unnecessary power use. 'Reducing the power cost of AI can have important implications for equitable AI access,' Chowdhury said. 'If a country doesn't have enough power to run a big model, they might need to use services from far away, or be stuck running smaller, less accurate models. This gap could further perpetuate disparity between different communities.' The team tested Perseus by training GPT-3, three other large language models and one computer vision model. Perseus is an open-sourced tool available as part of Zeus, a tool for measuring and optimizing AI energy consumption.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXg-Bx2GVang	2024-11-09T16:26:03-08:00	
Free Trade Agreements Key To Asia’s Prosperity – Analysis	By Mohd Faiz Abdullah Asia’s ascent as the centre of global economic activity has been nothing short of profound. Even in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by cycles of financial and health crises, Asia has withstood the test of time, emerging as the fastest growing continent. Asia’s economic rise has been inextricably linked to the forces of globalisation, particularly through the proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs). These agreements have facilitated Asia’s integration into the global economy and shaped its regional dynamics, making Asia one of the most interconnected and economically vibrant regions in the world. From the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Asia’s FTA network has been a cornerstone of its development and a key contributing factor in maintaining ASEAN centrality. FTAs have been instrumental in driving Asia’s economic growth and prosperity by opening new markets, reducing trade barriers, fostering investment and innovation and, in some instances, accelerating domestic reforms. Countries like Japan, South Korea and China — all of whom are already in some form of free trade arrangement with ASEAN Member States — have leveraged these FTAs to expand their exports, fuelling growth and development. The export-oriented strategies of these nations, supported by FTAs, have lifted millions out of poverty and transformed the region into a global economic powerhouse. The ASEAN region’s economy grew by 5.7 per cent in 2022, maintaining an average annual growth rate of 4.4 per cent between 2010 and 2022. ASEAN’s nominal GDP per capita stood at US$5,395 in 2022, a notable increase of 37.6 per cent from 2015. With such strong economic fundamentals, the region has also become a focal point for global supply chains, with Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia emerging as key manufacturing hubs. The ASEAN Economic Community has promoted the free flow of goods, services and capital, enhancing the competitiveness of its member states. In addition, the ASEAN Agreement on Movement of Natural Persons has also facilitated the mobility of talentwithin the region. RCEP underscores Asia’s central role in global trade. By harmonising trade rules and reducing tariffs across 15 countries, RCEP has solidified Asia’s position as a critical node in the global economic network. The CPTPP, despite the withdrawal of the United States, remains a significant agreement that binds its members to high standards of trade and investment rules, further integrating Asian economies with the rest of the world. These FTAs are both economic tools and strategic instruments that reinforce ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture. Despite the benefits brought by FTAs, Asia now faces significant challenges as globalisation encounters harsh headwinds. The rise of protectionism, trade wars and the potential decoupling of major economies like the United States and China pose a threat to the very foundation of Asia’s economic success. Any move towards decoupling could have profound implications on Asian economies, particularly for countries heavily reliant on trade with China. If global powers attempt to isolate or decouple from China, the ripple effects would cascade across the region and disrupt supply chains in industries ranging from electronics in South Korea to automotive parts in Thailand. Such disruptions would cause economic losses and destabilise the political and security environment in Asia, where economic interdependence has been a key factor in maintaining peace and stability. Confronting these challenges head-on, ASEAN centrality has become the linchpin upholding and promoting globalisation, particularly through FTAs. ASEAN has been the bedrock of regional economic integration, acting as a platform for dialogue and cooperation among its member states and external partners. Through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community, FTAs with Dialogue Partners and RCEP, ASEAN has strategically positioned itself at the heart of Asia’s economic architecture. Still, for the region to continue to benefit from free trade, ASEAN must address persistent weaknesses in the ASEAN Economic Community, such as non-tariff barriers and varying regulatory standards. ASEAN’s commitment to the rules-based trading system, plurilateralism and inclusive growth is a powerful counterbalance to the growing trends of protectionism and unilateralism. By championing FTAs and regional integration, ASEAN can help mitigate the risks associated with decoupling and ensure that Asia continues to reap the benefits of globalisation. ASEAN’s approach to consensus-building and respect for sovereignty serves as a model for other regions facing similar challenges. Through its active participation in FTAs, Asia has secured a strategic edge in globalisation, with its economic prosperity and political stability thriving on open markets and interconnected economies. But with the rise of protectionism and the growing potential for decoupling, Asia stands at a crossroads. ASEAN centrality, supported by robust FTAs, is essential to safeguard Asia’s interests in this shifting global landscape. By continuing to promote regional integration and engage in strategic dialogues, ASEAN can ensure that Asia remains at the forefront of the global economy, navigating the challenges ahead with resilience and foresight.

Cuba’s Real Power Problem Is Socialism – OpEd	Millions of Cubans remain without power in the wake of Hurricane Oscar, but bad weather is not Cuba’s real problem. Its centrally planned socialist economy is the root cause of the blackout and most of its other problems. Cuba’s nationwide blackout began a few days before Oscar made landfall when the Antonio Guiteras power plant went offline. Seven of Cuba’s eight thermoelectric plants were offline for maintenance or otherwise not operational. The failure of the Guiteras plant left the country without a major power producer. Oscar made things worse for Cubans on the island’s east end and will likely delay power returning to that region. However, other areas unaffected by the storm faced blackouts. The Cuba Electrical Union announced that 216,000 people in Havana, a city of more than 2 million, had their power restored Sunday, October 20th, only to have that grid collapse later in the day for the fourth time since blackouts began. Hospitals, hotels, and other businesses have limited power from generators, but fuel is in short supply and will not keep the generators running much longer. Venezuela has provided subsidized fuel to Cuba for two decades, but its own economic crisis has limited how much it can help Cuba in recent years. Meanwhile, fuel from the United States remains unavailable due to the embargo. But the root causes of Cuba’s lack of energy are homegrown. Without private property, socialist economic systems cannot provide the information and incentives necessary to create prosperity. Prices convey information about what goods and services are most scarce in market economies. However, prices in socialist economies don’t convey that same information because they are dictated by central plans or distorted by artificial scarcities due to the planners’ import controls. When I was researching a recent book in Cuba, I thought that Cuba should have a game show called 'The Price Is Wrong.' The lack of property rights also means that the managers of the factors of production, such as power plants, don’t have the same incentive to maintain them as entrepreneurs in market economies do because state managers are not entitled to the profits generated by long-term maintenance. Under socialism, entrepreneurs have no incentive, or even the right, to outcompete inefficient state firms to better serve consumers. Socialist systems stagnate and fail to create prosperity because of their inherent nature. Plenty of fuel could be imported from countries other than the United States and Venezuela, but the Cuban economy doesn’t generate enough wealth to afford it. North Korea is the only country in the world that is more completely centrally planned than Cuba, and it is perpetually without power. Satellite images reveal that the entire country, except the capital, is without power at night, and only about half the population has electricity for more than four hours a day. Power is far from the only thing in short supply in socialist countries. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, beef and pork production is collapsing in Cuba. Starvation has been a recurring problem in North Korea ever since Soviet aid ended in 1991. North Koreans are not free to flee their economic woes, but Cubans are. As a result, more than 1 million Cubans, 10 percent of the population, emigrated in 2022 and 2023. Cubans took to the streets demanding greater freedom three years ago in protests sparked in partby power outages and food shortages. Despite President Miguel Diaz-Canel’s announcement that he will not tolerate protests, pro-freedom protests are exactly what Cuba needs again today. Until it scraps its centrally planned system and grants Cubans a large measure of economic freedom, Cuba’s economic and power problems will continue.

Congress Should Fire Jerome Powell – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken There were a few seemingly tense moments at the FOMC press conference on Thursday when two reporters asked Jerome Powell about the prospect of Donald Trump asking Powell to resign. The first reporter asked 'would you resign if asked to do so by Donald Trump?' To this, Powell responded with a resounding 'no' followed by silence. A few moments later, Powell was asked by another reporter if it was lawful for Trump to either remove or 'demote'—that is, remove Powell as chairman, but leave him on the Board of Governors—Powell. To this, Powell responded with a forceful 'not permitted under the law.' Apparently, Powell wished to leave no ambiguity whatsoever about this position that he cannot be removed or demoted by a sitting president. It would agree that the spirit of the law here is that a president not be able to remove a Fed chairman, except for some kind of misconduct. But, ambiguity remains. Even Alan Blinder, a proponent of the myth of 'Fed independence,' admits that in the world of political reality, Trump could potentially remove Powell: Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court. 'Trump could try and he might try,' Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. 'It’s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don’t know what to think of the Supreme Court.' Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed’s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said. 'That’s a subtle question that has never been tested,' Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. 'We can’t answer that quite as definitively.' In any case, Trump would likely have to expend some serious political capital if he wants to remove Powell via presidential power. Yet, Powell’s defiance ought to provoke us to ask why wealthy, pampered, out-of-touch technocrats like Jerome Powell get to act like their removal constitutes some sort of transgression. Central bankers are just bureaucrats, and their removal ought to be regarded with no more trepidation than the removal of an undersecretary of agriculture. Congress Should Fire Powell, and Not Stop There Regardless of what Trump’s legal powers may be, it is clear that Congress has the power to remove Powell, just as Congress has the power to abolish the central bank altogether. The Congress ought to abolish the Fed entirely, of course, but if members lack the stomach for that heroic act, Congress can begin with amending the Federal Reserve Act to make it clear that the chairman of the Fed is not a Holy Person, untouchable by the mere mortals who are actually elected to run the federal government. There are many ways Congress could approach this issue. For example, Congress could rewrite the law to allow Congress to remove the Fed chairman with a majority vote in either house. It doesn’t really matter, so long as central bankers get the message that they’re not special. While Congress is at is, it could make a few other crucial changes as well. Congress should prohibit the Fed from buying any assets of any kind. This would end the Fed’s habit of buying up mortgage-backed securities and government securities to prop up the banker class and Powell’s buddies—i.e., Janet Yellen—at the Treasury. It would also end the Fed’s ability to manipulate interest rates since the Fed’s main tool here is its 'open market operations.' A second key change that is very necessary is removing the Fed’s so called 'dual mandate.' As the Fed likes to often mention, the Fed has a dual mandate of both 'stable prices' and 'maximum employment.' Congress should immediately abolish the mandate for 'maximum employment' because the only purpose this has ever served has been as an excuse for the central bank to inflate the money supply. As is abundantly clear from Fed press conferences and publications, the Fed routinely justifies its dovish policy in terms of fulfilling its mandate to maximize inflation. That is, the Fed often says something to the effect of 'we’re embracing easy-money policy because our dual mandate to maximize employment says we have to.' Congress should just delete the mandate. (By the way, the Fed actually has a third mandate. It’s to ensure 'moderate long-term interest rates.' Getting rid of the Fed’s power to purchase assets probably nullifies this mandate in any case, but Congress might as well remove any doubt and totally prohibit the Fed from manipulating interest rates of any kind.) Fed Independence Has Never Been Used for Good Things Of course, if Congress were to attempt any of this, Fed simps in the media and in Congress will try to talk about how such things are unprecedented and we must respect 'Fed independence.' Media stories in the Fed often claim that attempts by elected officials to rein in Fed technocrats violate 'long-standing norms' that respect Fed independence. This is a fantasy version of history. There is not now, and there has never been, any such thing as Fed independence because the Fed always willingly helps the regime get what it wants. Early on, Fed independence didn’t even exist in theory, and was explicitly limited in law. Prior to 1935, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the Treasury sat on the Fed’s Board, thus ensuring a direct line from the White House to the Fed. In 1933, of course, Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order abolishing the gold standard and ordering the Fed to turn over all its gold to the Treasury. So much for 'Fed independence' under the Left’s favorite twentieth-century president. Even after 1935, it was understood that the Fed would always assist the Treasury with funding whenever necessary. This again became obvious during the Second World War when the Fed essentially helped launder funds for the war effort. The Fed agreed in 1942 to peg interest rates on government securities. The Fed also engaged in a variety of price control measures and regulations designed to assist the White House. Only since the Monetary Accord of 1951 has there been a de jure nod to giving the Fed autonomy on policy. The Fed has never used any of this alleged autonomy to do anything good, however. We’ve seen this proven countless times since the Fed has always gladly done its part to ensure the Treasury gets what it wants. From the Fed’s efforts to finance federal deficits in the 1970s, to the Plaza Accord in 1985, and to the flood of easy money since 2008, the Fed has never used its so-called independence to actually rein in federal profligacy. What Matters to the Fed Is Protecting the Banking Class Central bankers have never cared about Fed independence as a way of limiting state power. According to its own historical narrative, the Fed has now allegedly been 'autonomous' for sixty years or more. Has inflation and federal spending been more restrained during that time? Obviously not. The Fed has always and everywhere been happy to enrich the state, regardless of whatever levels of self-governance it might achieve. The real reason the Fed wants more independence is so the Fed can also more easily enrich the banker class while also making the Treasury happy. That is, the banking cartel that works hand in glove with the Fed cares deeply about having control over who gets onto the Board of Governors and who gets to be chairman. The elite bankers are perfectly willing to effectively serve the Treasury so long as the cartel gets to have its own people in charge. This is how the banker class ensures that its monopolistic powers are protected, the competition is crushed, and the bailouts are guaranteed. If the Fed pushes back against the elected government, it’s only if the priorities of the elected government conflict with the Fed’s priority, which is serving the interests of the banker class. Experience makes it abundantly clear that central bankers are fine with endless price inflation. But, the Fed wants to inflate in a way that most suits the Fed and the banking cartel. That’s why Powell and the Fed are so opposed to the idea of being removed from office. There is no higher principle here. There is only power.

Australia’s Covid Inquiry Report Is Not Fit For Purpose – OpEd	On 24 October, Jay Bhattacharya, once derided by Anthony ‘Mr Science’ Fauci as a fringe epidemiologist, was awarded the Zimmer Medal for Intellectual Freedom by the American Academy of Sciences and Letters. The medal ‘is presented annually to a public thinker who displays extraordinary courage in the exercise of intellectual freedom.’ The 2023 winner was Salman Rushdie. Jay’s citation recognises his ‘courage and firm commitment to intellectual freedom’ who ‘resolutely refused…to compromise his scientific findings’ and took ‘a stand for the public’s right to unrestricted scientific discussion and debate.’ His writings and speeches are powerful examples of passion, courage, and clarity of expression that reflects clear thinking. He toured Australia in 2022 and I had the honour to share a packed town hall meeting with him in Melbourne on 22 September. Sadly but not surprisingly, his tour was mostly ignored by Australia’s mainstream media. On 29 October, the official panel inquiring into Australia’s Covid-19 response submitted its 868-page report. I regret to say the report is not fit for purpose. Bottom line: This is a report of, by, and for the public health clerisy. The prolix report is packed with turgid prose and bureaucratic analysis and recommendations. The Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, co-authored by Bhattacharya, still offers better big-picture value in both language and content. The 513-word one page GBD might even profit PM Anthony Albanese to read, since during last year’s doomed campaign for the Voice referendum he let it be known that his attention span does not extend beyond the first page of a report and he sees no reason for it to do so. At the granular level, the report has some positive features but these are outweighed by flaws of commission and omission, much like the response to the pandemic itself. Granted, the inquiry was hobbled by very tightly circumscribed terms of reference in yet another broken election promise that is itself destroying public trust in politicians and political institutions. Still, the panelists could have said no to the call to serve. The report opens with virtue-signalling genuflections to political correctness. There is the ritualistic acknowledgment of ‘Traditional Owners and Custodians of Country throughout Australia on whose lands we all work, play and live,’ ‘their continuous connection to lands, waters, skies, culture and community’ and the ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s significant contribution to society.’ The panelists pay ‘respects to their Elders past and present.’ The relevance of this to an inquiry report on Australia’s Covid response is difficult to discern. If this is a signal that henceforth, every official report is going to begin with these mantras then we can expect a significant and rapid rise of mainstream antagonism and resentment towards Aboriginal people. Next, there is an acknowledgment of ‘lived experience:’ ‘We acknowledge that Covid-19 touched every person, every organisation and each sector,’ albeit ‘in different ways.’ Well, yes, that’s why the inquiry was set up, to determine the details and identify the impacts. To coin a phrase, this is a statement of the bleeding obvious. This is topped off with a content warning: ‘This report contains material that may be distressing for some readers,’ complete with advice on who to contact for help. This was an inquiry into the Covid years that wrecked our lives, economy, and society for three years and counting. What did the panellists think readers would expect: lyrics to the latest kumbaya hymn? Instead of such mindless infantilisation, how about this: ‘We acknowledge the great loss of life, liberty, and happiness caused by Covid-19 and the response to it. We strongly recommend a Royal Commission of Inquiry to establish the division of causal responsibility between the disease and government policies, so that the perpetrators of mass public harms may be held accountable.’ Positives of Report Are Outweighed by Flaws The report confirms that lockdowns, state border closures, school shutdowns, and vaccine mandates broke public trust in governments and science. They drove lower Covid vaccine takeup in the last two years and promoted cross-vaccine hesitancy. Inconsistent advice, recommendations, and enforcement practices across the states, compounded by the refusal to release health advice and its science and evidence base further eroded public trust. The strong emphasis on human rights and the wider economic, social, and mental health consequences of the pandemic policies is also welcome. So too discussion of the long-term damage to children’s learning, development, and emotional health. All this is good, but neither particularly new nor insightful. Several critics warned about precisely these downstream consequences from day one. The report ignores how Australia’s Covid response marked a radical departure from the prevailing consensus on science and policy as synthesised in the WHO September 2019 report. Nor is there any clarity on why Australia’s own existing pandemic preparedness plans were ditched. Critical flaws of commissions begin with paeans to leaders’ courageous decision-making in conditions of mass fear and extreme uncertainty. The fear and hysteria did not match the data yet the government and media fed it. Experts who called for calm and responses that were proportionate to risks were ignored, censored, and vilified. Early data, including from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020 confirmed that the risk from Covid was highly age-correlated and concentrated in the elderly. There was no reason to strip peoples and businesses of their liberties and freedoms, to put healthy populations under wholesale house arrest, treating them as germ-ridden criminals even if proven innocent. Far from courageous, the leaders were cowardly and hypocritical, or else just too credulous of what their expert advisers told them. They had no skin in the game, suffered no financial penalty while decimating small businesses, paid no political penalty, got sugar highs on power tripping, hid behind health officials, and typically exempted themselves from inconvenient restrictions they foisted on all others. Australians were prevented from returning home, diluting the quality of citizenship, and also from leaving the country. But the prime minister was able to fly to the UK to attend the G7 summit (where he reversed Australian policy to commit Australia to Net Zero as the price of a guest seat at the exclusive high table), one state premier flew to Tokyo to lobby for hosting the Olympics, and one state chief health officer flew interstate to Canberra to attend an awards ceremony that recognised his stellar contribution to managing the pandemic. Australia became fixated on the single, dubious metric of case numbers, exaggerating the Covid risks, downplaying the harms of interventions, heightening the fear, stripping people of rights and liberties, censoring dissent, and cancelling critics. Hard to believe, dozens of Victorian firefighters who were dismissed for being unvaccinated are still banned from work despite staff shortages as the fire season is about to start. We threw extravagant and wasteful amounts of money at the problem. We sacrificed children’s futures for modest extensions to old people’s lives. Professor Margie Danchin, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, says bluntly that ‘We punished kids to protect the adults.’ Has any society ever done this before? The assumption of world-leading performance by Australia is rooted in simplistic and inappropriate European and North American benchmarks against which to assess our outcomes. Our Southern Hemisphere location, island identity, plentiful sunshine and open spaces, love of outdoors activities, relative paucity of high-density housing etc. conferred immense advantages in coming through the pandemic with much better outcomes than Europe and America. The most visible embodiments of courage through the pandemic public policy insanity were Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Sweden’s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. Florida and Sweden resisted the lockdown groupthink, are in the mid-range of Covid metrics, avoided most of the health, economic, educational, and social damage in European countries and US states with authoritarian approaches, including loss of public trust, and came out better on the balance of benefits versus harms. The panelists betray astonishing, one-dimensional ignorance in their references to Sweden, as though we are still stuck in 2020 instead of having moved on to near the end of 2024. The only mentions of Sweden are by way of its significantly worse comparison in the first year of the pandemic. ‘Australia would have had between 15 and 46 times the number of deaths if it had experienced the same Covid-related death rates as comparable countries like Canada and Sweden’ as well as France, the UK, and the US. The most striking variations in Covid mortality rates were by season (the Northern Hemisphere was much harder hit initially because of winter, giving a major seasonal buffer to countries in the Southern Hemisphere), geographical features like island identity and distance from Covid hotspots, and region. Tegnell insisted that lockdowns lacked any ‘historical scientific basis.’ In July 2020, he rejected short-term performance measures and said judge me in a year. Sweden’s initial bad outcomes reflected the equivalent of the ‘dry tinder’ effect with low flu mortality in 2019, the mid-term school holiday calendar that saw many Swedes vacationing on Italian slopes at a particularly unfortunate time for the spread of the infection, and badly mishandled elderly patients in care homes. The better point of comparison for light-touch Sweden is the heavy-handed UK, whose Covid outcomes were worse. Omissions Mean the Report Is Not Fit for Purpose This section explores three important examples of where the inquiry fell short. In the first two on social distancing and facemasks, the non-pharmaceutical interventions departed radically from existing understandings with no scientific basis or evidence in justification. In the third on vaccination, the response departed alarmingly from all established protocols governing the approval and authorisation of vaccines after duly completed trials to determine their efficacy and safety, not just in an immediate timeframe but over the long haul. To circumvent the full trials requirement, emergency use authorisation was necessary. This could not be done if existing treatment was available. When physicians who claimed high success in clinical treatment of Covid patients with repurposed ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were ordered by regulators to cease and desist, suspicions were fuelled about industry capture of the regulators. There is also a plausible argument that the legal framework governing the approval process in Australia should have been that for genetically modified organisms. This wasn’t done. Social Distancing ‘Social distancing,’ the requirement that everyone must maintain the minimum specified distance from physical contact with any other human being, was a profoundly anti-social rule that severely disrupted social and economic functioning around the world for more than three years. On 31 May, the US Congress published the transcript of two days of testimony in January from Dr Anthony Fauci, the face of America’s Covid response. On the second day of the closed-door testimony on 10 January, Committee Staff Director Mitch Benzine asked about the origins of the six-foot social distancing rule applied at businesses, schools, and all public settings. Fauci frankly admitted: ‘You know, I don’t recall. It sort of just appeared.’ Pressed on relevant ‘studies that supported six feet,’ he said ‘I was not aware of studies that – in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do’ (pp. 183–84). As early as 25 April 2020, Professor Robert Dingwall, a scientific adviser to the UK government as a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), said there has ‘never been a scientific basis for two metres,’ it was ‘conjured up out of nowhere,’ and it should more accurately be called a ‘rule of thumb.’ He also warned that the social distancing measures would cause ‘serious damage to society, to the economy and to the physical and mental health of the population.’ Was he right, or was he right? A group of Oxford University scientists explained in June 2020 that the science behind the social distancing rule was complex while the rule was starkly binary. It assumed that the sole or primary transmission route was through physical contact or large droplets. This also explained the early phobia about the constant use of hand sanitisers and disinfection of all potential contact surfaces like chairs and tables in restaurants and benches in parks. But the really small viruses can also be aerosolised and spread through the air. Our chief health officers and ‘experts’ thus need to be interrogated on whether the adoption of the two-metre rule for Australia was an example of copycat idiocy or the persistence of culture cringe: where the Brits and Americans lead, we unquestioningly follow. Facemasks At the Congressional hearing on 10 January, Benzine also asked if a cost-benefit analysis had ever been done ‘on the unintended consequences of masking kids versus the protection that it would give them.’ ‘Not to my knowledge,’ Fauci conceded (p. 135). Until 2020, ‘settled science’ was clear. Masks are ineffective. They stop neither infection nor transmission. The UK Influenza Preparedness Strategy 2011, reaffirmedon 27 February 2020, encapsulated the prevailing consensus (paragraph 4.15): Although there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks by the public in the community and household setting may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in this setting. Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good respiratory, hand, and home hygiene behaviour in order for them to achieve the intended benefit. Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods reduces over time. This conclusion was reaffirmed in the WHO report published in September 2019 that summarised the best available studies to date, noting that ‘there is very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in community and household settings. It was repeated by top WHO doctors Mike Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove on 31 March 2020: ‘There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly.’ The benefits-harms equation for masks doesn’t compute, especially for children. They are dehumanising and a potent force for stoking mass fear. Facial expressions are crucial in social interactions, including for babies. And also for the elderly and people suffering from dementia in care homes. Consider this poignant testimony to Scotland’s Covid inquiry hearings from Alison Walker, a former BBC sports presenter, on 17 November 2023. Having witnessed the trauma of her 89- and 90-year old parents residing in care homes in 2020, she asked (around the 36-minute mark): ‘If you are surrounded by a group of people 24/7 wearing masks, and you don’t see people smile for up to two years, what kind of effect is that going to have on your mental health and wellbeing?’ Care homes abandoned their duty of ‘care and compassion,’ she believed, and instead ‘operated under a veil of fear’ (at 1:24:46). This was reinforced by the closing statement from the Care Home Relatives Scotland (paragraph 20): ‘The evidence demonstrated that the use of masks caused distress, confusion and considerable difficulties with communication. Residents couldn’t see smiles, had difficulty recognising relatives and those with hearing difficulties couldn’t lip-read or read facial expressions or visual clues.’ Masks also do cause some harms as side effects in some people. Compulsory masking for everyone in all settings is a gross violation of fundamental human rights. It can be justified only if the evidence for their efficacy in community protection is compelling and the risk of harms is negligible. Instead mask mandates were heavy on fear-mongering and virtue-signalling but light on data and science, overturning, in a couple of months, cumulative scientific consensus built over decades. The report mentions masks several times, but only in the context of the inconsistent application of mandates. It doesn’t address the lack of high-quality studies and data that would contradict the pre-2020 consensus on their lack of efficacy in community settings, as confirmed in the Cochrane Review. It fails to tell us why Australia’s health authorities flipped on the old understandings. Vaccines Part of the explanation for the tone-deafness towards the still smouldering white-hot rage in the community is the failure to address the fiasco of the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. From the start of vaccine rollout in February 2021 to 70 percent full vaccination on 21 November 2021, Australia’s total number of deaths was 1,187 (2,110-923) (Table 1). From initial rollout until 80 percent full vaccination on 20 March 2022, it was 5,599 (6,482-923). Since achieving those landmarks, which for practical purposes amount to full adult vaccination, the numbers of Covid-related deaths are 23,126 and 18,754, respectively. There are two ways to put these figures in perspective. More than 25 times as many people have died with Covid-19 since 70 percent full vaccination compared to the total number before vaccination; and more than 20 times since 80 percent full vaccination than before vaccination. Source for Table 1 and Figures 1–3: Our World in Data (accessed 31 October 2024) That is, 91.6 and 74.3 percent of Australia’s Covid-related deaths occurred after 70 and 80 percent full vaccination, respectively. This contrasts with just 3.7 percent before the vaccines began to be rolled out. I really do hate to think what the statistics would be if vaccines were ineffective. And this is even without taking into consideration vaccine injuries or age-disaggregated Covid risks of hospitalisation and death for unvaccinated vs vaccinated and boosted healthy children, adolescents, and adults until age 60. On 23 October, the BBC said that AstraZeneca vaccines had saved 6.3 million livesand Pfizer another 5.9 million, just in the first year from December 2020 to December 2021, including 120,000 British lives saved until September 2021. Looking at Figures 1–2, one can see why they would make such a claim. Yet as per Popperian falsifiability, just the one contrary example of Australia is sufficient to falsify the hypothesis of the Covid vaccines having saved millions of lives. As can be seen in Figure 1, among the four countries plus the EU, Australia’s vaccine rollout was the last to begin yet the most rapid and successful of all five in covering the population. Figure 2 shows that Australia’s Covid mortality rate was above one death per million people almost continually for 17 months from 9 January 2022 to 23 June 2023, except for a brief period of three weeks in March–April 2023. If we look at Figures 2 and 3 against the vaccination coverage in the five jurisdictions, two things become clear. For the four entities in the Northern Hemisphere, the heaviest Covid mortality toll both in terms of the daily count (Figure 2) and cumulatively (Figure 3) was in the first twelve months of the pandemic and the toll fell dramatically coinciding with the vaccine rollouts. For example, contrasting sharply with Australian data where the pre-vaccine deaths with Covid were under four percent of the total until October 2024, for the UK this was almost forty percent. Confusing correlation with causation, authorities, and vaccine-faithful advocates continue to attribute the fall to vaccines. Yet, in the case of Australia, the relationship is reversed. Its Covid-related mortality rates and cumulative toll were exceptionally light in the first twelve months beforethe vaccine campaign was launched. For vaccine-sceptics, it’s tempting to attribute this to vaccines causing the explosion in deaths. Yet such a conclusion is contradicted by the experience north of the equator. Equally, however, the Australian (and New Zealand) experience refutes the hypothesis that vaccines saved millions of lives. Instead, to my mind, taken together the divergent experiences powerfully indicate two alternative conclusions. Firstly, as was the case with lockdown restrictions and mask mandates, the rise and fall of the various coronavirus waves were policy-invariant, following a trajectory to some inner virus logic that was stubbornly indifferent to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Second, population-level immunity acquired naturally through infection likely played a more critical role in getting to herd immunity than vaccines. This occurred much earlier in the UK, Europe, and America. Hard border closures in Australia (and New Zealand) kept the virus at bay until such time as borders were reopened in the wake of rapid and high vaccine uptakes. This finally seeded the virus in the population and infection, hospitalisation, and death rates rose sharply, herd immunity was achieved, and the virus receded. If this is so, then of course the benefit-harms equation for vaccines changes quite dramatically also. To my absolute astonishment, the three words ‘cost-benefit analysis’ cannot be found even once in the more than 353,000 words of the report. The failure – nay, the cussed refusal – to engage in such analysis and publish the results, for an experimental product that may very well be contaminating our DNA (see Rebekah Barnett’s comprehensive refutation of the charge that this is misinformation), offers yet another bit of evidence that regulators have become vaccine enablers first, more committed to defending vaccines from criticism than protect people from harmful vaccines. Conclusion On the one hand, the report confirms how the policies implemented by political leaders acting under the guidance of public health officers and experts caused substantial health, mental health, economic, educational, and social damage that triggered a significant fall in trust in government and science. On the other hand, the major solution to this problem recommended by the report is to increase the authority and resources of the same two groups (politicians and the public health bureaucrats) to control our behaviour in future health emergencies. The contradiction has been picked up by pretty much every commentator. Did none of the panelists notice the incoherence between analysis and recommendations? The report vastly underrates public anger and cynicism. People were locked up at home on dubious data and science, forced to isolate from parents and grandchildren, unable to visit grandparents in their final days or attend family reunions, weddings, funerals, and birthdays, coerced into taking the shot in order to shop, travel, and keep jobs on false assurances of safety and effectiveness. Some of the worst offenders, responsible for the most egregious policies and thuggish enforcement measures, have been awarded the highest gongs going, promoted into governors’ mansions, and even promised a statue in their honour. The report’s solution to the overreach and abuse of power by authorities during Covid is to create even more bureaucratic structures with more powers and resources, including an Australian Centre for Disease Control even as the US CDC sinks into ever greater disrepute by the month. Governments grabbed too much power, coming uncomfortably close to becoming police states. Who but the same experts would staff the Australian CDC? This could potentially include one of the panellists, Catherine Bennett, who is professor of epidemiology at Deakin University. In an interview with SBS TV on 7 July 2022, she said, ‘We have to ensure people have all their recommended boosters because the booster…reduces the risk of serious illness quite dramatically.’ She also recommended ‘people wear face masks and maintain social distancing.’ It’s certainly not unknown for a government report to turn out to be a successful job application for one of the authors. It would incense many if those guilty of the biggest assault on Australians’ health, political, and economic freedoms in the nation’s history were to be rewarded with increased powers and resources to serially indulge their inner bullies. Dealing with the past is a prerequisite for imposing justified punishment for crimes against the people, enabling closure for the many physical injuries and emotional trauma of the totalitarian responses, and deterring future wrongdoers. This report doesn’t take us far on the path we must but are yet to travel.

Don’t Urge Hotels To Censor, Even In The Name Of Opposing Genocid...	Medea Benjamin has done much good in educating people about violent aspects of United States foreign policy and why such should be opposed. But, via a brief video Benjamin posted Thursday at Twitter, in which she calls on people to urge Hilton to cancel an upcoming event at one of its hotels, she is promoting a curtailment of speech that endangers her cause and individual rights more broadly. Hotels have managed to remain a refuge for free speech as a censorship trend has proceeded among major American companies. This refuge is very valuable for people opposing the expansion of government power at the expense of individual rights. And part of defending this refuge is accepting that hotels will host on occasion events you abhor or see as harmful. In Benjamin’s case such an event is a conference to be held on November 14-17 by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) at a Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas. 'Say no to the JNF; say no to genocide and ecocide,' concludes Benjamin in her video. The course Benjamin is pursuing in regard to this conference is detrimental for liberty in America and ultimately for her cause. As we have seen, it is the forces for expanded government power, including in the area of foreign policy, that have been able to direct the extensive censorship pursued by other sorts of companies. If liberty defenders and peace advocates do not stand up unequivocally for free speech, they are sure to lose. They may be able to shut down a 'bad' event here and there at the beginning. But, ultimately, expect the advocates of expansive government power, including the warmongers, to be the ones directing who hotels censor. By all means, educate people about events you oppose. But, beware of taking the censorship approach. That approach plays into the hands of the opponents of liberty and peace.

Days Of DEI In The Pentagon Should Be Numbered – OpEd	By Dave Patterson Governments, like people, all too often adopt beliefs that are not true. As the opening quotation from the movie The Big Short asserted: 'It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.' And when those who believe for sure what 'just ain’t so' include the Pentagon leadership, then America is in trouble. The promise of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) falls squarely in the 'just ain’t so' category, as corporations are finding out. Will the Pentagon be the last to get it? DEI Is a Failure When Performance Is Demanded Many have seen all too well the performance of federal agencies that emphasize DEI over the quality of personnel. The Pentagon has favored DEI theories over merit for nearly four years, and there has been little to impede this trend – until now. President-elect Donald Trump will no doubt apply the brakes to DEI as he did in his first administration. 'To further advance equity within the Federal Government, this order establishes that it is the policy of my Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation,' were the words codified in an executive order signed by President Joe Biden during his first year in office. Since then, the divisive nature of the DEI ideology has had a chilling effect on recruiting and retention. What the Pentagon should find particularly worrying is a recent report in The Wall Street Journal: 'The focus on DEI is driving an especially profound disillusionment among conservative veterans, the military’s longstanding support bedrock. Between 2019 and 2024, the percentage of conservative veterans who would advise a young family member to join the military declined from 88% to 53%. That almost entirely explains the shift in the broader veteran population. Far more conservative veterans cited the ‘military’s DEI and other social policies’ as a ‘major factor’ (85%) in withholding their endorsement.' This is especially troublesome since 80% of volunteers for military service have family members who were in the military. It’s more than likely that the US government’s DEI programs will be short-lived under a Trump presidency. The real question is, why were they installed in the first place? Evidence is building that whatever motives existed for embracing the DEI craze are rapidly disappearing. Many corporations that adopted the flawed notion are backing away. Aerospace and defense giant Boeing is the most recent to ditch DEI. 'Boeing reportedly dismantled its global diversity, equity, and inclusion department as part of an overhaul of its operations ordered by the company’s new top executive — becoming the latest major company to ditch the controversial initiative,' according to The New York Post. Dissolving DEI comes on the heels of billionaire Elon Musk criticizing Boeing for 'prioritizing DEI over safety and quality controls.' Boeing is not the only company that is repudiating DEI. 'First Tractor Supply and John Deere; then Harley-Davidson and Brown-Foreman Corp., then Ford and Molson Coors' are among Fortune 500 companies dropping DEI as corporate objectives, HR Drive reported. You would think that US government agencies would view this trend as a cautionary tale prompting a review of DEI initiatives. One might expect Pentagon leadership to understand that if DEI has failed in business, it is not worth pursuing as a mission goal for the nation’s defense. The US Military Cannot Fail to Keep Americans Safe While Americans depend on the US Armed Forces to keep them safe, the Pentagon is mired in the diversity, equity, and inclusion ethos, prioritizing the tenet that DEI delivers a military that mirrors society. At some level, it does that. But it is pure mythology that such a military service would be preferable to a fighting force focused on relevant accomplishments and skills. The Pentagon should observe the trend of corporations moving away from DEI and follow suit before it is ordered to by its new commander-in-chief. As the saying goes, 'A new broom sweeps clean.' DEI will be something in the dustbin, unencumbered by the past. About the author: National Security Correspondent at LibertyNation.Com.

Ralph Nader: Electing An American Fuhrer As Wall Street Cheers An...	On September 17, 1787, the last day after the drafting of our Constitution in Philadelphia, Ben Franklin was leaving the building when a prominent resident, Elizabeth Willing Powel, asked him 'Well Doctor, what have we got – a republic or a monarch?' Franklin replied, 'A republic, if you can keep it.' On November 5, 2024, our fragile Republic became a Monarchy-elect. A majority of voters elected a Dictator. This is no exaggeration. Look at just some of the damage Trump has done and the appalling things he has said. In July 2019, he declared 'With Article II, I can do whatever I want as president.' And he did, throughout his four years, he violated all kinds of federal laws and provisions of the Constitution, mostly openly, with impunity. He obstructed justice from the White House as a way of life. He defied over 125 Congressional subpoenas. He is a very successful fugitive from justice with lawyers skilled at endlessly delaying judges and courts where federal and state prosecutors have obtained indictments. His convictions and adverse civil verdicts are like water on a duck’s back. He openly admires foreign dictators and meets with them proudly, musing about wanting to be more like them. Moreover, he is gathering around him a large number of vengeful, dictatorial Trumpsters readying to take over the federal departments and agencies. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, 900-page report prepared a detailed blueprint for the corporate state that is the definition of fascism, American style. Together with Trump, they have their 'enemies list' both individually and collectively. In speech after speech, Trump, Vance, and others have spoken as if they will have boundless power after January 20, 2025. They are not wrong. They control the compliant Republican House and the Senate. The U.S. Supreme Court (6 to 3) decided fanatically last June that a president’s 'official' conduct no matter how extreme was immune from criminal prosecution. Three of the Justices were Trump’s nominees. He believes his presidency will be above the law. There is no one to challenge him. Ordinary citizens have no 'legal standing' to sue. And as is the practice, he will replace all the federal prosecutors working at the Department of Justice, under the new Attorney General whom he chooses. Trump may be on facts and policies, 'dumb as a rock,' 'with a low IQ!' – to use his words about other persons, but when it comes to knowing the electorate and the mass media, he is a master magician who induces mass masochism. As with violent climate disruptions are 'a hoax, drill baby drill.' He weaves a web of fantasy about his past failed business and presidential records and constantly repeats his megalomaniac refrain: 'Only I can fix it.' His daily lies often come across to his supporters as a form of entertainment garnished with massaging their own grievances and biases into political campaign fodder. He tells those who think they are victims, that he is their savior. He promises a paradise in America in his next presidential term but doesn’t have a clue about how to get there. As far as the media, his denunciations of them, 'fake news,' and the 'failing New York Times,' only result in journalists giving him constant top-level coverage, even repeating in CAPITAL LETTERS his pejorative nicknames for people who are not given a chance to reply in the press. True, the major newspapers have exposed his numerous dark sides – whether personal against women, commercial against workers, students and creditors, against the government with his tax evasions, or as past president, with his brazen violations of law and overt unethical self-enrichment. Mark Green and I contributed two books– 'Fake President: Decoding Trump’s Gaslighting, Corruption, and General Bullsh*t' in 2019 and 'Wrecking America: How Trump’s Lawbreaking and Lies Betray All' in 2020 – about dangerous, corrupt Donald. However, in the end, nothing stuck or mattered. Do-little Donald’s fulminating lies were embraced by his followers. His slippery Teflon persona was underestimated. Voter acceptance of the Trumpian mirage reflects poorly on the majority of the voters who cast their ballots for him. Trump did have some crucial luck. A weak, arrogant Democratic Party leadership, loaded with inhibitory corporate campaign money, constrained by corporate conflicted political/media consultants, who control the Party’s campaigns and bar input from the experienced citizen community (see, winningamerica.net) made it impossible for the Democratic Party to learn from its past mistakes or its recurring disastrous strategies. Trump played the Democratic Party, from its bungling nomination process to the anemic Harris campaign like a fiddle – repeatedly, personally, and without a teleprompter, he fed his crowd blatant falsehoods, hateful rhetoric, and delusionary promises. And he gave the middle finger to the 'deep state.' People must realize they are, with all voters, in a two-party duopoly Trap, excluding full access to third-party and independent candidates. No Western country erects, as the U.S.A. does, such barriers to ballot access and many other exclusions and endless harassment. (See Theresa Amato’s book, 'Grand Illusion: The Myth of Voter Choice in a Two-Party Tyranny'). A competitive democracy we are not. Still, at the presidential level, alternative candidates are often on the ballot if not in the news or in the debates. But most voters want 'to be with a winner,' and glumly or willingly accept their electoral incarceration. Get ready this January for chaos, revenge, greed, rampant abuses of power, and the unbridled control of corrupt plutocrats and oligarchs. With Elon Musk in the lead. Fascistic states flow into exercises of terror. The majority of the voters have elected an American Fuhrer. Trump will be our founding father’s greatest nightmare. They inserted numerous protections in our Constitution to block another King George III tyrant with their separation of powers and checks and balances. Come 2025 these protections will be shredded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawD9fCSZuBI_-	2024-11-08T17:42:43-08:00	
Climate Objectives Of COP29 May Be Unmet – Analysis	By Yi Wang The 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) will be held from November 11 to 22, 2024, in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Over 100 heads of state and government are expected to attend the conference. The primary goal of COP29 is for wealthy countries to support poorer nations in their efforts to combat climate change. To this end, participants are seeking to establish a climate action fund aimed at raising trillions of dollars, with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies. However, many leaders from the world's major economies will be absent from this important event. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.S. President Joe Biden, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba have all canceled their plans to attend. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have also stated they will not participate. Neither Mexico nor China has been included in the agenda for leaders' speeches at the UN climate summit. Whether due to domestic political developments or personal reasons, their absence signals that COP29 negotiations are unlikely to yield a new climate action agreement, making it difficult to secure additional financial resources. This hesitation among developed countries in fulfilling their climate commitments suggests uncertainty about the outcomes of the conference. Western countries, particularly in Europe and the U.S., have notably downplayed the issue of moving away from fossil fuels.' For them, the more pressing concerns are energy security, price stability, and inflation reduction. Following the U.S. presidential election, after the victory of Donald Trump, it is expected that oil and gas production will increase to lower electricity costs. South Korean officials are considering increasing imports of U.S. oil and natural gas. Changes in Germany's coalition government also highlight the challenges of balancing economic transformation with key measures for emissions reduction, pointing to significant political divisions in decision-making. Global investors are increasingly dissatisfied with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulatory requirements and, in the pursuit of higher returns, are willing to abandon their green commitments. British oil giant BP has announced plans to abandon its restrictions on fossil fuel production, with its new strategy focusing on investing in oil and gas in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. Shell had earlier indicated it might slow down its emissions reduction efforts, and its latest energy transition strategy has lowered its targets. Moving away from fossil fuels is proving to be a hard task. Amid various disruptions and obstacles, momentum seems to be waning. Hence, the expectations for climate financing at COP29 are likely to fall short this year. 1. Localized military conflicts and their increased intensity are generating the most carbon emissions. Parties have failed to reach agreements on ceasefires, and negotiations on military withdrawals are unlikely to form any substantial agreements. Military activities are consuming vast amounts of resources, placing a greater burden of responsibility for global climate change and damage. In developed Western countries, military spending continues to rise, while domestic economic growth slows, making it difficult to quickly deliver on climate financing commitments. 2. Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, armed conflicts in the Red Sea, and other tense situations, flights have been rerouted, and commercial ships have altered their paths, further complicating efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Many air routes have been forced to change, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions on both land and sea. Emissions reductions in aviation have a long way to go, especially in terms of reducing the use of traditional aviation fuel. Transportation costs have already risen sharply in many countries, and prioritizing survival has become more important than other concerns. The loss of enthusiasm for climate action may be unavoidable. 3. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence applications has led to a rapid expansion in electricity demand. The production of chips, the construction of cloud data centers, and cryptocurrency mining all consume vast amounts of electricity. In the short term, addressing power shortages is more urgent than the source to generate electricity, and most countries are unable to complete a full transition to clean energy in time. This year is expected to be the hottest one on record, with an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, torrential rainfall, and typhoons, alongside the proliferation of infectious diseases and declines in agricultural yields. These trends are largely driven by climate change and its far-reaching effects. As the full scope of these risks becomes increasingly apparent, it is of utmost importance to critically assess the intricate interplay between economic and social development and climate change. This is not a concern limited to a select few or political leaders. Rather, the climate agenda is inextricably linked to the collective well-being, resilience, and long-term sustainability of societies and individuals across the globe.

Germany: Chancellor Signals Openness To Deal On Earlier Snap Elec...	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suggested he would be open to negotiations on an earlier election date in exchange for opposition backing on key legislation, which could trigger snap elections sooner than planned. This marks a notable shift from Scholz’s previous announcement that he would call a vote of confidence on 15 January to hold elections 'by the end of March' after his coalition government broke down on Wednesday (6 November). Scholz said on Friday (8 November) that the 'democratic' parties in parliament would have to come to an agreement on which laws could be passed by the end of the year. 'That understanding could also answer which point in time is the right one to hold the vote of confidence in the Bundestag, also with regard to a possible date for snap elections,' Scholz told journalists at an informal EU summit in Budapest on Friday. He said the discussion on the election date would have to proceed 'with calm.' Prior to this, Scholz had resisted demands to hold an immediate vote of confidence at a meeting on Thursday with Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU leader and frontrunner in the election, according to Merz. Scholz cannot be constitutionally forced to hold a vote of confidence and subsequent elections before the slated election date on 28 September 2025. However, his minority government is dependent on opposition votes to pass any remaining legislation. Scholz refused to detail whether there were specific laws that he would insist on in order to agree to earlier elections. But shortly after Scholz's statement, it emerged that Germany's Federal Returning Office had warned the chancellor against holding elections too early. Ruth Brand, the agency's leader, said that setting 'dates and deadlines' during the Christmas season or New Year's Eve would make important election preparations 'virtually impossible to realise.' A snap election must be called within 60 days after the dissolution of the parliament, which has to follow within 21 days of a vote of confidence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawJSc96iO33yr	2024-11-08T17:33:07-08:00	
NATO-Type Southeast Asian Defense Alliance Not Feasible At Presen...	By Jason Gutierrez A Southeast Asian defense alliance modeled after NATO and aimed at countering China may not be set up any time soon because the region’s nations would want to maintain good relations with the superpower, regional security analysts said. The creation of more minilateral agreements, though, rather than multilateral ones like the 32-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are not only likely but may be more effective, they added. A minilateral agreement is an accord between a small group of nations that have come together to achieve mutual goals or tackle shared problems, according to international relations experts. For instance, a good example is a minilateral agreement renewed last year by the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia for joint patrols on their seas, said geopolitics expert Don McLain Gill. 'The most we can expect [in the form of a defense alliance] for now is an area- specific and time-dependent security cooperation between particular states in the region in a way that would also reflect individual varying sensitivities,' he told BenarNews. Another lecturer from the university concurred. 'I think that [creating] minilaterals is more plausible,' political science lecturer Sherwin Ona told BenarNews. 'I also think that armed enforcement has its limitations and has a tendency for escalation.' Established in 1949, NATO commits its 32-member countries to each other's defense in the event any are attacked. Aside from the United States, other NATO members include the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Canada Conversation about a regional NATO, Asian or Southeast Asian, revived after now-Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba wrote a paper late September for think-tank Hudson Institute about his proposal for such a defense alliance. '[T]he absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense,' Ichiba wrote late September. 'Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' added the then-candidate for prime minister added. The proposal was rejected by the United States and India said it doesn’t share Ishiba’s vision. Similar ideas have irritated Beijing, which sees itself as the main focusof these proposals, in the same way that Moscow has accused NATO of concentrating its defense efforts against Russia. In Southeast Asia specifically as well, the idea of a NATO-like grouping has been talked about in response to some countries claiming harassment by Beijing’s vessels in the South China Sea, where they have overlapping claims. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea, but its claims overlap those of Taiwan, which isn’t a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which are. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. trod carefully when asked on Tuesday about a grouping similar to NATO consisting of the 10 members of ASEAN. 'I don't think it is possible at this time because of the dichotomies and divergence between country interests,' Teodoro answered at the venue of a private conference in Manila. Still, he acknowledged the need to boost multilateral security alliances. Teodoro noted that Manila has a bilateral defense alliance with Washington since 1951, even before it became one of the Southeast Asian countries to set up the ASEAN in 1967. Sherwin Ona, a political science lecturer at Manila’s De La Salle University, told BenarNews that ASEAN nations would stick to the bloc’s 'non-interference policy.' Besides, some Southeast Asian countries are very pro-Beijing because their economies are heavily dependent on China, indicated Ona. 'I agree [with Teodoro] about the beneficial relationship between countries that are pro-Beijing.' Another reason Southeast Asian countries may be cool to the idea of an 'Asian NATO' is because they have different security interests, noted a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation. 'This is because most countries are convinced that a multilateral security architecture will only elevate regional insecurities, and make them subservient to great power contestations,' Abhishek Sharma wrote on Deccan Herald. 'Loose, flexible' minilaterals Minilaterals are 'loose and flexible,' believes Gill. 'This is not NATO’s established collective security structure,' he said. Minilaterals are 'only as good as they last.' Gill explained that if one country in a three-nation minilateral agreement felt it did not any longer share the same interest with the other two, 'it can walk out anytime.' Geopolitical analyst Julio Amador III believes a network of 'minilateral ties' might be able to offset this shortcoming and would be more effective. Additionally, he said there was a way ASEAN as a bloc could become 'a formidable diplomatic counterweight.' If the group’s members, particularly those that drift towards China, agree that there are some issues 'that go beyond national interests, that there are issues that do matter to the collective interests of the group,' ASEAN could be powerful, Amador said. However, De La Salle University’s Gill said that the character of Southeast Asian cooperation tended to be based mostly on mutual interest. 'An ASEAN version of NATO is unlikely going to happen given the nature of ASEAN,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawMi6QlmHplcK	2024-11-08T17:31:14-08:00	
Trump’s Win Could Lead To Push For Peace In Ukraine, But On Whose...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- The common view is that an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine is nowhere in sight. But Donald Trump’s election could generate a push to reach a peace deal -- with Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and others wrangling over the potential terms. Trump’s victory in the November 5 presidential vote set the clock ticking, in a way, because he repeatedly said during the campaign that he would be able to end the war very quickly if elected, without even waiting for his inauguration on January 20. Russian President Vladimir Putin seized on this in his first public remarks about the U.S. election result, saying on November 7 that what he called Trump’s statements about a desire to 'revive relations' with Russia and help end the war in Ukraine 'deserve attention, to say the least.' That comment came amid high praise from Putin for Trump: He said that the now president-elect had shown 'courage' and 'acted like a man' when a would-be assassin shot at him in July, and that his impression was that during his 2017-2021 term, Trump was straitjacketed and prevented from pursuing his goals. Putin’s words were delivered in a way that was clearly meant to seem casual and off-the-cuff. But they suggest that the Kremlin will try to leverage the change of power in the United States, and Trump’s hopes of brokering peace, in a bid to further its own goals in Ukraine. Big Challenges However, there’s no sign that Moscow has abandoned its stated goals, which include Russian control over five Ukrainian regions in their entirety and a permanent ban on Ukraine joining NATO. The morning after Putin made his remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov seemed eager to drive that message home. He said Putin has repeatedly mentioned that Russia is open for dialogue but that the president 'has never said that the goals [of the invasion] have changed.' With its forces advancing in eastern Ukraine at a faster pace than they have since a few months after the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Moscow does not seem to be in the mood for compromise. Putin’s Security Council chief, Sergei Shoigu, also suggested that Moscow is open to talks, but only on its own terms. 'Now, when the situation in the theater of military operations is not in favor of the Kyiv regime, the West is faced with a choice -- to continue financing it and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognize the current realities and start negotiating,' Shoigu said on November 7. That’s one of the big challenges facing any bid by Trump to end the war: A cease-fire or peace on terms that satisfy Moscow would likely be seen as a defeat for Kyiv and could leave Russia in a position to threaten Ukraine and even the West. That would be hard for the White House to cast as a geopolitical victory. With Trump’s inauguration 10 weeks away, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is trying to prevent that from happening. He is urging the West to deliver more weapons, to help Ukraine improve its position on the battlefield and pave the way for a 'just peace,' warning that giving Russia what it wants would be a grave mistake. 'There has been much talk about the need to yield to Putin, to back down, to make some concessions. It's unacceptable for Ukraine and suicidal for all Europe,' Zelenskiy said in a speech at a European Political Community meeting in Budapest on November 7. Rifts In The West Divisions in the West threaten to play into Russia’s hands. Speaking in Budapest on November 8, European Council President Charles Michel echoed Zelenskiy, saying, 'We have to strengthen Ukraine, to support Ukraine, because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin, but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world.' But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an ally of Trump who is also close to Putin, voiced something close to the opposite position. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a [Ukrainian] military defeat,' Orban said. 'The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' But whether that will happen is not yet clear, despite Trump’s repeated statements that the war must end, and his criticism of the tens of billions of dollars in military and other support the United States has provided Ukraine under President Joe Biden. Beyond indications that he would use the volume of aid to Ukraine as leverage in getting Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table, Trump has said little about how he would go about trying to stop the fighting, so the approach he chooses remains a crucial variable as his new term approaches. Trump’s advisers have presented ideas, some of them publicly. But in a November 6 report that cited unnamed allies of Trump, The Wall Street Journal reported that he 'hasn’t approved a specific peace plan' or settled on a way to get Putin and Zelenskiy 'to sit at the same table and negotiate.'

France To ‘Expand And Diversify’ Naval Presence In Asia-Pacific	France is preparing for the deployment of its flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the next four weeks, the French navy has announced, amid reports it may head to Asia-Pacific waters. The navy said in a press release that the crew of the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle carried out a three-week training session on Oct. 4-25 in the Mediterranean in order to regain operational capability after a recent technical shutdown that lasted nearly four months. The crew has now embarked on a final four-week logistical and operational preparation at the quayside before the next deployment of the Charles de Gaulle in a 'constituted carrier battle group,' the navy said in the release without specifying where the carrier strike group would be heading to. Before this announcement, however, the Naval News quoted a senior French officer as saying that the months-long deployment would take place in the eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and 'possibly the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean.' The carrier strike group could make first, 'historic' calls to Japan and the Philippines, the Paris-based publication said. Apart from the Charles de Gaulle, the strike group may include several other warships, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, a logistics support ship and some support and assistance vessels. The air wing is set to include two E-2C Hawkeye AEW aircraft, 24 Rafale Marine jets and four helicopters. About 3,000 sailors and naval aviators would take part in several exercises during the deployment, among which a multinational exercise would 'focus on the theme of maritime security in the Indonesian straits,' Naval News said. China’s reaction 'This deployment is significant because it marks a major expansion of France’s presence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Benjamin Blandin, a network coordinator at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies. 'Since the announcement of France’s Indo-Pacific Strategy in 2019, the French military’s presence in the region has really grown and diversified,' Blandin told Radio Free Asia. Last week, Taiwan’s ministry of defense said that a French naval vessel sailed through the Taiwan Strait from the south to the north. Notably, the Prairial (F731) – a Floreal-class frigate – was sailing on the west side of the median line closer to China, unlike U.S. and Canadian ships, which normally pass east of the median line closer to Taiwan. Beijing did not immediately protest against the transit but on Nov. 4, the Communist Party-sanctioned Global Times published an article denouncing the possible deployment of the Charles de Gaulle carrier strike group in the Indo-Pacific. The Chinese news outlet quoted analysts as saying that the deployment 'is an attempt to pander to NATO’s expansion into the Asia-Pacific, which is detrimental to regional peace and stability.' Zhang Junshe, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times that despite being the only country outside the U.S. that possesses a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, France’s strength in this area was limited. Zhang warned that 'neither the countries nor the people of the Asia-Pacific region want external forces to build up their military presence in the region to sow discord and intensify regional tensions.' French comeback Paris has a long history of involvement in the region and after a period of relative inactivity, it seems it is making a strategic comeback. France has several arms deals in the Asia-Pacific, with Indonesia, Singapore and most recently, a US$438-million aid project to provide 40 patrol vessels and logistical support to the Philippine Coast Guard. 'The Philippines can be seen as one of the new cornerstones of France’s strategic presence in the region,' said Blandin. France and the Philippines agreed to enhance cooperation in December 2023 and a French defense attaché office was established in the Philippines in May this year. Frigate Vendémiaire participated in the Balikatan exercise in April and the destroyer Bretagne made a port call in Manila from May 31 to June 4. The frigate Prairial that recently transited the Taiwan Strait also conducted a goodwill visit to Cebu between Oct. 22-25. 'The French military is in the process of negotiating a visiting forces agreement with the Philippines, which is expected to conclude in the first semester of 2025,' said Blandin. 'Paris wants to put its name back on the map.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawOlP07Co6xSm	2024-11-08T17:24:54-08:00	
Despite The Bombast, Trump Never Turned His Back On Europe – Anal...	By Luke Coffey Donald Trump’s historic presidential victory has already sent ripples through Europe, as allies and partners wonder what it means for transatlantic relations. During his first term, Trump’s rhetoric often made European leaders uneasy, but beneath the bombast his administration arguably did more to bolster Europe’s security than any US president since Ronald Reagan. After a rocky start marked by his infamous press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, the Trump administration implemented policies that significantly strengthened NATO and US commitments in Europe. By the time Trump left there were more American troops stationed in Europe than when he took office. The US also increased military exercises and stationed forces further east, including Poland. Trump sharply criticized European defense spending and questioned America’s role in European security, but his actions told a different story: US defense spending for Europe, through the European Deterrence Initiative, was more than 40 percent greater than under the Obama administration. Trump’s record on Ukraine also deserves recognition. He was the first US president to provide advanced anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, when his predecessor offered only non-lethal aid. Trump also supplied air defense and anti-tank systems to Georgia within his first year in office, something the Obama administration had resisted for eight years. On broader geopolitical matters, the Trump administration was ahead of the curve. He was a vocal critic of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which deepened Europe’s energy dependence on Russia. While this stance strained relations with Germany, it was welcomed by many Central and Eastern European nations wary of Moscow’s influence. Trump also imposed economic sanctions on companies involved in the pipeline's construction — sanctions lifted by his successor. Additionally, Trump championed the Three Seas Initiative, led by Poland and Croatia, which aimed to enhance infrastructure, connectivity, and trade across Central and Eastern Europe. His administration also oversaw the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats in history, withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty over Russian violations, and welcomed North Macedonia and Montenegro into NATO, strengthening the alliance. The Europe Trump knew in his first term, however, has changed dramatically. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was a wake-up call for European defense. When Trump first took office in 2017, only a handful of NATO members met the alliance’s 2 percent of GDP defense spending target, with the European average at 1.46 percent. Collectively, NATO’s European members spent $254 billion annually on defense. Today, 23 of NATO’s 32 members meet the target and the European average has risen to 2 percent. Annual defense spending by NATO’s European members now totals $380 billion, a significant increase that will undoubtedly be welcomed by Trump. While Europeans need to do more in this area it is undeniable that this has been good news. The biggest question, however, is how Trump will handle Russia’s war in Ukraine. The invasion has reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the transatlantic alliance in ways not seen since the 1940s. While Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war quickly, he has yet to outline a concrete plan for doing so. His meeting in September with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered some insight. Trump emphasized the need for a 'fair' resolution to the conflict but stopped short of detailing how he would balance Ukrainian sovereignty with Russia’s demands. Given the high stakes, a kneejerk approach is unlikely. Instead, Trump will probably take time to craft a coherent policy on Ukraine, drawing on his administration’s past successes in Europe. For European leaders, the focus now is on how to work with Trump’s second administration. Fortunately, they do so from a stronger position. Europe’s increased defense spending and greater commitment to its own security will be welcomed in Washington. There's a far greater awareness in Europe today of the challenges and threats posed by China than there was during Trump’s first administration. Even with Ukraine, Europe has stepped up to the plate and spends as much as the US does. Some around Trump will argue that Europe is yesterday’s news, and there should be a renewed focus on Asia. The reality is different: Europe is too important for America’s economic well-being to ignore. Perhaps the future of the global economy is in Asia, but right now half of the world's GDP is shared between North America and Europe. Europe is responsible for two thirds of foreign investment into the US, and 48 of the 50 American states export more to Europe than they do to China. In the end, Trump’s return presents both risks and opportunities for European security. If he can navigate the complexities of the Ukraine war and broader transatlantic relations with the same strategic pragmatism his administration demonstrated the first time around, his second term could leave a lasting positive legacy. But if he gets Ukraine wrong and misjudges his engagement with Putin, this could have consequences not only for transatlantic security but for other regions too, such as east Asia and the Middle East. The future of transatlantic security depends not only on what Trump does next but also on how Europe rises to the occasion. History has shown that when America and Europe stand united, both sides benefit. The foundation for transatlantic cooperation remains solid. The challenge for Trump will be to build on this foundation while addressing the new realities posed by Russia’s aggression. Europe, for its part, must continue to step up, ensuring that its security framework is robust and meets the new geopolitical challenges. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

US Exposes Iranian-Directed Network Plotting Trump Assassination	By Jeff Seldin Iranian operatives sought to assassinate now President-elect Doanld Trump just weeks before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and were willing to forego other plots against regime critics and high-profile targets to see it through, court documents say. The revelations, in documents unsealed Friday against the suspects in an unrelated murder-for-hire plot, stem from a series of conversations between the alleged ringleader, 51-year-old Farhad Shakeri, and the FBI. The documents indicate that Shakeri, who said he was in Tehran at the time of the conversations, agreed to speak with the FBI to gain a reduced prison sentence for an unnamed prisoner in the U.S. Shakeri told the agents that an official with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached him in mid- to late September, asking him to set aside a plot to kill an Iranian dissident and journalist in New York, to instead go after Trump. Shakeri said he was asked to provide a plan within seven days and that when he said targeting Trump would be costly, the IRGC official told him, 'We have already spent a lot of money … money's not an issue.' He also told the FBI that if a plan could not be formulated within the seven-day timeframe, the IRGC official planned to wait until after the U.S. election, reasoning Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him. The court documents do not say whether Shakeri’s conversations with the FBI were authorized by the IRGC or other authorities in Iran. The Iranian mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The plot against Trump is just the latest in what U.S. officials have described as brazen attempts by Tehran to kill the former and future U.S. president in retaliation for a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force. In August, U.S. officials charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, who had traveled to the United States months earlier on behalf of Iran looking for hitmen to kill Trump and others. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Friday. 'We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,' he added. U.S. officials have been especially concerned about Iran's repeated use of criminal gangs and others to carry out its dirty work ((plotting)) on American soil. Court documents allege Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child, fits the description. The documents say Shakeri was deported from the U.S. in 2008, after spending 14 years in prison for robbery. But they add that during his time behind bars, Shakeri cultivated a network of criminal associates that he then would use in efforts to carry out Iran's orders. According to prosecutors, one of those associates was working with Shakeri up until the U.S. election to kill VOA Persian Service journalist Masih Alinejad, described in the court documents as 'an Iranian American journalist, author, and political activist, and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime's human rights abuses and corruption.' The associate, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera, then turned to one of his acquaintances, 36-year-old Jonathan Loadholt, to carry out the attack for a sum of $100,000. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested Thursday. Shakeri, Rivera and Loadholt are charged with murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering conspiracy. The charges carry maximum prison sentences of 10 to 20 years. Shakeri is also charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Alinejad on Friday expressed astonishment that she was wrapped up in the plot to kill the president-elect. 'I am shocked,' she wrote on the X social media platform. '[T]he person assigned to assassinate @realDonaldTrump was also assigned to kill me on U.S. soil.' 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don't want to die,' she said. 'Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me.' Last month, U.S. prosecutors charged a senior IRGC official in connection with a failed assassination attempt against Alinejad in 2022.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawH95PP9A0Duc	2024-11-08T17:19:52-08:00	
Riding The Trump Wave: India’s Gamble With A Tumultuous Ally – An...	The world has taken notice of Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election. The presidential elections in the United States have a significant impact on regional security, economic policy, and international diplomacy due to its status as a global superpower. India, one of the United States’ closest strategic allies, also eagerly anticipated this outcome, and many Indians see Trump's comeback as a chance for deeper bilateral relations and strategic advantages. But there are also serious potential drawbacks, which puts India in a difficult balancing position. Will India face unexpected difficulties under Trump's leadership, or could it be a game changer? In order to understand the implications of Donald Trump for India, it is essential to analyze his objectives for America and contextualize India, a significant player in US strategy, albeit not as crucial as some in India may assume, within that framework. The Unprecedented Comeback: Trump’s 2024 Win and Cleveland’s Legacy Reimagined Donald Trump’s extraordinary reascendancy to the U.S. presidency in 2024 draws historical comparisons to Grover Cleveland, the sole president prior to Trump to hold non-consecutive terms. Cleveland, who held office from 1885 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897, epitomized political resilience by losing his re-election campaign yet successfully reclaiming his position through a concerted and strategic resurgence. Similar to Cleveland, Trump utilized his time away from the White House to sustain public prominence, openly criticizing the policies of his successor and echoing voter dissatisfaction. Cleveland's relentless opposition to the elevated tariffs enacted by President Benjamin Harrison capitalized on economic discontent, which ultimately catalyzed his political resurgence. This strategy reflects Trump's 2024 campaign, in which he leveraged prevalent dissatisfaction arising from economic instability, including inflation and perceived policy shortcomings under President Joe Biden. Trump’s resurgence can be ascribed to a multitude of factors that parallel Cleveland's historical context while also being distinctly modern. His triumph was propelled by a confluence of anti-incumbency sentiment, substantial backing in rural America, strategic augmentation of his minority constituency, and his capacity to sustain credibility among voters as an unvarnished, genuine political figure. Cleveland opposed federal expenditure initiatives that he believed undermined American resilience, whereas Trump's policies focused on pledges of economic revitalization and national pride, appealing to a substantial segment of the electorate, particularly those who felt marginalized by the Democrats. Furthermore, Trump's coalition-building tactics resembled those of Cleveland's political operatives, who maintained his visibility despite challenges. Trump also gained from a demographic transformation, garnering heightened support from Latino and Black voters while solidifying allegiance among rural, working-class whites. Kamala Harris's campaign, by contrast, faced challenges in addressing economic criticisms and reconciling internal contradictions within the Democratic platform. Concerns regarding perceived hypocrisy in foreign policy positions and the inability to mobilize essential voter demographics, particularly women, further highlighted Trump's advantage. Trump's unrepentant demeanor, despite his controversial policies, starkly contrasted with the perceived inconsistency of the Democrats, facilitating a historic and uncommon political resurgence. Trump’s Transactional Blueprint for America's Objectives and Its Impact on U.S.-India Relations Donald Trump’s goals for America highlight a focus on transactions and trade, characterized by economic nationalism and protectionist policies. His focus encompasses the implementation of comprehensive tariffs aimed at addressing trade imbalances, emphasizing the importance of reciprocal agreements, and confronting adversaries such as China with substantial tariffs, potentially reaching 60% or higher. Trump appears to focus on immediate outcomes rather than fostering enduring partnerships or engaging in multilateral agreements, as evidenced by his previous actions and the strategy he may adopt in a potential second term (Sharma, 2024). In the context of India, it is probable that Trump's strategy would be characterized by a transactional nature. He would assess India's value through measurable advantages for the U.S., like job creation or heightened exports, instead of focusing on the overarching objective of countering China or fostering enduring strategic relationships. India's role as a significant ally in countering China is recognized; however, Trump's interactions with India are expected to prioritize trade balance and the protection of U.S. interests. During his previous term, he implemented tariffs on Indian goods and demonstrated hesitance to prioritize stronger relations without evident mutual advantages. Furthermore, the human rights issues raised by the Democrats may not be as significant during Trump's administration, which could reduce certain bilateral tensions while underscoring a 'quid pro quo' approach. It can be said that the policy of Trump 2.0 regarding India is expected to be characterized by a distinct approach focused on transactional relationships. The institutional strength of the India-US relationship guarantees its ongoing existence, yet the extent and character of its development will depend on Trump’s priorities. Should the relationship correspond with his ‘America First’ agenda and yield tangible advantages, it could experience instances of collaboration. Under Trump’s extractive framework, India is likely to encounter pressures such as tariffs and demands for reciprocal benefits. Strategic collaboration remains a possibility, particularly in countering China's influence. However, India needs to approach Trump’s demand-driven strategy with caution to sustain and strengthen the bilateral partnership while safeguarding its wider strategic and economic interests. Potential Benefits for India Despite the complexities, Trump’s presidency holds a promising horizon for India-U.S. relations, given the alignment on certain strategic priorities and Trump's public admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 1. Strengthening the Strategic Partnership Trump's presidency may signify a more robust U.S.-India strategic alliance, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. His administration is expected to strengthen India's position as a counterbalance to China. This alignment was evident during Trump's first term, characterized by the initiation of a strong Indo-Pacific strategy with India as a central ally. This strategy is crucial for India, which has been entangled in territorial and economic disputes with China, especially along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas. India's role in counterbalancing China's influence is anticipated to be pivotal to U.S. policy, likely enhancing collaboration within frameworks such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) with Japan and Australia. 2. Enhanced Defense and Security Ties During the Trump administration, defense cooperation may achieve new milestones. Trump's preference for high-value defense agreements may facilitate India's acquisition of advanced U.S. technologies, thereby aiding the modernization of its defense infrastructure. Joint military exercises may increase in scale and frequency, thereby improving India’s preparedness and promoting interoperability between Indian and U.S. forces. A renewed emphasis on defense partnerships may enhance India’s indigenous defense production capabilities via technology transfers and joint ventures, similar to agreements established during Trump’s prior term, including the sale of advanced helicopters and other defense equipment. 3. Revitalized Trade Relations Trump's transactional trade approach could be advantageous for India if bilateral trade negotiations are initiated between the two nations. India has encountered trade tensions with the U.S. regarding tariffs; however, Trump's emphasis on individual trade agreements may enable India to obtain more favorable conditions, particularly in the sectors of technology, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. This strategy may facilitate the expansion of markets for India's agricultural products, enhancing exports and supporting the Indian economy. The balance will be crucial, as the U.S. may pursue concessions in specific sectors. 4. Enhanced Energy and Technology Cooperation Trump's pro-energy policies are expected to enhance collaboration in the energy sector, allowing India to increase its LNG imports and thereby mitigate its energy deficit. The administration may promote investment in India's expanding technology sector, particularly in essential domains such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. These collaborations align with India's objectives of technological advancement and digital transformation. 5. Counterterrorism and Security Cooperation The Trump administration's strong position on counterterrorism may benefit India, which has faced challenges related to cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan. Trump's support could intensify pressure on Pakistan to confront terrorist organizations operating within its territory. Improved intelligence-sharing between the two nations may bolster India's capacity to address regional security challenges, particularly regarding threats from groups active in Kashmir. 6. Improved Diaspora Relations Trump's acknowledgment of the contributions made by the Indian-American community may enhance relations between the two countries. Relaxing H-1B visa restrictions could enable the entry of skilled Indian professionals into the U.S., thereby increasing remittances to India. Trump's favorable stance towards the Indian community has garnered significant support in India, and improved relations with the diaspora are expected to bolster India's soft power in the United States. 7. Support for Religious Minorities in South Asia In recent declarations, Trump has expressed his backing for Hindu minorities encountering difficulties in Bangladesh, a matter that has struck a chord with numerous individuals in India. Should his administration choose to extend support for the protection of religious minorities, it could effectively address the concerns of Hindus and other minority groups in the neighboring regions of India, thereby reflecting a cohesive commitment to the principle of religious freedom. Potential Challenges for India While the prospects appear promising, the reemergence of Trump may also introduce considerable obstacles. His frequently erratic and transactional approach to diplomacy, coupled with his 'America First' doctrine, may not consistently correspond with India's strategic objectives. 1. Paroxysm in Foreign Policy Trump's approach to foreign policy can be very transactional, frequently putting immediate financial gain ahead of long-term strategic partnerships. His snap decisions have left allies reeling, as evidenced by the sudden withdrawal from Afghanistan. Such uncertainty could make long-term strategic objectives, such as attempts to balance China and participate positively in the Quad, more difficult for India, which prioritizes stability in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. 2. Strained Trade Relations Trump's protectionist policies may result in trade friction. Critiques of trade imbalances with partners, such as India, may lead to heightened tariffs or more stringent regulations. Stricter trade policies may present significant risks to India's IT and pharmaceutical sectors, which depend heavily on U.S. markets, potentially restricting market access and impacting economic growth. 3. Restrictive Immigration Policies Trump has praised Indian contributions to the United States; however, his position on immigration, particularly regarding H-1B visas, poses a potential issue. The enforcement of stricter regulations on work visas may negatively impact the Indian workforce in the United States, influencing remittances and India's expanding influence via its diaspora. Policies designed to limit immigration may hinder opportunities for Indian professionals and students. 4. Reduced U.S. Engagement in South Asia A Trump administration prioritizing a reduction in U.S. engagement in global conflicts may create a power vacuum in South Asia, which could advantage entities opposed to Indian interests. This encompasses Pakistan, where diminished U.S. influence may encourage cross-border terrorism. India prioritizes regional stability, and a reduced U.S. presence may intensify security challenges in Afghanistan and surrounding areas. 5. Environmental and Climate Concerns Trump's prior withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and his pronounced focus on fossil fuels raise significant concerns for India, a nation susceptible to the effects of climate change. A diminished U.S. commitment to global climate initiatives may jeopardize collective efforts to address climate issues, thereby impacting India's ambitious goals for renewable energy and environmental sustainability. 6. Increased U.S.-China Tensions Trump's assertive approach toward China could heighten regional tensions, potentially compelling India to adopt a clear position. India's cautious approach towards China is influenced by the potential destabilization of the region due to an intensified U.S.-China rivalry, which could affect trade owing to India's economic and strategic interdependence with China. Conclusion India faces both opportunities and challenges as a result of Trump's potential comeback to the presidency. Even though his policies might help India fight China, improve defense cooperation, and build relationships with the Indian diaspora, his transactional, trade-centric style and propensity for abrupt changes could strain the two countries' relationship. India must carefully manage this relationship, striking a balance between the real advantages of a U.S.-India partnership led by a transactional leader and its strategic autonomy. The ability of Trump's administration to successfully combine its deal-driven, pragmatic approach with the stability required for a robust, long-term U.S.-India alliance will ultimately determine whether his presidency is a 'game changer' or a diplomatic challenge for India. To ensure that it can reap the rewards of this partnership while defending its national interests, India's diplomatic flexibility will be crucial.

Notre Dame Bells Ring For First Time Since Devastating Fire 5 Yea...	By Madalaine Elhabbal The bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris have rung for the first time since April 2019, when a devastating fire broke out in the spire and roof of the historic French church. Notre-Dame of Paris passed the major milestone today at about 10:30 a.m., just one month away from its highly anticipated reopening on Dec. 8. Housed in the northern belfry of the cathedral — which had been partially destroyed by the fire — the bells rang out one at a time, then sounded out together, according to AFP. Though authorities have not determined whether the fire was an accident, an initial investigation found that it could have been caused by an electrical malfunction. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately announced his intention to repair the cathedral within five years and even called for alternative contemporary proposals to reconstruct the church. For a brief period, debates swirled over whether the French government would sanction such an update instead of preserving Notre Dame’s original character. However, the French Parliament soon passed a bill stipulating that reconstruction efforts must 'preserve the historic, artistic, and architectural interest' of the historic cathedral. Macron officially declared a year later, in 2020, that the reconstruction would seek to resemble the original structure in the interest of finishing the project ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Notre Dame Cathedral was built between the 12th and 14th centuries. Its spire was first completed in the 13th century but was ultimately replaced in the 19th century on account of damage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawGs9DXMsZ1pc	2024-11-08T17:08:39-08:00	
UN Accuses Israel Of ‘Deliberate’ Attack On Peacekeeping Position...	By Ephrem Kossaify The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon on Friday said two Israeli excavators and a bulldozer destroyed part of a fence and a concrete structure in one of its positions in Ras Naqoura in southern Lebanon. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon added that in response to its 'urgent protest,' the Israel Defense Forces denied any activity was taking place inside its position. UNIFIL is stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor hostilities along the demarcation line with Israel, an area that has seen more than a year of fighting that turned into fierce clashes since last month between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters. Israel claims that UN forces provide cover for Hezbollah, and has told UNIFIL to evacuate peacekeepers from southern Lebanon for their own safety. But UNIFIL said the incident, which took place on Thursday, 'like seven other similar incidents, is not a matter of peacekeepers getting caught in the crossfire, but of deliberate and direct actions by the IDF.' UNIFIL issued a statement warning that 'the IDF’s deliberate and direct destruction of clearly identifiable UNIFIL property is a flagrant violation of international law and resolution 1701.' It called on the IDF and all other actors to honor 'their obligation to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.' UNIFIL also expressed concern over the destruction and removal this week of two of the blue barrels that mark the UN-delineated line of withdrawal between Lebanon and Israel (the Blue Line). Peacekeepers said they directly observed the IDF removing one of them. 'Despite the unacceptable pressures being exerted on the mission through various channels, peacekeepers will continue to undertake our mandated monitoring and reporting tasks under resolution 1701,' UNIFIL said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawIfoP8GGySvr	2024-11-08T17:04:25-08:00	
Beyond Deep Learning: Advancing Affective Computing With Diverse ...	Affective computing, a field focused on understanding and emulating human emotions, has seen significant advancements thanks to deep learning. However, researchers at the Technical University of Munich caution that an over-reliance on deep learning may hinder progress by overlooking other emerging trends in artificial intelligence. Their review, published in Intelligent Computing, a Science Partner Journal, advocate using a variety of AI methodologies to tackle ongoing challenges in affective computing. Affective computing uses various signals, such as facial expressions, voice and language cues, alongside physiological signals and wearable sensors to analyze and synthesize affect. While deep learning has significantly improved tasks like emotion recognition through innovations in transfer learning, self-supervised learning and transformer architectures, it also presents challenges, including poor generalization, cultural adaptability issues and a lack of interpretability. To address these limitations, the authors outline a comprehensive framework for developing embodied agents capable of interacting with multiple users in many different contexts. A key to this vision is the assessment of users’ goals, mental states and interrelationships for the purpose of facilitating longer interactions. The authors recommend integrating the following nine components, which they describe in detail, to improve human-agent interactions: 1. Graphs that map user relationships and context. 2. Capsules that model hierarchies for understanding affective interactions. 3. Neurosymbolic Engines that facilitate reasoning about interactions using affective primitives. 4. Symbols that establish common knowledge and rules for interaction. 5. Embodiment that enables collaborative learning in constrained environments. 6. Personalization that tailors interactions to individual user characteristics. 7. Generative AI that creates responses across multiple modalities. 8. Causal models that differentiate causes and effects for higher-order reasoning. 9. Spiking neural networks that enhance deployment of deep neural networks in resource-limited settings. The authors also describe several next-generation neural networks, resurgent themes and new frontiers in affective computing. Next-generation neural networks are advancing beyond traditional deep learning models to address limitations in capturing complex data structures, spatial relationships and energy efficiency. Capsule networks enhance convolutional networks by preserving spatial hierarchies, improving the modeling of complex entities, such as human body parts, which is vital in healthcare and emotion recognition. Geometric deep learning extends deep learning to non-Euclidean structures, allowing for a better understanding of complex data interactions. It has been particularly useful in sentiment and facial analysis. Mimicking the threshold-based firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks offer a more energy-efficient alternative for real-time applications, making them suitable for environments with limited resources. Traditional AI concepts, adapted to new contexts, can improve affective computing applications. Neurosymbolic systems show particular promise, combining the pattern recognition of deep learning with symbolic reasoning from traditional AI to improve the explainability and robustness of deep learning models. As these models enter real-world settings, they must conform to social norms, enhancing their ability to interpret emotions across cultures. Embodied cognition furthers this goal by situating AI agents in physical or simulated contexts, supporting natural interactions. Through reinforcement learning, embodied agents can achieve better situatedness and interactivity, which is especially beneficial in complex fields such as healthcare and education. In addition, three substantial ideas have emerged in affective computing in recent years: generative models, personalization, and causal reasoning. Advances in generative models, especially diffusion-based processes, enable AI to produce contextually relevant emotional expressions across various media, paving the way for interactive, embodied agents. Moving beyond one-size-fits-all models, personalization adapts responses based on user personalized characteristics while maintaining data privacy through federated learning. By incorporating causal reasoning, affective computing systems can not only associate but also intervene and counterfactualize in emotional contexts, enhancing their adaptability and transparency. The future of affective computing could hinge on combining innovation and a variety of AI methodologies. Moving beyond a deep learning-centric approach could pave the way for more sophisticated, culturally aware, and ethically designed systems. The integration of multiple approaches promises a future where technology not only understands but also enriches human emotions, marking a significant leap towards truly intelligent and empathetic AI.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawIkRYL6TkpJg	2024-11-08T17:02:11-08:00	
Nanoparticle Bursts Over The Amazon Rainforest	During the wet season in the Amazon rainforest heavy rainfall frequently occurs during the afternoon. For clouds and precipitation to develop, tiny airborne particles known as cloud condensation nuclei are required for water vapor to condense and form cloud droplets. But what are the origins of these cloud condensation nuclei? An international research team from Germany, Brazil, Sweden, and China now showed that rainfall regularly induces bursts of nanoparticles that can grow to form cloud condensation nuclei. The scientists analyzed comprehensive long-term measurements of aerosol particles, trace gases, and meteorological data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, ATTO, which is equipped with sophisticated instrumentation and measurement towers that are up to 325 m high. The observatory is located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil, about 150 kilometers north-east of Manaus, and jointly operated by scientists from Germany and Brazil. Luiz Machado, first author of the study now published in the journal Nature Geoscience, explains: 'Rainfall removes aerosol particles and introduces ozone from the atmosphere into the forest canopy. Ozone can oxidize plant-emitted volatile organic compounds, especially terpenes, and the oxidation products can enhance the formation of new particles, leading to temporary bursts of nanoparticles.' Nanoparticle concentrations are highest just above the forest canopy The researchers discovered that nanoparticle concentrations are highest just above the forest canopy and decrease with increasing altitude. 'This gradient persists throughout the wet season, indicating continuous particle formation in the canopy and an upward flux of newly formed particles that can grow by further uptake of low volatile molecules and serve as cloud condensation nuclei', adds Christopher Pöhlker, co-author and research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. Among the low volatile molecules involved in the formation and growth of natural nanoparticles in the atmosphere are oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organic compounds that are formed upon oxidation of isoprene, terpenes, and other volatile organic compounds, which are naturally emitted by plants and oxidized by ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the air. Earlier studies had detected new particle formation in the outflow of convective clouds in the upper troposphere and suggested a downward flux rather than an upward flux of newly formed nanoparticles. 'Our findings imply a paradigm shift in the scientific understanding of interactions between the rainforest, aerosols, clouds, and precipitation in the Amazon, which are important for regional and global climate', concludes Ulrich Pöschl, co-author and director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawF5SL3YbcQ6R	2024-11-08T16:57:25-08:00	
Off-The-Shelf Thermoelectric Generators Can Upgrade CO2 Into Chem...	Readily available thermoelectric generators operating under modest temperature differences can power CO2 conversion, according to a proof-of-concept study by chemists at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The findings open up the intriguing possibility that the temperature differentials encountered in an array of environments—from a typical geothermal installation on Earth to the cold, desolate surface of Mars—could power the conversion of CO2 into a range of useful fuels and chemicals. 'The environment on Mars really got me interested in the long-term potential of this technology combination,' says Dr. Abhishek Soni, postdoctoral research fellow at UBC and first author of the paper published in Device. 'This is a harsh environment where large temperature differences could be leveraged to not only generate power with thermoelectric generators, but to convert the abundant CO2 in Mars’ atmosphere into useful products that could supply a colony.' Thermoelectric generators produce electricity by being attached to places with two different temperatures—in this case, a hot plate and an ice bath in the lab. The research team determined when the temperature difference between the two faces was at least 40 °C, standard model thermoelectric generators provided enough steady current to power an electrolyzer that converts CO2 to CO. Close to home, a refinement of the technology could be attached to geothermal installations. 'Our results in the lab indicate the temperature difference between hot geothermal pipes returning from underground and the relatively cooler surface temperature is enough for thermoelectric generators to power a convertor,' says Dr. Soni. The vision for Mars would be a bit more extreme. Any biodome on Mars would need to be maintained at room temperatures. Thermoelectric generators clamped over a dome’s surface would leverage the difference between indoor temperatures and the frigid temperatures outside to generate power. That power could in turn be used to drive CO2 conversion into useful carbon-based products like fuels and chemicals. The Martian atmosphere is 95 per cent carbon dioxide, and temperatures range from 20 °C to -153 °C. 'This paper shows a fun way to make carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals,' says Professor Curtis P. Berlinguette, principal investigator at UBC. 'We’ll need plastic on Mars one day, and this technology shows one way we can make it there.' Next steps will be to see how the thermoelectric generators work with our electrolyzer in the real world, here on Earth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawCioGVfn5rsF	2024-11-08T16:54:46-08:00	
BRICS Suits Putin But Is No Friend Of Israel – OpEd	From October 22 to 24, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, as host of the 2024 BRICS summit, welcomed 36 world leaders to Russia. This conference marked the first gathering of the BRICS group after its expansion to include, alongside the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), four new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Other countries attended as partners or aspiring new members. The expanded body brings together countries representing approximately 41% of the global population and 24% of the global GDP. BRICS aims to promote cooperation among major emerging economies and increase their economic and political influence. Its primary purpose is to provide an alternative to Western-led institutions like the G7 economic grouping. It seeks to reduce reliance on the US dollar in international trade. The group's aims conform precisely to Putin’s domestic and international aspirations, which he does not seek to conceal. At an open meeting on October 22, 2022 he said: ''The unipolar world is being relegated into the past…The West is unable to rule humanity single-handedly, and the majority of nations no longer want to put up with this…. A future world arrangement is taking shape before our eyes.' BRICS is the perfect instrument for assisting Putin reach his goal. Given the inclusion of Iran and South Africa in its membership, the viscerally anti-Israel stance it has adopted is not, perhaps, surprising. The summit was held in the Russian city of Kazan, so the statement issued on its conclusion is titled the Kazan Declaration. In it, the BRICS leaders devote 8 of its 35 paragraphs to denouncing Israel in one way or another. In paragraph 30, for example, without any reference to the horrifying events of October 7, 2023, or even one mention of the word Hamas, they express 'grave concern' at the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which they ascribe to 'the Israeli military offensive, which led to mass killing and injury of civilians, forced displacement and widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure.' They call for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages and detainees 'from both sides', drawing no distinction between civilians illegally seized, and people imprisoned for their crimes. Providing no evidence to support the charge, they denounce 'Israeli attacks against humanitarian operations'. Unsurprisingly they approve of the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in 'the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel.' They call for a two-state solution based on what they term the 'borders of June 1967,' and for the State of Palestine to be granted full membership in the United Nations. In paragraph 31 the Declaration turns to Lebanon. Here BRICS members, without once mentioning Hezbollah or making any reference to its ceaseless bombardment of northern Israel starting on October 8, 2023, 'condemn the loss of civilian lives and the immense damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from attacks by Israel in residential areas in Lebanon and call for immediate cessation of military acts.' They move on to condemn, among other things, what they term 'the premeditated terrorist act of detonating handheld communication devices in Beirut on 17 September 2024,' which, they claim, 'resulted in the loss of life and injury of dozens of civilians.' They make no mention of the fact that the devices in question had been issued only to Hezbollah members and certain other VIPs like Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. The Kazan Declaration makes it clear that BRICS turns a blind eye toward terrorist activity aimed at eliminating Israel and its people, and has nothing but unreserved condemnation for the steps Israel takes to defend itself. The summit was undoubtedly a personal triumph for Putin. Ostracized and sanctioned by the West, here he was able to straddle the world stage, host to a large gathering of global leaders. At Kazan Putin demonstrated that he has been rehabilitated personally by a large section of the world, and that an alternative to Western dominance is a real possibility. The topics discussed included how emerging economies could cooperate more fully across a variety of fields. In addition it set the ball rolling on one of Putin’s pet projects – a new international payments system that would undercut the dominance of the US dollar. The magazine Newsweek believes that the overarching ambition of BRICS leaders such as Putin and China's President XI Jinping is to accelerate and bolster the shift away from America as the sole superpower, and toward a multipolar world that counterbalances the US and its Western allies. It points out that the Russian economy has managed to readjust following the sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has done so with the help of its key partner China, aided also by Iranian weapons supplied for use in Ukraine. Putin is now seeking to expand trade with India through a strategic partnership, particularly in the areas of energy resources and defense. 'These partnerships,' says Newsweek, 'are Putin's multipolar vision in practice, undermining the US-led West's ability to exercise its power and enforce its desired global norms through sanctions and other economic and diplomatic levers at its disposal.' His overall aim is to dismantle the US-led transatlantic and global order so that Russia can exercise greater power regionally and internationally Allied to the bid by BRICS for economic, financial and political independence from the West is a rejection of the principle, staunchly upheld by the US and most of the free world, that Israel has the right to defend itself against the genocidal and illegal terrorism of Iran and its axis of evil. In fact, with Iran and South Africa as leading members, it is doubtful if BRICS as an organization regards Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Iranian-supported militias in Iraq and Syria as terrorist bodies at all. It is this myopia that underlies its root and branch condemnation of Israel. However Israel need not submit to being blackened and isolated. A closer look at the list of BRICS members reveals the presence of Abraham Accord partner, the UAE, while hovering in the wings, invited to join but as yet uncertain, is Saudi Arabia. Other countries enjoying good relations with Israel, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Belarus, are also possible new members. Putin himself has a nuanced attitude toward Israel – a position that could be affected by the result of the forthcoming US presidential election. Self-interest could well override any demand by Iran, South Africa or Turkey (another possible new member) for a permanent anti-Israel stance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcd7av1bCIhtehjVBWmRX44	2024-11-08T09:17:01-08:00	
Russia, China Figure Out Trump’s Landslide Victory – OpEd	One great paradox of our era is that the robustness of American democracy has come to be measured in coffee spoons in terms of the country’s archaic system of electoral college votes. The result is, foreign observers lacking a sense of the forces of history miss the woods for the trees. The ancient Greeks who invented democracy never thought of an electoral college system. The word democracy came from two Greek words that mean people (demos) and rule (kratos). Don’t miss the bigger truth that Donald Trump’s landslide victory is highly consequential. Trump was on comeback trail, something that happened only for the second time in American history. He was fighting against very heavy odds including real threats of assassination by unknown forces whose identity still remains a mystery, and in circumstances enveloped in darkness that is impossible to penetrate. He estimates that he is entirely beholden to God’s will. And he went on to secure a mandate that is so comprehensive that no caveats can be attached to it — securing a majority of votes (first time this is happening in 20 years) as well as winning a grand slam in the key swing states and counties too, plus walking away with an impressive Republican Party majority in the Senate that can only be seen as a reflection of the 'Trumpmania' sweeping America from coast to coast. If that isn’t a wave, what is it? Kamala Harris lost no time to understand its meaning and graciously accepted the nation’s will. The Guardian, no friend of Trump, reported today, 'The results show that America has firmly swung back to the Republicans. The Democrats won 2020 by expanding their share of votes across the country, but 90% of counties swung back to the Republicans in 2024.' The Russian President Vladimir Putin felt compelled, finally, to change his mind and 'offer my congratulations on [Trump’s] election as president of the United States.' All that rancid talk in Moscow about 'apocalypse now' for American democracy is petering out. And the dull roar of a retreat is vaguely audible in Putin’s turnaround to a conciliatory tone during a major speech at Sochi yesterday. Putin who maintained that he wouldn’t be congratulating Trump probably took the cue from Beijing. The night before Putin spoke on Thursday evening, Chinese President Xi Jinping had sent a formal congratulatory message to Trump on his election victory underscoring that 'history tells us that both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Xi wrote, 'A China-U.S. relationship with stable, healthy and sustainable development serves the common interests of the two countries and meets the expectations of the international community. It is hoped that the two sides will, in the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era to the benefit of the two countries and the world.' These incipient signs of a new dawn breaking in big-power politics could well turn out to be the salience of the new Trump Administration’s foreign policies. Who knows? Beijing senses that the US is reemerging credibly as a flag carrier and a decent burial of the American dollar is nowhere in sight — BRICS or no BRICS. In comparison, alas, Moscow’s hyperbolic rhetoric was that the US election tolls the death knell of Democracy in America and that the country may even disintegrate: 'For the [USA] republic itself, dark forebodings abound. Some warn that unchecked discord could rend the union asunder, casting the states as enemies sworn to conquer one another, much as kingdoms of old clashed on blood-soaked fields. Political battles, once confined to speeches and votes, may soon take the form of steel and fire, with regions seeking dominance or defense of their way of life. In such a landscape, the banners of free states could be raised high, each upholding its own 'God-given' reign, even as they march against one another.' This was absurdity carried to the extreme, and it appeared in a Kremlin-funded publication on November 3! Again, the Foreign Ministry’s statement in Moscow in the afternoon of November 6 even as the news was appearing on Trump’s victory was simply appalling — defensive like a porcupine’s behaviour in times of stress raising its quills with body shivering, clattering its teeth and producing an unpleasant odour to warn predators not to approach. But here, again, Putin, fortunately, had other thoughts on his mind and made amends just in time. On the other hand, China is pinning hopes that a strong president in the White House may be a good thing to happen, as the neocon shibboleths get discarded, and with a mind steeped in intuitive cognition and realism, Trump is in a position to take difficult decisions. If that happens, of course — veering toward a non-confrontational trajectory in the Sino-American relationship that has seamless potential to create synergy for Trump’s MAGA movement as well as China’s peaceful rise — it becomes a 'win-win' for all sides and humanity as a whole. Four decades ago, in fact, Trump had espoused to newly-elected Ronald Reagan precisely such a detente with the Soviet Union in a full-page paid write-up in New York Times and even offered to be a presidential envoy to make it possible. The heart of the matter is Trump 2.0 remains an enigma. Importantly, he is being presidential after a four-year internship in DC from 2016 to 2020. But there is no question that Trump will assert his presidential authority. He has no more heights to conquer in a tumultuous career, which makes him, like Shelly’s skylark, 'an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.' Robert Kennedy Jr, is on record that 'I spent two days with [Trump] recently and he was saying things that were kind of shocking to me…The level of change that he wants to make in our government, I think is going to be unprecedented… He wants a revolution and I think he’s going to get one.' The 11 words that shook the world in Trump’s victory speech was undoubtedly, 'I’m not going to start wars, I’m going to stop wars.' Indeed, China is taking Trump’s victory very seriously — rationally, positively and with cautious optimism. Conceivably, Beijing draws comfort that aides like Tesla CEO Elon Musk may provide a sense of proportion to Trump’s policymaking. Certainly, Trump cannot hope to turn back the tide of historical forces and restore US hegemony. Being a civilisation state, China has its own concepts of time and space. The Chinese economy is nowhere near collapse. And it is unrealistic to wage a technology war and impose global standards vis-a-vis a vast economy like China’s, which has reached high levels of research and innovation backed up by industrial production on a scale surpassing the entire western world’s put together. The 1970s analogy of the US breaking Japan’s will and compelling it be a subaltern forever doesn’t hold good today. Then, there is the spirit of the times that must be noted: the CEO of the official government think tank in New Delhi NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) — erstwhile Planning commission — has just spoken out that India should seek membership of the RCEP(Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) where China has a lead role, to tap into the potential of the free trade bloc comprising the 10-member ASEAN group plus their six FTA partners China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

NATO Statement On The Democratic People’s Republic Of Korea	Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and Ukraine associate themselves with this statement NATO Allies strongly condemn the decisions by the leaders of the Russian Federation and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to dangerously expand Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. In addition to the DPRK’s already substantive support to Russia’s war effort, through the provision of millions of rounds of ammunitions and ballistic missiles, the thousands of combat troops deployed by the DPRK constitutes a dangerous expansion of its ongoing support for Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. The deepening military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK deeply impacts Euro-Atlantic security, with implications also for the Indo-Pacific. Increasing military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a breach of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including 2270 (2016), 1718 (2006), and 1874 (2009). This is particularly egregious given Russia’s status as a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. We call on Russia to return to compliance with these resolutions and to uphold its international obligations. Russia’s statement on 26 September asserting that the denuclearisation of the DPRK is 'off the table' is unacceptable, as it undermines the global non-proliferation regime, directly contradicts relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and further exacerbates regional tensions. The Russian statement forms part of its wider effort to undermine the global non-proliferation regime and to dismantle UN sanctions. We urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression, and condemn all those who are facilitating and thereby prolonging Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine. NATO will continue to work with its partners, in particular in the Indo-Pacific, to promote peace and stability, and prevent Russia and those facilitating its war effort from undermining regional and global stability. Allies continue to enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence against all threats and challenges, in all domains, and in multiple strategic directions across the Euro-Atlantic area. Allies remain as resolute as ever in supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail. Allies and partners continue to step up vital political, military, financial, economic, and humanitarian assistance as Ukraine exercises its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Allies are determined to support Ukraine in building a force capable of defeating Russian aggression, in line with the pledge of long-term security assistance for Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsTiYE-5VYhRG	2024-11-08T09:14:32-08:00	
An Assessment Of Israel’s War As Peace Efforts Grind To A Halt – ...	A year has passed but the war in the Middle East has not slumped. Israel’s many fronts war seems only to be expanding with the direct intervention of Iran. As peace efforts have been sidelined, Israel’s war strategy has been caught adrift, especially with a besieged front in Gaza. At the outset, Israel has mostly withdrawn from the Gaza strip although it has kept a sizable presence in strategic areas such as the Philadelphi corridor among other high grounds, this is fundamentally to prevent any regrouping of Hamas fighters. The Rafah crossing is equally vital for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) since large quantities of infrastructure and material supplies have been funneled through that infamous crossing. Yoav Gallant has publicly acknowledged that Hamas’ military capabilities have been downgraded severely. One of Israel’s core rallying points for the October 7 retaliation was the complete disintegration of Hamas’ military wing coupled with its political arm insomuch that it could never establish an authoritative presence in Gaza. This is confirmed by the continuous bombings in Beit Lahiya a municipality in northern Gaza and the Jabaliya refugee camp despite exterminating Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the ignominious October 7 massacre. In Lebanon, the IDF’s strategy has been to target Hezbollah affiliated sites in and around Beirut while the ground forces are carrying out clearing operations. A relatively small number of Israeli troops are fighting along the border. Whether the IDF will make the grade in pushing Hezbollah beyond the Litani River is still early to predict however in 2006, they were unable to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, attacks from the West Bank are growing in number and lethality whilst the internal security agencies within Israel have contained the threats. Within Israel, there were internal dissensions at play considering what Israel’s Defence Minister had to say about the trajectory of the war. Yoav Gallant wrote a letter to top military officials and cabinet ministers including Benjamin Netanyahu about the direction the war is heading; the Defence Minister has opined that the ongoing war seems aimless. According to former CIA Director David Petraeus, the strategy of 'clear and leave' employed by the IDF is not a viable option. This strategy has certainly worked for Israel in the short-term especially, after the death of key leaders and commanders. But ideally, the approach should have been 'clear, hold, and build' but it is too late for that since the quantum of depredations and destitution in Gaza has crossed epic proportions. In the backdrop of these myriad developments, negotiations are rife in the back channels of war between the US, Lebanon, and Israel as reports of a draft agreement under discussions is slated for 60 days. The onus of this agreement has been entrusted to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) who are required to gradually deploy 10,000 troops as both Hezbollah and the IDF cease attacks, while the US alongside the UN, Europe, and regional states would ensure a 'Monitoring and Enforcement Mechanism' to supervise ceasefire violations including sanctions packages. The ultimate objective is to steer this agreement towards enforcing the UN Resolution 1701. However, this truce effort has been rejected as Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that 'agreements, documents, proposals are not the main point', thus crushing any prospects for brokering a ceasefire settlement. Another ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US was aborted. They had designed a cessation-of-hostilities agreement backed by the US advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza. It has several stages. First, a prisoner swap is to be implemented under which the following criteria has to be applied i.e., the IDF has to gradually withdraw and Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Second, Hamas should release all remaining hostages and Israel should follow suit by releasing a number of Palestinians alongside the withdrawal of all soldiers from Gaza. Third, the end of the blockade and the exchange of dead bodies has to be undertaken. A fourth option beseeches that Hamas should not rearm. Lately, a senior Hamas official Khalil al Hayya has outright rejected a proposal for their safe passage from Gaza so that the hostage deal could be resolved. The reticence shown by Hamas indicates two possible scenarios: on the one hand, Hamas will continue their fight against Israel while on the other, they will prima facie look for avenues to form a government in Gaza. Indeed, Hamas is seeking to build a national unity government in coalition with the Palestinian Authority (PA) clinging on to the idea of a vacuum in the post-war reconstruction of Gaza. As peace efforts in the Middle East grind to a halt, the options for de-escalation appear distant. First, the destruction of Gaza will have ramifications in the long-term as anger against the Israelis is mounting; many disgruntled youths would in all likelihood join Hamas and other militant clusters against Israel. Second, there is no alternative vision to reconstruct Gaza on humanitarian grounds which could perhaps solicit the support of the Arabs if the Israeli government resorts to such a course. Nevertheless, to expect such a directional change in the war from either side is preposterous. Third, Tel Aviv would certainly hold on to vital corridors such as the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah crossing if future attacks are to be prevented. Fourth, the Biden administration, belatedly, had tightened the noose on Benjamin Netanyahu just before US elections on pertinent issues. Washington pressed for a 30 days timeline under which Israel had to help improve the living conditions in Gaza— allowing aid into Gaza including 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza and to provide access to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which was recently barred by the Israeli Knesset. Finally, the return of Donald Trump to the White House could perhaps a) tighten the noose on Iran and its proxies although that does not preclude the latter would cease to threaten Israel; b) Trump’s foreign policy could facilitate the probable annexation of the West Bank by Israel at the expense of the Palestinians and c) Netanyahu’s discretion in total war against Hamas and Hezbollah may be curtailed by a strong US President. However, until Trump assumes office, Israel’s objectives in Gaza, its ground operations in Lebanon would persevere in full swing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsZzOW6M4lkqH	2024-11-08T09:13:27-08:00	
Operation Iron Swords: Israel’s Long Game In The Middle East – Op...	Pundits in International Affairs comment that after one year of military exhaustion, Israel’s Operation Iron Swords has made some twisted dynamics in the Middle East as an unmitigated disaster in which both Israel and its foes are equally wounded. For Hamas, the death of its leaders one after another caused a disastrous effect as it may take years for them to revive their organizational apparatus. Israeli’s jubilation over crushing the key leaders in both Hamas and Hezbollah is not long-lasting as their escalation with Iran is symbolic of a new regional conflict, which can undermine the international order. The contention often heard from the commenters in the global affairs is that Israel lacks the long term strategic ability of transforming its massive military victories into a durable political one as Tel Aviv is losing its international partners due to violating the proportionality in the military operations in Gaza and Lebanon . From a vantage point of view, all these arguments are good enough as ingredients for a scholarly soup as the realist position in the war in the Middle East has taken strides in favour of Israel by the strategic victories that the IDF acquired. Iranian entry into the theatre of the Middle East has been sometimes depicted as a turning point, but Tehran and its proxies show less advancement over the Israeli operations in Lebanon indicating the military superiority of the latter. The only significant threat posed by Iran towards Israel lies in deploying its proxies outside the centre of gravity against the Israeli targets. For example, the recent alleged threat reported in Sri Lanka on Israeli tourists visiting the island’s East Coast referred to Iranian agents.One might speculate if Israel has achieved its strategic ambitions from Operation Iron Swords, how would Tel Aviv turn them into a political reality, which would consolidate Israel’s position in the Middle East? In order to address such a question, it is essential to understand whether Israel accomplished what it yearned for after the 7th of October. Here are Israel’s declared strategic and political goals in Operation Iron Swords: In Gaza: 1) To eliminate Hamas’s military power and force the collapse of its rule, with the object of bringing about a situation in which there is no longer any security threat from the Gaza Strip; and 2) to create conditions for the return of the hostages. In Lebanon: To return the residents of the Israeli north to their homes by destroying and pushing Hezbollah forces north of the Litani River. A much more ambitious overarching goal that Israel desires to achieve is to form a new regional security reality bolstering the formidable position of Israel. In achieving this target, Israel aims to dismantle the Iranian proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah that loom before the Israeli boarder causing a severe existential threat and it may not be an exaggeration to contend that Iran will be much weaker without the consistency of these two forces. Country’s dwindling economy which has been stagnated for years is another additional burden for Tehran which reduces its ability to sustain in a long term war against Israel . As American strategic guru Edward Luttwak cleverly argued Iran’s export revenue which earned nearly 80% from oil has been spent on imported components and supplies consumed by the domestic Revolutionary Guards, with its 125,000 troops and a naval force. This includes the imports of Chinese and North Korean missile and rocket components, as well as the foreign-currency costs of the entire nuclear programme which proceeds at a very large scale. The oil export process is mainly located in the Khark island within 1500 km proximity of Israeli airbase. In the UN general assembly, Netanyahu hinted that Israeli’s long arms can extend to Iran’s oil resources, which can certainly collapse Iran’s wounded economy. All in all, from the Iranian front a threat posing against Israel is not much inimical as Israel’s military machinery stands stronger as a lethal threat to Tehran. The challenges loom before Israel in Gaza seem to be more complex regardless of Israel’s military victories over Hamas, in which the latter has been devastated both logistically and numerically. Israel’s dilemma with Gaza is the fact that if it decides to distribute humanitarian aid among Gazans, Israel will become the de facto force ruling Gaza which Tel Aviv does not want. But, this can lead to accelerating the authority of Hamas again even after its eclipse. The history of Hamas since its inception has shown that it contains the ability to relish major blows as the Hamas ideology that its founders nourished remains unaffected. Yet on the strategic front the achievements that Israel earned from its operation Iron Swords elevate Tel Aviv’s status into a powerful position which they did not hold in the region before the 7th of October. Mainly its ability of freeing itself from the threat paranoia from Hezbollah in Lebanon is a deterring factor that fortifies Israel. Overall, Israel seems to have tighten its grip over Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran with the aim of securing its position in a long game, which may alter the security architecture of the Middle at unprecedented level. The other paramount factor adding one more brick to Israel is Trump’s return to the White House for his second term, which has already made many right-wing Israelis jubilant. Considering how the Trump administration supported Israel between 2017 to 2020, it appears to be reasonable to see these latest changes in Washington as catalyst factors changing the chain of events in the Middle East. From the act of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem to the successful completion of the Abraham Accords in 2020, Trump’s actions appeased Tel Aviv. In return, Israel backed out of the plot to assassinate Iranian General Soleimani in January 2020, which frustrated Trump and even became a point of discussion during the presidential election. Despite the troubling memory of Israel’s broken promise, Trump’s second term is likely to be favorable to Tel Aviv, as he would oppose bringing the Palestinian Authority to Gaza or moving earnestly toward a two-state solution. With the military victories earned by IDF for past few months, Israel can begin a fresh start when Trump enters the White House on the 20th of January. It can also be presumed that Trump may support Israel to launch pre-emptive strikes on Iran nuclear reactors as an emulation of what Israel achieved against Iraq in 1981, which completely wiped out Saddam Hussain’s nuclear ambition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsRF0AU-gMurN	2024-11-08T09:12:00-08:00

Hegemonic Masculinity As A Political Strategy For Donald Trump’s ...	Donald Trump's historic success in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election can be significantly linked to his representation of hegemonic masculinity, which resonate with traits such as strength, authority, and assertiveness. Trump's political identity and campaign strategies, characterized by resilience, assertiveness, and a defiance of established norms, struck a chord with voters who felt marginalized by evolving gender dynamics and progressive social movements. Through his rhetoric and media portrayal, Trump leveraged these gendered power dynamics, solidifying the appeal of hegemonic masculinity as pivotal to leadership and political achievement in modern America. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election appears to be significantly influenced by narratives intricately linked to established gender power dynamics, especially the notion of hegemonic masculinity. This sociological framework, which denotes the prevailing form of masculinity within a society, significantly influences political ideologies, the attractiveness of candidates, and the results of elections. Donald Trump’s persona, political style, and strategies during the campaign illustrate the substantial impacts of hegemonic masculinity traits on his electoral success. Therefore, the hegemonic masculinity, left indelible imprints within the political sphere, its expression in Donald Trump’s political persona, and its significant impact on his achievements in the 2024 election. Understanding Hegemonic Masculinity Hegemonic masculinity, a concept initially articulated by sociologist R.W. Connell in the 1980s, denotes the culturally prevailing ideal of masculinity that is regarded as the standard within a particular society. It is defined by attributes such as physical strength, dominance, aggression, emotional stoicism, competitiveness, and sexual virility. These characteristics are frequently regarded as the standard for defining a 'true man' within a specific cultural context. Hegemonic masculinity functions as a systemic power framework rather than merely an individual identity, reinforcing patriarchal norms while simultaneously marginalizing those who deviate from traditional gender expressions, such as femininity, homosexuality, and various forms of gender diversity (Connell, 1995). The concept of masculinity is dynamic; it is shaped by social constructs and differs across various cultures and historical periods. Nevertheless, specific elements consistently persist, such as the oppression of women and the disparagement of alternative masculinities that diverge from this dominant standard. Within this context, political candidates—particularly male politicians—tend to portray themselves in a manner that aligns with the anticipated traits of strength, control, and dominance linked to prevailing masculine ideals. The Role of Hegemonic Masculinity in Politics In the political sphere, hegemonic masculinity significantly influences how the public perceives leaders and assesses their effectiveness. Political leaders who embrace this ideal frequently attract significant support from voters, especially those who equate masculinity with robust leadership. In a country such as the United States, where political discussions frequently revolve around power dynamics, strength, and authority, the influence of hegemonic masculinity can profoundly affect voter behavior, ultimately shaping electoral results. The concept of hegemonic masculinity in the realm of politics is complicatedly connected to the nuances of political discourse, the formulation of campaign strategies, and the representations found within media portrayals. It shapes the perception of candidates regarding their leadership capabilities, negotiation skills, and ability to tackle challenges effectively. Voters frequently gravitate towards candidates who embody conventional masculine characteristics—those who present a strong stance on matters such as crime, national security, and foreign policy, while embracing positions that resonate with ideals of strength and authority. The phenomenon has been particularly pronounced in the context of Donald Trump, who has adeptly utilized the notion of hegemonic masculinity to craft a persuasive narrative surrounding his political persona. The focus of his campaign consistently highlights themes of resilience, tackling both domestic matters (like immigration and crime) and international challenges (including trade and military strategy). Trump’s emphasis on 'law and order,' his pledges to restore the nation’s stature, and his confrontational stance towards the media and political elites have established him as a prominent embodiment of assertive masculinity in the American political landscape. Donald Trump's 'America First' policy is closely aligned with hegemonic masculinity, especially in its approach to conventional security threats. This policy underscores national strength, military superiority, and unilateral decision-making, presenting a vision of America as a preeminent global power, aligned with the principles of hegemonic masculinity—strength, control, and aggression. Trump’s emphasis on military strength, border protection, and economic independence underscores the concept of American masculinity as inherently robust and self-sufficient. His rhetoric frequently frames America as requiring a restoration of its supremacy, addressing external threats—such as terrorism, China, and illegal immigration—through assertive, 'tough' measures, reminiscent of the conventional masculine characteristic of aggression. Donald Trump’s Hegemonic Masculinity Donald Trump's political identity is closely associated with the representation of hegemonic masculinity, a concept that highlights characteristics such as strength, control, aggression, and dominance. Trump's identity as a leader has consistently centered on these masculine ideals, which are firmly rooted in conventional American concepts of power. His political rhetoric, frequently marked by bold statements and a lack of concern for conventional decorum, positions him as the quintessential 'tough' leader who boldly confronts established norms and asserts his authority. The characteristics of hegemonic masculinity strongly connect with white working-class male voters who experience a sense of alienation due to changes in gender roles and power dynamics within society. Trump's hegemonic masculinity approach has played a crucial role in his political achievements, framing him as a champion of conventional values in opposition to what he and his followers perceive as the feminization or dilution of American society. His portrayal as a formidable and pragmatic leader capable of commanding respect has positioned him as an emblem of strength, resonating with voters who perceive in him a dismissal of contemporary political correctness and a commitment to decisive action in both domestic and international affairs. His confrontational approach to political adversaries, especially women, solidifies his portrayal as a commanding male presence in a sector historically led by men, thereby reinforcing the notion that authority is to be established through force and dominance. Trump's leadership approach, characterized by a steadfast assurance in his capacity to command the political arena and global affairs, serves as a distinct representation of dominant masculinity. His political decisions, including the emphasis on military strength and a strong focus on immigration control, reinforce his position as a representative of conventional, patriarchal masculinity. In this context, Trump's appeal is anchored in his portrayal as a dominant leader, a persona that continues to resonate with significant portions of the American electorate. Election Campaigns During the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election campaign, Trump's rhetoric and public appearances were meticulously designed to resonate with his voters’ perception of hegemonic masculinity. Through his speeches and social media communications, Trump highlighted his assertiveness, confrontational nature, and unapologetic stance—traits that strongly appealed to his voters. Unlike the typically measured and diplomatic strategies employed by other candidates, Trump's campaign was characterized by assertive and confrontational rhetoric. The employment of 'fight' imagery, including phrases like 'take back America' and 'drain the swamp,' resonated with voters’ aspirations for a leader capable of asserting authority and countering perceived threats to the nation’s stability. This form of rhetoric aligns with the broader cultural narrative surrounding hegemonic masculinity, portraying the ideal leader as someone who remains resolute in adversity and is prepared to tackle challenges directly. Trump leveraged his unique persona to set himself apart from his rivals, especially those affiliated with conventional political establishments. His self-presentation as an outsider—unconstrained by the norms of Washington politics—bolstered his image as a robust figure capable of confronting the political elite. By presenting himself as the advocate for 'ordinary Americans' in the face of perceived threats from immigrants, foreign adversaries, and progressive social movements, Trump’s campaign effectively leveraged themes of dominance and defiance against external pressures. Furthermore, Trump's media strategy played a pivotal role in the manifestation of hegemonic masculinity throughout the campaign. He leveraged his media presence to enhance his reputation as a bold leader unafraid to express his views, frequently at the expense of conventional political decorum. This bold expression of masculinity was positioned as a strength rather than a drawback, resonating with a portion of the electorate that felt disconnected from what they viewed as the gentleness or fragility of the political establishment. Trump’s Victory The outcome of the 2024 election in favor of Trump can be partially linked to the prevalent endorsement of traditional masculine ideals among a considerable segment of the American voting population. The acceptance of this phenomenon is not uniform; however, it is notably pronounced within specific demographics, including white working-class voters, evangelical Christians, and rural communities. These groups, perceiving a decline in their cultural and economic influence amid evolving social dynamics, frequently interpret Trump’s endorsement of traditional masculinity as a means of countering this perceived erosion. The concept of hegemonic masculinity significantly influenced Trump's capacity to rally his supporters. A significant portion of his electorate perceived that their identities as men were being sidelined by modern social movements advocating for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and feminist initiatives. Trump's rhetoric frequently featured anti-feminist undertones and direct appeals to male voters, effectively reinforcing a sense of solidarity among those who perceived a threat from the feminist movement and evolving gender norms. By presenting himself as a champion of traditional masculinity, Trump successfully brought together a substantial segment of the electorate that felt disconnected from the changing dynamics of gender roles. In the framework of the 2024 election, the appeal of Trump's brand of hegemonic masculinity transcended personal identity, serving as a calculated political strategy that enabled him to convey strength and authority on issues that profoundly connected with his supporters. Trump's success in the 2024 election transcends the boundaries of his political platform or economic policies. This outcome represents a triumph for a specific interpretation of masculinity that prioritizes strength, authority, and opposition to advancing social movements. This portrayal of masculinity is one that Trump has consistently represented throughout his career and one that continues to connect with a substantial portion of the American electorate. Conclusion Ultimately, the concept of hegemonic masculinity significantly influenced Donald Trump’s success in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the embodiment and promotion of characteristics linked to dominant masculinity—such as strength, aggression, and control—Trump successfully shaped a political identity that resonated with a significant portion of voters who regarded these traits as vital for effective leadership. Through his campaign rhetoric, media strategies, and public persona, Trump established himself as a champion of hegemonic masculinity during a time of societal evolution, leveraging anxieties surrounding cultural decline and shifts in gender norms. The 2024 election illustrated that hegemonic masculinity remains a significant influence in American politics, affecting both voter preferences and the fundamental characteristics of political discourse. The connection Trump established with his voters through the framework of masculine power played a crucial role in his electoral success, highlighting the persistent impact of gendered power dynamics within the political landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLOcLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-08T09:05:54-08:00	
Reflections On The US Election – OpEd	Not surprisingly, the mainstream media are in disbelief over the results of the presidential election. That’s because they live in an intellectual ghetto. Instead of just talking to each other, it would be so nice if they actually spent time talking to those who work in housekeeping, the cafeteria, maintenance and security. Will they change now that they have been proven wrong? Not at all. They are hopelessly incapable of changing, though they love to say that the public has a hard time accepting change. Not so. They do. Does money count in elections? Not as much as many think. Harris raised over $1 billion and wound up $20 million in debt in the final week. Trump spent half as much, over $400 million. In the few weeks before the election, Bill Gates gave Harris $50 million, and Michael Bloomberg followed with another $50 million. George Soros topped them both. Do celebrities matter? They may if they occasionally show up for a rally or fundraiser. But Harris went overboard, bringing in Oprah, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Jennifer Lopez et al. She also went on Saturday Night Live before the election. This actually hurt her. Why? She was already seen as a lightweight, the word-salad queen, so being surrounded by celebrities only fed the perception that she was not a serious person. Why were so many of the polls wrong? Because most of them never corrected for the Trump supporters who simply won’t speak to them. They don’t trust them, and, importantly, they know it is not popular in many circles to admit being for Trump. The pollster that was the most accurate was J.L. Partners. Based in the U.S., it was founded by pollsters for the British Prime Minister; it published its results with the Daily Mail, a conservative U.K. publication. It was one of the few that got it right: it said in the run-up to the election that Trump had a 54 percent chance of winning. McLaughlin & Associates also did a good job. Pollsters often ask the wrong questions, or they don’t dig deep enough. For example, the media kept reporting that Trump’s unfavorability rating was significantly higher than Harris’. On election day, Nate Silver, who runs an influential survey site, reported that Trump’s unfavorability score was 8.6 points higher than his favorability score. For Harris, her unfavorable rating was 2.0 points higher than her favorable rating. A more important question is how the public views the candidates on their leadership abilities and their ability to get things done. A month before the election, Gallup found that when it comes to who is a strong and decisive leader, Trump outscored Harris 59 percent to 48 percent. On their ability to get things done, Trump won 61-49. Exit polls on election day found that his numbers increased significantly on related measures. In other words, an election is not a popularity contest. It is about issues and who is the most likely to govern effectively. Billy Martin, who coached the New York Yankees, was hard to deal with. Bobby Knight, who coached the University of Indiana basketball team, could be obnoxious. Bill Belichick, who coached the New England Patriots, was surly. Unlikeable though they were, they were also great leaders who knew how to win. Ergo, while Trump’s persona may strike many as offensive, few question his ability to get things done, and that is what counts in the end. Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats in October that Harris was not getting her message out. This misses the point. She had no message. That was her problem. Being against Trump is not a message—it’s a feeling: it doesn’t tell voters what policies you want to implement. Admittedly, she was put in a delicate position. Joe Biden dropped out after the debate in June because the media could no longer pretend that he wasn’t mentally challenged. They covered up for him for years, but could do so no longer. Harris never faced a challenger—she was anointed—and proved incapable of separating herself from his policies. More than anything else, it was the politics of extremism that did her in. Flooding the economy with funny money drove prices sky high Allowing millions of migrants to crash our borders and then be rewarded with better services from the government than are afforded homeless veterans angered millions Playing catch and release with violent criminals was indefensible Forgiving student loans for the middle and upper classes while making the working class pay for them was infuriating Promoting policies that allow children to change their sex behind their parents’ back was mindboggling Allowing boys to compete against girls in sports and shower with them was morally bankrupt Allowing the FBI to spy on Catholics was malicious Inviting foreign aggression was irresponsible These policies did Harris in. For the most part, the American people do not want extremists on the right or the left in office. Thank God for that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLGNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-11-08T09:04:02-08:00	
Overpopulated India Leading To Social Tension And Unrest – OpEd	Chief minister of Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has triggered widespread concern with his recent statement that families should have more children than at present. The Chief Minister of Indian state of Tamil Nadu has also said that each family should have sixteen children. Such views of two chief minsters have shocked the discerning people in India and as a matter of fact, several people think that these are careless and thoughtless remarks. It is well recognized that India is now a over populated country with one of the highest population density amongst all countries in the world. The views of the two chief ministers go completely against the national consensus on two child norm. It is extremely difficult to understand why such statements were made by these two chief ministers, who ought to know better. India's alarming population growth & likely scenario in future The Indian population which was around 35.9 crore in 1950 have now surged to around 144 crore in 2024. Population is likely to increase at not less than 0.8 % per annum, if the present trend were to continue , particularly since population is still increasing and also that average life span pf people is increasing and longevity is now around 65 years, which has much improved compared to earlier period. Indian population is likely to touch more than 170 crore people by the year 2050. India's population density India's population density has steadily increased over the years from 428.19 people per square kilometre in 2021` to 438.58 people per square kilometre in 2024. India has one of the highest population density in the world amongst all countries. Growth in economy and job opportunities unlikely to match the population growth The Indian population level and population density has already reached an alarming level and the adverse impact is already evident. In spite of impressive growth of Indian economy and progress in industrial, agricultural and services sector particularly during the last ten years, significant section of Indian population still remain below poverty line or just above poverty line. In other words, the economic growth is unable to catch up with the population growth. With the population increasing, it is necessary to create adequate employment opportunities for people at different skill level. Any view that in tune with the future population growth, generation of large number of jobs at different level and promotion of skill amongst the people as required by the level of population can be created is an Utopian expectation. This would be particularly so, since the emphasis in the various projects that contribute to economic growth, would be on greater automation, less manpower requirement and more so in the context of recent developments such as artificial intelligence. Future technological changes would result in less manpower requirement for various tasks. Such view amount to wishful thinking and certainly not based on ground realities in India. It is easily said than done. Increasing level of population and inability to keep the people engaged by providing employment adequately is bound to cause social tension and unrest. It is said that the idle brain is the devil's workshop. So-called demographic dividend It is vaguely said that growing population would provide demographic dividend for India. This statement is incorrect and would prove to be wrong , as demographic dividend can be availed only if jobs would be made available to the population at different skill level.It is extremely difficult to get the possible demographic dividend as it is already evident now with the level of unemployment in the country. India may become large exporter of migrants The future trend in the densely populated India is likely to be that more and more people from India would be seeking jobs abroad and seek migration to other advanced countries. They would be forced to do so , due to lack of job opportunities in India with the steady growth in Indian population level and population density. It is quite likely that in the coming years , several advanced countries would feel concerned about the growing entry of migrants from India , which may disturb the demographic balance in the countries and probably create social issues and tension. Such migrants entering the advanced countries would become unwelcome people. India's population carrying capacity Factors to be considered: • Level of economic growth already achieved and growth likely to be achieved in the coming years. • Land size of India.• Availability of natural resources • Likely water scarcity.• Ability to create jobs in large number to meet the need of increasing population.• Unsustainable urban migration due to lack of job opportunities• Waste generation and consequent environmental issues. India has to strive to reduce the population density by bringing down the population level in a gradual and painless manner over the next few years. Taking a holistic view, it can be said that the optimum population for India is around one hundred crore people. If and when India were to achieve this level of one hundred crore population, India would certainly emerge as one of the most prosperous countries in the world. Strategies There is a need for the strong compaign, as in the last several years, the campaign to check population growth has not been conspicuous and not visibly seen. On the other hand, the country has been brain washed with the view that population growth is unlikely to be a threat, as birth rate is tapering down and fertility rate in several states in India have already reached replacement level of 2.1 and economic growth would be sustained. Common man has not been told in clear terms about the grave issues that would arise due to further increase in Indian population, which may increase by another 40 crore in the coming years before stabilizing. This would be an unbearable burden on the nation. Empowerment of women Empowerment of women and creation of awareness amongst women about the need for population control is the primary requisite. This can be done only by vigorous public campaign. Need for one child policy for some period India has to frame one child policy per family, which China implemented successfully, in spite of the fact that China's land area is much larger than that of India and China's density of population is lower than that of India. China has brought down the population growth level within acceptable limits by one child policy and is now stabilizing the population by appropriate measures. Of course, China adopted dictatorial methods, which India cannot do in view of India's highly desirable democratic structure. The only way out is that one child policy must be implemented by persuasion and by disincentivising more than one child family. Fix population sustainability index Since the extent of population growth is different in different states, population sustainability index has to be fixed for each state. This policy should fix a specific population target for each state, which is necessary for the nation at this juncture. Ban polygamy Any man marrying more than one woman should be banned by law, to curtail the population increase and to protect the dignity of women. Prognosis Central and state governments should realise that India has not time to lose and India's future stability can be ensured only by achieving affordable population level, which could be several crores less than the present level.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLBJBvza5r3Ie	2024-11-08T09:02:26-08:00	
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) And The Path To Pakistan’s Econom...	Pakistan, like many developing countries, faces numerous challenges in revitalizing its economy. However, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and an increase in exports are two powerful catalysts that can significantly contribute to the country's economic recovery. These elements are not only instrumental in revitalizing sagging economies but also in setting a nation on the path to sustained economic development. The inflow of FDI signals investor confidence in the revival of Pakistan's economy, while boosting exports generates foreign exchange to finance essential imports and promotes industrial development, leading to job creation. FDI is one of the most effective ways to rejuvenate an economy, particularly in countries like Pakistan, which are grappling with financial instability and limited resources. The arrival of foreign investment not only provides capital but also helps improve technological infrastructure, fosters innovation, and creates jobs through projects initiated by foreign investors. Importantly, it sends a positive message to the global market about the country’s economic potential, encouraging other international investors to consider the local market. Pakistan has witnessed increasing foreign investment from key players in the Middle East and Asia. Countries like China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have committed to injecting capital into various sectors of Pakistan's economy. The recent visits of high-profile delegations underscore this growing confidence. In August, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Pakistan, during which 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed, emphasizing cooperation in security, education, agriculture, and the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This phase is expected to bolster connectivity and boost economic ties between the two nations. Saudi Arabia, too, has pledged significant investment in Pakistan. A Saudi delegation led by Investment Minister Khalid Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Falih visited Pakistan recently, committing to a $2.8 billion investment. This is an increase from the original $2.2 billion pledged during the previous visit. This is in addition to the $5 billion commitment made by Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz during a past visit. The UAE also recently announced a $10 billion investment in Pakistan, while Qatar committed to investing $3 billion. These pledges were made through the platform of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which aims to streamline and expedite foreign investments in Pakistan. Azerbaijan, too, is contributing to the cause, with a $2 billion investment commitment. These developments are significant indicators of the global community's confidence in Pakistan's economic future, given that these investments are contingent upon sustained economic recovery and growth. Alongside FDI, an increase in exports plays a vital role in revitalizing Pakistan’s economy. Exports generate the much-needed foreign exchange to support the import of vital goods, such as oil, machinery, and raw materials for industrial production. Moreover, as exports grow, so does the country’s industrial sector, which in turn enhances job opportunities and stimulates economic activity. Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) highlights a positive trend in exports. In the first quarter of the year, Pakistan’s exports reached $7.495 billion, marking a 7.82% increase compared to the same period last year. The textile and footwear sectors have shown particular growth, with footwear exports rising to $45.136 million in the first quarter, compared to $41.192 million in the same period last year. This increase in exports not only boosts the economy but also enhances Pakistan’s trade relations with other countries, further diversifying its economic partners. Pakistan’s bilateral trade with Uzbekistan also underscores the growing export potential. In 2023, Pakistan and Uzbekistan signed a $1 billion deal to increase trade between the two nations, with plans for further discussions to maximize the benefits of this agreement. Such collaborations are critical for Pakistan, as they open up new avenues for trade and help reduce the country’s dependency on traditional export markets. The impact of the government’s economic policies is also evident in the industrial sector. Major projects in sectors like power generation, mining, and electric vehicles (EV) are gaining momentum, providing a glimpse of a promising industrial future for Pakistan. Hub Power Company Ltd, Pakistan's largest independent power producer, is expanding into lithium mining, battery manufacturing, and electric vehicle production under the SIFC. This move will cater to the growing global demand for rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones, laptops, and automobiles, thus positioning Pakistan as a key player in the emerging EV industry. Additionally, the government is developing a 15,000-acre industrial park on Pakistan Steel Mills land as part of a broader strategy to establish nine special economic zones under CPEC. These zones are expected to attract foreign investment and contribute to Pakistan’s industrial growth by providing infrastructure and facilitating production in key sectors. The economic recovery in Pakistan is not just a product of foreign investments and export growth but also of positive macroeconomic indicators. Inflation has dropped below 7%, and interest rates are on a downward trajectory, with the State Bank of Pakistan reducing the policy rate from 17.7% to 15%. Foreign exchange reserves have crossed the $10 billion mark, and remittances have shown an encouraging rise. The stock market is also performing well, with the KSE 100 Index surpassing the 91,000 mark for the first time. International financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF have also expressed optimism about Pakistan’s economic prospects. The World Bank expects Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 2.8% in FY25, while the IMF has acknowledged the country’s improved policymaking, noting that inflation has reached its lowest level in three years, and international reserves have more than doubled. However, the path to sustained economic growth is contingent upon political stability. While economic recovery is underway, political uncertainty remains a threat. The opposition party, PTI, has been actively creating disruptions and undermining the government’s efforts, which could derail the economic recovery. Political stability is critical to maintaining investor confidence, and any disruption could negatively impact the growth momentum. Foreign Direct Investment and an increase in exports are two crucial pillars that can help Pakistan overcome its economic challenges. The commitment of key countries like China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar to invest in Pakistan reflects growing international confidence in the country’s economic revival. Furthermore, the rise in exports and positive industrial developments signal a hopeful future. However, political stability is essential to ensuring these gains are sustained and that Pakistan remains on a path toward sustained economic development. Political parties, particularly PTI, must recognize the importance of unity and work together to promote the country’s interests above political rivalry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfu6mFSNniVz8	2024-11-08T09:00:12-08:00	
Evaluating The Security Impact Of Pakistan’s Taliban Outreach Pol...	Imran Khan’s long-standing support for dialogue with the Taliban and similar factions has had considerable implications for Pakistan’s security. Initially, Khan’s advocacy for peace negotiations with groups such as the TTP was seen as a bold move to curtail violence in Pakistan. However, as terrorist attacks rise across the country, critics argue that his policies have inadvertently emboldened these factions, risking the safety of Pakistani citizens and challenging the state’s ability to control extremist activities. Khan’s Stance on the Taliban Since his days as an opposition leader, Imran Khan has called for a reconciliatory approach toward the Taliban, emphasizing that dialogue over military action could address the grievances fueling their activities. He has, on multiple occasions, publicly sympathized with the Taliban’s anti-Western rhetoric, earning him the moniker 'Taliban Khan' in some circles. Khan contended that peace could be achieved through understanding rather than confrontation, a perspective that, while appealing to some, overlooked the deep-seated ideological motives driving groups like the TTP. Policy Shortcomings and the Surge in Attacks Following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan has experienced an upsurge in attacks. Statistics indicate that militant activities have nearly doubled since the U.S. withdrawal, with the TTP and other groups feeling emboldened by Khan’s overtures. Security experts argue that Khan’s approach has fostered a perception of Pakistan as willing to compromise with extremists, thereby diminishing the deterrent effect that a firm counter-terrorism stance would provide. This pattern suggests a crucial oversight in Khan’s approach: by extending a hand of reconciliation without stringent conditions, he inadvertently allowed extremist factions to regroup and strengthen. The TTP, for instance, capitalized on the peace negotiations to consolidate its networks, increasing its operational capacity and resources. As a result, Pakistani citizens are now facing one of the worst waves of terrorism in recent history, with attacks targeting public spaces, government offices, and border areas alike. Implications for Regional and International Relations The repercussions of Khan’s policies are felt beyond Pakistan’s borders. Countries in the region, particularly Afghanistan, India, and Iran, have voiced concerns about the spillover effects of Pakistan’s leniency toward extremist factions. The recent statements by the Taliban, urging Pakistan to engage in dialogue with Imran Khan’s supporters, reflect an uneasy dynamic. They raise questions about Pakistan’s autonomy in decision-making and its influence over cross-border militancy. From an international standpoint, Khan’s reconciliation policies could have broader diplomatic implications. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has maintained pressure on Pakistan to strengthen its counter-terrorism financing frameworks, and any perceived leniency risks further scrutiny. International actors expect Pakistan to demonstrate a clear stance against extremism, and policies that suggest otherwise can harm Pakistan’s economic and diplomatic ties. Public Disillusionment and Calls for Change The public response within Pakistan has been mixed but increasingly critical. Many Pakistanis question the wisdom of accommodating groups responsible for years of violence and instability. Families affected by terrorist violence, as well as members of the security forces, have voiced their disapproval of any policy that appears to grant legitimacy to these groups. This growing disillusionment poses political risks for Khan and his party, as citizens become frustrated with a security approach that appears to prioritize appeasement over safety. Historical Context and Lessons Pakistan’s previous peace deals with militant groups reveal a troubling pattern. In past agreements, such as those in Swat and Waziristan, extremists exploited the periods of ceasefire to bolster their ranks and resources. Instead of leading to sustainable peace, these deals often resulted in a renewed surge of violence once the factions had regained strength. Khan’s policies, which echo this strategy of reconciliation, appear to be repeating these mistakes, as militant groups use negotiations as a cover to advance their agendas. Conclusion Imran Khan’s outreach policies toward the Taliban and TTP, while grounded in a desire for peace, have ultimately weakened Pakistan’s security framework. The country now faces an increased threat of terrorism, amplified by factions that see Khan’s policies as an invitation to escalate their activities. Moving forward, Pakistan needs a more stringent approach that unequivocally opposes terrorism. Only through a consistent and uncompromising counter-terrorism strategy can Pakistan hope to safeguard its citizens and restore public confidence in its security apparatus.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfrP2pTsu94SY	2024-11-08T08:58:38-08:00	
Fantasies Of Free Market Under Capitalism – OpEd	The concept of the 'free market' under capitalism is often promoted as an emblem of individual consumer choice and a driver of national economic growth and development. The priests of capitalism view the free market as the most effective and efficient mechanism for resource allocation, framing it as a key engine of economic progress. However, in practice, the free market is neither free nor fair for producers and consumers. Instead, it is largely controlled by capitalist interests. This idealised notion of a free market under capitalism becomes a mechanism that separates producers from consumers, establishing independent pricing structures designed to generate super-profits—often at the expense of working people. In a capitalist system, 'free market' implies that the state, government, and working masses—as both producers and consumers—cannot interfere in the market’s operations. Instead, market forces alone control prices, production, supply, demand, distribution, and consumption. Within this framework, the purchasing power of consumers and the productive capacities of producers determine individuals' perceived worth. Price, rather than intrinsic value, dictates everything in a free market. As a result, it is often fictitious desires, rather than genuine human needs, that shape the culture of the capitalist free market. The belief in the free market as an ideal under capitalism, championed by the Chicago School, has not only distorted economics as a discipline but has also eroded the social and moral foundations of the market once based on trust between consumers and producers regarding price, quality, and value. Capitalism’s version of free market undermines this trust, rendering market interactions impersonal, where consumers and producers are unknown to each other. Furthermore, neither symmetric nor asymmetric information is adequately accessible to producers and consumers concerning demand, supply, and pricing. As a result, the notion of perfect competition in the so-called free market under capitalism becomes a myth. Ultimately, it is the arbitrary nature of this free market that defines the system. Governments provide both legal protection and security for the so-called free market under capitalism, allowing it to operate with minimal risk. When the free-market faces crises, the state and government step in to rescue it. The rules and regulations of the free market are neither neutral nor natural; rather, they are designed to protect the interests of the capitalist classes. Market forces establish their own rules to maintain dominance over economic activities, backed by the approval of the state and government. Thus, there is no inherent virtue in an unfettered 'free market'; it is a capitalist project and a tool of exploitation of consumers and producers, legitimised by state and government. The free market serves as a tool for transferring resources and wealth from the masses to a small, capitalist elite. It functions as a system for profit accumulation, aimed at expanding capitalism and benefiting capitalists. Today, the fundamentalist belief in the free market and its absolutist nature act like an opiate for policymakers, driven either by ignorance or a conscious choice to overlook the market's history, social origins, and moral foundations. The capitalist voices like George Soros describe the free market as a system in which 'the doctrine of laissez-faire capitalism holds that the common good is best served by the uninhibited pursuit of self-interest.' In reality, however, there is little common ground between capitalists and the working masses, who are both producers and consumers. The free market does not offer genuine economic freedom to consumers or producers; instead, it is the antithesis of freedom and choice for both groups. It imposes control over production and consumption by manipulating the processes, institutions, and structures of the free-market economy and its culture. The free market has failed to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. As a process, a project, and an institution, it has not succeeded in delivering and distributing resources, products, and services according to genuine human needs and desires. Free market has accelerated different forms of inequalities and undermined all attempts to achieve equality. It is time to reclaim the social and moral foundations of the market, where both consumers and producers are truly free to produce and consume. Saving the free market from capitalism and its proponents is essential. Free producers and free consumers can only establish free and fair market that works based on human trust and values of human needs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfg_-DYCn0U0V	2024-11-08T08:56:52-08:00	
How A Swiss-Led Global Network Fosters Greater Access To AI – Ana...	Switzerland is spearheading a global initiative to promote equal access to artificial intelligence (AI), regardless of a country’s economic strength or political power. Three pilot projects demonstrate the power of pooled international resources to boost AI research into some of the world’s most pressing problems. By Matthew Allen AI is widely acknowledged as a breakthrough technology that can power rapid advances in many areas of scientific research, from weather predictions to medicine and energy. But there is also a danger that resource-rich countries and companies could monopolise the new generation of powerful computers. While perceived as slow to adapt national laws to govern the use of AI domestically, Switzerland has now earned praise on the international stage for promoting the sharing of AI expertise and experience worldwide. The Swiss-led initiative, called the International Computation and AI Network (ICAIN), aims to matchmake scientific projects in developing nations with the most cutting-edge supercomputers and the world’s best AI know-how to create a level playing field. 'We observe a huge power imbalance,' Katharina Frey, deputy head of digital foreign policy at the Swiss foreign ministry, told SWI swissinfo.ch. 'There are a handful of companies worldwide capable of developing large-scale models, while the majority of the world does not have access to this level of computing power.' Pushing back against inequality Besides the Swiss foreign ministry, the founding members of ICAIN also include the federal institutes of technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and Lausanne (EPFL), the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems, Data Science Africa, plus supercomputer centres in Switzerland and Finland. 'It is important that ICAIN is pushing back against inequality of access to AI,' said Ciira Maina, chair of Data Science Africa. 'Big tech is in itself not a bad thing – we all use the products. But it’s important to have a varied ecosystem in place.' Launched in January, ICAIN supports two science projects in Africa and an AI initiative with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Each project is granted access to supercomputers and leading academic AI experts. The ICAIN network closely follows a United Nations call for equal access to AI. In a September report, the UN singled out ICAIN as an example of how global resource-sharing AI networks can promote sustainability goals. 'Advanced economies have both the capability and duty to facilitate AI capacity-building through international collaboration,' the report reads. In the context of ICAIN, what are the practical implications of this? According to Maina, who’s also a professor of electrical engineering and data science at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Kenya, international collaboration can boost African research into weather predictions and identifying crop diseases. 'Bringing on board more computing power is an exciting new ingredient because it means we can do this research on a larger scale,' said Maina. 'ICAIN has unlocked high-quality expertise and access to high-level computers.' Protecting sensitive data AI is able to crunch more data in machines that can be trained to 'think' for themselves, learning as they go along. This leads to a higher rate of computation and a greater variety of solutions to problems. This computational bounty could also prove beneficial to the humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC. The ICRC relies on vast amounts of case files and field notes obtained from their workers on the ground, supplemented by data from satellites, for example. The ICRC hopes that Large Language Models – AI systems trained to understand and interpret large volumes of data – can make better sense of the continuous flow of ever-changing data that derives from chaotic situations, allowing it to better plan and mobilise operations. 'We see how AI is reshaping warfare and the direct impact this has on civilians in conflict zones,' said Blaise Robert, who advises the humanitarian organisation on AI. 'AI also presents important potential to improve the way we deliver humanitarian aid.' Swiss initiative It is also important to the ICRC that ICAIN allows it to retain complete control over sensitive data. 'Retaining the trust of the people we talk with in sensitive situations depends on our capacity to maintain the confidentiality of that dialogue,' said Robert. 'It’s very important that the ICRC keeps very tight control of its data. We need to be certain we are not dependent on certain actors who could later bring negative operational consequences.' Maina from Data Science Africa praised Switzerland for taking the initiative to get ICAIN off the ground. 'Many people have been talking about the AI inequality problem, but sometimes it takes leadership to bring the right people together in the same room to solve problems collaboratively,' he said. 'We have started with a seed that can hopefully fuel more global interaction and bring new partners on board.' Switzerland may have initiated ICAIN, but the Swiss foreign ministry says it has no desire to control its operations and continued growth into other regions of the world. The plan is to create an independent legal entity in Switzerland that will manage the matchmaking between scientific projects and AI resources. Sustainability and justice Details of the association are yet to be released but the idea is to free the body from any suggestion of political interference by countries. 'We absolutely need initiatives that aim to create alternatives to the current political economy behind AI, which is dominated by a handful of enormously big global companies,' Angela Müller, head of policy at the NGO Algorithm Watch Switzerland, told SWI swissinfo.ch. 'ICAIN should not limit itself to focusing on how we can use more and more AI to promote sustainability or justice, but also on how we can make AI itself more sustainable and just,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWco__jhnAERvcgjojmG4DSc	2024-11-07T16:50:14-08:00	
Fighting The Rat Menace In Cities: The NYC Experiment – Analysis	By Ramanath Jha Recently, New York City’s (NYC) proposed experiment with rodent contraceptives to combat rats became global news. The step was labelled by the city mayor as a 'new paradigm in urban rat management.' The city council recently approved the deployment of ContraPest, a type of rodent birth control tool, to be tested in limited areas of the city. Its developer, US biotechnology company SenesTech, claims that it provides a humane and sustainable choice for long-term rodent management. Based on the success of the city’s trial, a new approach might be taken to deal with NYC’s about 3 million rats. If successful, this experiment could mark a departure from traditional methods of rodent control. Rats have been known to co-exist with humans in cities for centuries. They have also been a nuisance in cities all over the world. They are a risk to human health and a danger to built structures, electrical cables, and parked cars. They could result in a major loss of food grains stored inside granaries. The World Health Organization (WHO) for instance, estimated that rat control measures in Mumbai alone could save enough food to feed 90,000 people annually. Studies conducted in India indicate that 2.5 percent of all food grains stored in India are lost to rodents. A conservative analysis estimated that between 1930 and 2022, rats caused a loss of US$ 3.6 billion to the world’s economy. Rats contaminate food and animal feed, introducing unwelcome parasites such as fleas, lice and ticks into the human habitat. They can cause allergies, rat bite fever, scrub typhus, leishmania and plague. At times, their activities could lead to salmonellosis (food poisoning). The COVID-19 pandemic, forced rats to discover new food sources. Rodentologists estimate that hundreds of thousands of rats were killed during the pandemic. But as businesses and eateries have become operational and returned, the resilient rats have rebounded, and their population has grown in cities across the globe. Furthermore, climate change, which brought longer periods of warm weather, has given them more time for breeding. Dealing with rats has not been easy. They are tenacious, highly adaptable, and prolific breeders. NYC has tried various methods in the past to tackle the menace. In 2023, the city council passed a new law that required contractors of construction projects to shoulder rat extermination costs. The law emphasised prevention over reaction and laid down strategies for rat control, which included conducting regular inspections, identifying potential rat entry points (gaps in walls or floors) and sealing them, discovering signs of infestation early and eliminating them, adequately storing garbage and ensuring its safe disposal. Additionally, NYC has altered the trash take-out times for businesses and residents to prevent garbage from staying out too long on the streets, allowing rats to fester. The city now requires food-related businesses to dispose of their waste in secure containers instead of trash bags. To incentivise households, NYC also decided to replace the residents’ trash bins with larger cans at the cost of US$ 3.4 million. Rats in Indian cities Indian cities have had large rat populations for a long time and controlling rats has been an age-old responsibility of Indian Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The task has been traditionally assigned to the Pest Control Officer of the Public Health Department. Mumbai was especially vulnerable to the dangers of a plague on account of it being a port city. The city’s infamous plague attack at the end of the 19th century killed 200,000 people. During the plague threat of 1994, Mumbai used the plague vaccine prepared by the Municipal Rat Destruction Unit at the Haffkine Institute to bring the epidemic under control. Wards of the city were divided into ‘rat labour boundaries,’ assigned to beat officers for inspection and prevention. The most common methods for rat destruction were physical and chemical. Additionally, night rat killing was a unique method of rat control that was exclusively used in Mumbai. Delhi, too, has a massive rat population, mainly residing underground, adroitly finding shelter in sewerage networks, water pipes, fibre optic and gas pipelines. Delhi’s rats have thus been able to develop a complex underground network of rat colonies. Kolkata has also been battling rats which have been found to tunnel through the concrete foundations of flyovers and nibble away at vital underground sewage and cable lines. They have been seen in slums, eateries and historical colonial buildings. Kolkata Municipal Corporation has been seeking advice from other ULBs and exploring measures to combat the growing rat population. In Patna, rats were found to have burrowed under the railway platform causing its collapse. The library of Patna University was at one point closed to deal with rats that had taken over a section of the book shelves. Although some cities around the world have claimed to have successfully controlled rodent growth, in most places, rats have managed to survive and continue to operate as usual. Rat control complexities Over the years, different rodent management measures have come into use. Trapping rats has been one of the earliest used methods. Use of rodenticide has also been common. However, rats are known to develop a resistance to them. The use of rat poison has not been favoured by experts since it often ends up bio-accumulating in the food chain. Encapsulated bait formulations have been observed to have reasonable success. These, however, run the danger of risk to non-target. Chemical control, according to rodentologists, is the most effective known method for rodent management in urban conditions. However, even this has had limited effectiveness. Even though city rats are widely prevalent and pose a huge threat to city infrastructure as well as the health of citizens, they are among the least studied wildlife in urban environments. As a consequence, very little is known about their ecology. This disinterest in rodent research exists despite the broad concession that traditional methods of rat control in the urban landscape have not produced the desired results. The ongoing speed of human urbanisation, compounded by the effects of climate change, is leading to a proliferation of rat-related risks. Further, urbanisation in countries like India, along with heavy densification of its cities will inexorably lead to conditions that will substantially support the multiplication of rats. Studying urban rats has also been fraught with difficulties because rats inhabit spaces owned by both public and private entities, which poses problems with entry and a hindrance to the prolonged observation of rat behaviour. A suitable urban rat research site, that is a mix of public spaces, commercial and business sites, as well as residential areas, which can allow for a comprehensive study over a long enough period to generate robust science, is difficult to obtain. This problem is directly attributable to some notable knowledge gaps that continue to accrue in the rat ecological literature. However, there have been recent successes achieved in fertility control studies through immuno-contraceptives. What is now required is testing their effectiveness in a live situation. Here, NYC has taken the lead by designating city areas where contraceptive delivery will take place. This step towards rodent control could prove invaluable in the cities’ fight against rats. If this experimentation is successful, it may open up a new methodology that can provide an effective mechanism for rodent control globally.

Material World: How Europe Can Compete With China In Race For Afr...	By Sarah Logan Critical juncture Despite heightened focus in the West about dependence on China – and high-level efforts to recalibrate these relations at the strategic level – Europeans’ economic reliance on China has continued to grow in recent years. EU imports from China reached €515.9 billion in 2023, across a wide array of products, many of which are vital to advanced economies. At the heart of these entangled relations is European states’ and economies’ dependence on China for the critical raw materials (CRMs) needed to produce green energy technologies, including solar modules, electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and permanent magnets for wind turbines. The central importance of these technologies today risks leaving Europe heavily reliant on other countries for their supply – an acute challenge when production is highly concentrated in China as strategic competition intensifies between China and the West. To respond to this situation, the European Union has vowed to diversify its energy sources and build out CRM supply chains and processing capabilities that are unconnected with China (ex-China). The bloc has introduced an array of policies aimed at achieving this. 'De-risking' supply chains is the way the EU terms its efforts to reduce its economic reliance on China. This de-risking approach encompasses the green energy technologies critical for the EU’s decarbonisation and energy security, as well as a range of other technologies, including in the military field. Managing European exposure to China in different domains is vital not only for Europe’s energy security, but also for the EU to retain and enhance its geopolitical and geoeconomic strength in a rapidly changing world. In its quest to access ex-China CRMs, the EU has turned to resource-rich African countries it regards as politically friendly. In the last two years, it has signed strategic partnerships to develop sustainable CRM value chains with several African countries, and it is supporting the development of an economic corridor in southern Africa. The EU hopes such agreements will unlock opportunities for European participation in CRM supply chains in these African countries. Despite these ambitious policies and the strategic partnerships signed to date, Europeans are struggling to overcome market forces to break their dependence on China. Other players, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, are also entering CRM mining and processing and are focusing on Africa in particular. Time is fast running out for Europe to win access to the CRMs it needs. The sluggish progress indicates a wide gap between ambitions and reality, especially regarding CRM projects in Africa. It is essential that Europeans understand this disconnect and consider how to address it. This policy brief aims to support this understanding and propose solutions. It begins by situating EU efforts within the evolving global CRM landscape. The paper examines the EU-Namibia strategic partnership on sustainable CRM value chains in order to show what it will take to increase European participation in ex-China CRM supply chains in African countries. This agreement illustrates the ways in which political factors may have influenced the EU’s selection of third country partners more than the commercial reality of a country’s CRM opportunities. At the same time, market dynamics and commercial viability challenges continue to deter European private sector involvement in CRMs in Africa. The paper suggests ways Europeans can begin to turn this state of affairs around. Most urgent is the need to innovate with new financial mechanisms offered by the EU and member state governments, which have so far failed to motivate European companies to enter CRM supply chains in African countries. If the EU is to succeed in its stated mission, it will need to provide greater financial support to better align European private sector interests with the bloc’s own energy security and de-risking objectives. This will come at a cost. But it is the price it must pay if the EU is to reduce its dependence on China and others. The global race for CRMs The EU has introduced a number of key policies to reduce its supply chain dependence on China. These include the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), which aims to secure a sustainable supply of CRMs for European industry and remove import dependencies on any single country. The Net-Zero Industry Act seeks to enhance the capabilities and competitiveness of European manufacturing of net zero technologies. The EU has also joined the Minerals Security Partnership, a group of countries (excluding China) that seeks to develop diverse and sustainable CRM supply chains. Additionally, the EU launched the Global Gateway initiative, which aims to mobilise €300 billion between 2021 and 2027 to boost European investments in energy, transport, and digital infrastructure in countries across the world. The Global Gateway is of particular importance to the EU’s engagement with African countries, given its explicit focus on external partners. The EU hopes the initiative will enhance the relationship between the two continents. Africa has emerged as a key battleground in the scramble for access to CRMs. The continent possesses around one-third of the world’s mineral resources, including significant deposits of cobalt, copper, lithium, graphite, and a range of rare earth elements. CRMs are vital for the production of a wide range of technologies, including green energy technologies such as solar modules, EV batteries, and permanent magnets. Military uses include beryllium needed for fighter jets and targeting and surveillance systems, and semi-conductors, which are critical to missile guidance systems and encryption technology. As the world decarbonises and increasingly switches to green energy, demand for these minerals is set to soar. The production of some of these minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, and graphite, will need to rise by up to 500 per cent by 2050. This feat cannot be achieved without the supply of Africa’s CRMs. In pursuit of its goals, the EU signed strategic partnerships with Namibia in November 2022, the DRC and Zambia in October 2023, and Rwanda in February 2024. It is also party to the multi-stakeholder agreement for developing the Lobito Corridor, a railway and economic corridor joining Zambia, the DRC, and Angola, which is a logistics route enabling access to the CRMs of these African countries. Despite the EU’s ambitious policies and strategic partnerships, European companies have been hesitant to venture into CRM supply chains in these African countries. In fact, since the advent of de-risking as an approach, little has actually materialised by way of projects. This points to a major disconnect between the EU’s geopolitical and geoeconomic agenda and the interests of the European private sector. This is a key challenge given that the EU is extremely dependent on European companies to deliver on its de-risking goals. As EU efforts falter, other geopolitical powers are working to obtain African mineral resources in pursuit of their economic and energy security. For example, Emirati companies have recently purchased stakes in a number of mines in Zambia and the DRC. Turkey is making inroads into African mining, including in Sudan and Niger. Recently, India has also initiated discussions with some African countries around CRM mining opportunities, with exploration activities planned in Zambia. Even like-minded allies are geoeconomic competitors for Europe in this area, also aiming to build out their own CRM supply chains. Notably, the United States is drawing some investment away from European manufacturing in solar and EV supply chains, for example, through the attractive subsidies offered under its Inflation Reduction Act, which comprise an estimated 20 to 40 per cent of unsubsidised costs for solar modules and a $7,500 tax credit for EV batteries. This financial support has persuaded manufacturers to locate themselves in the US rather than in Europe, taking production capacity, job opportunities, and CRM supply chains with them. How China’s dominance grew To work out what Europeans need to do to get ahead of their geoeconomic competitors, a deeper understanding is required of how China in particular got to where it is today. In short, China appears to have spotted the strategic importance of CRMs at least 20 years ago. It has succeeded in gradually expanding both its mining operations in Africa and processing capacity back in China. Over time, China has moved up the value chain to manufacture more sophisticated technologies. Moving in as Europeans retreat For many decades, European mining companies were leading players in African mining. However, European operations in Africa declined steeply over the last 10 to 15 years, coinciding with the end of the commodity super cycle, an extended period during which prices had remained above their long-run trend. The high commodity prices of the super cycle period were driven by demand outstripping supply – these high prices encouraged greater mining investments which, in turn, led to higher supply and eventual collapse in prices as supply overtook demand. Mining companies and their financial backers, who had extended themselves when commodity prices were high, found themselves unable to fully recoup their investments once prices dropped. Around this time, international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards also grew in importance, driven by a range of governmental, business, and civil society initiatives. European countries became signatories to many of these efforts, placing new expectations on European companies to adhere to ESG standards, including those encapsulated in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. Bringing mining operations into quick compliance with ESG standards in more undeveloped environments was not straightforward, as mining is a relatively ‘dirty’ industry and is costly to pursue in a responsible manner. To illustrate: complying with ESG standards involvessafeguarding biodiversity, lowering carbon footprints, rehabilitating land after mine closure, implementing community engagement activities (such as providing clean water and health services), and committing to responsible resource use, transparent reporting, and good governance practices, among other things. ESG compliance often increases operational costs in the short term, requiring additional resources for these efforts. This new state of affairs initially rendered European companies uncompetitive compared to others that were not similarly expected to comply with ESG standards. European public and private finance for mining also waned, with banks having little interestin the sector amid challenges around ESG compliance and after the losses occasioned by the end of the commodity super cycle. As European mining operations in Africa declined, Chinese companies were aggressively increasing their mining interests on the continent. This was facilitated in part by minerals-for-infrastructure deals under China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Unconstrained by ESG standards, Chinese mining companies enjoyed greater freedom to strike deals with African governments on accessing mineral resources. China has since grown its control in the African mining sector, particularly in valuable CRMs such as cobalt, copper, and lithium in the DRC, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Like Europe before it, China exported Africa’s resources in raw form for processing back home. This allowed it to use its cheaper electricity and labour, as well as notable state supportand more relaxed approach to ESG standards within China, to build out CRM processing capabilities at home. Within a matter of years, China began to develop economies of scale that further reduced processing costs and allowed it to refine CRMs more cheaply than anyone else. Even metals and minerals mined in the EU, such as lithium, are commonly processed in China, at a lower price, and with the risk of environmental damage removed from Europe. For a number of years, the mining and initial processing of CRMs in China suited European firms well enough – after all, these were often hazardous activities with low profit margins. European companies seized the opportunity to concentrate on higher value phases of processing and manufacture. Over time, however, China came to control 60 per cent of global CRM production and 85 per cent of processing capacity. Chinese manufacturers also started working their way up the value chain, leveraging their greater access to CRMs and lower manufacturing costs to establish a system that now poses both a supply chain risk and competition risk for Europe. China appears to have had a comprehensive strategy in the CRM sector long before others recognised the crucial importance of these products. China has decisively strengthened its hold on the manufacture of the green energy technologies that are now in high demand globally. Europe today sources 90 per cent of its solar modules from China, and European-manufactured solar modules are heavily reliant on imported components and materials from China. China achieved this through its lower production costs, as well as creating a supply glut of cheaper products that have depressed prices and undercut production elsewhere. European solar producers are unable to compete on price with Chinese manufacturers. As a result, around half of the EU’s solar production capacity is at risk of being shuttered. This is not only bad for European industry, it also threatens to further entrench Europe’s dependence on China. China similarly controls 80 per cent of the global market for battery cell production, in which it leads on cost by a substantial margin. Overcapacity in battery manufacturing in China was already three times that of domestic demand in 2023 and may rise to more than six times by 2025; oversupply has collapsed prices and severely impacted on European producers. With batteries comprising around a third of the cost of EVs, and with labour and electricity costs markedly higher in Europe, European car manufacturers cannot compete with their Chinese equivalents on cost, particularly when some Chinese firms also benefit from unfair subsidisation. Consolidation in China European efforts to reduce this reliance on Chinese CRMs and green energy technology supply chains are made more challenging by the particular market dynamics of CRMs. Understanding these market dynamics is necessary for considering Europe’s de-risking options. Importantly, the markets for CRMs are smaller than those for industrial metals, both in terms of volume and value of commodities, with some CRM markets amounting to only a few billion dollars annually. The pricing of CRM products can be opaque, with prices often agreed through confidential bilateral agreements or by vertically integrated Chinese companies that both mine and process CRMs. In some instances they may also be the buyer of the refined CRMs, while receiving some form of state support. A further complication is that a number of CRMs are by-products in the processing of other primary products, so their supply may be tied to the price of the primary product. This can increase price volatility and means that increased demand for CRMs does not necessarily lead to increased supply in the short term. Refining encompasses a complexity of different processes required for different CRMs, producing a range of refined products with varying specifications depending on potential uses and users. Many refining processes are highly carbon-intensive and can be very environmentally damaging. Crucially, processing requires a certain scale to be economically viable and not all mines – or, indeed, countries – produce CRMs in sufficient volume and of sufficient quality to make local processing economically viable. The smaller volumes of raw minerals, as well as the complexity and low profitability of refining, mean that processing often needs to be consolidated to be more viable. These dynamics helped facilitate China’s domination of CRM processing. Further processing beyond the initial refining stage is more advanced and includes the manufacture of precursor cells and other components from intermediary inputs. It requires easy access to a variety of intermediary inputs, as well as scale to be economically viable. The co-location in China of different CRM supply chains has undoubtedly facilitated the lower-cost manufacture of technologies such as solar equipment and EV batteries, enabling China to gain considerable market share. Additionally, manufacturing activities taking place in other countries still rely on China for at least some necessary components. Establishing their own access to CRMs and building out processing capabilities will be a monumental task for Europeans. Imposing dutieson Chinese EV imports into Europe will help protect some European manufacturing. But achieving further gains will require Europeans to either directly participate or otherwise invest in every step of the CRM supply chain – mining, refining, and further processing. Understanding what this would involve can help inform the design of the financial and other mechanisms needed to shift European private sector actors to (re-)enter CRM supply chains in Africa. Partnering with Namibia The EU sees Namibia as a partner with a shared commitment to enabling the global green transition. The EU and Namibia signed a strategic partnership on sustainable CRM value chains and green hydrogen two years ago. Enough time has now elapsed to assess the agreement’s impact on European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector – and, therefore, its contribution to Europe’s de-risking objectives. The conclusion is that there is some way to go. Despite the strategic partnership and some new activities, there is still no presence of EU companies in Namibia’s CRM value chains. An attractive partner Compared to other sub-Saharan African countries, Namibia offers remarkable political stability and an investment environment that is increasingly conducive to foreign investment. It has abundant land, a very small population of around 2.5 million people, and a population density of only 3.7 people per km2. Export infrastructure and skilled labour exist, although they need further development if CRM mining and processing activities in the country are to be scaled up. Additionally, it has a notably long coastline and easy access to global shipping routes. High electricity costs and scarcity of freshwater pose notable obstacles to expanding CRM mining and processing in Namibia. In 2020, electricity imports were needed to meet around 60 per cent of demandin Namibia. This high dependency on imports, together with cost-reflective tariffs and margins for regional electricity suppliers, meant that Namibia had the most expensive grid-provided electricity prices in southern Africa for commercial electricity consumers, at around 2.40 NAD (around €0.14) per kWh in 2022 (although commercial consumers using off-grid options such as diesel generators in other southern African countries undoubtedly face substantially higher electricity costs). However, Namibia has world-class solar and wind resources and, leveraging its abundant land, numerous renewable energy power projects are under way. More capacity expansion is planned and is projected to reach 230 MW of solar and 149 MW of wind by 2035. Deployment of solar plants is already lowering the cost of electricity in Namibia and will make desalination of seawater cheaper in instances where this is needed. This will help overcome the country’s current electricity and freshwater constraints. The government also intends to leverage these renewable energy resources to establish a burgeoning green hydrogen sector, which could power CRM mining and processing in the country. At a time when many other southern African countries are struggling with limited and unreliable electricity supply, Namibia is on a trajectory of making electricity both more plentiful and cheaper. Namibia is thus set to become an attractive location for green processing and manufacturing activities – including potentially in ex-China CRM value chains. Critical raw materials in Namibia While Namibia’s broader investment environment is attractive, its CRM potential is more muted, although this is evolving as more mineral exploration takes place. Namibia has a history of mining, particularly in diamonds and uranium, and produces a number of CRMs, including lithium, graphite, copper, and rare earth elements. It has some local processing capacity in copper smelting and zinc processing. Uranium is currently the only CRM for which Namibia is a notable global supplier – it is the world’s third largest producer of uranium. The country’s two most productive operational uranium mines, Rössing and Husab, are majority-owned by Chinese companies. Uranium mining in Namibia has not always been profitable, but its strategic importance for nuclear power reactors in China and China’s long-term investment policy have enabled its continued production. China’s ability to prioritise access to critical minerals over project profitability is a key factor, highlighting the limitations of Europe’s market-based approach to CRM access to date. Namibia has several existing lithium mines but, to date, the country has been a relatively small global supplier of lithium. The quality of currently mined lithium is far below the global 6 per cent standardneeded for production of battery-grade lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, thereby earning a lower price per tonne. Low lithium prices in recent years have led to the temporary closure of some of Namibia’s lithium mines. However, recent exploration activities appear to have uncovered new lithium finds of a higher ore grade, raising the likelihood of more profitable lithium mining in the country, should lithium prices recover. Namibia also has deposits of heavy rare earth metals such as dysprosium and terbium, which are used in the manufacture of permanent magnets. Namibia’s Lofdal deposit is considered to be one of the largest heavy rare earth deposits outside China. The country’s rare earth projects are largely still in the exploration or feasibilityphases. In addition to Chinese mining companies, Australian and Canadian mining companies are also active in lithium and rare earth element mining in Namibia, especially in exploration activities. But once they have identified commercially viable mineral deposits, they have often sold mining projects on to Chinese firms for development.[1] In an effort to force greater local beneficiation, in June 2023 the Namibian government banned the export of unprocessed lithium ore, rare earth elements, and other CRMs. This move follows similar measures elsewhere, including in Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Mining licences now require mining companies to undertake at least initial processing of these raw minerals locally – but it is unclear whether local processing of these minerals is either commercially viable or technically feasible. The new requirement to undertake local processing comes amid a sharp slump in prices. By September 2024, lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide prices had lost almost 90 per cent of their value since late 2022. This makes the proposition for local beneficiation of lithium particularly challenging at this time. The sharp decline in lithium prices has prompted Zimbabwe, for example, to soften its stance against requiring local processing of lithium in the current climate. It may be necessary for Namibia, too, to rethink this requirement in the short term. Similarly, prices for dysprosium and terbium have collapsed since their five-year high in early 2022 and mid-2022, respectively, with the price slump driven by oversupply within China and reduced demand for magnets amid an effort to lower production costs. Despite the current unfavourable market, a Chinese company is reportedly currently constructing a lithium refinery in the country.[2]This is a notable step for local processing in Namibia. Rather than confirming the commercial viability of local processing, however, this may merely indicate how much China is willing to pay for access to lithium. China’s ability to undertake local processing, potentially in the absence of commercial viability, furthers its own strategic goals. It also demonstrates goodwill towards the Namibian government, likely raising its political and economic leverage with them. China taking the first initiative with local lithium refining in Namibia unfortunately may also deter European companies from establishing local processing activities, as it is far from clear whether the country’s lithium production could support more than one refinery, at least in the short and medium term. Subsequent market entrants would struggle to secure lithium ore supply if the first-moving Chinese refinery has locked in supply through long-term agreements. The processing of rare earths is even more challenging. These elements are found in very low concentrations, and extraction and separation can pose serious environmental risks as radioactive residues are released, which can contaminate the air, water, and soil. Around 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste are produced for every one tonne of rare earths, necessitating extensive waste management. Specialist expertise is also needed for processing rare earths but this is relatively scarce outside China. These difficult dynamics need to be borne in mind as Namibian policymakers seek to enforce local beneficiation of rare earth elements – and must also be considered by European stakeholders as the EU pushes for greater de-risking from China. In an effort to comply with the mandate for local processing, an alliance of three rare earth mining companies from Canada and Namibia is undertaking a feasibility study to explore the viability of developing a joint separation plant in Namibia. This plant would separate rare earth elements from concentrates of mixed rare earth oxides. A collaborative effort is necessary to try to meet the significant upfront cost of plant construction and minimum critical mass of ore needed for processing operations, which exceed what each developer would be able to deliver individually. Processing rare earths in Namibia will be very challenging, and the viability of this ex-China local processing will undoubtedly also be undermined by China’s ban on the export of technologies needed for the extraction and separation of rare earth elements. The ban aims to hamstring ex-China processing and retain China’s near-total dominance of rare earth element processing. It will be a costly proposition for European companies to enter projects for local processing of lithium and rare earth elements. This reality is not sufficiently reflected in the EU’s commitments to support local value addition in CRM value chains in African countries. The unintended outcomes of European policy in Namibia The EU’s strategic partnership with Namibia was the first that the bloc signed with an African country. It was motivated by the need for Europe to diversify its energy sources, including towards renewable energy, and Europe perceiving Africa as a close neighbour with common values and interests. Regarding Namibia specifically, the EU hopes to collaborate on green hydrogen development and to gain access to CRMs in Namibia, with the view to building out European CRM supply chains. This would boost Europe’s industrial capacity and de-risk its energy system from China. In turn, Namibia aims to use its CRM resources to increase local value addition, job creation, skills development, and technology transfer, and to support industrialisation and higher domestic revenue mobilisation and foreign currency earnings. Namibia is also keen to diversify its investors and dilute its reliance on China.[3] European interest in its CRM sector would present Namibia with an opportunity to leverage competition for better deals. The scene is thus set to translate the strategic partnership into gains for both Namibia and the EU. However, while European mining companies have the capabilities to mine CRMs, none are currently active in Namibia. Nor have they shown any appetite to participate in mining operations in the country since the signing of the strategic partnership. Several factors may be dissuading them. The cost and difficulty of ESG compliance in mining activities is a barrier. [4] European finance shies away from these projects with concerns around the challenges of local processing predominating among investors amid calls for increased local beneficiation of minerals in African countries. As noted, Namibia’s ban on the export of unprocessed lithium and rare earth elements means that mining licences now require at least initial local processing of minerals. In terms of whether local processing leads to improved outcomes for the host country, evidence from previous export bans, including in Tanzania and Zambia, is not encouraging. There, the result appears to have been decreased local production of both processed and raw materials. This suggests foreign investors’ coolness towards mining operations in countries where local processing is required. If European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector is to be established in this landscape, two key elements are needed: first, the European private sector must be sufficiently commercially interested in available opportunities. The EU and its member state governments cannot themselves participate in CRM supply chains – in mining or processing or even as significant buyers of ex-China CRM products. Rather, they need the European private sector to drive these participation efforts. Second, European mining companies would need to outmanoeuvre others to secure these opportunities, notably through making a superior ‘offer’ to African governments than competitors’. The European offer would need to exceed that of China in particular. Whether European companies can be persuaded to participate in Namibia’s CRM supply chains depends on the economic attractiveness of projects. CRM supply chain opportunities are deeply location-specific in terms of their viability, which can vary depending on the size and quality of mineral deposits and the presence of enabling infrastructure, including transport infrastructure, reliable and affordable electricity, and sufficient water for mining and processing activities. A predictable and enabling regulatory environment, a workforce with the necessary skills, and easy access to global shipping routes are also key factors. Namibia is appealing across several of these factors, but the lack of extensive mineral exploration in the country and limited knowledge around the commercial viability of local processing remain barriers. They also bring into question the basis for the EU’s selection of external partners and the realism of commitments made to partner countries under the strategic partnerships. Europe’s ‘offer’ to Namibia is encapsulated in the strategic partnership itself; two commitments made in the agreement have particular relevance. First, the EU has undertaken to adhere to international ESG standards in projects in Namibia. Second, it has promised to support the establishment of local processing of CRMs. These commitments are attractive to Namibia, with the latter commitment now also reinforced by the Namibian government’s ban on the export of unprocessed lithium ore, rare earth elements, and other CRMs. The EU’s commitment to Namibia reflects its interest in the sustainable development of Namibia’s CRM supply chains – but, as noted, only companies can actually do the work that makes these commitments a reality. The EU and Namibia agreed a roadmap for implementing the strategic partnership in November 2023; it outlines an ambitious list of activities for the 2023 to 2025 period. The roadmap includes activities such as capacity building for geological surveying and undertaking a pre-feasibility study for lithium processing in Namibia. These activities are currently ongoing.[5] Most roadmap activities, including these examples, are aimed at improving the local environment for developing CRM value chains in general – which benefits all actors active in Namibia’s CRM supply chains. Given that European companies are not present in the CRM sector in Namibia, the EU’s contributions are currently improving the environment only for other actors, including China. Nevertheless, by enabling the operations of more actors, these efforts may indirectly contribute to diluting China’s control in some value chains. This may be acceptable from the EU’s perspective if supporting Namibia’s sustainable development was the purpose of the partnership. But Europe’s de-risking from China was an important objective for the EU. It is therefore a point of concern that not only are European companies not benefitting from such activities, but the EU’s efforts may in fact be indirectly undermining its own de-risking objectives by helping Chinese companies and others to strengthen their access to CRMs.[6] At the same time, the EU needs to be seen to be delivering on commitments made under the implementation roadmap in order to maintain its relationship with Namibia and preserve its credibility with other African countries. Europeans are therefore stuck in a lose-lose situation with roadmap implementation unless they can cultivate European private sector participation in Namibia’s CRM supply chain, and quickly. To address this, they must renew efforts to achieve European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector. This would ensure the strategic partnership contributes to Europe’s de-risking efforts. Namibia is an easier prospect in many ways than Zambia or the DRC, given its enabling environment and existence of ex-China CRM supply chain opportunities, such as the operation of Australian and Canadian mining companies. It is vital that the EU is able to make its strategic partnership work for European interests, or it will not bode well for efforts in other countries. The difficulty in getting traction on European investments in Namibia highlights the limits of what EU efforts can achieve without European private sector participation. It also raises the need for the EU to reconsider how it deploys its resources in furtherance of its own de-risking objectives. Specifically, resources could make more of an impact if they were targeted directly at incentivising European companies to enter CRM supply chains – rather than providing all-sector support. More focus on market economics and less traditional development policy is needed. Lining up buyers for ex-China CRMs For European participation in mining or local processing in Namibia to contribute to de-risking, it will also be necessary to keep all further processing of these CRM products outside of Chinese value chains. If products enter Chinese processing or manufacturing supply chains later, it will negate European de-risking efforts in mining and local processing phases. Achieving this starts with finding ex-China buyers for these refined CRMs. Buyers will need to satisfy at least three key criteria to ensure that supply chains remain ex-China and contribute to Europe’s de-risking objectives. Like-minded allies that the EU wishes to work with on CRM access would likely have a shared view on these criteria, potentially creating scope for cooperation. First, buyers will need to be European or from a friendly third country that will later sell components or final products manufactured with ex-China CRMs to Europe, thereby enabling Europe to diversify its supply chains. This would need to be stipulated in contracts, with necessary conditions passed on to every actor in the supply chain until products reach Europe – although this is a complex and difficult arrangement to enforce in practice. Second, buyers will need to be willing to pay a premium for the ESG-compliant, ex-China CRMs refined in Namibia. These products will be more expensive than their Chinese equivalents, due to smaller economies of scale and higher production costs, at least in the short term. Third, buyers must be willing to purchase refined CRMs and undertake further processing of these products into intermediary inputs and components themselves, rather than sourcing already-processed components and final products from China. This requires European companies to build out CRM processing capacity along the supply chain. Finding buyers that meet these criteria will be very challenging. For example, there is currently only one facility in the EU capable of separating rare earths for magnet production, with a second plantpotentially being operational by 2025. European buyers are also not yet willing to pay a premium for ESG-compliant, ex-China CRMs, as much as they may like the idea of responsible sourcing.[7] Price still matters more to European buyers than where CRM products come from, although many European customers are increasingly concerned about the vulnerabilities created by their high reliance on China and are actively looking for alternative suppliers. Policy instruments can be used to help shift European procurement away from China’s supply chains to an extent, such as application of import charges under the carbon border adjustment mechanism or duties on EVs imported from China. Nevertheless, there are limits to what costs European buyers can be expected to absorb where price differentials between Chinese and ex-China products are high. Additionally, European companies have situated themselves at the higher end of the value chain. They need to buy components rather than lithium carbonate, for example, for their manufacturing operations. Little incentive exists for European companies to move to lower rungs of the value chain when cheaper, already-manufactured components and products from China are available. For European companies to build out processing capacity in parallel to China will be costly and will take time – posing a challenge to urgent decarbonisation demands. Underlying these challenges is the further threat that, in an effort to reinforce its CRM supply chain dominance and strengthen its geoeconomic position, China may use its supply chain domination as a tool of retaliation. It could ban the export of CRM products to certain countries, or it could intentionally trigger a supply glut of any CRM product at any time in order to depress global prices and collapse the profitability of ex-China operations. The global impact of a supply glut is already seen with the ongoing collapse in lithium and rare earth prices. Western geoeconomic measures towards China may be met with retaliation that could send European companies active in ex-China CRM supply chains into financial distress or bankruptcy. Given these challenges, it is evident that financial mechanisms are needed to improve the commercial viability of ex-China CRM opportunities and to persuade European companies to participate in ex-China CRM supply chains. What Europeans should do Improve support mechanisms for European companies The EU has introduced various policies and initiatives with the goal of supporting European companies operating in CRM supply chains, including in projects located outside the EU in friendly third countries. To access benefits, projects generally need to be attributed with Strategic Project status. Under the CRMA, for example, applicants for Strategic Project status must submit to the European Commission a range of supporting evidence to demonstrate that the project will strengthen the EU’s supply of CRMs, is technically feasible, will comply with ESG standards, and will undertake local value addition if in a third country. They must share a business plan that shows, among other things, the financial viability of the project, including secured funding and offtake agreements. Applications must be submitted for consideration ahead of board meetings, which may be held quarterly or biannually. Projects given Strategic Project status can receive assistance from the CRM Board to identify potential funding sources, including private investors, the European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, international finance institutions, and programmes and initiatives of member states and the EU (including the Global Gateway). The CRMA does not itself make new funding sources available, so financing options are limited to what other sources of funding can offer. The act also promises to facilitate offtake agreements, with the European Commission undertaking to establish a bidding process that could match buyers and sellers of CRM products based on the volume and quality of CRMs being sought or sold, intended price at which to buy or sell, and desired duration of the offtake agreement. Most of these mechanisms are very recent and their impact on incentivising European participation in CRM supply chains in Africa is yet to be seen. Indeed, the first application round for Strategic Project status under the CRMA closed in August 2024, with 170 applicationssubmitted. It is not yet known whether any of these applications pertain to possible CRM projects in Namibia or the other African countries with which the EU has signed strategic partnerships. Some challenges are, however, apparent. For example, CRMA Strategic Projects can only receive advice on potential funding sources and the proposed bidding process for CRM offtake can only attempt to match buyers and sellers. This makes receiving financing and offtake facilitation potentially both uncertain and not very time sensitive. This will be a challenge for European companies looking to take quick advantage of an emerging opportunity, particularly when competitors are able to move faster. Projects must also be at a sufficiently mature stage, requiring them to have progressed to that point in the absence of Strategic Project benefits. This excludes projects that could have reached viability if financial support from the EU had been available at an earlier stage. Additionally, the European Commission’s efforts to match buyers and sellers of CRM products will be complicated by the non-standardisation of these products, as CRMs must be refined to particular buyer specifications and few companies purchase the same kinds of raw materials. CRM products do not lend themselves to bulk procurement, creating a very different scenario to, for example, development of joint procurement platforms for green hydrogen or natural gas, which are homogeneous products. The EU pinned much hope on its strategic partnerships with African countries increasing its access to CRMs. Yet the lack of European private sector participation means this is access is failing to materialise. Will the CRMA Strategic Projects approach be more effective? This will depend on whether the benefits extended to these projects succeed in aligning private sector interests with the EU’s ambitions. This seems unlikely in the current market circumstances. Incentivise the private sector The level of financing required for European companies to get in front of competitors in CRM mining and processing in Africa far exceeds the funding the EU and other European partners have made available to date. While other powers are speeding ahead, leveraging significant available resources to aggressively pursue opportunities, the cost of catching up is growing for Europe. In addition to those already adopted, the EU will need to devise the following forms of support. First, European companies participating in either mining or local processing need some form of price protection. This could be provided by European public financial institutions extending guarantees to producers to establish a minimum price (floor) and maximum price (ceiling) for ex-China products. This would remove some price volatility – on the upside as well as the downside – protecting producers against price drops by China while facilitating more long-term offtake agreements made possible by greater price certainty. Second, greater deployment of political risk insurance is needed to support European companies entering more difficult contexts. This would protect companies against the risks arising from arbitrary actions by the host government, including expropriation, confiscation, and selective discrimination. Such risks are comparatively high in the mining sector. The European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are able to provide political risk insurance, as are several European development finance institutions. More extensive use of these facilities is needed, with the institutions providing these products scaling up resources dedicated to them. Third, measures to reduce Europe’s electricity costs will be vital to enable greater processing capacity to be developed in Europe. European electricity costs are currently two to three times higher than those in the US and China, which poses a significant barrier to expanding processing capabilities in Europe. Reducing electricity costs in Europe will take concerted efforts from a number of actors, including private sector investments in renewable energy supported by incentives from the EU and member state governments. Finally, the EU and member state institutions will need to develop better consultation platforms with the European private sector to understand their concerns about entering CRM supply chains in Africa, what they could be incentivised to do, and what support it would take. This understanding should inform the nature of the support extended to European companies active in CRM supply chains in Africa, thereby ensuring that de-risking initiatives are more effective. Geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions cannot wish away market dynamics and the need for the commercial viability of projects. However, well designed policies that target clear interventions can help overcome these factors. Turning the needle on CRM project viability in Africa is essential if European companies are to pursue these opportunities. This will come down to the nature and scale of support extended to European companies. It will undoubtedly be costly to develop incentives that can motivate European companies to enter CRM supply chains in Africa and deploy them at some degree of scale. But Europeans cannot afford not to act if they are to address this vital aspect of de-risking. Not only is their energy security at stake, but so is the EU’s future political, economic, and military strength.

US Drought Conditions Reduce Hydropower Generation, Particularly ...	In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we forecast that electricity generation from U.S. hydropower plants in 2024 will be 13% less than the 10-year average, the least amount of electricity generated from hydropower since 2001. Extreme and exceptional drought conditions have been affecting different parts of the United States, especially the Pacific Northwest, which is home to most U.S. hydropower capacity. As of the end of September, 72.6% of the continental United States was experiencing dryer-than-normal to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. By the end of October, this value increased to 87.2%. Multiple regions are affected by drought conditions, but the effects on hydropower generation are more obvious in the Pacific Northwest. For example, a recent study conducted by the University of Alabama found that hydropower generation in Washington state is one of the most susceptible to droughts in the country, ranking right below California based on data from 2003 to 2020. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook and Electric Power Annual; U.S. Drought Monitor Drought impacts this year The Pacific Northwest’s Columbia River is the fourth-largest river in the United States by volume. Its watershed, the Columbia River Basin, covers large parts of four states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The basin is home to some of the largest hydropower dams in the country, such as the Grand Coulee with a net summer capacity of 6.7 gigawatts (GW) and Chief Joseph with 2.4 GW of capacity. As early as April of this year, the Washington State Department of Ecology declared most counties in the state under drought. The department takes this step when water supply in the state is less than 75% of normal. In Oregon, two counties declared a drought emergency this summer, first in June in Jefferson County and then in September in Lake County. The Dalles Dam located between Oregon and Washington, with a total net summer capacity of 1.8 GW, is considered a good indicator of water supply conditions in the upper Columbia River. At the end of September, water supply at The Dalles Dam was at 74% of the 30-year normal for the summer months (April through September), according to the Northwestern River Forecast Center. Hydropower generation peaks in the summer months in response to seasonal peak demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Basin Outlook Reports, reservoir storage at the end of September was 48% of capacity in Oregon, 67% of capacity in Washington, 76% in Montana, and 60% in Idaho. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Electric Power Monthly On a monthly basis in 2023, across Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, hydropower generation has been close to or below the lower end of the 10-year range, except for a brief spike in May due to a heatwave. In Washington and Oregon, hydropower generation in 2024 was mostly higher than in 2023, especially during the summer months. In Idaho and Montana, hydropower generation in 2024 was below 2023 levels from April through August. Drought effects in the Northwest according to STEO In the STEO, we forecast electricity generation for electricity market regions instead of state geographical boundaries. We expect hydropower generation in the Northwest electricity region, which includes the Columbia River Basin and parts of other Rocky Mountain states, to total 101.8 billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2024, a 23% decrease from the 10-year average of 132.8 billion kWh and a 1% decrease from 2023.

Who Was Joe Overton Of Overton Window Fame? – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed On October 28, 2024, on his social media platform 'X' (formerly Twitter), the well-known entrepreneur Elon Musk asked this question: 'Ever wondered about the Overton Window?' His query was accompanied by a 'retweet' of a post by Jash Dholani, who included a photo of Joe Overton and stated that the 'Window' concept that bears his name is 'the best mental model for understanding how political change ACTUALLY happens.' This was just the latest Overton Window reference. They surely number now in the tens of thousands, from all over the world. A few years ago, the concept required an explanation, but it is now so ubiquitous, so much a part of our political lexicon, that it’s routinely used as though everyone knows (or should know) what it’s about. It has its own Wikipedia page, as does Joe himself, and Joe’s Window was the focus of a New York Times article in 2019. Any search engine brings up countless citations of it. Simply put, the Overton Window posits that at any given moment, politicians can only operate and get re-elected when they take positions within a narrow framework shaped by prevailing public opinion. Shift the window by changing popular ideas, and you can thereby make what’s politically unpalatable today into a mainstream view tomorrow. If you are unfamiliar with it, or want some examples of it in action, click on these links and learn more from Michigan’s Mackinac Center for Public Policy, where Joe first formulated the idea: An Introduction to the Overton Window of Political Possibility ‘Now it’s simply referred to as the Overton Window, as if everyone knows what it is’ The Overton Window of Political Possibility Joe Overton was a humble man, but I assure you he would be both proud and amazed that his name, barely two decades after his untimely death in 2003 at the age of 43, is approaching the status of a household word. But how many people could tell you who Joe was? What was he like? The world should know more about the man whose name is invoked so often in political and social discussions these days, and I may well be the most qualified living individual to tell you about him. Why? Joe was my best friend, and both of us said so often while he was alive. I was Best Man at his wedding when he married Helen Rheem in March 2003, just three months before he was killed in an ultralight plane crash on June 30. He and I journeyed to 21 countries together, including China, Poland, and Singapore. We even undertook a dangerous, clandestine visit to Mozambique in 1991, where we lived for two weeks with anti-communist rebels during the country’s civil war. As president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, I hired Joe in March 1992 and soon thereafter promoted him to senior vice president. Along with my successor and Mackinac’s current president, Joe Lehman, and a superb staff, we built the operation into one of the most effective state policy-focused think tanks in the country. And in 28 'leadership conferences,' we trained more than 600 staff and executives from other 'free market' organizations from dozens of countries. So yes, I knew Joe very well, and I still think of him almost every day. Joe Overton Born on January 4, 1960, Joe was a native Michigander. From 1965 until his passing in 2003, he lived in the town of Midland. I moved there from my home state of Pennsylvania to teach at Northwood University in 1977, but it would be another decade before I met Joe. In September 1987, we were introduced not in Michigan but at a conference in Seattle, Washington. I told him that in December, I would be opening an office of a new think tank in our town of Midland because I had just accepted an offer to serve as its first president. He was an electrical engineer and project manager at the Dow Chemical Company, as well as a staunch libertarian. He immediately volunteered to help us at what would become the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. He knew engineering, but his passion was freedom and free markets. By 1992, our fifth year of operation, the Center was becoming influential in Michigan and even beyond. A new governor, John Engler, had put many of our policy recommendations into law. I asked Joe if he would relinquish his job at Dow, change his career completely, and come to work full-time at Mackinac. He said yes on the spot and never looked back. I remember telling Joe, 'Your first task is to put in place the nuts and bolts of sound management of our operation, freeing me up to pontificate and raise money.' His engineering and management background coupled with his love of liberty proved to be a potent combination. It helped attract top talent and ensured we got maximum bang for our donors’ bucks. We grew from four employees to more than 30 under Joe’s watch. I was on the road much of the time—at news conferences, speeches, and donor meetings—but I never worried for a moment about what was happening back at the office. In our tenth year, Joe even supervised a major construction project: the transformation of an old, abandoned Woolworth department store in downtown Midland into Mackinac’s new headquarters. It was just a block away from our original office, so it was easy for Joe to spend time every day on the new site. His motto during this time was, 'You expect what you inspect,' meaning he felt obligated to monitor every step of the construction process. He even contributed ideas that later won us some notable design awards. Oh, and by the way, he somehow found time during these busy years of the Mackinac Center’s growth to go to law school. He earned his J.D. degree from Thomas Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan, and passed the bar exam on his first attempt. Whether in organizational management, construction, or political philosophy, Joe was that rare kind of person who understood both the big picture and the intricate details that composed it. He was fond of telling a story of three workers laying bricks at the site of a new cathedral. A man walks by and asks one worker, 'What are you doing?' The worker answered, 'Laying bricks.' The man walks a little further and asks a second worker, 'What are you doing?' The worker responded, 'Building a wall.' When the man approached the third worker with the same question, the worker said, 'I’m constructing a cathedral.' All three bricklayers were doing precisely the same thing, but it was the third one who truly grasped the significance of the project, though the task of the moment could seem rather menial. Joe saw everything we did at the Mackinac Center—even taking out the garbage—as 'building a cathedral.' And largely because of his obvious competence and admirable persona, that’s the way we all thought of it. To Joe, the most important policy issue of our time was school choice. He saw it as a civil right, a righteous cause worth every effort we could muster. Children belong to parents, not to the State, he believed. Joe devoted much of his professional career and most of his personal time to advancing that cause. He even devised a 'Universal Tuition Tax Credit' that, by variations, is on the books now in multiple states. More than anything else, what I learned from Joe in our 16 years of friendship was the importance of personal character. He possessed it by the boatload. He was a Christian, above all else, and he lived his faith and its teachings as well as anyone I have ever known. In an essay for these pages a few months after he died, I wrote: Through his example, his mere presence in a room would raise everyone’s standards of speech and conduct. As a consummate administrator he taught us the importance of continuous organizational improvement through Total Quality Management. He was able to do that effectively not just because he knew the nuts and bolts of the subject, but because he practiced it in his personal life as well. I heard him say many times, 'You cannot impart what you don’t possess.' Joe Overton was the straightest straight shooter I’ve ever known. Not a speck of deception, guile, conceit, or hidden agenda in him. He said what he meant and meant what he said, always. You never, ever had to wonder if he was telling you the truth. He kept his word as if it was an indispensable and inseparable physical appendage like an arm or a leg. Like so many others, I came to place total, unqualified trust in him. So did others who came to know him. Never underestimate the importance of truth and trust to a free society; if we cannot deal with each other on those terms, we will resort to the ugliness of brute force and political power. …Over and over again, people were attracted to his work because of the sterling character of his persona. Friends marveled at his consistency and self-discipline. They were impressed that he not only preached the virtues of civil society; he practiced them in his own life through endless volunteer efforts, quiet philanthropy, and ceaseless counsel to those who needed good advice. One of Joe’s hobbies was flying. He owned two ultralight aircraft—one was a two-seater, the other built for one. On the afternoon of June 30, 2003, he asked me if I wanted to go up with him that evening in the two-seater. I declined because of a summer cold. So, he went up by himself in the other one. I was sound asleep when my phone rang later around midnight. It was Joe’s brother Scott (1965–2016). 'Larry,' he said in a voice choked with emotion, 'Joe was killed this evening when his plane suddenly lost altitude and fell to the ground.' I was more than a little stunned with disbelief. I was struck to the bone by the awful feeling that the world had lost an extraordinarily good man, that the liberty movement had lost a widely admired and irreplaceable leader, and that I had lost the best friend I ever had. To this day, I have never experienced personal trauma as deep as what I felt at Joe’s death. At the Mackinac Center in the weeks after the crash, we were deluged with unsolicited tributes to Joe. As well as I thought I knew him, there was so much more to the man than any of us knew. In keeping with the Christian calling, it turned out that Joe, in ways big and small but always quiet, was helping somebody all the time. The testimonies we published by the hundreds on the organization’s website were mind-blowing: 'He saved our marriage.' 'He gave me a check to get through a tough time.' 'He went out of his way to give me a hand.' The man I thought was outstanding in every way was more exceptional than I ever imagined. Twenty-one years since he died, I still shed tears when I pause to remember him. So the next time you hear of the 'Overton Window,' please understand that the concept itself is valuable and appealing, but the man behind it deserves to be remembered every bit as much.

National Elections Expose The Sham That Is Centralized ‘Democracy...	By Ryan McMaken The 2024 election is over, and in some states, big majorities voted for the winner Donald Trump. In Wyoming, Trump won 72 percent of the vote. In fact, more than 60 percent of the voting population went for Trump in 13 states. Fortunately for the majorities in those states, they’ll get the president they voted for. However, the outcome would have been different if fewer than a million people—in a nation of 330 million—had changed their votes in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan. Then, Kamala Harris would now be the president-elect. She would have won even though the voters of more than a dozen states had lopsided majorities in favor of Trump. Moreover, Kamala could have won even though there was far less enthusiasm on her side. That is, only a single state, Massachusetts, had a voting majority of more than 60 percent for Kamala Harris. Even If You Win, You Lose We could come up with many similar examples in the past 24 years. In 2012, for example, Mitt Romney won 60 percent or more of the vote in nine states. 72 percent of the voters went for Romney in Utah. But, in the end, those supermajorities meant nothing, and the people of Utah, Oklahoma, Alabama, and several others—who had voted nearly 2 to 1 for Romney—got Barack Obama as president. In 2020, by the way, more than 60 percent of the voters in ten states voted against Joe Biden. These facts should be remembered the next time that some pundit or politician tries to tell us that democracy is 'the voice of the people' or 'the will of the majority.' The question that has to be asked is 'which majority?' and 'which people?' Indeed, for the people of Utah in 2012 or Massachusetts in 2024, the president that rules over those states was chosen by people who don’t live in those states. Even if 100 percent of the voters in a state vote against a certain candidate, they could still end up with that candidate as president based on the votes of people living somewhere else. Moreover, given that many states don’t have voter ID, it stands to reason that even a large majority of your state votes for a certain candidate, foreign nationals in some other state may ultimately make the decision for you. It’s difficult to see how such a method expresses 'the will of the majority' when a tiny majority or plurality nationwide so often nullifies overwhelming majorities in a multitude of US states. On a legalistic level, of course, the courts tell us this is all how it is supposed to be. In presidential elections, it simply doesn’t matter what your local majority says. The only majority that matters is the national majority. This is true even if we take into account the electoral college, which is nothing more than a formula for weighting the national majority vote. It bears noticing, however, that these national majorities are often not even majorities. In 1992 and 1996, for example, Bill Clinton won the race with 43 percent and 49 percent, respectively. And, when a candidate does manage to win a majority, it is usually very slim. Not since 1988 has any presidential candidate managed to get even 53 percent of the popular vote. The closest anyone got was Obama in 2008. Most presidential races since 1948 have been decided by a majority of 51 percent or less. The Rules Are Broken in the Age of the Modern Unlimited Presidency In spite of all this, those who can’t think beyond the status quo—both leftists and conservatives—will simply say 'rules are rules.' They’ll go on to insist that we must blindly follow the rules no matter what. In truth, however, these 'rules' were not ratified by any living person, and they were created in an age when the US president exercised very few domestic powers. In the early nineteenth century, presidents could do virtually nothing domestically without Congressional approval, and even those powers were few. Nowadays, however, presidents exercise vast power within the borders of every single US state. Yet, the current system is based on the idea that even if whole regions of the country vote overwhelmingly against a president, they are still forced to submit to four years of that president’s rule-by-decree, which is what every presidency now is in our post-legislative age of Rule by Executive Order. Yes, this system is based on 'the rules,' but in the world of politics, rules only work until they don’t. Ask the British in 1776 or the Soviets in 1989. You’re Never Allowed to Leave The absurdity and injustice of this system is further illustrated by the fact that no matter how much your state’s majority might object to the federal president or his policies, no state or part of a state is allowed to exit the system. Ever. If a two-thirds majority in your state votes against the federal administration again and again, well, that’s too bad, you’re never allowed to leave. You’ll just have to sit back and take whatever the executive branch decides to dish out. But, hey, you always have your small handful of members of Congress to make little speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. None of this will ever do anything to protect your state’s population from federal policies—no matter how contrary these might be to your local economic interests and institutions. But, 'rules are rules.' No private, non-state organization would ever function in such a fashion. Imagine telling the owners of a public company that no matter how much the management behaves contrary to various investors’ wishes, those investors are never allowed to sell their shares and leave the organization. Imagine telling members of any dues-paying organization that no matter how much the leaders screw over the members, they are never allowed to stop paying dues. Yet, this is how the 'rules' work in America. No matter how much the central government might ignore, abuse, and generally govern against the majority of the voters in your state, you are never allowed to leave. You are never allowed to stop paying taxes to support the very people who couldn’t care less what you think. The only way out requires that we stop caring what the rules say. The answer lies in decentralization, secession, and the dismantling of the political system that allowed Obama and Joe Biden to shove their policies down the throats of supermajorities that voted against these presidents again and again. The re-election of Donald Trump does not fundamentally change any of this. Even if Trump were to turn out to be some kind of anti-establishment dream candidate in his second term, the 2028 election is just a few years away. On the other hand, to accept the status quo is to continue allowing federal technocrats a thousand miles away to literally dictate federal policies to your community. Unfortunately, like prisoners suffering from Stockholm syndrome, many will elect to continue supporting the central regime because the 'rules-are-rules' propaganda has worked very well.

Why Trump Routed The D.C. Establishment, Again – OpEd	After the media complained nonstop for months about Donald Trump offering a dark message on the presidential campaign trail, a New York Times headline bewailed his election victory on Wednesday morning: 'America Hires a Strongman.' So anyone who cast a ballot became the moral equivalent of a mafia don hiring a hitman? The Times news analysis lamented, 'This was a conquering of the nation not by force but with a permission slip. Now, America stands on the precipice of an authoritarian style of governance never before seen in its 248-year history.' Well, at least never-before-seen by journalists whose knowledge of history does not extend back beyond Taylor Swift’s first best-selling album. The notion that Trump was a unique threat in American history entitled the media to ignore all the civil liberties abuses of the Biden-Harris administration. Coincidentally, that spared many reporters and editorial writers the difficulty of comprehending the policies which they tacitly endorsed. The media betrayed freedom of speech—at least for Americans who do not have a journalism degree. Biden administration officials conducted potentially 'the most massive attack against free speech in United States history,' a federal judge concluded, and a federal appeals court condemned Team Biden for 'suppressing millions of protected free-speech postings by American citizens'—mostly by conservatives and Republicans. But most of the media was the Sherlock Holmes’ 'dog that didn’t bark' when federal agencies browbeat social media companies with endless demands to muzzle and blindfold average Americans. Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance raised the censorship issue during his debate with Gov. Tim Walz, but it got little or no traction beyond his spiels. Instead, censorship was championed by the media in recent years as part of a holy crusade against 'misinformation' (i.e., facts that are damned inconvenient for the ruling class). Did progressives discover a hidden asterisk to the First Amendment that nullifies constitutional rights for anyone who jokes about covid vaccine mandates? Because it was a self-evident truth that 'Orange Man Bad,' most reporters and pundits exerted little or no effort to comprehend or expose Biden administration follies and frauds. Almost all the media campaign coverage ignored the risk of World War III thanks to the Biden-Harris escalation of the Ukraine-Russia war. Why was there no controversy about Biden providing F-16 jets to Ukraine—potentially enabling Ukraine to attack practically anywhere in Russia with US bombs? Or did the media believe they had a moral duty to blindly support Ukraine because its president—unlike Putin—supports transgender rights? Journalists who retained jobs at top papers continue to be paid very well. On the Friday before the election, the feds released the worst jobs report since the covid lockdowns, confirming a net loss of private jobs. A few hours after that report hit the wires, a Washington Post headline chirped: 'The economy is strong heading into Election Day. Will it matter?' The article’s subhead assured readers: 'The last batch of economic numbers before the election are in, and they’re looking pretty good. So why aren’t voters feeling them?' Presumably because voters were fools or liars and refused to admit how Washington is making their lives wonderful. Most pundits dismissed or disdained people who complained about how the 20+ percent inflation of the Biden era harmed their families. The average mortgage payment has almost doubled since Biden took office—pricing millions of Americans out of their first home—but that was apparently an illegitimate consideration on Election Day. As Mises Institute fellow Tom Woods noted, leftists 'are now mocking people who are concerned about price inflation by using the expression ‘burger too expensive.’' I predicted in the New York Post in early 2022 that inflation would politically bankrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats and plenty of voters agreed on Tuesday. The Harris campaign believed that perpetually championing the right to abortion would guarantee them more than enough votes from women. But it turned out that 'women buy milk and eggs more often than they get abortions.' That fact of life enraged many media commentators. As a female panelist on ABC’s The View asked other panelists on Wednesday morning: 'Why do you think that uneducated white women voted against their reproductive health freedoms, and why do you think Latino men voted in favor of someone who says he will deport a majority of his community?' Perhaps that panelist wasn’t aware that most Latino men in this nation are American citizens. Democratic Party poohbahs and their media allies could not have shown more contempt for the American people. Until his disastrous debate with Donald Trump in June, doddering President Biden was perennially defended as fit for another four years of ruling America. After Democratic Party bosses pushed Biden out the window, they pretended Vice President Harris was entitled to be the candidate even though she got zero votes in the primaries. Party bosses presumed that her candidacy’s 'coronation-by-Establishment' would assure victory thanks to Harris’s gender and race. And anyone who failed to fall in line could be denounced as sexist or racist. That explains why a senior Harris campaign official told MSNBC early on Election Day that 'we are optimistic that we are literally about to turn the page… and install Vice President Harris as the next President of the United States.' That 'identity push button' failed thanks to Harris’s astounding incompetence in interviews. As a journalist, I have interviewed many government officials and politicians over the years and learned to watch for tell-tale signs. From her first media interviews after her designation as presidential candidate, Harris radiated fear except when she was exuding dread. She turned down a chance to be interviewed by Joe Rogan, whose exchange with Trump garnered more than 37 million views. Instead, she went on a vapid 'Call Me Daddy' podcast run by a woman who usually talked about topics such as sex toys. A Slate columnist notedthat she was 'afraid that the host was going to ask Harris her favorite sex position.' Harris turned down the chance to meet with Time Magazine reporters and editors to discuss her views on policy. She never held a press conference. She felt no obligation to explain why she reversed her positions on fracking and other issues. Instead, she acted entitled to the presidency simply because of who she was—or perhaps because of her resume. She offered voters the strangest policy trifecta in presidential campaign history: 'joy,' 'positive vibes,' and 'Trump is Hitler.' The 2024 election was a defeat for Kamala Harris and progressive authoritarianism. But it would be naïve to equate Trump’s victory with the triumph of liberty. Trump’s bizarre view of tariffs as an economic magic wand could be disastrous for America and the world. Trump does not appear to recognize that the soaring national debt is a ticking time bomb that could detonate beneath the economy. There is a broad strand of Washington conservatives who are championing paternalist economic interventions, making the Republican Party look like it is morphing into the old-time Tory Party of England. But, unlike the downtrodden commoners of nineteenth century England, average Americans have not been taught to stay in their place—which helps explain why Trump defeated Harris. And that is the ultimate problem for zealots who believe lofty SAT scores give the Washington elite a divine right to run everyone else’s lives. PBS pundit Jonathan Capehart whined after midnight on election night that, because of Trump’s victory, 'I can’t help but wonder if the American people have given up on democracy.' A better synopsis of Tuesday’s results came from columnist Bridget Phetasy: 'I can sum it up. He’s not Hitler. I’m not racist. F**k you.'

India Charts Its IMEC Path To Global Trade Influence – Analysis	By Soumya Bhowmick During the G20 Summit in late 2023, an agreement was signed between India, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union to establish the India–Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC). This initiative is a strategic response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aims to position India as a pivotal player in global trade. The IMEC seeks to create a comprehensive infrastructure network connecting countries with a combined GDP of US$47 trillion, encompassing shipping lanes, railways, undersea cables and solar grids. This initiative holds great potential to bolster global trade efficiency and ensure energy security. But the IMEC faces several geopolitical, infrastructural and environmental challenges that must be addressed to ensure its success. While the IMEC holds great promise, its implementation is not guaranteed. The corridor is expected to run through geopolitically sensitive areas such as the Middle East, where conflicts, political instability and regional rivalries could pose significant risks. For instance, the war in Gaza has delayed the project’s progress. Infrastructure bottlenecks, such as the need for substantial upgrades to rail and port facilities in some participating countries, may also delay the expected efficiency gains. The reliance on intermodal transportation — combining rail, sea and road transport — could also create logistical complexities. While the IMEC aims to reduce shipping times by up to 40 per cent, the 30 per cent cost reduction claim remains debatable, since the intermodality involved in the IMEC could increase costs due to additional handling, transhipment and coordination requirements. The project’s success will depend on whether the corridor can maintain its promised efficiency despite these hurdles. The IMEC is not a direct alternative to China’s BRI, but it is part of the global response to counter China’s growing economic influence. Unlike the BRI, which has focused extensively on infrastructure financing in developing countries, the IMEC seeks to establish a network of high-efficiency trade routes by prioritising cutting-edge technology, green energy solutions and digital infrastructure. Crucially, BRI investments also have varied trajectories. While the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in Chinese investment in BRI projects in 2020, data from 2023 suggests a rebound in sectors such as green energy and technology. But IMEC’s focus on sustainable energy solutions and connectivity could make it an appealing alternative for countries looking to avoid the debt traps associated with BRI projects. The IMEC project has attracted attention for its ambitious green energy and infrastructure plans, but it must also deal with environmental and socio-political risks. Developing solar grids and hydrogen corridors is a significant step toward renewable energy, but the environmental footprint of constructing this massive infrastructure is a concern. While the corridor aims to promote clean hydrogen trade, questions also remain about the feasibility of large-scale green hydrogen production and transportation across long distances. Ensuring this energy source is produced using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels will require continuous technological advancements and investments. One of the IMEC’s significant contributions could be reducing the global economy’s reliance on critical maritime chokepoints like the Suez Canal. The corridor proposes an alternative route that could reduce congestion and improve trade resilience for India and its partners. But while the IMEC may offer an alternative route, it is unlikely to replace the Suez Canal entirely, given the volume of global trade passing through the latter. The IMEC may provide some relief, but the Suez Canal will remain vital in international trade due to its centrality and established infrastructure. The IMEC also plans to establish a 20,000 kilometre cable system — the Trans Europe Asia System — to bolster global communication networks. Given that 95 per cent of the world’s communication flows through undersea cables, this project is vital for improving the security of international data transmission. India’s involvement in the IMEC reflects its growing diplomatic prowess. The corridor offers India the opportunity to strengthen its geopolitical alliances with key countries in the Middle East, Europe and North America while simultaneously countering China’s influence in global trade. Similarly, by focusing on the IMEC’s economic and strategic benefits, India can consolidate its role as a significant player in global trade networks. The corridor will also serve to promote India’s Digital Public Infrastructure, a framework designed to enhance financial inclusion and streamline digital transactions. By integrating Digital Public Infrastructure into the IMEC, India could set new standards in cross-border digital trade and communication. The IMEC represents a significant opportunity for India to strengthen its position in global trade networks. It offers a comprehensive strategy to enhance regional cooperation and economic resilience by focusing on trade efficiency, renewable energy and digital connectivity. For the IMEC to succeed, participating countries must align on an actionable implementation plan that addresses these challenges head-on. Only by doing so can the IMEC realise its potential to drive global trade, secure energy transitions and offer a robust alternative to existing trade routes.

The CDC Planned Quarantine Camps Nationwide – OpEd	No matter how bad you think Covid policies were, they were intended to be worse. Consider the vaccine passports alone. Six cities were locked down to include only the vaccinated in public indoor places. They were New York City, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. The plan was to enforce this with a vaccine passport. It broke. Once the news leaked that the shot didn’t stop infection or transmission, the planners lost public support and the scheme collapsed. It was undoubtedly planned to be permanent and nationwide if not worldwide. Instead, the scheme had to be dialed back. Features of the CDC’s edicts did incredible damage. It imposed the rent moratorium. It decreed the ridiculous 'six feet of distance' and mask mandates. It forced Plexiglas as the interface for commercial transactions. It implied that mail-in balloting must be the norm, which probably flipped the election. It delayed the reopening as long as possible. It was sadistic. Even with all that, worse was planned. On July 26, 2020, with the George Floyd riots having finally settled down, the CDC issued a plan for establishing nationwide quarantine camps. People were to be isolated, given only food and some cleaning supplies. They would be banned from participating in any religious services. The plan included contingencies for preventing suicide. There were no provisions made for any legal appeals or even the right to legal counsel. The plan’s authors were unnamed but included 26 footnotes. It was completely official. The document was only removed on about March 26, 2023. During the entire intervening time, the plan survived on the CDC’s public site with little to no public notice or controversy. It was called 'Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.' 'This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings. This approach has never been documented and has raised questions and concerns among humanitarian partners who support response activities in these settings. The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data. Considerations are based on current evidence known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may need to be revised as more information becomes available.' By absence of empirical data, the meaning is: nothing like this has ever been tried. The point of the document was to map out how it could be possible and alert authorities to possible pitfalls to be avoided. The meaning of 'shielding' is 'to reduce the number of severe Covid-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (‘high-risk’) and the general population (‘low-risk’). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or ‘green zones’ established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector, or community level depending on the context and setting. They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.' In other words, this is what used to be concentration camps. Who are these people who would be rounded up? They are 'older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.' Who determines this? Public health authorities. The purpose? The CDC explains: 'physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population' allows authorities 'to prioritize the use of the limited available resources.' This sounds a lot like condemning people to death in the name of protecting them. The model establishes three levels. First is the household level. Here high-risk people are'physically isolated from other household members.' That alone is objectionable. Elders need people to take care of them. They need love and to be surrounded by family. The CDC should never imagine that it would intervene in households to force old people into separate places. The model jumps from households to the 'neighborhood level.' Here we have the same approach: forced separation of those deemed vulnerable. From there, the model jumps again to the 'camp/sector level.' Here it is different. 'A group of shelters such as schools, community buildings within a camp/sector (max 50 high-risk individuals per single green zone) where high-risk individuals are physically isolated together. One entry point is used for exchange of food, supplies, etc. A meeting area is used for residents and visitors to interact while practicing physical distancing (2 meters). No movement into or outside the green zone.' Yes, you read that correctly. The CDC is here proposing concentration camps for the sick or anyone they deem to be in danger of medically significant consequences of infection. Further: 'to minimize external contact, each green zone should include able-bodied high-risk individuals capable of caring for residents who have disabilities or are less mobile. Otherwise, designate low-risk individuals for these tasks, preferably who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 and are assumed to be immune.' The plan says in passing, contradicting thousands of years of experience, 'Currently, we do not know if prior infection confers immunity.' Therefore the only solution is to minimize all exposure throughout the whole population. Getting sick is criminalized. These camps require a 'dedicated staff' to 'monitor each green zone. Monitoring includes both adherence to protocols and potential adverse effects or outcomes due to isolation and stigma. It may be necessary to assign someone within the green zone, if feasible, to minimize movement in/out of green zones.' The people housed in these camps need to have good explanations of why they are denied even basic religious freedom. The report explains: 'Proactive planning ahead of time, including strong community engagement and risk communication is needed to better understand the issues and concerns of restricting individuals from participating in communal practices because they are being shielded. Failure to do so could lead to both interpersonal and communal violence.' Further, there must be some mechanisms to prohibit suicide: Additional stress and worry are common during any epidemic and may be more pronounced with COVID-19 due to the novelty of the disease and increased fear of infection, increased childcare responsibilities due to school closures, and loss of livelihoods. Thus, in addition to the risk of stigmatization and feeling of isolation, this shielding approach may have an important psychological impact and may lead to significant emotional distress, exacerbate existing mental illness or contribute to anxiety, depression, helplessness, grief, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide among those who are separated or have been left behind. Shielded individuals with concurrent severe mental health conditions should not be left alone. There must be a caregiver allocated to them to prevent further protection risks such as neglect and abuse. The biggest risk, the document explains, is as follows: 'While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings.' (It should go without saying but this 'shielding' approach suggested here has nothing to do with focused protection of the Great Barrington Declaration. Focused protection specifically says: 'schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.') In four years of research, and encountering truly shocking documents and evidence of what happened in the Covid years, this one certainly ranks up at the top of the list of totalitarian schemes for pathogenic control prior to vaccination. It is quite simply mind-blowing that such a scheme could ever be contemplated. Who wrote it? What kind of deep institutional pathology exists that enabled this to be contemplated? The CDC has 10,600 full-time employees and contractors and a budget of $11.5 billion. In light of this report, and everything else that has gone on there for four years, both numbers should be zero.

The Plot Against Democracy – OpEd	In Philadelphia this past weekend, I met a number of people who’d given up on democracy. They railed about politicians who make promises they don’t keep. They spun conspiracy theories about the government. A number of those who answered the door told me that they weren’t going to vote. Then there were the grim young men who said, hell yeah, they were going to vote for Trump. They spoke of the Republican presidential candidate as if he were Tony Montana, the gangster played by Al Pacino in the film Scarface: violent, lawless, and powerful. Trump elicited respect laced with fear. According to his supporters, he’d stand up to America’s enemies abroad and be tough on crime domestically. Several said to me—with the usual preface of 'don’t get me wrong but…'—that a woman president would be too weak or 'mixed up by hormones' to do those necessary things. If you cross celebrity culture with gun culture and add a few dollops of testosterone, you get Donald Trump. Much has been written about the rise of the global far right (including by me). It’s important to understand that this global trend is not a type of politics. It is an anti-politics. The far right embodied by Vladimir Putin in Russia, Victor Orban in Hungary, Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, and others is determined to unravel democracy. They have contempt for elections. They revise, bend, or undermine the constitutional order. And they despise the civic engagement at the heart of thriving democracies. They crack down on dissent. They target protesters. They ruthlessly purge the 'enemy within.' This is what Donald Trump has promised to do this time around. The Republican campaign in 2024 relied on anti-government rhetoric, conspiracy theories, and violent innuendo (against FEMA, against the border patrol, against Republican politicians that didn’t toe the MAGA line) in order to do two things. These strategies drew the disaffected to the polls. And they pushed others not to vote: to give up on politics altogether. Rage and apathy are the two modes of right-wing politicking. This is a variation on Albert Hirschman’s famous 'exit, voice, and loyalty' distinction. The loyalists are voicing their anger, the apathetic are exiting, and the dissidents continue to organize in the hopes of avoiding the Russian scenario: an entire opposition in exile or jail. Other countries have managed to buck the trend. Even little Moldova was able to successfully beat back the anti-democratic, pro-Russian, billionaire-supported candidate in its presidential election last weekend. Brazil got rid of Bolsonaro. The French teamed up to stop Marine Le Pen at the polls. It can be done. Rich, prosperous, arrogant America failed to do so. Let’s face it: American politics, as we know it, is over. To be sure, it was always possible for American politicians to win with dirty tricks. But then there’d be a course correction of sorts: Nixon followed by Watergate, Trump 2016 followed by impeachment and electoral loss. That loss in 2020 should have been an inoculation against outlandish lies, threats, and manipulations. Instead, the Republican Party doubled down. It abandoned the few remaining guardrails governing the conduct of a campaign, which is a preview of how the next administration will skirt the few remaining guardrails it reluctantly observed in the waning days of its previous term in office. The political game is now fundamentally different. Forget 'ground game.' Forget strategic messaging. Forget polling. In other words, forget about those traditional methods of mobilizing political sentiment in a democracy. Never bring a knife to a gunfight, the pundits warn. The Democrats brought a computer to a gunfight. Those computer models of how to win an election now lie in ruins. A funereal pall has descended over half of America, and naturally there is a lot of finger-pointing in the wake of the Democratic Party’s loss of the presidency and the Senate. It was misogyny. It was Black men abandoning the Democratic Party. It was poor whites voting against their economic self-interest. It was the Electoral College, Elon Musk’s money, and Russian disinformation. It was Joe Biden’s decision to run again, and Kamala Harris’s failure to explain her positions clearly. It was all of that, of course. But it was also the failure of the Democratic Party to understand the rage coursing through the body politic. The Democrats failed to translate the economic gains of the last four years—the infrastructure bill, the watered-down version of the Green New Deal, the CHIPS Act—into populist language. Put another way, the ordinary gains of an ordinary political process did not prove inspiring because this is a post-political moment. And the Democrats were playing by the rules of the old era. Here’s an instructive story. A friend confessed to me before the election that he didn’t pay attention to politics. 'They’re both bad,' he said 'One’s a fascist, the other’s a communist.' 'Harris is a communist?' I said, surprised. 'That’s ridiculous. She’s just a run-of-the-mill politician, straddling the center. I could understand if you were criticizing Bernie Sanders as a communist. He, at least, is a self-professed socialist. He’s not a communist, of course, but at least he’s – .' 'Oh, Bernie?' my friend interrupted me. 'Oh yeah, I really like Bernie!' There are several lessons here. Even for the apolitical, the lies of Trump ('she’s a Marxist!') penetrated the population with the brutal repetitiveness of state propaganda. The level of political understanding in the populace is shockingly low (a fifth grader should be able to put Trump, Harris, and Sanders on a political spectrum). And Bernie’s populism transcends ideology. Like the Vermont senator, a successful political party must be able to channel anger as well as aspiration. As the opposition regroups, it’s useful to repeat some truisms. Character is forged in adversity. Previous generations have successfully fought fascism to rescue democracy. And democracy is all about learning lessons and moving forward (especially after slipping backward). It’s long been clear that this country needs a new politics. To use a shopworn phrase, let’s build back better—after this third and most devastating hurricane of the season. In his 2004 novel, The Plot Against America, Philip Roth imagined the alternative past of a fascist takeover of the United States. Charles Lindbergh, a pro-Hitler isolationist, wins the 1940 election with his slogan 'Vote for Lindbergh, or vote for war.' In office, he fulfills his promise by keeping the United States out of World War II. But when Lindbergh’s plane mysteriously goes missing, Roosevelt gets reelected to the presidency in 1942. The Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, and history resumes its well-known course. It’s a chilling book that resonates with today’s headlines. It was a reminder, well before the political rise of Trump, that it can happen here. But the current situation is different. This is not just a battle over the soul of America. This is a much larger confrontation. This conflict is being waged against Russia in Ukraine and against Israel in Gaza. It is being fought in polling places in democratic nations around the world. And it is being sustained by anti-authoritarian dissidents in streets, jails, and exile communities. Even as they wrap themselves in the American flag and the U.S. constitution, the American far right and its enablers are plotting against democracy itself. It didn’t look promising in 1940 either, in Roth’s alternative reality or in the actual history. So, let the finger-pointing end and a new era of creative and savvy political organizing begin.

The Sustainability Scam: How Self-Interest Ruins Good Ideas – Ana...	We must ensure ecocentric standards to reverse environmental and social injustices. We have laws to ensure children are born into a safe, sustainable, and unpolluted environment. These laws are also meant to empower future generations and guarantee birth equity. But far from ensuring that these rights are upheld, we disfranchise children at birth because they do not have a legal say in the actions of adults that impact their future. Our ill-advised desire to prioritize economic growth over children's futures has led to the climate crisis. It has also led to children being born into unequal conditions where they do not have equal access to welfare resources. This has resulted in the impacts of environmental degradation being felt unequally among different socioeconomic groups. Poor people, Indigenous groups, and people of color are, by and large, impacted more by the degraded environment than the wealthy and white segment of the population. This is the tragic legacy of environmental racism, which has been referred to as 'the new Jim Crow.' Those most affected by these injustices often have little or no say in shaping policies and laws, and their children eventually inherit this unequal system. In a capitalist, profit-driven economy, it is unsurprising that the corporate sector, driven by financial concerns above all else, is the biggest culprit in perpetuating these wrongs—particularly the extractive industries and industrial agriculture. The Misinformed Power Grab Most leaders—and the biggest beneficiaries of an unequal society—never came close to protecting children from the harm caused by the development model favored by the rich world. Instead, poor children grow up in a world to face the repercussions of a power grab by wealthy, primarily white, families. The first misstep of dissociating the connection between human rights and environmental sustainability was taken in 1948 when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was signed, establishing fundamental rights for all people. Twenty years later, in 1968, the United Nations held a conference in Tehran where some groups raised concerns about the impact of population growth (and, by extension, economic growth) on human rights. Despite these efforts, the concerns were never resolved, and the relevant changes were never incorporated into the UDHR. Fixing the Problem: Laws, Norms, and Reparations The UN's ill-informed, misguided policy decision has led to a socioeconomic system built on the disenfranchisement of children at the time of their birth. There is an urgent requirement to rectify this situation and secure their welfare. Firstly, reparations are needed. The wealth made through this process of disenfranchisement must be used to secure the future of newborn children who are entering the world. Those wealthy individuals and corporations that have benefited most from this disenfranchisement (and may have promoted ignorance by glossing over the actual impacts of economic growth) should be held especially responsible. Secondly, we must establish laws and norms that ensure that the rights and welfare of unborn children are accounted for in the democratic process and that human beings are not merely seen as a means to sustain and grow economies. We must shape a future where children are not born simply to become consumers or workers but as fully participatory citizens with agency over their lives, with the ability to choose and thrive instead of merely surviving. While Effective Altruism and other movements based on financial investments are often viewed by many nonprofits as effective ways to resolve these issues, reparations are the most effective and immediate way to fix problems facing us today if we want to restore the natural balance. If we skip this crucial step, it would be the equivalent of building a house with no foundation. The Sustainability Scam Sustainability has become a buzzword among environmentalists, CEOs, and politicians. Leaders often present themselves as guardians of a better future, bragging about eco-friendly projects and sustainable methods. However, a closer look exposes a darker aspect to these assertions. The rhetoric and reality frequently diverge significantly, with racial disparities, self-interest, and uneven growth undermining various projects' ostensible benefits. Nonprofits working toward social, economic, and environmental changes must also include family planning in their goals. They must first help ensure the shared, inclusive equity of children born into the world. That means giving all newly born human beings an equal capacity to self-determine the social and ecological influences that others have over them. In his 2018 book Winners Take All, The Elite Charade of Changing the World, Anand Giridharadas examines how the global elite's efforts to 'change the world' are only an attempt to retain the status quo. He argues that their actions to try and resolve problems are a bid to hide their role in creating the problems in the first place. Publishers Weekly called the book a 'damning portrait of contemporary American philanthropy.' But Giridharadas—and publications like the New York Times—have missed the biggest charade—the one mainly driving the suffering and death unfolding as temperatures increase. This 'sustainability scam' has at least two standards for activist campaigns that claim to be sustainable, green, humane, democratic, eco-friendly, etc. There is one standard for wealthy investors (and their children), who often fund organizations that promote these terms, hoping that their work might have an impact in furthering them, and a different standard based on birth equity. These standards are artificial, arbitrary, and designed to allow a particular form of economic growth that benefits some—mainly the white population—at a deadly cost to others. This first standard—anthropocentric and adopted in 1968 by the UN agencies bowing to wealthy families—does not require birth equity. It functions on unsustainable welfare as the primary currency or value. This first standard allows significant deviation from the ecosocial baselines and ecocentric standards that would have prevented the climate crisis. These real standards can be measured along at least eight metrics like restorative levels of greenhouse gas emissions and inclusive representative ratios that ensure a healthy, functional democracy. Deviation from these standards—based on self-determination or freedom and equitable share in democracy—has led to the climate crisis that is killing millions. Funders in the polluter nations facing significant climate liability fund various institutions—media, nonprofits, universities, agencies, think tanks, and celebrities—to spread disinformation to support the first standard. This allows wealthy families to treat inherited wealth and other privileges as something outside the realm of the democratic process, which they use to strengthen their positionality and growth to systematically disenfranchise the average voter. We are now at a place where they can use the wealth they made through the scam to attack the democratic process and try to step outside of it. An effort is underway at the United Nations that requires assessments of climate damages. This includes the need to 1) ensure that ecocentric standards are adopted to account for the actual harm being done by the crisis and 2) to treat these standards and the recovery of climate reparations as the first and overriding human rights, a right that preempts the government's authority to assign wealth contrary to it, and allows citizens to engage in preemptive acts of self-defense to protect themselves and their children. Inequitable Growth Policies As a fundamental right, people who are made vulnerable by the actions of others—like fenceline communities put in harm's way by petrochemical plants being built in their backyards—are owed compensation. As millions die in a climate crisis resulting from inequitable growth policies undoing most mitigation efforts, questions arise about how that happened and who should be held accountable. We can see the imbalance in how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts those who are least responsible for causing it. In 2022, Seth Borenstein and Drew Costley of the Associated Press reported that 'the data shows that the top carbon emitter over time, the United States, has caused more than $1.9 trillion in climate damage to other countries from 1990 to 2014, including $310 billion in damage to Brazil, $257 billion in damage to India, $124 billion to Indonesia, $104 billion to Venezuela and $74 billion to Nigeria. But at the same time, the United States' carbon pollution has benefited the U.S. by more than $183 billion, while Canada, Germany, and Russia have profited even more from American emissions.' This problem can no longer be ignored if we want to secure our children's future. We must work toward resolving the social and economic disparities, increasing access to welfare measures, and ensuring better resources for pregnant women and families. Ensuring Child Rights There is a minimum threshold of well-being for birthing a child, which is necessary for self-determination. We must take drastic measures to ensure all children have the resources to become self-determining individuals. This could involve seizing resources from well-defended enclaves of wealth. By doing so, potential mothers might be incentivized to plan for their children's future, knowing these resources would be available. Some will argue that reduced economic growth, for example, is too high a cost to pay for ensuring birth equity and access to the same welfare opportunities for all children, especially those from BIPOC communities. However, these minimum thresholds are essential in forming a just and equitable society. People who argue against these basic standards threaten who we aspire to be as a society. They are more interested in exploiting humans and the environment for their gains, rather than investing in a better future. They threaten our freedom. It's physically impossible to have a legally obligating 'we' that precedes all legitimate national constitutions without measurable birth equity. As the work done by the United Nations shows, no one gets to use authority and state violence to benefit at a cost to others without incurring significant risk. It is important to see beyond the lies perpetuated between 1948 and 1968 to make us think that national sovereignty is magically inherent. It has to be derived from the measurable sovereignty or self-determination of its subjects. The only way to ensure share equity is to entitle would-be parents to bring children into the world only after a certain threshold of planned conditions, measurable on the eight metrics, have been achieved. The wealth accumulated by exploiting nature, which led to the climate crisis, must be used to ensure these conditions. The United States prides itself on being a free nation but uses the concept of freedom that starts by exploiting the most vulnerable. There is no minimum threshold of well-being for future children and animals, as they are seen as a means to growing economies rather than individuals with rights who form integral parts of society. Converting democracies into unsustainable growth economies that enrich a few by diluting everyone else's equal and influential equity shares in our political system is a subtle form of oppression. It leads to millions dying as the growth triggers catastrophic heat waves. This eventually results in justified resistance movements to protest against the scam, where those at the top of the economic pyramid benefitted from a society that promised an inclusive democracy, which is instead based on shared inequity. 'While there is no 'optimal' human population, the evidence suggests that a sustainable global population of 3 billion is an optimistic number given that we long ago entered a continuously intensifying state of ecological overshoot, accumulating ever more massive amounts of ecological debt that must be paid down if we are to avoid the ongoing (and ever-worsening) climate catastrophe, ecological destruction, and the resulting human misery,' Dr. Christopher K. Tucker, chairman of the American Geographical Society, said in an October 2024 email. 'Adding 80 million additional people to the planet each year—the equivalent of 10 New York Cities or an additional Germany each year—is not a recipe for addressing this polycrisis,' he said. 'Fortunately, simply investing (heavily) in empowering strategies focused on women and girls worldwide can hasten the already inevitable demographic transition that would relieve the unrelenting pressure we have foisted on our planet—and help us meet our commitments to the next generation under the UN's 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child.' The wealthy need to pay the cost of creating an unequal system that benefits them instead of ensuring equal and inclusive participation by all citizens in that system. They profit from treating children as part of a labor force to build and grow economies, instead of securing their rights as part of human rights and the democratic process. Many involved in prioritizing birth equity have seen a pattern in how they react to it: they do not offer counterarguments to the idea that restoring nature through ecosocial birth equity must be the first and overriding human right but resort to tactics to evade the issue. These people share a common trait: They attempt to evade being held responsible for the deadly costs and lush benefits of their birth, developmental, and emancipatory positionality. Their phrasing varies from 'I'm just trying to save these specific animals' to 'I'm just trying to focus on this specific area of research.' That kind of siloed myopia ultimately destroysbiodiversity and causes irreversible environmental damage. True Sustainability Means Having Children in a Very Different Way These deceptive tactics undermine the promise of sustainability, allowing leaders to project a false image of environmental stewardship while continuing harmful practices. To achieve genuine sustainability, we must demand transparency, hold organizations accountable, and ensure that the benefits of sustainable development are distributed equitably. Addressing these systemic issues is the only way toward a sustainable and just future. Many willing to benefit at a deadly cost to others want to treat the birth of children as unrelated to their lives. It is not. It is the basis of all things: a commitment to our most fundamental aspirations. Do we care about each other or exploit each other? While economics has dominated the social sciences because humans predictably try to maximize their welfare, it is also clear that many people choose criteria for truth and value that reaffirm their birth and developmental positionality. That's a dangerous form of self-deception, but understanding its existence allows us to move beyond economics, beyond capitalism versus socialism, and toward unifying constitutionality. We can't change lives for the better if disproportionately influential people have the power to define what good is. Recognizing this fact is essential to hold those who evade our obligations to birth equity accountable—so that we all can work together to know what's right and work toward taking remedial steps to prevent further environmental damage. How could you know how much welfare you deserve if you are not involved in making the rules determining welfare? We can't create economic demand by violating neonatal rights. We can't ensure economic growth by preventing all citizens from being born and raised in town halls and participating in the democratic process. Using specific ecosocial thresholds to reform birth and development rights ensures an equal and influential role in rulemaking, thus limiting the influence others have over you to live in relative self-determination. Given the exponential difference between the wealth of Black and white children, massive reforms are necessary to achieve equity. Countries cannot legitimately undercut the sovereignty of their subjects by ignoring children's birth and development entitlements, using those children instead as economic inputs to create ecologically deadly growth. Nations and many powerful interests within them have, while responding to the 'baby bust' of falling fertility rates, openly admitted to doing this. Part of creating deadly growth is to offer tax cuts to women for having children. In the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, we learn that a basket weaver could not expect to succeed in the 'free' markets created by those colonizing his lands. But even Thoreau missed the fundamental value of nature in constituting the creation of power relations toward equity and freedom. Laws that protect the beneficiaries of any political system only derive their legitimacy by including and empowering future generations—in a measurable way—rather than exploiting them.

Moscow Opens Pandora’s Box With New Talk About Changing Ukraine’s...	On November 4, the post-Soviet Russia’s Day of National Accord, Yevgeny Pozdnyakov, a pro-Kremlin commentator for Vzglyad, published a commentary entitled 'Russia Will Have to Redraw the Borders of Ukraine' (Vzglyad, November 4). Pozdnyakov dismisses the idea that Ukraine should be allowed to exist in its borders established in 1991 because almost all neighboring countries claimed or even controlled part of its territory at one time or another and to this day do not respect those borders. To support this argument, he uses a tactic much favored by Russian commentators, citing Ukrainian authors rather than Russian ones to make his point that Ukraine’s current borders are meaningless. Pozdnyakov then suggests that in the future, Russia should work with other countries, such as Hungary and Poland, to change the borders. That would reduce a future Ukrainian state to a small landlocked country incapable of defending itself or being defended by others against Russian demands. This logic is likely being shared by some Kremlin officials, meaning that any 'land for peace' deal between Kyiv and Moscow will not end the conflict. Instead, after perhaps a brief breathing space, the Putin regime will continue its aggression against Ukraine with the aid of allies. With those successes in hand, Russia could then launch attacks on other neighbors such as the Baltic countries and Kazakhstan. In short, what may appear to some as a peace deal could trigger a broader war rather than prevent one. Pozdnyakov’s argument builds upon and modifies Moscow’s commentaries on border changes that were especially frequent at the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expanded war in Ukraine in February 2022 (see EDM, March 29, 2022). At that time, Vladimir Vinokurov, a professor at the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Diplomatic Academy, took a very different view about border changes in Ukraine. Vinokurov suggested that Russia should oppose any changes in Ukraine’s Western borders because those could limit Russia’s freedom of action. Although, he conceded, if Kyiv made territorial concessions to Moscow, Hungary and Poland would likely make analogous demands for concessions themselves (NVO.NG.ru, June 2, 2022). After more than two years of fighting, however, Ukrainian resistance has prevented the Russian side from achieving its initial goals and Moscow appears to have concluded that it may ultimately need to involve other countries in the future if it is to achieve the much-diminished Kyiv. Pozdnyakov suggests in his article that not only would Hungary and Poland’s demands for concessions help Russia directly in that effort, but they would also normalize territorial expansion and, thus, reduce criticism of Moscow for engaging in it. In Moscow’s view, if everyone is involved or portrayed as being involved in territorial aggrandizement then Russia should not be singled out with sanctions and other restrictions. If that view prevails, far more wars of aggression will break out, possibly leading to a global conflagration. The borders of Ukraine, like those of many countries in the region, including Russia, have shifted throughout history. This historical context, however, does not validate Pozdnyakov’s conclusions, even though it is true that the evolution of the Ukraine-Russia borders of continued right up to the end of the Soviet period. (On that process, see my 'Can Republican Borders be Changed?' RFE/RL Report on the USSR, September 28, 1990, posted online at Window on Eurasia, May 21, 2021). Moreover, borders of districts within these union republics were also changed frequently, again to serve Moscow’s interests, and especially to prevent any challenges to the Soviet Union’s territorial division (Window on Eurasia, October 5). When the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991, all 12 countries that had been union republics—the three occupied Baltic countries had left earlier—and the international community committed themselves to accepting the 1991 borders as legitimate. The independence of these countries had only become possible because of a provision in the Soviet constitution allowing union republics to secede. There was a conviction that doing anything else would cause more issues, making the transitions many hoped for impossible and even more dangerous than agreeing to the previously established Soviet borders. Those decisions, of course, did not prevent border disputes among and within the newly independent countries. The most prominent disputes before Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea include Moscow’s war against Chechnya, the conflict of Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh, and a series of disputes among Central Asian countries. These conflicts have attracted the attention of other countries, which have supported one side or the other, but rarely their direct participation. Moscow, until very recently when it recruited North Koreans to fight alongside the Russian military in Ukraine, has opposed any involvement of countries beyond the former Soviet space and see it as a direct threat (see EDM, October 30). Many of these countries, even when they very much supported one side or the other, fear that their involvement could spark an even more serious conflict between the Russian Federation and themselves (Window on Eurasia, May 26). Moscow’s counting on the possibility that East European countries might help it in Ukraine should not come as a surprise. Russian officials have always paid close attention to the ways Moscow can exploit ethnic minorities in adversarial countries. In the case of Ukraine, the Kremlin has long tracked the Hungarian, Polish, and Romanian minorities, of which there are approximately 150,000 each, and these groups’ attitudes in their ethnic homelands—even if those governments have been generally supportive of Kyiv. More recently, Moscow has paid particular attention to Hungary and the Hungarians in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia given the Orban government’s pro-Moscow position and Budapest’s own actions regarding the Hungarian minority in Ukraine (see EDM, June 20). It is entirely possible that the Kremlin may believe that offering Russian assistance to Hungary to regain portions of Ukraine could help Moscow wean Budapest even further away from Europe. Pozdnyakov’s article suggests that Moscow is increasingly attentive to these complicated ethnic relationships, something Western governments need to be aware of as well. Without proper care, any agreement the West encourages Kyiv to sign with Moscow could spark new and broader conflicts in the region and sow the seeds of a much larger and more destructive war.

Unusual Reasons Africa Wanted Trump To Win – OpEd	By Azu Ishiekwene I understand wealthy US citizens and conservatives of the evangelical hue rooting for Donald Trump. The rich believe he would loosen regulations and protect them and their businesses from excessive taxation. Conservative evangelicals believe he is the bulwark against wokeism, especially the ultra-liberal variety. And white folks want their country back. But Africans at home and in the Diaspora—what is their business supporting a guy who described their continent as a 'shithole' and has worn his anti-immigrant rhetoric on his sleeves? It didn’t seem to make sense that anyone who saw Trump 1.0 would ever dream or wish for the second version. But now, he’s back. He even has the Supreme Court and the Senate in his Red corner as of press time. With the media (especially the major networks) awash with polls indicating a dead heat up to zero hours, I became more interested in the pro-Trump sentiment among Nigerians. I also checked in with friends elsewhere on the continent, and the feedback surprised me. Trump, we want Some friends told me Trump is just the man the US needs to purge itself of its hubris and arrogance. Once upon a time, the US was a moral force for good worldwide. Its exceptionalism didn’t often require bullying others to make the point. It did many bad things during the Cold War, as did its arch-rival, the Soviet Union. But after that phase and with the fall of the Berlin Wall, many had hoped to see the emergence of a multipolar world, one in which, if you like, the lion and the lamb would lie side by side. But that was not to be. From Cuba to Venezuela, Libya to the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, and right up to the old sphere of influence of the USSR, the US stoked—and still stokes—a zero-sumness that hardly brooks 'live and let live.' Since then, the world has experienced fewer devastating wars, but it has wrestled with no fewer tensions of a new variety aided and abetted by technology. Same difference? Trump 2.0, these folks hope, will do at least two things for the world. It would further hasten the internal decay of the US by aggravating racial tensions and emboldening right-wing excesses. Two, Trump’s America First ultra-insularity and his off-the-fly foreign policy style will distance the US from its traditional allies and enable crazies around the world, like North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, to run amok. This sounded more like saying that if US voters were happy to be seduced by their worst selves, they deserve what they get. But that was not all. Some also wanted Trump’s victory as a stick to beat their leaders back home. On the eve of the election, Larry Madowo of CNN reported that Kenyans wanted Trump to win because 'with him, you know where you stand.' The report contrasted Trump’s style with Kenya’s political elite, who could hardly be trusted. Trumphobes The CNN report might also have been about Nigeria, where Trumphobes wanted him to win for a slightly curiously different reason. They think his anti-immigration policy will force Nigerians and their government to fix their own country. In the US, Nigeria has the highest diaspora population of Africa, 327,000 citizens, followed by Ethiopia, 222,000, and Egypt, 192,000. It didn’t matter much to the Trumphobes that Nigeria’s US diaspora sends home $20 billion yearly, an increasingly significant source of support for a distressed economy. What is at work is a reverse schadenfreude, which says that the fewer opportunities Nigerian immigrants have outside the country, the more seriously the government would be obliged to fix the country. Someone even said to me that the 'malicious support' for Trump was payback for the bad leaders that the US routinely propped and supported around the world, a list that included Saddam Hussein, Augusto Pinochet and Mobutu Seseko. Republican African record Some pro-Trump sentiments are, however, driven by facts. For example, Republicans have a far better record of engaging Africans than Democrats. The Republican Party opposed colonialism. Its support for African initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and efforts to combat AIDS contrasts with the Democrat’s preference for aid diplomacy. The hope is that Trump 2.0 will not be an exception. Here, Diasporans are not too far from their Black cousins in the US. A NAACP poll in September showed that one in four Black men under 50 supported Trump for president. Trump 1.0 showed tough love towards Africa, but it was on his watch, for example, that the US finally authorised the sale to Nigeria of the much-needed fighter jets for the prosecution of the war on Boko Haram, which President Barack Obama had blocked for eight years. On his part, President Joe Biden will only make a brief visit – his first to Africa in four years – to Angola on his way out of the White House. Better or worse? Trump’s overwhelming victory might mean one of two things for his presidency: The weight of the responsibility could humble him and increase the likelihood that he would be more restrained than before. On the other hand, it could also bring out the worst in him—that feeling that he never really lost in 2020, that he was cheated of victory as he claimed, that it’s now time to take his pound of flesh with a vengeance. We’ll have to wait and see. If Trump 2.0 means Africans who were not on the radar during the campaign will now have to look inward and find their way through an uncertain future, then so be it. Ukraine and Gaza Trump’s victory might hasten the end of the war in Ukraine and, hopefully, improve the protracted global supply chain crisis that has affected the supply of agricultural products and cooking oils to many African countries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky knows he cannot depend on Trump to bear the cost of a war that has, for all purposes, become a meat grinder. The war in Ukraine might end sooner than later. As for the Middle East, Trump. 1.0 moved the Embassy of the US from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem despite protests by the Palestinians and some Arab countries. If that means anything, it should suggest that Trump 2.0 will not walk on the eggshell of a two-state solution in his approach to the current war on Gaza. He’s flat-out pro-Netanyahu and big on oil deals with Gulf states. I make no pretence of my dislike of Trump’s politics. Nor do I have any illusions that his second term would be significantly different from his first, which left the world holding its breath dangerously for four years. But if he’s the man American voters have chosen to lead them, so be it. Unfortunately, what America does—for good or ill—affects the rest of the world whether or not we cast a ballot.

Zelenskyy Warns EU Leaders That Capitulation To Putin Is ‘Suicida...	(RFE/RL) -- President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned European leaders that capitulation to Russia after it invaded Ukraine would be 'suicidal' for Europe, just hours after Kyiv and the Black Sea port of Odesa were rocked by an unusually intense wave of air strikes. Speaking at a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest on November 7, Zelenskiy renewed his appeals for more support for his war-torn country ahead of an informal EU summit the next day to be hosted by Hungary, which currently holds the 27-member bloc's rotating presidency. He also said he has already spoken with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump about how both the United States and Europe need to be strong for each other's benefit amid the 'many challenges' facing the world. 'There has been much talk about the need to yield to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, to back down, to make some concessions. It's unacceptable for Ukraine and suicidal for all Europe,' Zelenskiy said in his speech, which came two days after Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Speaking later at a news conference, he said he was not aware of any details of Trump's plan to end the war quickly and that he had not discussed it with him. He said he believed Trump wanted to end the war quickly, but this did not necessarily mean it would happen. He also said talk of introducing a cease-fire without first agreeing security guarantees for Ukraine was 'very dangerous.' 'A cease-fire when there are no security guarantees...is a preparation for the continuation of the occupation,' he said. Trepidation has swept across Europe since the victory given Trump's oft-stated skepticism over U.S. military support for Ukraine.'The concept of 'peace through strength' has proven itself and is needed now. Showing weakness or selling out Europe's positions won't buy a just peace. Peace is the reward only for the strong,' Zelenskiy added. Zelenskiy was welcomed to the meeting by right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has maintained close ties with Putin and has spoken against EU sanctions on Moscow. Orban also has close relations with Trump. NATO chief Mark Rutte, in a pitch to secure Trump's support for Ukraine, told journalists upon arrival in Budapest that the sending troops by North Korea to aid Russia in Ukraine posed a direct threat to the United States. 'What we see more and more is that North Korea, Iran, China, and of course Russia are working together, working together against Ukraine,' Rutte said. 'At the same time, Russia has to pay for this, and one of the things they are doing is delivering technology to North Korea, which is now threatening in future the mainland of the U.S., continental Europe,' he warned. 'I look forward to sit down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively,' Rutte said. North Korean troops are already fighting for Russia, according to Zelenskiy, who told reporters during the news conference that they already had sustained 'losses' on the battlefield. The gathering in Budapest came as Ukraine shot down 74 of the 106 drones that Russia launched early on November 7 at targets in nine Ukrainian regions -- Odesa, Mykolayiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Chernihiv -- while 22 others were lost after being jammed by Ukrainian electronic warfare systems. Russian strikes early on November 7 sparked fires and caused damage in five districts of Kyiv, which was under Russian attack for eight hours, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported on Telegram.Drone debris fell in the the districts of Pechersk, Holosiyivskiy, Solomyansk, Obolonsk, and Podilsk, Klitschko said, adding that two people were injured by falling drone debris.Klitschko reported that the upper floors of a multistory building in Pechersk were burning and residents were being evacuated.In Odesa, a high-rise apartment building was damaged and one man was injured by falling debris after Ukrainian air defenses shot down Russian drones over the Black Sea port, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported.Telegram channels published a video of a fire on the first floor of a nine-story building in Odesa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olqrlxG7vNvOO	2024-11-07T15:36:49-08:00	
How Chinese Nationalism Is Sending Jitters Through The Arctic – A...	By Jane Tang On an early morning in late July, a luxury expedition cruise ship, boasting the latest in high-end Arctic travel, made a slow approach to the docks of Ny-Ålesund, a remote settlement in Norway’s Svalbard Islands. At 79 degrees north latitude, Ny-Ålesund is the northernmost inhabited outpost on Earth. Isolated in the Arctic’s desolate winter, it hosts just 30 year-round residents. Newayer, a Chinese travel agency, chartered the vessel for 183 tourists from Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing. Each passenger paid at least $13,000 for a two-week 'Three Arctic Islands' tour, marketed as an exclusive opportunity to reach the 'top of the Earth,' complete with 'the luxury of Chinese hospitality.' Clad in matching red jackets bearing a polar bear logo, the travelers disembarked at their first stop: China’s Yellow River Research Station in Ny-Ålesund. There they marked the 20th anniversary of the station – one of several research facilities established on Svalbard by different nations. More than 100 Chinese tourists waved national flags beneath a Chinese Communist Party-style banner hung on the research station’s door. The travel agency’s blog likened the celebration to 'raising the Chinese national flag during the Olympics.' Among the participants, a woman in a People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, uniform was seen saluting and posing for photos. A PLA Ground Force patch is visible on her right arm, two professional cameras are slung over her shoulders. The episode has raised serious alarm in Norway, according to experts and government discussions reviewed by RFA and NRK. Military function and symbolism on Svalbard is highly restricted, and a treaty that governs foreign presence on the island forbids military activity. Yet Chinese interests have blatantly disregarded these prohibitions, in what experts say is a prime example of China’s increasing willingness to push the bounds of legal acceptability to exert its influence and power. Indeed, RFA and NRK can reveal that at least eight tourists on the cruise were PLA veterans, with at least one still appearing to hold an on-going (though not active duty) role with the Chinese armed forces. The PLA-linked tourists participated in a co-ordinated display of nationalism in the Arctic while on board their cruise ship and on Svalbard. The jingoistic displays align with what experts regard as 'gray zone' tactics employed by Beijing, in which blurry lines between civilian and military actions are exploited to exert influence. It comes as China-watchers warn that the West is ill-prepared to address the geopolitical consequences of this flexing of power. 'The big picture of China’s ambitions in the Arctic is that it reflects a clear, long-term strategic goal: China wants to be a significant presence in the Arctic,' says Isaac Kardon, a senior fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington D.C. think tank. Since declaring itself a 'near-Arctic state' in 2018—despite lacking territorial claims—China has steadily built its presence through legal, military, commercial, and individual channels. Svalbard has become the latest frontline. An Arctic Battleground for Great Powers A remote Norwegian archipelago roughly twice the size of Hawaii, Svalbard lies less than 1,000 kilometers from the North Pole, some 650 kilometers north of mainland Norway. A land of dramatic peaks and glaciers, its location is of strategic as well as scientific importance. Its proximity to Russia’s Kola Peninsula—home to the Russian Northern Fleet and nuclear submarines—positions it as a critical focal point for military and resource interests. Radar data collected from Svalbard can aid in missile trajectory calculations and satellite calibration. Experts caution that, in the event of a war, missile routes could increasingly traverse the Arctic skies—covering the shortest distance from Beijing to Washington. 'The role Svalbard might play in a large-scale conflict involving the Arctic cannot be ignored,' warns a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'If tensions with the United States continue to worsen, the Arctic becomes the only other viable route (for China) to Europe for significant volumes of energy,' says Kardon. As melting ice opens up new shipping lanes, the waters around Svalbard are set to become even more pivotal in global trade and shifting geopolitical dynamics. In the face of these changes, governance of Svalbard-- until now a sleepy affair-- has come into focus. A 1920 treaty granted Norway sovereignty over the archipelago while allowing signatory nations to engage in peaceful scientific and economic activities. The treaty prohibits any 'warlike purposes,' and gives Norway authority to enforce these restrictions on the islands. Russia has had a decades-long presence, first with mining operations during the Cold War. Today, there is still an active mining town, Barentsburg, and a Russian research station. China joined the Svalbard Treaty in 1925 but didn’t establish a scientific presence until 2004; the founding of the Yellow River Research Station marked a significant step forward in its Arctic ambitions. According to China’s official website, the station supports scientific observation, monitoring, and research in glaciology, and conducts research in ecology, space physics, atmospheric studies, and geographic information. Its goal is to 'contribute to global efforts in addressing climate change and other challenges,' the website says. Not everyone is convinced that it is all benign. 'The fact is, when we’re talking about Russia and China, we are talking about authoritarian states. There’s no such thing really as a completely civilian, independent agency, especially one with very strong strategic implications,' says Marc Lanteigne, a Political Science professor at The Arctic University of Norway. 'Any activity, regardless of how civilian in nature it is, will produce information which will get back to the Chinese military.' Last year, Russia held what Norwegian officials described as a militaristic parade in Barentsburg—something never before seen on Svalbard—in support of Moscow’s troops in Ukraine. Dozens of trucks, tractors, and snowmobiles moved through the town waving Russian flags. A Russian company was fined for unauthorized use of a Mi-8 helicopter that flew overhead. Norway is concerned about the rise of Russian—and now Chinese—nationalist displays on the island, says Lanteigne. An internal report from the Norwegian Polar Institute, the governing authority on Svalbard Island, sounded alarm over the high-profile July celebration staged by the cruise ship tourists in front of the Chinese research station. The report, seen by RFA and NRK, found the activities 'particularly problematic' as they showed a clear disregard for regulations. A month before the event, Norwegian authorities had explicitly denied the station permission to hang a celebratory banner given its nationalistic nature-- but the station displayed it anyway, with Chinese scientists photographed posing in front of it. The Institute noted that tourists appeared 'well-prepared' with Chinese flags and stickers, and that photographs were organized in such a way that 'it is likely that the photos will be used by the Chinese authorities.' It made specific mention of the woman in the military fatigues, which they identified as PLA garb. The report noted that the authority was unsure what to do. Camilla Brekke, Director of the Norwegian Polar Institute later told RFA and NRK: 'New Ålesund is a Norwegian research station, and we do not see it as useful for the various institutions that rent premises there to hang banners, as we want a unified research nation.' 'It would not be a successful practice if various research institutions in Ny-Ålesund start hanging such banners on the houses they rent.' Some experts fear the government has been caught on the back foot. 'I get the feeling that the Norwegian government is still playing catch-up on this,' says Lanteigne. The government’s overall silence about its geopolitics has consequencesaccording to Andreas Østhagen, a Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute think tank. 'When it comes to Svalbard and foreign and security policy, Norway’s strategy has been to sit quietly and do nothing,' he wrote. 'The less frank and transparent Norway is about issues pertaining to Svalbard, the more misunderstandings and conspiracy theories are likely to emerge, even among close allies.' Following its internal report, the Norwegian government said its representatives had met with the Chinese embassy in Oslo and reiterated the expectations for international guests, emphasizing that 'all activities in Ny-Ålesund must be civil.' They requested an explanation of the person in military dress and were told that the person 'was a private citizen or cruise tourist wearing military-style clothing deemed appropriate for the Arctic wilderness,' they told RFA and NRK. The Chinese embassy in Norway said that the cruise passengers were private tourists visiting Svalbard independently. 'The Chinese scientific team in Ny-Ålesund did not invite any tourists to participate in the relevant celebration activities,' the embassy told RFA and NRK. 'China has always actively participated in Arctic affairs in accordance with international law,' it said. It did not directly address the questions of why banners and flags were displayed despite prior warnings and why military dress was allowed. Entering the ‘gray zone’ Fan Li, the CEO of Newayer, the tour agency, told RFA and NRK that their tour group informed the research station of its plans to stage a celebration at Yellow River, and to hang banners and wave Chinese flags outside the station. The station never objected or even raised it as an issue. 'The staff at the Yellow River Station came out to engage with us, and everyone was quite happy about that,' Li told RFA and NRK. A video of the tour group’s celebration was posted to Newayer’s social media account. It further features eight guests telling the camera that they are PLA veterans and perform coordinated military salutes to China while a patriotic song plays as a soundtrack. Afterward, passengers gathered to share their stories of service in the PLA. Li said that the presence of veterans on board was merely a 'coincidence' and that when Newayer realized the connection, the company organized a ceremony and incorporated the clip into its video. According to Li, all of those featured were retired, as it’s difficult for active military members in China to travel abroad. However, one cruise participant, who identifies herself in the video as Yin Liu, was photographed wearing military garb bearing the insignia of the PLA on Svalbard. On camera, Liu says she enlisted in 1976 and fought in Vietnam in 1984 and gave the name of her unit. Ying Yu Lin, an expert on the PLA at Tamkang University in Taiwan, identified Liu’s fatigues as a 'Type 21' training uniform issued by China’s Ministry of Defense in 2023. It is restricted to military personnel and would not be accessible to civilians, Lin said. The 'Type 21' uniform can be seen on the Chinese Defense Department website. Lin added that based on her age, the uniform, and other descriptions, it was likely that Liu was a member of a local militia unit. Militia units are one of three branches of the Chinese armed forces, the other two being the PLA and the People’s Armed Police, or PAP. Attempts to reach Liu were unanswered by press time. But regardless of her status or those of other PLA-linked tourists, 'the sight of Chinese veterans waving national flags and performing salutes in the Arctic serves as an effective piece of internal propaganda,' says Lin. 'While foreign observers may overlook it, within China, it symbolizes the assertion of influence in a geopolitically significant region.' He added: 'It’s about operating within legal ambiguities—pushing boundaries without directly violating laws. This time, we see veterans in PLA uniform; next time, it could be active-duty soldiers without the uniform, gradually testing international responses and how far they can go.' These displays represent 'classic ‘gray zone’ activity—conduct that doesn’t overtly breach regulations but pushes boundaries,' according to Kardon. 'On one hand, it may appear as patriotic tourists expressing national pride; on the other, it subtly normalizes a more visible Chinese presence, legitimizing scientific activities that can serve dual purposes, like gathering environmental data and military intelligence.' Such incidents can serve to gauge reactions, particularly from Norway and other Arctic nations, helping China understand which behaviors are tolerated, he said. 'Given the strategic importance of the Arctic to the U.S., Russia, and increasingly China, there is little doubt that this expanding presence is deliberate.' Questions of diplomacy But sources familiar with diplomatic discussions say that Norway is unlikely to take a leading role in pushing back against China. 'Like many countries, Norway just doesn’t have a lot of equities in its dealings with China,' says Kardon. Overt criticism or perceived slights can cause notable damage, like in 2010, when Beijing banned imports of Norwegian salmon after its Nobel committee awarded the Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. But as long as that’s the case, room for more muscular tactics in the Arctic will grow. Last month as China celebrated the 75th anniversary of the People’s Republic, the Chinese Coast Guard engaged in joint operations with Russian forces in the Arctic. This was preceded in September by a meeting of Russian and Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss economic development and resource extraction in the region, and earlier, a Chinese and Russian meeting in Svalbard to explore opening a joint research center in Pyramiden, a former Soviet mining hub on the islands. 'So if you’re looking for a pattern here, I would say this is the latest version of what China and Russia are trying to do—find a way to get to the red line without crossing it,' says Lanteigne, referring to the Yellow River celebration incident. 'It is a very subtle signal, one that really demonstrates that China is now starting to deviate more directly from Norway regarding what is and is not proper activity on Svalbard.' Lanteigne views this as a pressing challenge that the Norwegian government must confront head-on. 'I think there needs to be the understanding that with the Arctic beginning to militarize as a whole, Svalbard is caught in it, whether it likes it or not.'

Malaysian PM Lauds China’s Xi As Global South’s ‘Voice’ Day After...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim lauded Chinese President Xi Jinping as 'a new voice for the Global South' during their meeting on Thursday in Beijing, a day after 'America First' candidate Donald Trump won the U.S. election. Xi reciprocated saying his country and Malaysia were good friends and partners that must jointly oppose protectionism and uphold international fairness, although he did not mention Trump or his professed plan to tax almost all imports by 10-20%, but Chinese imports 60%. Anwar met Xi on the last day of his four-day working visit to China, his third trip to Beijing since being named PM in 2022. The Malaysian PM attended the China International Import Expo trade fair in Shanghai during the first three days of the visit. The Malaysian PM visited the United States to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in San Francisco last year, but he has not made an official trip to Washington as PM. In his opening remarks on the visit to meet Xi, Anwar commended the Chinese president for emphasizing 'values and civilization' and his 'passion for the people, the poor, and humanity.' 'More importantly, your vision for global security and development resonates deeply with us,' Anwar said to Xi. 'This is why we view China not just as a leader of the East but as a voice for the Global South, one that champions the interests of the developing world.' Still, Anwar also said that Malaysia will stick to its 'strategic independence, and is willing to maintain close multilateral coordination with China to help safeguard regional peace, stability, development and prosperity,' reported China’s state news agency Xinhua. For his part, Xi said China and Malaysia should 'firmly support each other, jointly oppose protectionism, … [and] advocate [for] an equal and orderly multipolar world,' reported Xinhua. The Chinese president further said his country and Malaysia must also ensure 'inclusive economic globalization that benefits all, push for the reform and improvement of the global governance system, and uphold international fairness, justice and the common interests of developing countries.' Xi said China supported Malaysia’s rotating presidency of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year, as well as the regional bloc’s centrality and independence. Referring to Anwar’s comment about Malaysia retaining its 'strategic independence,' Xi said China supports the Southeast Asian nation in upholding that autonomy and 'choosing a development path suited to its national conditions.' During a speech at Peking University earlier on Thursday, Anwar outlined a vision for a Southeast Asia that interacts constructively with global powers 'while maintaining independence and promoting regional stability.' Bridge between East Asia, Southeast Asia Asia, Middle East At the trade fair in Shanghai earlier this week, Anwar invited Xi to a summit next year with ASEAN and the Arab nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). 'As ASEAN chair next year, Malaysia aims to enhance regional cooperation and inclusive, rules-based regional framework,' the Malaysian PM said on Tuesday. 'By linking China, ASEAN, and the GCC, we can build a bridge between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, enabling deeper economic, cultural, and strategic ties.' The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, all oil-rich countries with substantial investments in Southeast Asia. For Malaysia, the potential benefits of the trilateral forum go beyond economic gains, Lee Pei May, an assistant professor of political science at the International Islamic University Malaysia told BenarNews. 'This is the first attempt to build a bridge between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, allowing for discussions on critical issues like regional stability and Middle Eastern conflicts.' And although Anwar’s invitation to China was made before the announcement of Trump’s win, the Malaysian PM seemed to have spoken presciently about building new partnerships in the broader region now that sweeping U.S. import taxes, especially on Chinese goods, are a certainty. China’s BRICS support ‘invaluable’ Trump’s expected inward-looking policies, analysts believe, will lead to much unpredictability and could also cause security problems, particularly in the Asia Pacific, analysts told Benar News on Wednesday after the former president’s victory. Perhaps to prepare for such a contingency, Anwar’s participation in the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, included meetings with Chinese officials, investors, and over 23 top industries’ 'captains' from advanced technology and manufacturing sectors. Benedict Weerasena, research director at Kuala Lumpur think-tank Bait Al Amanah, said Anwar discussed expanding cooperation in digital economy initiatives, manufacturing, and infrastructure development with Chinese officials. This signaled a bid to take Malaysia-China relations 'to the next level,' Benedict told BenarNews. As it is, Anwar publicly on Thursday said that China’s support for Malaysia becoming a partner of BRICS has been 'invaluable.' The Southeast Asian nation had in July applied to become a partner of BRICS, an economic bloc that includes Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, in addition to China, and officially became one late last month. Malaysia’s BRICS membership For some observers, Malaysia’s BRICS partnership only solidifies their perception that the Southeast Asian nation under Anwar is becoming closer to Beijing, although the PM has denied it. And Malaysia already had strained ties with the U.S. since October 2023 because of Washington’s support for Israel in the Gaza conflict. BRICS is viewed by some analysts as a forum to provide Asian nations with alternative partnerships that could reduce their reliance on Western institutions or markets. The anticipated worsening of U.S.-China ties under Trump – like under his first 2017-2021 presidency – may complicate Malaysia’s position if the U.S. president-elect feels slighted, regional observers noted. Chong Ja Ian, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, told BenarNews that the second Trump administration may adopt a more transactional and punitive approach. 'The risk is if the next Trump administration sees this as Malaysia siding with China in the U.S.-China rivalry, it may line Malaysia up for additional punishment from the United States,' the professor said. 'Anwar says he won’t tolerate unilateral decisions, but it’s an open question how he intends to rebuff, say, a blanket tariff imposed by the United States on Malaysian imports.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olry-EUX16IZ5	2024-11-07T15:30:48-08:00	
Asia Must Act Decisively On Climate Change – OpEd	Countries in Asia are set to experience some of the most severe consequences of the climate crisis and this unique vulnerability underscores the urgent need for proactive and collaborative climate action. Asia’s rapid industrialization and reliance on fossil fuels have accelerated its contribution to global carbon emissions, while geographic and socioeconomic factors make the region especially susceptible to rising temperatures, sea level increases and extreme weather events. According to a report released last week by the Asian Development Bank, Asian nations are significantly underfunded in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The annual financing requirement for climate adaptation across developing Asian countries ranges between $102 billion and $431 billion, yet they received only $34 billion in 2021-2022. This funding gap reflects the challenge that Asia faces in both reducing emissions and preparing for the inevitable impacts of a warming world. Asia is the most populous continent, home to approximately 60 percent of the world’s population. Countries like China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam have high population densities, especially along coastlines, where communities face the dual threats of sea level rises and intensified storm surges. The report noted that, if Antarctic sea ice collapses, sea levels in Asia-Pacific could rise at twice the global average, putting 300 million people at risk. In addition, many of these populations lack the infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, leaving them highly vulnerable to both loss of life and economic disruption. Asia’s economic structure still heavily depends on fossil fuels, with the Asian Development Bank report estimating that governments in the region provided nearly $600 billion in subsidies for fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas in 2022. The issue is that such subsidies make fossil fuels more affordable, providing less incentive to shift toward cleaner energy sources. Consequently, developing Asia reportedly contributes nearly half of global emissions, with China alone responsible for two-thirds of this total. This dependence not only hampers Asia’s ability to reduce its carbon output but also increases the risks associated with climate-related health impacts, such as respiratory illnesses from air pollution. This means that, without decisive intervention, the economic repercussions for Asian countries will be severe. If emissions continue to rise unchecked, regional economies may face a 17 percent gross domestic product decline by 2070. Higher temperatures are already reducing productivity, as heat stress makes working conditions unbearable, particularly in sectors like agriculture and construction. In addition, agricultural yields, fisheries and forestry — vital components of many Asian economies — will suffer, further threatening food security and livelihoods. Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and India could see the most drastic economic downturns. Asian governments ought to prioritize a transition to renewable energy to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Investment in solar, wind and hydropower infrastructure will not only reduce emissions but also create millions of green jobs. The Asian Development Bank estimates that 'aggressive decarbonization' could generate 1.5 million energy sector jobs by 2050. Nevertheless, this shift requires regional policies that incentivize renewables, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and provide tax incentives or subsidies for green energy adoption. In addition, Asian countries need to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, particularly in coastal cities and rural areas vulnerable to flooding and storms. Constructing flood barriers, creating mangrove forests to buffer against storm surges and developing robust urban drainage systems could significantly reduce the loss of life and property. Bangladesh’s investment in flood shelters that have drastically reduced storm-related fatalities serves as a model for other nations. Furthermore, in order to bridge the financing gap, Asian nations must advocate for more substantial international support and create partnerships with multilateral institutions like the World Bank. Given the scale of the crisis, both private and public sector investments are crucial. Asian countries can explore green bonds and international carbon markets to attract the necessary funds for adaptation and mitigation projects. Effective climate action demands transparent and accountable governance. It is critical to develop comprehensive frameworks that align with Asian countries’ commitments under international climate treaties. This involves setting clear roadmaps toward net-zero emissions, enforcing environmental regulations and integrating climate considerations into all sectors of national policy. Such governance reforms are essential to ensure that actions are consistent, measurable and enforceable. It is worth noting that, although Asia-Pacific is currently the largest emitter, historically, the US and Europe have contributed the most atmospheric carbon. This shared responsibility highlights the need for Western nations to support Asian countries in their climate efforts. Increased financial aid, technology transfer and expertise from the West can accelerate Asia’s transition to sustainable development. Providing these resources would also foster cooperation and goodwill in addressing a challenge that transcends borders. Any economic downturn in Asia due to climate change would reverberate worldwide, given the interconnectedness of global supply chains and financial markets. Europe and the US rely on Asian economies for manufacturing, resources and labor. By supporting climate resilience in Asia, Western nations can mitigate risks to their own economies. Additionally, as climate change fuels migration, political instability and resource scarcity, assisting Asia would reduce the potential for conflicts and humanitarian crises that could impact the West. In a nutshell, the climate crisis in Asia is no longer a distant threat but a present reality with wide-reaching implications. Immediate action is essential to limit and adapt to its impacts. Asian countries need both domestic reform and international support to bridge the financial gap, transform their energy landscapes and prepare for the worst-case scenarios. The cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of proactive measures. By acting decisively now, Asian countries, with support from the global community, can protect their people, economies and natural environments from the worst impacts of climate change.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olk4N6JyS2bBV	2024-11-07T15:29:23-08:00	
Biden Calls Trump Victory ‘Fair’ And ‘Transparent’	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President Joe Biden, long a political adversary of President-elect Donald Trump, declared Thursday that Trump’s election this week to a second nonconsecutive four-year term in the White House was 'fair' and 'transparent,' and that there would be a peaceful transfer of power on January 20. Biden, speaking to dozens of his White House aides in the Rose Garden, said he accepted that Trump had defeated his vice president, Kamala Harris. 'The will of the people always prevail,' Biden said, 'As I’ve said many times, you can’t love your country only when you win. And you can’t love your neighbor only when you agree.' But Biden, a Democratic political figure for five decades, lamented what might have been — for the vice president he picked to run alongside him in 2020 to succeed him. He praised her campaign as 'inspiring' and said she 'gave her whole heart and effort.' 'We lost this battle,' Biden said. 'Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. We’re going to be okay, but we need to stay engaged. We need to keep going. And above all, we need to keep the faith.' Biden described his single term as the U.S. leader as 'an historic presidency' that will be 'changing people’s lives' for years to come, especially infrastructure improvements throughout that the country that he pushed to congressional approval during the first two years of his presidency. Biden, who ousted Trump from power in the 2020 election, said in a seven-minute address that he is leaving his Republican political rival and now his successor 'the strongest economy in the world.' While economic numerical standards support that assessment, voter exit polling showed to a significant degree that Trump supporters disapproved of Biden and Harris’ handling of the American economy, the world’s largest, because rising consumer prices throughout their time in office sharply squeezed household budgets. Trump vowed during his campaign, without saying how, that he would bring down inflation. He has proposed new tax cuts during his upcoming administration, which would put more money in the pockets of consumers, particularly the wealthiest, and corporate coffers, but could also balloon the country’s long-term national debt that already totals nearly $36 trillion. Biden called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him and invited him to the White House soon to discuss their handover of power. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Thursday that if Trump wants U.S. intelligence briefings, he will get them. An ODNI spokesperson said the agency 'is acting consistent with the tradition, in place since 1952, of providing intelligence briefings to the president-elect,' although it was not known whether Trump has made such a request. Key appointments Meanwhile, Trump is moving quickly to consider appointments to key positions in his new White House administration and could name some choices within days. He has been huddling with aides at his oceanside Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida to mull over his options. Even before the election, transition chiefs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon met with some potential candidates for top jobs, either in the White House or to head the government’s Cabinet-level departments and an array of other agencies. Trump could name the world’s richest man, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, a staunch advocate and campaign donor for Trump, to a new position to find government inefficiencies and curb spending excesses. Another major Trump political supporter, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a scion of a U.S. Democratic Party dynasty, could be named to oversee health issues, even though he has rebuffed COVID vaccinations as unneeded. Several Wall Street financiers are under consideration for top-level economic positions, and Trump aides say that some Republican senators may be tapped to head Cabinet-level agencies. Trump aides also have prepared a long list of possible executive orders and regulation reversals for him to sign on his first day in office, to end policies that have been adopted by Biden over the last four years. Biden was running for reelection against Trump until his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June and falling poll numbers forced him from the contest. Biden quickly endorsed Harris. In a statement Wednesday, Biden praised Harris for her campaign, saying, 'She’s been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage and character. 'Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what’s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just and full of more opportunities for all Americans,' Biden said. VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olgnFCzTaAsyb	2024-11-07T15:27:20-08:00	
2 Kazakh Zhuzes’ Subjection To Dzungars And Qing Dynasty In 17-19...	Back in 2015, Japanese documentary writer Keiko Kawasoe predicted that a 'serious dispute' would arise between Russia and China over Kazakhstan’s territory and resources in the future. In her article, published by Sankei Shimbun and translated and republished in the Russian media under the title 'China and Russia’s War over Kazakhstan’s Resources' she wrote: 'China, led by Xi Jinping, and Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, are engaged in a bitter struggle for Kazakhstan… It appears that a serious dispute will flare up between China and Russia over the territory and natural resources of Kazakhstan'. Chinese-Russian Non-Contact Dispute Over Kazakhstan It has been almost ten years since then. Even if such a dispute is already happening, it is not yet being done out in the open. But other times, some things that give an idea about it spill into the media. They look like trial balloons sent out to test each other's reactions to their claims concerning Kazakhstan. Well, judge for yourself: here are just a few examples of how things have happened concerning this matter. In spring 2020, an article entitled 'Why is Kazakhstan Seeking to Return to China' appeared on the Chinese website www.sohu.com. It, according to the Russian media, 'states that: - The lands that Kazakhstan now occupies were Chinese territories at different times (when there were states such as Dzungar Khanate, Qing Empire), 'but Russia took advantage of the opportunity to occupy the lands of the Qing Empire, and Kazakhstan returned to Russia'; - 'People in Kazakhstan believe that they are of mixed Han descent'. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador and expressed diplomatic protest over that article. That was an understandable reaction to it. Yet there seemed to have been even more anxiety about the said article among the Russian policy-makers and political experts. This is evidenced by a piece Liubov Stepushova entitled 'Why has China announced its claims on Kazakhstan: Should we give credibility to Nursultan's [Astana's] anger?', and published by Pravda.ru. She came to the following conclusion: 'It is obvious that the author [of the Chinese article] expresses the point of view of a part of the Chinese elite, who considers the territory of Kazakhstan and its resources to be their own… In fact, Chinese money, like any other, 'doesn’t smell', and the Kazakh elite have been stuffing their wallets with money coming through Chinese investment projects for a long time'. Liubov Stepushova also quoted Yuri Solozobov, an associate of the National Strategy Institute of the Russian Federation, as saying 'that China is a very manageable country, so no statement, especially on the official website responsible for dealing with international politics, appears by chance'. Hence, 'the emergence of this [article on the Chinese website www.sohu.com] 'is someone's directive, a trial balloon, approved at the very top, and that is how it was seen by Kazakh diplomats'. Afterward, it was already the Russian spokespersons who embarked on doing a similar task. In December 2020, an article appeared in the Turkish-language press entitled ‘Russia launched a hybrid war against Kazakhstan, according to the scenario tested earlier in Ukraine’. It should be recalled that at that time, several members of the Russian State Duma made territorial claims against the Central Asian country, stating that Northern Kazakhstan had been ‘a great gift from Russia’. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry, just as it had been done in the case of the Chinese website, firmly rejected these statements, making it clear that the official Nur-Sultan (Astana) was not ready to put up with them. But that only seemed to make Russian MPs attack Kazakhstan more. Evgeny Fyodorov, a State Duma deputy and a member of the Central Political Council of the ruling United Russia party, declared the Russian rights to the whole of Kazakhstan. In particular, he said the following: 'Do you want to part [with Russia], comrade Nazarbayev, Tokayev, and [the ones in] the Kazakh Foreign Ministry? All right, take your suitcases, return [us] the territories [of Kazakhstan], the city of Verny (Almaty), and everything else, and leave'. In 2021, those undertakings by Russian MPs expanded into a vast media campaign of anti-Kazakhstani propaganda in Russia. In the period from August to December of that year, Russia was subjecting Kazakhstan - through the media forces and political circles close to the Kremlin - to all kinds of information attacks, ranging from threats disguised as persuasion to outright threats of interference in its internal affairs, unless the Central Asian nation follows in the wake of Russian interests. That year ended with a statement by Nikita Mendkovich, a political analyst and expert at the Russian International Affairs Council, that 'all this [Nursultan's (Astana's) failure to heed the criticism and advice from Russia] might mean that the issues of foreign and domestic policy of Kazakhstan will be dealt with not by Tokayev and the current generation of elites, but by some other people' (‘Flirting with nationalists can lead to the collapse of the Kazakh [ruling] power’, Ukraina.ru, 12.09.21). At the very beginning of 2022, the events of what became later known in Kazakhstan as ‘Bloody January’ happened. On January 6, Reuters reported that 'Russia sent in paratroopers to put down a countrywide uprising'. And then the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that 'On January 10, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov'and'with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister MukhtarTileuberdi'. On January 11, 2022, a decision was made to withdraw troops of Russia and other CSTO member countries from Kazakhstan. That action may have somehow diminished the Russian expansion-minded spokespersons' appetites for Kazakhstan's territory. Thus, following the January 2022 unrest in Kazakhstan, some Russian media started playing the card of the need of ‘protecting… the Kazakhs from the Middle Zhuz, who are historically and mentally close to us [Russians]’, in contrast to ‘the southern Kazakhs’, and, most importantly, of the ‘deprivation’ of the potentially very rich, but actually ‘poverty-stricken West’ (the Junior Zhuz) in the face of the Senior (Southern) Zhuz elites' domination in the country as a whole. A rather direct has been State Duma deputy Mikhail Delyagin, when speaking on this matter: 'Unless Northern Kazakhstan, along with Central [the Middle Zhuz] and Western Kazakhstan [the Junior Zhuz], rejoins their Homeland [Russia] as a result of the upcoming events, it will be … well, like ditching Donbas [non-admission of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic to Russia]'. The title of the relevant article brings the substance of his speech: 'The main point in establishing order in Kazakhstan is to return the Russian lands' - Mikhail Delyagin'. So, the Kremlin sort of sent a very simple message to Beijing through the words of one of the most popular politicians, economists, and MPs in Moscow: from now on, Russia is claiming the right not to the whole of Kazakhstan but the Middle Zhuz and Junior Zhuz traditional territories that cover, respectively, Northern and Central Kazakhstan; and Western Kazakhstan. Thus, the Russian side kind of made the Chinese side understand that they weren't laying any claim to that part of the Central Asian country on which the latter has a claim. Here are some pieces of proof. Globalnews.kz, in an article entitled 'Does China lay claim to Balkhash? Kazakhstan is urged to appeal to the UN' quoted the Chinese source (on Baidu, July 29th, 2023) as saying: 'If we want this territory back, we must first rely on historical and political factors to accurately study [the situation with] Balkhash, as times change, and so does national sovereignty. We are engaged in serious negotiations about rights and interests'. So, if we are to believe even some of the above, it seems that the Chinese kind of lay claim to the territory of Kazakhstan east of Lake Balkhash, or, in other words, up to Lake Balkhash. At the same time, Russian MP Delyagin and his kind in Russia are exactly laying claim to almost the rest of the Kazakhstani territory that lies north and west of Lake Balkhash. There is no information about whether such an interpretation has satisfied the Chinese or not. But seemingly, they go on pushing their agenda on the matter. How Do The Chinese See Kazakhs? Chinese geneticists analyzed the DNA of ethnic Kazakhs living in China and published their results - Ancestral Origins and Admixture History of Kazakhs - in Molecular Biology and Evolution in July 2024. The following revealings they have made in their study seem to deserve the most attention in the context of the topic under consideration: 1. 'The top 4 populations exhibiting the closest genetic affinity to KZK [the Kazakh population residing in northern Xinjiang, China] were Uyghur, Kalmyk, Hazara, and Even'; 2. 'Although KZK and Kazakhs of Kazakhstan live in different locations, they cannot be separated into 2 distinct populations in terms of genetic makeup'; 3. 'Our analyses indicated that the available data do not support the classification of KZK and KZK.CA [Kazakhs of Kazakhstan] as distinct genetic populations'. Hence, the conclusion suggests that, first, Uyghurs, who live mostly in Chinese Xinjiang, and Mongolian [Kalmyks, Hazaras] and Manchu [Evens] ethnic groups are the closest relatives of the Chinese Kazakhs, with the latter long being part of the ethnically mixed Mongolian-Chinese areas having deep-rooted common historical and cultural traditions; and, second, the above matter applies to all Kazakhs of Kazakhstan without exception, as well. In short, Chinese geneticists have brought the talk back to where it started in 2020: the origin of the Kazakh is related to the peoples of China to a much greater extent than to the ones of Russia. This idea is radically different than the narrative accepted in Kazakhstan about China and the Chinese. Here, it is necessary to digress and provide clarifications for a better understanding of what was said above. 'Description of the Kirghiz-Cossack, or Kirghiz-Kaisak hordes and steppes' by A.Levshin, a Russian statesman, historian, writer, and ethnographer, published in St. Petersburg in 1832, has long been and still is considered the first scientific monograph on the history of Kazakhstan and the Kazakh people. That work was translated into Western European languages and thus formed the foundation for Russian and Western Kazakh studies. It later started to serve as the basis for the formation of the Kazakh national school of studying the historical past of the Kazakhs. During the era after A.Levshin, in tsarist Russia and the USSR, Russian-Soviet and Kazakh historiography on the issue of the history of Kazakhs until they had become Russian subjects was developing largely in line with the Russo-centric paradigm of perceiving the past. According to Soviet-era research and textbooks on the history of the Kazakh SSR (the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic), the Mongol invasion of Central Asia was as disastrous to the Kazakhs’ ancestors as the Mongol attack on Eastern Europe was to the Russians of the time. The feat of Ghayir-Khan Inalchuq, the governor of Otrar in the early 13th century, on the defense of that Khwarezmian city, had at some length been described in those books. Such a vision of the historical past was also present in literature, film, and art. How Do The Russians See Kazakhs? The wars of the Kazakhs with the Oirats and Dzungars, who had been periodically invading their lands in the 17th and 18th centuries, were characterized along the same lines. In the historical consciousness of many generations of Kazakhs, the idea has developed that the Dzungarian raids were as terrifying as the Mongol invasion was. It is quite consistent with the Russian Soviet historical narrative that if there had been no ‘salvation’ by the Russian Empire, then there would have been a mass extermination of the Kazakhs by the Dzungars. And, importantly, the Kazakh historical science, as far as it can be judged, continues to remain faithful to the previous theoretical and conceptual approaches and to follow in the mainstream of Russian and other foreign historiographical traditions in terms of studying the historical past of Kazakhstan. In such conditions, the official historical narrative about the times of the Mongol and Dzungar invasions is increasingly at odds with the self-conscience of the culture of the Kazakhs of the Senior Zhuz (which consists of the descendants of the Niru'un or pure Mongols) and the Middle Zhuz (which mainly consists of the descendants of the Darligin or other Mongols), which does not perceive the culture of the Mongols and Dzungars as alien and hostile. For better disclosure of the topic in question, let us separately address here the subject of the relationship between the Kazakhs and the Oirats (Dzhungars) in the 17th and 18th centuries in the context of assessing what Robert Skidelsky, a Harbin-born British economic historian of Russian origin and a member of the British House of Lords, called 'China’s motive for reviving Pax Mongolica'. By the beginning of the 17th century, the Mongolosphere, as a common continuous space where peoples and their rulers adhered to Genghisid political and legal traditions to varying degrees, had significantly shrunk and was located between the Mongolian-Manchurian steppe in the east and the Turgai (Kazakh) steppe in the west. Until then, there were many independent or semi-dependent states ruled by the Khans from among the descendants of Genghis Khan, who established and developed relations with each other based on their own military and political interests. By then, Pax Mongolica had entered a long period of political fragmentation. The result was the weakening of Mongol influence to the west of the Altai Mountains. Manchus and Oirats On The Path Of Expansion With A Focus On Uniting Pax Mongolica The Mongolian lands themselves were divided into three large parts: Southern Mongolia (Chakhar, ор Tsahar), Northern Mongolia (Khalkha), and Western Mongolia (Oiratia). In Southern Mongolia, there was the Northern Yuan, a rump state that emerged when the Yuan remnants retreated to the Mongolian homeland after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in China in 1368; a state where the name Great Yuan remained in formal use, and the Northern Yuan was the name of the dynasty that ruled there until the end of the reign of the last Genghisid emperor, Ligdan Khan, in the 17th century. In Khalkha, three lines of rulers-khans emerged, bearing the titles of Sechen Khan, Tüsheet Khan, and Zasagt Khan. The northwestern part of Khalkha, where the Khotogoids, a subgroup of Mongol people, lived, was the possession of the Khotogoid rulers, who bore the title of Altan Khan. In Western Mongolia, there was the Oirat Khanate, or the Alliance of the Four Oirat Tribes or the Oirat Confederation, that preceded the creation of the Dzungar Khanate in 1635. By the beginning of the 17th century, in that part of the Great Steppe where Genghisid political and legal traditions continued to prevail, two forces emerged that embarked on the path of expansion with a focus on uniting Pax Mongolica under their rule. These were: the Manchus in the east and the Oirats in the west. In 1606, Nurhaci, the founding father of the Manchu state in China, later known as the Qing dynasty, was bestowed the title of Kundulun Khan (Respected Emperor) by the eastern Mongol tribes' leaders. In 1616, he assumed the title of Genggiyen Han (Brilliant Emperor) and founded the Qing dynasty. In 1634, when Ligden Khan, the last of the paramount Mongol khans, died and his son Ejei submitted to the Qing dynasty, Nurhaci's son, Hong Taiji, sometimes referred to as Abahai in Western literature, was granted the title Bogda Khan (Sacred Khan). On that occasion, the ancient imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty came into the hands of Hong Taiji. His son Fulin later became the first Chinese emperor of the Qing dynasty. In 1636, Hong Taiji proclaimed the Da Qing (Great Pure) dynasty. All the lands and populations that had earlier been subject to the Northern Yuan were now formally under its authority. But a year earlier, in 1635, the Alliance of the Four Oirat Tribes or the Oirat Confederation, which had been only part of the Mongol state of Northern Yuan since 1468, proclaimed the creation of the Dzungar Khanate, centered in the Dzungaria region, currently in the north-westernmost part of China, and headed by Erdeni Batur, who took the title of ‘Hongtaiji’. Thus, Abahai, who had been declared the paramount Mongol khan and given the ancient imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty as a certificate that he was entitled to rule the whole Pax Mongolica, found himself deprived of dominion over the Oirats and sovereignty over the territories that were under their control. Since the very end of the 16th century, the Oirat Confederation, which existed before the creation of the Dzungar Khanate, had been creating conquests on the western peripheries of the Mongolosphere in the same way as the union of Manchu (Jurchen) tribes in alliance with the eastern Mongols had been carrying out the expansion on its eastern peripheries. At that period, the Oirats were leading offensive campaigns oriented on all four sides of the world: in the east, against the Khalkha-Mongol Khans; in the north, on the lands of the Russian yasak population of Southern Siberia, in the west, against the Kazakh Khans, in the south, against Moghulistan, or the Moghul Khanate. Thus, by the time of the creation of the Dzungar Khanate, the Oirats had completely subjugated Moghulistan. As evidenced by Tomila Petrov and Ivan Kunitsyn, members of the Russian mission sent in 1616 from Tobol to the Oirats, the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs, along with the Kyrgyz, were then the latter's subjects. Did the described situation change later on? A.Levshin ('Description of Kirghiz-Cossack, or Kirghiz-Kaysak, hordes, and steppes') pointed out that during negotiations with Russian envoy held in 1642, Erdeni Batur-hongtaiji, the then-ruler of the Dzungar Khanate, during negotiations with Russian envoys, had described the Kazakhs [of the Senior Zhuz] as his subjects, and their ruler, as his relative. Russian ex-diplomat: After The Disintegration Of The USSR, Chinese Claims Against Kazakhstan Have Remained Intact Here is one important thing to mention. Even in Russian-language sources, there are claims that the Dzungar Khanate, which remained an independent state throughout its history, was 'formed after the Oirats had usurped the Northern Yuan state's supreme power to rule on the territory of modern Xinjiang, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Western Mongolia'. After the ancient imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty had come into the hands of Abahai (Hong Taiji), the rights of the supreme power of the Northern Yuan state were transferred to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China from 1644 to 1912, having assembled the territorial base for modern China. These days, Xinjiang is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Western Mongolia is part of the People's Republic of Mongolia. The latter's statehood and territorial integrity were guaranteed by the Yalta Conference held in 1945, where the allies - the leaders of the USSR, the USA, and Great Britain - pledged to recognize the independent status of Mongolia after the end of the war. According to paragraph 1 of the agreement adopted at that conference, the Soviet Union pledged to enter the war against Japan on the side of the Allies on the condition of 'preserving the status quo of Outer Mongolia (the Mongolian People’s Republic)'. On August 14, 1945, the then-Chinese government expressed its willingness to 'recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia within its existing borders' if a plebiscite of its people 'confirmed this aspiration'. The results of a referendum held two months later confirmed 'this aspiration'. And on January 5, 1946, China recognized Mongolia within its existing borders. Regarding the parts of 'the territories of modern Russia and Kazakhstan' over which 'the supreme power of the Northern Yuan had been usurped by the Oirats' in the historical past, Nikolai Platoshkin, a former Russian diplomat, said the following: 'As for [the attitude] of China [towards Kazakhstan]. To this day, part of the Kazakh, Kazakhstani territory... appears in their textbooks as the original lands of China, which were at one time taken away by Russian imperialists, Soviet social-imperialists'. According to him, when Soviet-Chinese relations worsened in the 1960s, 'it was about China’s territorial claims against our country (the USSR)'. 'After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, these claims against Kazakhstan… have remained intact', he added. Throughout its history, the Dzungar Khanate remained an independent state that was not recognized by the Qing Empire, which considered it and the regions and peoples subject to it to be parts of its territory and its vassals who had temporarily come from its power. The Dzungar khans, in turn, sought, either by force or through negotiations, to bring the Genghisid rulers of the Khalkha Mongols in the east and the Senior and Middle Zhuz Kazakhs in the west under their control, and thus increase their territorial, mobilization, and material resources to win back Pax Monlolica from the Manchu dynasty. It was a sort of civil war among different groups of the population of the eastern Great Steppe with a mindset based on the Genghisid political and legal traditions. Since coming to power, the Manchu Qing Dynasty began to praise Genghis Khan as a god, following the customs of Tibetan Buddhism. Nurhaci and Hong Taiji or Abahai, whose son Fulin later would become the first Chinese emperor of the Qing dynasty, claimed that they were the reincarnations of Genghis Khan. During the Qing Dynasty, Genghis Khan and other Mongol leaders of the Middle Ages were treated with special respect in its empire, just as it was the case among the Oirats (the Dzhungars) as well as the Kazakhs of the Middle and Senior Zhuz at that time. The Dzungars, who had the most powerful state union of Mongolian-speaking peoples at the end of the late Middle Ages and the beginning of the New Age, considered themselves the direct successors of the Mongols of the time of Genghis Khan and, having adopted Yeke Caaji, the Mongol-Oyirod Great Code of 1640, conducted an independent foreign and domestic policy. They, in turn, also started reuniting the scattered possessions of the Genghisid rulers through force of arms. Their destructive campaigns against the Khalkha Mongols and Kazakhs, having been undertaken for decades in the spirit of steppe military traditions, substantially disrupted economic life throughout much of the territories that now make up the modern Republic of Kazakhstan and the Mongol People's Republic. It is known from history that from 1599 to 1750, the Dzungars carried out numerous raids on Kazakh lands and were not at all peaceful neighbors. They carried out similar raids on the lands of the Khalkha Mongols. As a result of such expansionist actions of the Dzungars, in the 1680-1690s, the Khalkha Mongolian Genghisid khans began to state their willingness to swear allegiance to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China, and in the 1730-1740s, the Kazakh Genghisid khans to the Romanov dynasty, which ruled Russia. But, as they say, politics is a changeable business. Later, there were also cases when some Genghisid rulers of the Khalkhas and Kazakhs combined formal subjection to China and Russia with establishing allied relations with the Dzungar leaders and supporting the latter in their confrontation with their various enemies. How Did The Senior And Middle Zhuz Kazakhs Become Subjects To Chinese Emperor? Thus, according to Wikipedia, in 1751, when two contenders for the Khan's throne in the Dzungar state, noyons Davaci and Amursanaa, were defeated in the struggle for power against Lama-Dorji, they fled in search of salvation to the Kazakhs. There, they were given shelter by Abylai, the Khan of the Middle Zhuz of the Kazakhs since 1743, who called himself 'the son of Galdan-Tseren [the previous Dzungar Khan]' and, in his letter addressed to the Kalmyk female ruler dowager Darmabala, offered her 'to consider him as her younger brother'. A year later, Davaci and Amursanaa returned to their homeland and resumed the struggle for the Khan's throne. In 1753, Davaci became the ruler of the Dzungar Khanate. During the Third Oirat-Manchu War, which took place in 1755-1759, according to Wikipedia, on one side were the Dzungar Khanate led by Davaci and Amursanaa, the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs led by Abylai Sultan, and the Khalkha Mongols led by Chingunjav, a prince ruler, and on the other, the armed forces of the Qing Empire and also other Khalkha Mongols. The war ended in the ultimate defeat and liquidation of the Dzungar Khanate. In 1759, Ablai Khan, formally having already been a subject of the Russian throne, went personally to Beijing and became subject to the Bogda Khan (a title in the Mongolian language used by emperors of the Qing dynasty of China), or the Chinese Emperor as a ‘wang’ - a vassal prince. And in 1762 he sent his son to the capital of the Qing Empire as an amanat, or hostage. Thus, following the Third Oirat-Manchu war, the Senior Zhuz, as a vassal possession of the Dzungar Khan, and the Middle Zhuz, as an ally of the utterly defeated and abolished Dzungar Khanate, became subjects to the Great Bogda Ejen Khan [Qing emperor], who had emerged victorious from the battle of the two contending powers in the then Pax Mongolica. In Kazakhstan, it is now common to diminish the historical importance of the Qing court's bestowing titles of nobility to the rulers of the Kazakhs [of the Middle Zhuz] - they supposedly were put in such conditions that they had no choice but to agree to receive them and create the appearance of accepting Qing imperial suzerainty, while aiming in doing so, according to the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to strengthen the Kazakh Khanate and to liberate their homeland from the invaders. However, some independent overseas researchers interpret those titles' meanings to those receiving them quite differently: 'of course, when Kazakhs requested titles from the Qing court, the ‘self-appellation’ they asked for reflected, to some extent, the organization of Kazakh society', and 'visits of Qing imperial envoys, grand traditional ceremonies, and imperial edicts from the Qing emperor all helped to give authority to the sultan [the Genghisid ruler] in [the Middle Zhuz] Kazakh society [still having been strongly adhered to the Genghisid political and legal traditions]'. The Manchu Qing dynasty, who ruled China from the Khan City, Khanbalyk (now Beijing), just as the grandson and greatest successor of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, had done, and positioned themselves as their heirs, was most probably seen by the Kazakh Genghisids as the restored seat of power for all countries and peoples of the Genghisid ideology. The factors described above might be the key to explaining why, even in the 1820s, the Middle Zhuz Kazakh rulers continued to confirm allegiance to the Qing dynasty, which had already been a shadow of its former vigor by that time, and still wanted it to legitimize their rule over the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs, while the Kokand Khanate, a tiny state compared to China, already was occasionally making aggressive invasions into Kashgar, i.e., Chinese territories adjacent to Central Asia. At that time, Russian power and influence were on the rise in Central Asia, which was not true for Chinese power and influence. So eventually, the Russians, by right of might, put an end to such a double allegiance. Here is how it happened. In 1821, the leaders of the Kazakh tribes of the Middle Zhuz elected Gubaidulla - a grand-son of Abylai Khan, who, back in 1759, was the first to go to Beijing and become a subject of the Chinese emperor as a ‘wang’, a vassal prince - as their Khan. In 1823 Gubaidulla sent his confidant, his younger brother sultan Zhantore, to Beijing as part of the mission seeking an imperial audience. He delivered the Chinese emperor's representative a letter saying that the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs' tribal elders decided that Gubaidulla was to succeed to the title of khan [han]. In response to it, the Daoguang emperor issued imperial instructions to that effect by the end of 1823. In compliance with them, the imperial charter and attributes of the Han's power were sent to the seat of the Middle Zhuz rulers. But that Chinese mission was intercepted by Russian troops. The Kazakh Khan was taken into custody and forced to renounce recognition of his khanship by the Chinese Emperor. He later started a rebellion against the tsarist government, which was suppressed in 1825. Gubaidulla was exiled to inner Russia. From there, he was able to return only in 1840, when what is called the century of humiliation had already begun in China. But the fact remains that in the mid-1820s, the Middle Zhuz ruler, who had been elected by the leaders of the Kazakh tribes of the Middle Zhuz as their Khan and confirmed his subjection to the Chinese Emperor in that capacity, was deposed by the Russian authorities. In contrast to what happened in the case of the Middle Zhuz, the Russian Empire did not challenge the subjection of the population and territory of the Senior Zhuz to Beijing until the beginning of the period in Chinese history called the 'Century of Humiliation' (1839-1849), when Western colonial powers began to divide the weakened Qing Empire into parts. Here is just one example of this. In response to the expressed willingness of Suyuk Ablaikhanov, a son of Ablai Khan, who ruled one of the tribes of the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs, to enter the service of the State of Russia, in 1821, Emperor Alexander I, who had been victorious over Napoleon Bonaparte, bestowed upon him a rank and ordered 'to build for him a house and a mosque on the eastern side of Lake Balkhash'. In 1825, when a Russian military detachment, having reached the named area in the lower reaches of the Karatal River, began to erect those buildings, the Chinese government lodged a protest with St Petersburg. As a result, the buildings were demolished and the detachment was recalled. While the small Uzbek states' rulers in Central Asia turned out to be more active and consistent in their intentions to expand their realms to the north and northeast at that time at the expense of those lands of the Senior Zhuz and, partially, Middle Zhuz Kazakhs, which the Qing dynasty regarded as their own. So, 'a significant part of the territory that belonged to the Senior Zhuz of the Kazakhs ended up' under the control of the city of Tashkent, which had previously been at the intersection of the interests of the Dzungar and Kazakh khanates, as well as the Kokand and Bukhara rulers and which in 1784 became an independent state entity. In 1798, due to the secession of the regions of Southern Kazakhstan to the Tashkent State, Bolat Khan, who had held the title of the Right Tribe han (youbu han) given by the Qing court, lost control over the city of Turkestan and its environs. In 1808 the city came under the control of the Kokand Khanate. After this, the latter continued the conquest of the Kazakh lands. By 1819, the Kokand Khanate subjugated the bulk of the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs’ territory. Later on, the Kokand troops occasionally made incursions into the Chinese Kashgar. The Russians, who were following these events, received information that 'the Chinese were in great fear'. From this, it is clear that by that time, the military power of the Qing Empire, being gradually waning, had already fallen into such decline that it was difficult for them to resist the invasions of troops even from the tiny states on its outskirts. This all seems to have served as a kind of summoning for the Russian Empire to further expand its presence in the Central Asian region. In 1846, Kapal was established as the first Russian military-type settlement in the Southern Balkhash Lake area. By then, the First Opium War had been over, and what was the century of humiliation for China began, in which Russia played a very active part, too. After that, the entire Senior Zhuz annexation to the Russian Empire was only a matter of time. Japanese Researcher: Kazakh Genghisids Fought Over Titles Granted By The Qing Court Jin Noda, associate professor at the Waseda Insitute for Advanced Study, Tokyo, Japan, who published 'A Collection of Documents from the Kazakh Sultans to the Qing Dynasty' in 2010, in his piece entitled 'Titles of Kazakh Sultans Bestowed by the Qing Empire', wrote: 'Soon after Ablay opened relations with the Qing court, he inquired about the sorts of titles the Qing conferred. In his request, he said, 'If the great Emperor (ejen) were to favor me with the title prince (wang), this would be welcome, and if with the title han, this would be even more welcome'. Thus we know he expected to receive the title of either prince, or han'. Noteworthy… is that the Kazakh sultans [Genghisids] fought over titles of nobility granted by the Qing court. This fact buttresses the notion that there was a rivalry among the sultans... over Qing court titles of nobility. From another perspective, it also shows the considerable value attached to the titles of nobility of the Qing court'. According to the Zongtong Yili Shiyi (Matters Concerning Control of Ili) compiled during the Jiaqing period (1796-1820), 'In [the] Kazakh lands], there were hans [the Chinese rendering of khan], princes, dukes, and gentry, all passed on hereditarily. Through this system, the order was brought to the nomads of the area'. Jin Noda also said the following: 'In the Qing historical sources, there are three recognized tribes (bu) - the Left, Right, and West tribes - but these tribes were based on a confusion of the geographical distribution of the three juz [Zhuz] (tribal unions and the three main khan clan lineages)'. A table [Table 1, 'Succession to Qing Nobility Titles within the Khan clans'] he then provided shows the following: '[1] Kazakh Left Tribe han (Hasake Zuobu han) - Abulay [Abylai], [then] Wali [Uali] ('who inherited the han title in Qianlong 47 [1782]'), [then] Ghubaydulla; [2] Right Tribe han (youbu han) - Tauke, [then] Abulmambet [Abilmambet], [then] Bolat, (Toghum [Toghym] 'who inherited the han title in Jiaqing in 14 [1809]'); [3] Right Tribe prince (youbu wang) - Abulfeiz [Abilpeyiz] ('the second son of Abulmambet'), [then] Khankhoja [Khankozha], [then] Jankhoja [Zhankozha]/Janbubek [Zhanbobek] ('who inherited the prince title in Jiaqing in 5 [1800]'); [4] West Tribe han [xibu] - Tursun, then Kuchuk, then Adil, then Sama [Saman]'. Just one look at Table 1 is enough for any ordinary ethnic Kazakh person to understand that Jin Noda himself, having said that 'in the Qing historical sources, there are three recognized tribes (bu) - the Left, Right, and West tribes - but these tribes were based on a confusion of the geographical distribution of the three juz (tribal unions and the three main khan clan lineages)' created confusion with the interpretation of the notion of 'the Left, Right, and West tribes'. Because all the Genghisids, referred to therein as hans and princes of 'the Left, Right, and West tribes', were mostly, if not completely, the rulers of different population groups in one tribal union of Kazakhs - the Middle Zhuz. Wali, or Uali ('who inherited the han title in Qianlong 47 [1782]') inherited the title of khan, or han and power over various clans of the Argyn, Kerey and some other tribes of the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs, according to the will of his father, Abulay, or Abylai. His residences were in the north, not far from where the capital of Kazakhstan is now located. Bolat, a son of Abulmambet [Abilmambet], was the khan of the Argyn and Konyrat tribes of the Middle Zhuz and the Saryuysin clan of the Senior Zhuz. At different periods, he ruled an area extending as far as the middle reaches of the Syrdarya River in the west, the valleys of the rivers Shu and Talas in the east, and the upper reaches of the river Turgai in the north. Khankhoja [Khankozha], his sons Jankhoja [Zhankozha] and Janbubek [Zhanbobek] were the rulers of the Muryn clan of the Naiman tribe of the Middle Zhuz who lived then to the east of the Irtysh River, in what now is the western part of the Abai province of Kazakhstan. Tursun, Kuchuk, Adil, and Sama [Saman] were the rulers of the Kyzai clan of the Naiman tribe of the Middle Zhuz who lived then in the area of the Tarbagatai Mountains and Alakol Lake located in the south-east of nowadays Kazakhstan. Kazakhs' Joining China Is Associated With Name Of Modern Kazakhstan’s Most Praised Historical Figure So, contrary to Jin Noda's claim that 'the Left, Right, and West tribes' in the Qing historical sources 'were based on a confusion of the geographical distribution of the three juz [Zhuz] (tribal unions and the three main khan clan lineages)' has, as far as can be judged, no basis in reality. Here is what comes out of things he said if one looks at them through the eyes of ethnic Kazakhs: the Zongtong Yili Shiyi (Matters Concerning Control of Ili) is by and large about the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs; while 'the Left, Right, and West tribes' mean mainly the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs. They do not say anything about the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs. This vision is entirely consistent with the research conclusion of the Chinese side regarding the appeal of Abylai Khan to the Qing Emperor Qianlong, which reads, 'Information on the Middle and Senior Zhuzes Kazakhs' joining China'. Using his knowledge of the basics of Chinese hieroglyphic writing, the Japanese historian put an enormous amount of work into researching the archive materials based on the documents from the Kazakh Genghisid Sultans to the Qing Dynasty. His work deserves the utmost respect. But as a whole, his vision of Kazakh history, and his ideas about what the Kazakhs are, seem to be to a significant extent in line with the Russo-centric paradigm of perception of Kazakhs and their past. Perhaps that's why it's not surprising, then, that understanding of even the simplest particularities of the internal life of the Kazakh society sometimes eludes him. If he could turn to sources in Kazakh, he would have had no problem with learning about the following: In the historical documents compiled during the Qing Dynasty, the [Middle Zhuz] Kazakhs, who inhabited the area of the Tarbagatai Mountains and Alakol Lake located in the south-east of nowadays Kazakhstan, were known as 'West tribes'; in the Chinese understanding of that time, 'West Kazakhs' were not the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs, i.e. Western Kazakhstan's natives at all. As for the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs, the question of their joining China in the second half of the 18th century did not arise and could not arise. This assumption is indirectly confirmed by the following words from the piece by Jin Noda: 'But Ablay before he ascended the Kazakh throne as khan, had already received the Qing court nobility title of han, and Qing court never conferred the nobility title of han on Nurali [Nuraly], the Kazakh khan of the Small Zhuz'. In Chinese historiography, the Middle and Senior Zhuzes Kazakhs' joining China is associated, as shown above, with the name of Abylai Khan. He is one of the two most praised national historical personalities in modern Kazakhstan, with the second being Abai Kunanbayev, who has been used to be widely regarded as the founder of modern Kazakh literature. It is noteworthy that both that and another of these two names may also bring to mind the prominent real and mythic figures of Mongolian-Oirat peoples - Ablai Taiji (who, by age, would have been suited to be Abylai Khan's grandfather), the founder of the Buddhist monastery Ablai-kit that is in what is now Eastern Kazakhstan, and Abai Geser, an epic hero. Abylai Khan's real name was Abylmansur. People later began calling him ‘Abylai’, after his grandfather. Abai Kunanbayev’s real name was Ibrahim. He got the nickname ‘Abai’ allegedly from his grandmother Zere. Those historical examples may perhaps indicate that in 18th-19th centuries, the Middle and Senior Zhuz Kazakhs still could have remained profoundly influenced by Mongolian-Oirat history, culture and even language. According to the maps compiled at the time, Dzhungaria once covered much of what is now Northern, Eastern, and Southern Kazakhstan. This could not pass without a trace. Here's what else is to be noticed. In the case under consideration, two quotes from a monograph entitled 'The Nogai Horde' ('Nugai Urdasy') by Marcel Akhmetzyanov, a renowned Tatar historian, are of interest. The first one says: 'The keepers of literary legacy were usually the so-called 'zhyrau' [creators of the epic genre] who, as is known, came from the cities of Saraichik, Astrakhan, Azak [Azov], etc. The most notable 'zhyraus' were Asan Kaigy Sabit ugyly (XV century), Shalkiyz zhyrau (1465 - 1560), Dosmambet zhyrau (1493 -1523). The Nogai 'zhyraus' created beautiful dastans [eposes] such as 'Idegey', 'Koblandy', 'Er Targyn', 'Alpamysh', 'Chura Batyr', and 'Kyrk Kyz'. The second one says: 'The immediate descendants and heirs of the Nogai Horde are the Nogais (a Caucasian people), the Crimean, Volga-Ural, and Siberian Tatars, the Kazakhs of the Younger Zhuz, and the Karakalpaks'. Thus, according to Marcel Akhmetzyanov, it turns out that, first, all so-called Kazakh literature up until the 18th century was and is actually Nogai literature; second, only the representatives of the Alshyns or the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs can be considered the heirs of the Nogai genetic and cultural heritage from among all the modern Kazakhs. Yet the Tatar historian leaves unanswered the questions of whose descendants and heirs the Kazakhs of the Senior and Middle Zhuz were and are, and what should be considered their literary and cultural legacy up until the 18th century. Perhaps Marcel Akhmetzyanov isn’t aware that in the literary history of Kazakhstan, there was and is no other literature applicable to those times (15th-17th centuries), besides what he sees as Nogai’s literary legacy. Because of the above, one can't help but wonder: What language did the Senior and Middle Zhuz people speak up until the 18th century? And it remains open.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olimjJbI5_Rua	2024-11-07T15:25:19-08:00	
Constitutional Court In Spain Forces Catholic Brotherhood To Admi...	By Nicolás de Cárdenas Spain’s Constitutional Court (TC, by its Spanish acronym) has ruled that by refusing to admit a woman, a male Catholic brotherhood violated the legal precept of nondiscrimination on the basis of her sex and her right to association. In 2008, María Teresita Laborda Sanz requested to join the Pontifical, Royal, and Venerable Slavery of the Most Holy Christ of La Laguna, a public association of the faithful founded in 1545. Article 1 of the statutes of the brotherhood states that it is 'a religious association of gentlemen, established to promote among its members a more perfect Christian life, the exercise of works of evangelical piety, and the increase of devotion and veneration of the holy image of Our Crucified Lord,' which is why the application was denied. In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that Laborda had not suffered any discrimination because 'the purposes of [the brotherhood] being religious, it did not hold a dominant position in the economic, professional, or labor spheres, so no harm could be caused to the appellant, who could create a new religious association with the same purposes.' The Constitutional Court now considers that the content of the Article 1 of the brotherhood’s statutes 'isn’t protected by the religious autonomy of said association to the extent that the prohibition of women from being part of the association is not based on any reason of a religious or moral nature,' a Nov. 4 statementfrom the TC explains. 'The requirements of religious freedom and the principle of religious neutrality not being in question' derived from Article 16 of the Spanish Constitution, the court considers that 'although a private association has the right to freely choose whom it associates with (Article 22), this right cannot constitute discrimination based on gender when the association holds a ‘privileged’ or ‘dominant’ position in the economic, cultural, social, or professional field,' as the Supreme Court held. However, the Constitutional Court maintained that 'although the activities carried out, from which the appellant is excluded, are acts of religious worship and are not related to any economic, professional, or work-related matters, this does not exclude the possibility that these acts may also have a social or cultural impact, given that culture and religion, being different elements, are not watertight compartments, and a large number of religious [public events] in Spain are part of the history and social culture of our country.' The TC concluded that the plaintiff 'has no possibility of carrying out the same activity of veneration of said image in another brotherhood or confraternity of the municipality.' The ruling of the six judges of the Second Chamber of the Constitutional Court was not unanimous. Expert: Ruling is ‘bad news’ Rafael Palomino, a professor of ecclesiastical law of the state at the Complutense University of Madrid, criticized the ruling of the TC in a comment published on his professional profile on LinkedIn, calling it 'bad news.' To the argument of the TC that considers the plaintiff has had her rights violated because 'she does not have the possibility of exercising the same activity of veneration of said image in another brotherhood or confraternity of the municipality,' Palomino responded: 'What do you mean she cannot carry out the same religious activity? Let the appellant set up another brotherhood, another association, another religion if she wants! This is beginning to be the inverse of the law presided over by a banana republic constitutional judiciary.' Consulted by ACI Prensa, the Diocese of Tenerife declined to comment on the ruling. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. It has been translated and adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olgaIfTt6XUj0	2024-11-07T15:23:09-08:00	
Trump Presidency 2.0: Ending Colonial Mentality In Philippine Def...	President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House should provide opportunities for the Philippines to end the perennial colonial mentality in Philippine defense and foreign policy. When President Ferdinand 'Bong Bong' Marcos Jr assumed office in June 2022, there were enormous expectations that his administration would take this direction by pursuing a flexible foreign and defense policy practiced by most Southeast Asian countries. Otherwise known as 'bamboo diplomacy', this policy delicately balances the country’s bilateral relations with great powers, particularly with the United States and China, with the main goal not only of advancing national interests but also in maintaining regional stability through the principle of peaceful coexistence, neutrality and amity among nations. 'Friends to All Enemy to None' Three years ago, during the presidential campaign, Marcos Jr promised to continue the nationalist policy of his predecessor, former President Rodrigo R. Duterte who attempted to champion a flexible foreign policy by implementing a comprehensive strategic cooperation with China while sustaining, but critically reexamining, military alliance with the US with a pragmatic slogan, 'friends to all and enemy to none'. In January 2023, in fact, Marcos Jr announced during his visit to China to shift to a higher gear Manila ties with Beijing while sustaining defense alliance with the US. The world thought that Marcos Jr would truly uphold an independent Philippine foreign policy as mandated by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. But Marcos Jr surprisingly made a drastic turnaround when he suddenly adopted an excessive pro-Americanism in Philippine defense and foreign policy. This excessive pro-Americanism is a strong indication of the persistence of colonial mentality in the Philippines under his leadership. Excessive Pro-Americanism Marcos Jr policy is now akin to the foreign and security policy of late President Benigno Simeon Aquino III. Like his pro-American mother, the late President Corazon C. Aquino, the late President Aquino III became excessively pro-American when he succumbed to the US influence to challenge China before international arbitration on maritime jurisdictional conflict in parts of the South China Sea (SCS) that Manila calls as the West Philippine Sea (WPS). To counter China, Aquino III even signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the US in 2014 that Marcos Jr expanded in 2023. To date, nine American military facilities are built in Philippine bases as a result of the EDCA expansion under Marcos Jr administration. There are other camps of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) facing the SCS where American troops can easily access as locations of other US satellite military facilities to support various kinds of Pentagon’s military activities in the Philippines. Currently, there is also the controversial and risky deployment of American Typhon mid-range missile system in the Northern Philippines facing Taiwan. AFP Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner even announced his inclination to permanently deploy the Typhon missile in the Philippines. Philippine National Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr also affirmed the indefinite stationing of the Typhon missile in the Philippine to deter China’s 'aggressive and coercive' activities in the WPS. Bases of Philippine Insecurities According to Prof. Roland G. Simulan, American military facilities in the Philippines are, in fact, the bases of Philippine insecurities rather than defense. In the Third Edition of his book, The Bases of Our Insecurity: A Study of the US Military Bases in the Philippines, published in July 2024, Simbulan laments, 'if we allow US troops and warships and aircraft, some of which carry nuclear weapons to use and establish drone bases in any part of the Philippines, we will surely be targeted by China’s missiles or worse by suicide bombers retaliating against US military forces.' Thus, excessive pro-Americanism of Marcos Jr administration is raising the risk of the Philippines to get involved in the worsening American rivalry with China and other US adversaries in the world. The Philippines as a Former American Colony There is nothing new in pro-Americanism in Philippine defense and foreign policy as the Philippines was known worldwide as a direct colony of the US from 1898 to 1935. Because of the struggle of the Filipino people for self-determination and political independence, the US granted the Philippines the Commonwealth Government on November 15, 1935 as a political transition toward sovereign rule. However, foreign policy and military affairs of the Philippines remained in the supreme hands of the US. All legislation passed by the Philippine Congress still needed the approval of the US president. This situated deeply sedimented American colonial rule of the Philippines even during the Commonwealth period. The Commonwealth: The Root of Continuing Dependence The passage in 1935 of the Commonwealth Act Number 1 provided the solid foundation for the US to maintain a strong grip on the Philippines that until now shape the direction of Philippine foreign and defense policy. Better known in the Philippines as the National Defense Act (NDA) of 1935, it established the strategic umbilical cord between the two countries and provided the legal justification for forging a military alliance. The NDA allowed the establishment of US military reservations in Philippine territories while the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines was setting-up its own independent military forces. The NDA also authorized Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon to confer on US Gen. Douglas MacArthur the title of field marshal of the Philippine Army. MacArthur was the architect of the Philippine defense plan that became the basis for the development of the current AFP. Though it has gone through several revisions, the NDA remains in effect and continues to serve as the formal tie that strongly binds and inextricably links the security of the Philippines with the US. The US as the Liberator and Savior When Japanese Imperial forces occupied the Philippines from 1941 to 1945, Commonwealth President Quezon evacuated to the US to run a government in exile. The Commonwealth Period formed a habit among Philippine security officials to be very reliant on the US government for security advice and training, if not outward decision-making. The Japanese occupation allowed the US and the Philippines a common foe. Fighting side-by-side against the Japanese Imperial Forces further cemented the historical foundation of the US-Philippines military alliance; around a million Filipinos and over 60,000 US soldiers died in the Philippines during World War II. World War II served as the main catalyst for Philippine security officials to develop a strong emotional affinity with and psychological dependence on their US counterparts. Most Filipinos during World War II regarded the US as the liberator of their country from the Japanese Imperial Forces. This created an image of the US among most Filipinos as a 'savior' of the Philippine Republic. Neocolonial Philippine Republic When the Philippines received its political independence from the US on July 4, 1946, then President Manuel Roxas enunciated a pro-American orientation of Philippine foreign and security policy. During his inauguration, Roxas declared his unequivocal subordination to the US when he stressed that he was committed to 'subscribe irretrievably' to US foreign policy and to the 'cause and international program of the United States of America.' He also underscored the need to have the 'closest cooperation with the United States in all matters concerning our common defense and security.' Thus, his government signed the Military Bases Agreement (MBA) with the US in 1947. In his book, The United States and the Philippines: A Study of Neocolonialism published in 1986, American scholar, Stephen R. Shalom, argued that Roxas Administration was the beginning of US neocolonialism in the Philippines. He asserted, 'neocolonialism is appropriate for describing the relationship between the United States and the Philippines. Like all concept, neocolonialism is an abstraction but it has had very real consequences for the people of the Philippines.' Succeeding Philippine presidents like Elipidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos Garcia and Diosdado Macapagal attempted to adopt a less pro-US outlook in Philippine policy. But they all failed to resist strong American neocolonial rule of the Philippines. Quirino, for instance, deployed Filipinos to fight with American troops at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 and signed the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the US in 1951. Magsaysay, on the other hand relied heavily on the US to fight the local communist insurgency and supported the formation of the US-led Southeast East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954 to fight communism in the region. Although short-lived, SEATO served as the Asian counterpart of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Garcia appeared to be nationalistic when he implemented the Filipino First Policy. He also acted against the US by signing the Bohlen-Serrano Agreement that shortened the lease of American military bases from 99 years to 25 years renewable after every five years. But Garcia actually failed to overcome neocolonial dependence on the Americans considering that during his administration, half of foreign investments to the country were from the US while American business community occupied the most prominent position in the Philippine economy. Thus, Garcia kept four American bases in Subic, Sangley, Clark and Baguio City. Despite some nationalist resistance, Macapagal also sustained the neocolonial policy of Garcia of keeping US military bases in the Philippines. Though he changed the celebration of Philippine independence from July 4 to June 12 to promote a more independent posture, Macapagal supported American military activities during the Vietnam War in exchange for increased US foreign military assistance. Like other previous Philippine presidents, Macapagal relied heavily on US neocolonial support to fight the local communist insurgency. US 'Waltzed' with Marcos Sr It was former President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr who pursued a more flexible and even pragmatic foreign and defense policy when his administration opened diplomatic relations with China and the so-called 'communist world', particularly with the former Soviet Union. Marcos Sr attempted to overcome American neocolonial rule of the Philippines under his grandious program of the 'New Society'. To reduce the country’s dependence on the US for national defense, Marcos Sr implemented the ambitious but expedient Self-Reliance Defense Program (SRDP). Marcos Sr utilized the US-Philippines alliance not only to confront common external security challenges and internal insurgency threats. He also used bilateral relations with the US to maintain his authoritarian regime. The US had to pragmatically and cautiously 'waltz with the dictator' because the Cold War still required US military facilities in the Philippines. Marcos Sr used nationalist rhetoric and anti-neocolonial propaganda to get more military aid from the US for purposes of rule maintenance. He even threatened to terminate the MBA if the US would not pay an annual compensation package for the use of facilities in Philippine territories. Marcos endeavored to remold the US-Philippines alliance by initiating an amendment of the MBA during the first term of his presidency. This effort led to the signing of the Ramos-Rusk Agreement on Septemeber 16, 1966, which finally reduced the term of the bases treaty from 99 to 25 years – thus the expiration of the MBA in 1991. Autonomous Defense and Moribund Alliance After the Cold War The end of the Cold War in 1991 posed enormous challenges to the relevance of the US-Philippines alliance. US withdrawal from Clark and Subic after the termination of the MBA in 1991 weakened the foundation of the alliance. The complete withdrawal of US military facilities in the Philippines in 1992 made the 'once-strong' and 'once-special' alliance 'essentially moribund.' Many thought that this was the end of American neocolonial rule of the Philippines. During the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos, the Philippine government flirted with the idea of autonomous defense by passing in 1995 the AFP Modernization Program. Confronted with territorial disputes in the SCS and internal armed conflicts with the Maoist and Moro rebels, the Philippine government even accommodated multilateral options, through regionalism, to overcome the country’s complex security dilemma. From its bilateral security alliance with the US, the Philippine government, therefore, Ramos went regional and multilateral by strongly participating in the expansion and strengthening of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Philippine government also supported the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1993 and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 1989. It even formally joined the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) after the termination of the MBA in 1991. But the Philippine government realized that neither autonomy nor multilateralism was a complete solution. Autonomous defense was not just ambitious, it was also very impractical considering the country’s sluggish domestic economy in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It realized the peril of pursuing security through self-help without adequate military resources. It also acknowledged that while multilateralism was important to promote dialogues for regional confidence building, it was not adequate for national capacity building to overcome the country’s internal and external security problems. Reactivation of Philippine-American Alliance With the growing security challenges emanating from China against the backdrop of complex maritime disputes in the SCS, the Philippines found it necessary to reactivate its alliance with the US, particularly when China took control of the Mischief Reef in 1995. Thus, the Philippines fashioned a new type of security relations with the US when the Philippine Senate ratified the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in 1999 during the administration of President Joseph Ejercito Estrada. American neocolonial rule of the Philippines did not end. Philippine-American security alliance only fully reinvigorated after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US. Then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo supported the US-led Global War on Terror (GWOT). The US, on the other hand, declared the Philippines as the second front in the GWOT next to Afghanistan, which the US invaded before targeting Iraq. The Philippine government sent Filipino troops to Iraq to support American activities there. But when the Philippines withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2004 due to the abduction of a Filipino overseas worker by a terrorist group, Philippine-American relations turned very sour. Then President Arroyo, on the other hand, shifted her attention to China for political and economic support. In 2005, the Philippines and China enjoyed the 'golden age' of Philippines-China relations when Arroyo pursued a friendlier policy towards Beijing. Again, there was a perception that the Philippines was ending its neocolonial ties with the US. But the US regained its neocolonial control of the Philippines during the Aquino III administration in the aftermath of the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff. As previously mentioned, Aquino III signed the EDCA in 2014 allowing the building up of five American military facilities inside Philippine bases. From the 'golden age' of Philippines-China relations under Arroyo, China and the Philippines suffered their lowest moments of bilateral ties under Aquino III. Meanwhile, the Philippines and the US enjoyed the enhancement of their neocolonial alliance during the Aquino III administration. Brief Separation from the US: A Paradigm Shift to China A major challenge in Philippines-US alliance emerged during the Duterte administration who stopped the full implementation of EDCA when he pursued a paradigm shift to China in foreign and security policy. Duterte even announced the separation of his foreign policy from the US. Duterte also suspended the implementation of the VFA while promoting pragmatic cooperation with China. To manage conflicts, Duterte joined China in pursuing the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism (BCM) in the SCS where both countries talked about cooperation, conflict management, and peaceful resolution of disputes. Duterte attempted to overcome colonial mentality in Philippine defense and foreign policy by pursuing a hedging approach with China and the US practiced by Southeast Asian neighbors like Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and even Vietnam. But his term was short-lived to sustain such approach. After his term, the Philippines returned to neocolonial reliance on the US. Subservient Policy and Renewed Dependence on the US Though the world has changed from cold war to post-cold war and to the current century, it is a great pity that until now, the Philippine government under the Marcos Jr Administration still carries the neocolonial policy of dependence on the US. Rather than relying on its own feet and cooperating with close neighbors to address its panoply of security concerns free of American intervention, the Philippine government under Marcos Jr administration is relying again on its distant relative. Nationalist scholars have called this as the neocolonial policy of subservience. This subservience to the US can be attributed to the persistence of century-old colonial mentality of ruling Filipino elites, the political oligarchs and the military, who regard its erstwhile colonial master as a provider and guarantor of Philippine security. They are the patrons of the masses who follow the colonial mentality of their masters. Mendicant Policy As a result of colonial mentality, Philippine foreign policy has become medicant to the American policy. The Philippine government’s blind adherence to the US Indo-Pacific Strategy is a tragic case of this continuing mendicancy in exchange for increased access of the Philippine military to US Foreign Military Assistance (FMA), Excess Defense Articles (EDA) and International Military Education and Training (IMET). Since 1946, the Philippines government has been begging the US for greater privileges in FMA, EDA and IMET. Sadly, the Philippine military is currently free-riding on American defense capabilities through the MDT, VFA, EDCA and other military arrangements,. This actually limits the capability of the AFP to genuinely build its autonomous defense capabilities. Though the AFP continues to procure military assets to modernize the armed forces, the Philippine military continues to suffer from the perennial underdevelopment. Now, the Philippine military is still lagging behind its key Southeast Asian neighbors like Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore because of the heavy reliance of the AFP on the US and other American military allies for defense build-up. Towards a Decolonization Policy The Philippines cannot be a truly sovereign state if its defense and foreign policy continues to be subjected to the colonial mentality of subservience and mendicancy on the US. As what former Senator Claro M. Recto once argued half a century ago, 'The tragedy of our foreign policy is that being an Asian people ten thousand miles away from the effective center of American power, our behavior is that of banana republic in the Caribbean. We have fed upon the fancy that we are somehow the favorite children of America.' While there is no doubt that the Philippines still needs to foster strong mutually beneficial relations with the US for pragmatic purposes and strategic considerations, ties should be built on decolonized mindset. The Philippines under Marcos Jr administration still have chances to adjust its policy by resisting US dominance as what other nations from the Global South or developing world are doing. The US, on the other hand, under the second Trump Administration should deal with the Philippines on equal footing and refrain from treating the Philippines as a subordinate ally, a controlled former colony. Unless Filipinos overcome this colonial mentality through genuine decolonization that cuts its umbilical cord of dependence on its former colonial patron, pursuing an independent Philippine foreign policy and autonomous defense strategy will continue to be a myth rather than a reality. The return of President Trump to the White House should make a difference in ending this neocolonial rule and in reexamining the nature of Philippines-US alliance in the 21st century during the remaining years of Marcos Jr administration.

Banlaoi, 'The US-Philippines Alliance: Meeting 21st Century Security Challenges' in Carl Baker and Brad Glosserman, eds., Doing More and Expecting Less: The Future of US Alliances in the Asia Pacific (Honolulu: Pacific Forum CSIS, 2013), pp. 55-66).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQBnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-07T09:25:21-08:00	
President Muizzu To Diversify The Tourism-Dependent Maldivian Eco...	New projects will supplement tourism and generate jobs for all skill sets Maldives, which has been over-dependent on the tourism industry for decades, has begun to realize the risks of over-dependence on one sector and President Mohamed Muizzu is taking a range of steps to correct the missteps of the past. COVID had hit tourism hard and Maldives had a hard time recovering from it. Therefore, one of the primary goals of President Muizzu government is to diversify the Maldivian economy. His administration is actively working to develop other industries, such as fisheries, agriculture, and renewable energy, an official said. By fostering growth in these areas, the government hopes to create job opportunities, increase exports, and boost the economy's resilience against global market fluctuations. Fisheries Fisheries has great potential. In 2021, nearly 71% of the animal protein consumed by Maldivians was credited to fish. The demand for fisheries and agricultural products continues to grow not only due to an increasing population, but also due to the increase in tourist arrivals, which total 2 million a year. There is tremendous scope for increasing production for consumption as well export. In 2018, the government issued and renewed 21-year leases for 15 uninhabited islands dedicated to commercial fisheries, 50 uninhabited islands for commercial agriculture and eight additional uninhabited islands for both commercial fisheries and agriculture. The result was that the fisheries sector contributed nearly 96% to the country's total merchandise export of about MVR 2.7 billion (US$ 175.4 million). In 2021 exports in 2021 were MVR 1.9 billion (US$ 123.4 million). Exports included live ornamental fish, fish roe, smoked fish, fish chips, fresh fish, chilled fish, or frozen consumable fish such as yellowfin tuna, albacore, long finned tuna and many more. With these great values, came the responsibility of managing the fish stocks as well. But there was insufficient capacity and institutional support. In addition, lack of market access, inadequate transport as well as poor environmental management and insufficient food safety controls. There were also concerns about over-fishing. Climate change was affecting biodiversity in marine life causing a decline in fish catches, which resulted in overfishing. The lack of air cargo and sea transportation relative to the yield of fishing was a limitation to production and sale flows. There was also a lack of awareness on good aquaculture and high-value market products, due to which the industry fell short in reaching its full potential in the global market. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is one of the strongest supporting bodies for the development of the fisheries sector in the Maldives. It boosted the sustainability of rural livelihoods, with a focus on climate-smart agriculture and fisheries development. FAO provided funds for fisheries, and till 2011, it had disbursed US$ 411,120 for various projects in the veterinary, aquaculture and agricultural sectors. Renewable Energy and Climate Change President Muizzu is keen on renewable energy to reduce the Maldives' dependence on costly imported fuel. Investments in solar and wind energy not only support environmental sustainability but also promise a more stable and self-reliant future. Maldives is projected to lose 80% of its land over the next few decades. It has therefore, recognized an urgent need to chart a new course. The country has set an exceptionally ambitious target of reaching net-zero by 2030, embarking on a historic transition to clean energy with the help of the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. A joint investment of over US$ 300 million is helping the Maldives develop solar power facilities, increase renewable energy capacity, and remove barriers to private investment and further development. Boosting Entrepreneurship President Muizzu's policies also emphasize empowering Maldivian entrepreneurs and small businesses. By providing financial incentives, grants, and training programs, the government seeks to unlock local talent and innovation. The focus on local entrepreneurship aims to generate more job opportunities across diverse fields, allowing Maldivians to benefit directly from economic growth. Initiatives that support women and youth entrepreneurs are also expected to drive inclusivity and expand access to economic participation. Employment The labour market of the Maldives is characterized by a duality. On the one hand, unemployment rate remains at 28%, on the other hand, the expatriate workers in the Maldives is at par with the economically active Maldivian population. It is estimated that the economically active population of the Maldives will be doubled by the year 2054. Parallel to this growth, by 2054, expatriate workers' population in the Maldives will surpass the economically active Maldivian population. The growth of foreign employment in the Maldives could pose a huge challenge for locals to find employment in the future. Therefore, the way forward for us is to seek entrepreneurship and self-employment. Entrepreneurship According to the Pension Office (2020) statistics, there are 1971 businesses registered with it. Only 0.4% of the population are active entrepreneurs. This suggests that there is a huge potential for entrepreneurship development in the Maldives. The rise of internet, gig and shared economy have created opportunities for entrepreneurship. Equalitarianism To support economic development and enhance access to essential services, President Muizzu has prioritized infrastructure development, particularly in outlying atolls. Through an ambitious decentralization program, the administration is working to ensure that more people across the country have access to high-quality healthcare, education, and public services. Enhanced road networks, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions in remote areas aim to improve living standards, reduce urban migration, and foster sustainable development across the nation. President Muizzu's commitment to regional development also supports the goal of creating a more cohesive society, where economic opportunities and social benefits are more evenly Dr. Muizzu's vision places great emphasis on social stability. The administration has committed to improving social welfare programs, providing safety nets for the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income families. These initiatives are aimed at creating a foundation of security that will foster a stable and resilient society. Furthermore, investments in education and healthcare seek to provide Maldivians with the resources they need to lead productive and fulfilling lives. By ensuring access to quality education and healthcare, Dr. Muizzu's government is aiming to equip the population with the tools necessary to contribute to national development. Current Economic Condition Be that as it may, current economic parameters give a grim picture. Domestic inflation stayed low at 0.5% in H1 2024, but food inflation surged to 6.7%, raising living costs, especially for poorer households. The trade deficit widened to US$ 1.5 billion in H1 2024 due to a 45.5% drop in fish exports and a 6.4% increase in imports. Rising import costs and debt repayments reduced official reserves from US$ 590.5 million in December 2023 to US$ 395.4 million in July 2024, while usable reserves fell to a record low of US$ 43.7 million. Recurrent expenditure fell by 7.2% in H1 2024, but capital spending plummeted by 47.6% due to infrastructure spending cuts. Total expenditure is set to moderate, but expenditure arrears are building up. Revenue collections dropped by 5.7%, keeping the fiscal deficit at 12.8% of GDP. The central bank's exposure to government securities increased to 61% of its assets by mid-2024, reflecting ongoing domestic and external financing challenges. There's Light The situation is indeed grim. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. The economy is expected to grow by 4.7% on average over the medium term, slower than the pre-pandemic average of 7.4%. Backed by substantial foreign budgetary assistance, the Maldivian budget for 2025 is for MVR 2.5 billion (US$ 168 million). Out of which, MVR 2.3 billion (US$ 149.8 million) is expected to be received from friendly countries, with India accounting for US$ 104 million of it. Officials believe that Maldivians can look forward to a future where economic opportunities are abundant, social welfare is prioritized, and environmental sustainability is an enduring principle. Dr. Muizzu is keen on positioning the Maldives as a model for sustainable growth and stability in the region and also the world at large.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQLuofv7p8eIb	2024-11-07T09:23:19-08:00	
Trump 2.0 And The World Economy: The Challenges Of Protectionism ...	The re-election of Donald Trump in 2024 has set the stage for a significant shift in both American domestic and international policy. Returning to the White House in January 2025, Trump’s second term is expected to renew his ‘America First’ ethos—a promise to prioritize American interests over traditional alliances and multilateral frameworks. Trump’s appeal, reinforced by a steady erosion of public trust in the Biden-Harris administration, reflects the public’s desire for a return to perceived American strength. Yet as he steps back into global leadership, Trump encounters a more fractured and volatile world order than the one he left in 2021. Global conflicts, economic disruptions, and shifting alliances create an unpredictable landscape that could amplify the effects of his policies in unprecedented ways. His promises of a 'Golden Age for America' face immediate challenges, demanding more than slogans if they are to reshape the global economy. America-First Redux: Reclaiming Economic Sovereignty at All Costs Central to Trump’s renewed agenda is his commitment to an ‘America First’ doctrine, which prioritizes national economic sovereignty over globalization and multilateral cooperation. Trump’s economic stance reflects a protectionist ideology that, while popular among his domestic base, carries profound implications for the global economy. His promise to increase tariffs on imports—from an additional 10-20% on most goods to as much as 100% on certain Chinese products— indicates a return to trade policies that prioritize immediate U.S. benefits, often at the expense of international economic stability. This approach mirrors the Monroe Doctrine in its assertion of American dominance, but it differs in scope, extending protectionism far beyond U.S. borders. Unlike its historic predecessor, which aimed to secure the Western Hemisphere from foreign influence, Trump’s strategy aims at reshaping global trade to prioritize American economic interests worldwide. The implications are clear: reduced engagement with international institutions, prioritization of bilateral trade deals, and a willingness to withdraw from multilateral frameworks. For major trading partners like China, Mexico, and India, these policies promise renewed tensions, likely leading to retaliatory tariffs and a reshuffling of trade relationships. Domestically, Trump’s protectionist stance may satisfy those who feel left behind by globalization. However, it poses risks for American consumers, who would likely bear the cost of higher tariffs in the form of increased prices. These rising costs could dampen consumer spending, thereby slowing economic growth, while the absence of multilateral trade agreements may create an unpredictable environment for U.S. companies reliant on foreign markets. Globally, this protectionist turn risks alienating long-standing allies and could accelerate the formation of alternative economic blocs that seek to insulate themselves from U.S. influence. A Withdrawal from Global Alliances: Retreating from Multilateralism Trump’s approach to foreign policy often draws upon transactional relationships, sidelining traditional alliances in favour of direct negotiations and pragmatic agreements. His first term was marked by withdrawals from key agreements, such as the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), moves that weakened multilateral cooperation on critical issues. His return to the White House signals a continuation—and potentially an intensification—of this trend. With NATO, Trump has previously expressed frustration over what he sees as disproportionate U.S. contributions to the alliance. Speculation suggests he may reduce troop deployments, close certain bases, or scale back financial support, citing these measures as necessary to reduce the U.S.’s global ‘burden.’ This retreat could destabilize NATO’s security framework, emboldening adversaries who view a weakened NATO as an opportunity to challenge Western interests. Trump’s turn from traditional alliances may also indicate a decreased reliance on shared international security commitments, favouring instead a more insular approach that views alliances through a narrow lens of immediate American benefit. A diminished U.S. presence in international agreements is also anticipated in environmental policy. Trump’s resistance to climate change mitigation initiatives remains a defining aspect of his platform. His intent to withdraw, once again, from the Paris Climate Accord underlines a disregard for collaborative climate action, a posture that risks weakening global efforts to address climate change. The retreat from multilateral climate agreements would have far-reaching consequences, particularly for developing countries most vulnerable to climate impacts. Trump’s isolationist stance on environmental policy is not merely symbolic; it directly threatens international funding for climate adaptation, an essential resource for regions facing increased environmental challenges due to global warming. The Global South and the Risks of Economic Fragmentation The effects of Trump’s policies extend far beyond America’s borders, particularly impacting the Global South, where developing nations rely heavily on access to American markets. For countries that have historically benefited from open trade with the U.S., Trump’s tariff hikes and protectionist policies present immediate challenges. Nations in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia could face restricted access to American markets, especially in sectors like agriculture, textiles, and technology. This reduced access could force these economies to seek alternative markets, potentially increasing dependence on emerging powers like China and fostering new regional alliances. Furthermore, Trump’s scepticism toward multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) could create a more hostile global trading environment. Developing nations that depend on the WTO to mediate trade disputes may find themselves without effective recourse if the organization’s influence diminishes. This absence of a reliable multilateral framework would likely increase economic competition, as countries are forced to protect their interests in an environment that prioritizes national gains over cooperative trade. Trump’s focus on dollar dominance as a tool of economic leverage could also drive de-dollarization efforts among emerging economies. His threats to impose tariffs on countries exploring alternative currencies are seen as attempts to maintain the dollar’s global supremacy. However, these efforts may backfire by accelerating the movement among BRICS nations toward independent financial systems. Russia and China have already initiated steps to trade in local currencies, and a second Trump term could strengthen this trend, creating a fragmented global economy where countries are increasingly wary of dollar-denominated transactions. Eroding Stability in Key Regional Economies: China, Russia, and India China: Trump’s re-election brings renewed focus on ‘decoupling’ from China, with a tariff strategy aimed at diminishing China’s role in U.S. supply chains. While this move may create short-term gains for American industries, it risks isolating the U.S. from a critical market. China’s potential pivot toward self-sufficiency and stronger regional alliances, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, could accelerate. A protracted trade conflict with the U.S. might even lead China to establish a parallel economic system, reinforcing alliances with countries that resist U.S.-led financial structures. Russia: Trump’s confrontational stance toward multilateralism aligns with Russia’s interest in reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. With sanctions limiting Russia’s access to Western markets, a continued de-dollarization push could see Russia strengthen its ties with China and other BRICS countries. This shift might lead to the establishment of alternative financial frameworks that encourage trade in local currencies. For countries within Russia’s influence, this shift could offer a way to avoid U.S. sanctions, although the process of moving away from the dollar would introduce economic volatility. India: India’s relationship with the U.S. under Trump’s policies could be a bit complicated. As the U.S.-China trade relationship remains strained, India may become an attractive partner for American businesses looking to diversify their supply chains. However, Trump’s protectionist trade policies could simultaneously hinder India’s access to American markets, particularly in tech and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, Trump’s push for U.S. primacy in Asia may place pressure on India to align with American interests, limiting its diplomatic flexibility with neighbouring countries. The Global Economy and a Potential Shift Toward a Fragmented Order Trump’s second term is expected to reinforce a polarized economic scenario. His protectionist approach and scepticism toward multilateral organizations challenge the foundations of the liberal economic order, which relies on cooperation and shared governance. The retreat from multilateralism undercuts efforts to create equitable frameworks for international trade and development, potentially worsening global inequality. For developing economies, especially those in the Global South, Trump’s policies could exacerbate economic volatility. Rising debt costs, reduced access to American markets, and increased dependence on alternative alliances threaten the progress many nations have made in recent decades. By undermining the stability of the dollar and sidelining international institutions, Trump’s policies may push the world economy toward a more fragmented order, where economic relationships are increasingly regional and less anchored in a unified system. A Path Forward: The Case for a Sustainable Global Economic Model A second Trump presidency raises critical questions about the sustainability of the current global economic model. His administration’s approach to prioritizing immediate national gains at the expense of long-term stability challenges the assumptions underlying a cooperative global order. The liberal economic framework, with its emphasis on multilateral cooperation and fair trade, offers a viable alternative that can address the needs of both developed and developing nations. By supporting policies that encourage equitable terms of trade, sustainable development, and international collaboration, a liberal economic order could foster an environment where countries work collectively to address shared challenges. For the world economy to address the pressures of a protectionist U.S., multilateral organizations must adapt, finding ways to protect vulnerable economies and maintain pathways for international cooperation. In the face of rising nationalism, the case for a more resilient, inclusive global system becomes not only a matter of economic stability but a necessity for global equity and progress.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQB8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-07T09:22:21-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Meets With European Leaders In Hungary	Thursday (7 November 2024), Secretary General Mark Rutte participated in a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest, Hungary. The meeting was an opportunity for European leaders to discuss a broad range of security challenges and the importance of working together to address them. This included exchanges not only on traditional threats and challenges but also on issues like economic security and critical dependencies. Rutte highlighted the importance of working together - not only across the European community but through NATO and its global partners as well. He noted the growing alignment between Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, which are working together to support Russia’s war against Ukraine - a reality that has broader impacts. In exchange for this support, Rutte said, 'Russia is delivering technology to North Korea' that will enable the DPRK to 'threaten the US mainland, continental Europe and our Indo-Pacific partners'. 'These are new, dangerous developments that we need to discuss together.' In the margins of the meeting in Budapest, the Secretary General met with a number of other leaders including the host, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Albanian President Edi Rama, and others.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQO3Vkp6vYVr0	2024-11-07T09:20:13-08:00	
Iran: Unprecedented Surge In Executions – OpEd	The number of executions carried out by Iran’s religious dictatorship has exceeded 150 in the month from September 22 to October 21, marking the highest monthly total in the past decade. Since Massoud Pezeshkian was inaugurated as Iran’s new president on July 28, 2024, more than 386 executions have been reported. In a recent and damning report, Javaid Rehman, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran from July 2018 to July 2024, classified two waves of mass killings in Iran as acts of genocide: the massacres of 1982 and 1988. The term 'genocide' applies here because Iran’s religious regime executed its opponents solely based on their beliefs, ethnic background, or political affiliation, with the aim of eradicating them. Shockingly, this practice continues to this day. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence has intensified its crackdown on supporters and families of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), the regime's sworn enemies, targeting them solely due to family ties or presumed support for the Resistance. This wave of arrests aims to prevent any social movement or uprising against the ruling powers. In July 2024, this organization submitted to the UN a list of 3,600 supporters and relatives detained by the regime who had previously massacred nearly 30,000 PMOI members in 1988. Meanwhile, the judiciary is extending prison sentences for political prisoners, including Maryam Akbari Monfared, one of Iran's longest-held political detainees, and Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, under spurious pretexts to block their release. Maryam Akbari Monfared’s 'crime' consists of filing a complaint over the execution of her siblings. Like all dictators throughout history who were facing intense pressure, Iran’s religious leadership is resorting to ruthless executions and extreme repression. In an appalling act on October 29, Khamenei’s agents severed the fingers of two brothers, Shahab and Mehrdad Teimouri, using a guillotine at Urmia Prison. Five other prisoners in Urmia are currently awaiting similar amputations. The two brothers were arrested in December 2018 on theft charges and sentenced to the amputation of their right-hand fingers. Amnesty International’s most recent report condemning such inhumane amputations dates back to 2018. Under international scrutiny, the Iranian regime seemed to have paused or at least limited public disclosure of such punishments. However, the regime remains deeply fearful of a discontented populace, which it views as a powder keg on the brink of explosion. Negotiation with and leniency toward this enabler of execution, terror, and war only embolden them to further violate human rights and destabilize global peace. Europe and the international community should follow Germany’s example. After the execution of an Iranian-German citizen, kidnapped by Iran’s dictator four years ago, Germany closed all Iranian consulates within its borders. The European Union should condition its relations with Iran on concrete human rights improvements and an immediate halt to executions. Failure to act will allow this dictatorship to continue undermining peace and stability worldwide, as we have seen in the recent Middle East conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQMYXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-07T09:18:53-08:00	
Allah Is A Word And A 99 Name – OpEd	Some Muslims say Allah is the Arabic word for God; so the word Allah can be used by non-Muslims to refer to their own religious concept of God. Others vehemently oppose this. They maintain that no believing Muslim should translate the English sentence 'Zeus is a Greek God.' as 'Zeus is a Greek Allah'. It is absurd, sacrilegious, and an affront to Islam. Allah is the name of the one and only God and not just a word. Jews also have a very special name for God (YHVH) that is untranslatable; and has not even been pronounced verbally out loud by Jews for the last 2400 years. In the days of Abraham, the religions of the Near East and India had hundreds of gods, and so had hundreds of different names for their gods. But for the monotheistic religions that trace their prophets back to Prophet Abraham, and his two sons Ishmael and Isaac, the many names of God are not really names of God: they simply describe different aspects or attributes of the one God's multifaceted personality. For monotheists the many names of God are just appellations: titles and descriptions. Thus, to say that God is a King or a Judge describes one of many ways the one God acts. To say that God is the Compassionate One is to describe one of the many character or personality traits of the one God. So for monotheists each of the many 'names' of the one God is only one of the many appellations of the one universal creator of space and time; both Islam and Judaism also have one special Divine name that is always in the believer's heart and soul. Because the Qur'an is filled with beautiful Arabic poetry; it is not surprising that the Qur'an is also filled with 99'names' of the one and only God. Because the Jewish tradition dates back more than thirty five centuries; it is not surprising that Jews have used many additional 'names' (70) for God over those many centuries. The word God in English is not a name of the one God like Allah or YHVH. It is the generic term used for any and every deity, similar to the West Semitic root word EL as it is found in Sumerian and Akkadian Ellil-Enlil; Hittite and Hurrian Ellel, and Hebrew El-Elohim. The words El, Elah, Elohei and Elohim are all pre Abrahamic West Semitic generic terms for a God or for many Gods. In these various forms they appear almost 3,000 times in the Hebrew Bible. But for Jews, the most important unique personal name of the one God is the name that God himself reveals to Moses at the burning bush: YHVH, which appears more than 6,800 times in the Hebrew Bible. In Exodus 3:13-15, Moses said to God, 'If I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'—what should I say to them?' And God said to Moses, 'Ehyeh asher Ehyeh'. Ehyeh is the verb 'to be' future tense singular and means I will/could/might/may be/become who I may/could/will/might be/become i.e. Ehyeh is The God of Potentialities, The God of Possibilities, The Living God of Becoming and Transforming, the One who can and will liberate Israel from bondage in Egypt. Unfortunately, the Greek and Latin translations of this verse were influenced by the Greek philosophical idea that God was similar to a permanent ideal form (like an equilateral triangle) or an unmoved mover; and is not similar to a living personality. Since the Greeks thought God must be a static unchanging being. they mistranslated 'Ehyeh asher Ehyeh' as 'I am who I am' rather than its plain Hebrew meaning of 'I will be whatever I should be to redeem you' i.e. God Almighty The Torah continues, 'And God said, 'You must say this to the Israelites, 'I am' (the usual false translation for God's self revealed name) has sent me to you.'' God also said to Moses, 'You must say this to the Israelites, Ehyeh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.' (Exodus 3:13-15) When Jews speak of God in the third person, God's name is pronounced Yehyeh and written YHVH-- 'the One who causes being and becoming, the One who brings potentials into existence.' The name YHVH was spoken publicly for almost a thousand years, from the time of Moses, throughout the centuries of the 1st Temple of Solomon. But it was ultimately replaced by Adonai (Lord) before the 3rd century B.C.E., because God's actual Holy name was eventually considered too holy to speak audibly. In later centuries even the substitution Adonai was considered too holy to utter; and pious Jews till this day do not use any name for God at all (except in prayer); but say only HaShem--the name (of God) when speaking about the one and only God. Islam takes a different view. The most well known of Allah's 99 names is Ar- Rahman -'the kindest and most forgiving one'; but Allah has kept to Himself knowledge of His greatest name, and He has not granted knowledge thereof to any of His creation. Prophet Muhammad once stated: 'Verily, there are 99 names of God, 100 minus 1. One who enumerates them will get into Paradise.' (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4, no. 1410) Some Muslims believe it will only be revealed by Imam Mahdi. Or perhaps if we are all 'Made in God's Image' Mankind might be the 100th name for God. Or Hagar's feminist name for God may be the 100th beautiful name. One name of God that very few Christians, Jews or Muslims even know, much less use today, is a name that I believe will become more important in the future as Christians, Jews and Muslims learn more about each other's religions. This name, El Ro'ee, only appears twice in the Hebrew Bible and, as far as I know, is not used at all in the Talmud or Midrash as a Divine appellation. Prophet Abraham's wife Hagar/Ha-jar uses El Ro'ee as her special name for God. El Ro'ee means A God Who Sees Me. It also became the name for a well (Zamzum?). 'Then she (Hagar) called the name of YHVH, who spoke to her, El Ro'ee, 'You are a God who sees me'; for she said, 'Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?' Therefore the well (where this happened) was called Beer-laHai-roee; the well of the Living One (Al-Hayy) who sees me. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael...' (Genesis 16:13-15) Neither Sarah nor Hagar/Ha-jar are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but the story of Ha-jar's exile from Abraham's home is traditionally understood to be referred to in a line from Ibrāhīm's prayer in the Qur'an (14:37): 'I have settled some of my family in a barren valley near your Sacred House (Kaaba)' Muslim tradition relates that when Hā-jar ran out of water, and Ismā'īl, an infant at that time, began to die; Hā-jar panicked and ran between two nearby hills, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah repeatedly searching for water. After her seventh run, Ismā'īl hit the ground with his heel and miraculously caused a well to spring out of the ground called Zamzum Well. It is located a few meters from the Kaaba in Mecca. Perhaps these two Torah names of God, El Ro'ee and Hai (Hayy) Ro'ee; which are Hagar's names for God, which mean A Self-reflecting God or A God Who Sees Me, and the name for the Zamzum well 'Beer-laHai-roi'; the well of the Living One (Hayy) who sees (mirrors) me; can help bring Christians, Jews and Muslims, who all share respect for Prophet Abraham and his family, to see each other better and thus become closer together in the future. That would be an excellent example of the power of God's name to cause future seemingly impossible transformations in all kinds of people and places. The meaning of God's name YHWH, is central to Jewish theology. There are two approaches: the philosophical, focusing on God's essence ('being') and the kabbalistic, focusing on God's evolving relationship with Israel ('becoming'). Rabbi Moses Maimonides (1138-1204), Judaism's chief rationalist, holds that all divine names, except YHVH, refer to God's activities: judge, ruler. creator, merciful, forgiver, etc. But for Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (1194-1270), a prominent Spanish Kabbalistic mystical Bible expositor, God is far more interactive and personal than just a first cause of existence, and thus the names capture different dimensions of God's dynamic being. The name YHWH, which occurs repeatedly in the book of Genesis, is only introduced formally in Exodus 3:13, in direct response to Prophet Moses' request for it at the burning bush. Exodus 6:3 corroborates its unprecedented disclosure to Moses: 'I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shad-dai, but I did not make Myself known to them by My (deepest) name YHWH.' The Torah's first communication of YHVH to Moses uses the root 'to be' in the future tense of ehyeh asher ehyeh (Exodus 3:14) 'I will/may/can be who I will/may can be' and not the wide spread erroneous present tense of 'I am who I am.' YHWH conveys a relational being in a partnership of reciprocity with Israel. It connotes a God of endless becoming, as the imperfect I will be indicates, a deity who will be elusive, continually shaped and reshaped by the respective partners with whom he/she/but not it establishes a relationship. Other divine names then derive naturally in this respect from the core relational name YHWH. They correlate to various dimensions of God such as compassion, mercy, or justice, which are all manifest in relationships. Rashi captures this God of relationship by fleshing out the meaning of ehyeh asher ehyeh as, 'I will be with them during this affliction as I will be with them during their (future) oppression by other kingdoms.' For God provides the comfort, assistance, and empathy expected of any partner in a meaningful relationship. ‍ Kabbalists use ehyeh asher ehyeh to push this interactive mutuality between God and human beings even more by employing new words, so that the Name ehyeh asher ehyeh can become I will be what you will be אהיה אשר תהיה. Rabbinic and mystical interpretations of an evolving, impressionable, at times suffering, God, emerge more naturally from the original sense of a personal interventionist God subject to emotions and affectation in the Hebrew Bible as well as its rabbinic glosses. The difference between the personal intimate name of God the believer uses in prayer and when reciting his or her holy scripture, and all other names; is a measure of the believers piety and love of the God of his or her own religion. When Christian believers speak about Jesus they are referring to the 'Divine Son of God' who connects them to God the father. When Jews or Muslims speak about Jesus they are referring not to God, but only to a man of God. Indeed, Paul and his followers converted Jesus the Jewish prophet into Jesus the totally personal Devine Son of God; and this may be why the Qur'an uses 'We' and not 'I' when speaking to Prophet Muhammad so when he repeated God's words, no one should think he was a son of God. When Jews do not utter the name YHVH they are referring to the God who made a covenant at mount Sinai with the descendants of their ancestors; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob/Israel. Neither Christians or Muslims connect to God this way. When Muslims use the word Allah they mean the one God they worship and adore; who sent Prophets, speaking their own language to every nation and tribe in the world, and sent Prophet Muhammad to proclaim the Qur'an in Arabic. This is the same one God; who sent Jesus to proclaim the Gospel and Moses to proclaim the Torah. Neither Jews nor Christians connect to God in this very universal way. Thus, for Muslims the word Allah is both a generic for the one God of all monotheistic religions; and a special personal Islamic name when spoken with devotion and love by a Muslim. As an American Reform Rabbi, I can understand why many Muslims would object to Christians using the word Allah in the context of saying that Jesus is the son of Allah. Another word for Divinity is needed. On the other hand, one could say that Allah spoke to Jesus as the Qur'an itself states, 'Allah said: Jesus, I will take you back and raise you up to Myself...' (3:55) If people of good will use the generic aspect of the word Allah only in a monotheistic context, and use another word for a trinitarian or polytheistic context, we can have more light and less heat in our own religious lives.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQFeanY6Kp3cX	2024-11-07T09:17:13-08:00	
AI And Social Media: Catalysts Of Social Transformation – OpEd	Artificial intelligence (AI) has multifaceted impact on digital contents and social media. In recent years, the impact of AI embedded social media channels has had a profound effect on developing countries. These technologies have transformed both economic activities and social activism by providing new frontiers for growth and civic engagement that were previously inaccessible. Social media platforms, for instance, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and TikTok, are becoming more user friendly but sophisticated and popular with AI-driven algorithms. These platforms have become a go-to place for small businesses, social activists, and communities to leverage the digital media for ensuring social development. In areas where scope, resources and infrastructure are scarce, AI-powered social media is making a tangible difference, enhancing economic resilience and social transformation. Economic Opportunities and Growth AI is revolutionizing every aspect of our life including businesses. AI’s accelerated development has made the technology widely available and accessible. However, the AI’s ethical practices in their business models and/or to streamline their operations represents a unique opportunity to maximize their impact. The social economy represents 7% of global GDP, and generative AI could add values between $182 billion and $308 billion annually to the sector. One of the most significant economic impacts of AI-driven social media platforms in developing countries is the opportunity for small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs to reach wide-ranging markets and consumers at relatively low costs. In many areas, conventional methods of advertising are expensive and often somewhat ineffective for smaller enterprises considering their limited budgets. Social media provides an alternative channel for small businesses to access customers directly, promote products, and build brand loyalty without heavy financial investment. For example, in Nigeria, local businesses are now using WhatsApp to engage with customers. They share product catalogs, and coordinate delivery services through this application. With limited investment, entrepreneurs can now maintain direct communication with consumers and expand their customer base. This digital transformation allows businesses to operate and grow sustainably, even with minimal infrastructure, fostering rural economic growth and enabling a degree of financial independence which was previously unattainable. AI’s role in optimizing these platforms—for example, by targeting specific audiences or enabling chatbots to handle routine customer inquiries—further enhances business productivity and customer satisfaction, benefiting both entrepreneurs and consumers. Empowering through Digital Platforms AI-driven social media plays an essential role in promoting social change and community development. In areas where access to educational materials and awareness campaigns are scarce, social media provides a platform for advocacy and outreach. AI algorithms amplify content which enables social causes to reach diverse stakeholders across geographic and socioeconomic boundaries. In South Asia, for example, social media has become a major platform for social movements for promoting gender equality, education, and public health. In Bangladesh, local NGOs and INGOs leverage Facebook and other social media platforms to disseminate knowledge and organize campaigns to reach out to the less privileged communities by raising awareness on issues like education, health, employment and gender equality. Facebook groups and pages allow NGOs to engage with wider people directly, share key information, and mobilize community support. Campaigns addressing issues such as women’s rights, mental wellbeing, and environmental sustainability are now able to gain visibility and attract participants even from the remote areas. AI-powered tools, such as automated translation and customized content recommendations, further enhance the outreach by breaking language barriers and delivering relevant information to individual users. Social media, in this way, provides an essential platform for communities to engage in social discussions and collaborate on possible solutions—measures that would be difficult to achieve through conventional channels in parts where mainstream media coverage is limited. Challenges and Ethical Considerations The benefits of AI-driven social media are evident. In addition, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges and ethical considerations associated with its use in developing nations. One major concern is the risk of misinformation. As AI algorithms may amplify sensational or false content which may potentially lead to mass unrest or confusion. Especially false rumors about sensitive issues like religion, political beliefs and contentious issues can escalate violent clashes. Bangladesh has experienced several such vigilantism over the years following spread of social media misinformation. Few years back, a violent clash between police and protesters erupted in Bhola due to a social media derogatory post about Prophet Mohammad went viral which was made from a fake account and the four people were killed in the violence. Moreover, the privacy and data security of users are pressing issues as personal data collected through these platforms may be vulnerable to misuse. To mitigate these risks, digital platforms must invest in robust AI-driven moderation systems that can identify and limit harmful content while ensures data transparency. Additionally, partnerships with local governments and organizations can ensure that these technologies are operated in a manner that aligns with the specific needs and contexts of developing nations. To summarize, the integration of AI into social media platforms has emerged as a powerful tool for economic and social prosperity in developing nations. These platforms provide valuable resources for communities that lack access to traditional infrastructure and resources by fostering entrepreneurship and enhancing the visibility of social causes. If we can responsibly operate the AI-driven social media platforms, we can continue to empower individuals, strengthen grassroots economies, and promote social equity in parts that are often underserved. This digital transformation reflects the potential of AI to bridge gaps in opportunity, foster resilience, and support a more inclusive model of development in the digital era.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQFgEurx4QEDv	2024-11-07T09:15:11-08:00	
The Delusion Of A Greater Afghanistan – OpEd	The notion of a 'Greater Afghanistan,' murmured in Afghan nationalist circles, is more fantasy than feasible, a mirage conjured by a handful of fervent propagandists. History and reality offer a stark rebuttal, laying bare the implausibility of this dream. Such ideas are so far from the complexities of the region’s cultural and political landscape that one might call them the musings of those living in a self-created utopia. To grasp why, one must look into the nuances that define this region. The history of Pashtun culture, language, and identity clearly shows that its core has always been located in present-day Pakistan, rather than Afghanistan. The regions of Khurasan and Hind, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), were never part of the Afghan Empire but instead fell under the control of the Mughal and other external empires. The regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan, and FATA (now merged into KP) have been the primary cradle of Pashtun civilization for centuries. Great Pashtun poets like Khushal Khan Khattak and Rahman Baba, whose works remain a vital part of Pashtun cultural heritage, hailed from what is now Pakistan, not Afghanistan. Peshawar, in particular, has been a center of Pashtun culture, politics, and literature for a long time. Afghanistan, on the other hand, has historically been a melting pot of various ethnic groups—Hazaras, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and others. This demographic reality challenges the premise of a 'Greater Afghanistan' centered around Pashtuns. The Afghan state has always been a heterogeneous entity, and any claim that Afghanistan can somehow unify Pashtun regions under its banner is not only historically unfounded but also practically impossible. Afghanistan’s sociopolitical landscape is defined by its complex ethnic mosaic, which has led to centuries of internal strife. The Pashtuns, though the largest ethnic group, are far from a monolithic entity even within Afghanistan. They share the nation with Tajiks (27%), Hazaras (9%), and Uzbeks (9%)—each with their own distinct identity and political agendas. Unlike the marginalization Pashtuns often experience in Afghanistan, Pakistan's approach has been one of inclusion, embracing Pashtuns within its social, political, and economic spheres. The notion of 'Greater Afghanistan' is a delusion fueled by those living under the influence of unrealistic fantasies. It reflects either a misunderstanding of regional dynamics or a deliberate attempt to incite chaos. In reality, the Pashtuns in Afghanistan have long expressed dissatisfaction with their status in a fragmented state. The region of Afghanistan's eastern provinces, including Kunar, Nangarhar, and Laghman, has seen increasing unrest and a desire for closer ties with Pakistan due to better economic and security conditions across the border. Afghanistan’s economy remains weak, with a GDP that pales in comparison to Pakistan's. The economic disparity is a significant factor that contributes to the frustration of Pashtuns in Afghanistan, who have witnessed Pakistan’s relatively superior infrastructure, educational opportunities, and security apparatus. after the soviet-afghan war, over 3 million afghan sought refuge in pakistan who even after three decades were unwilling to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, Afghanistan has been embroiled in continuous conflict and civil war since the 1980s, which has exacerbated its economic struggles and hindered development, making the contrast even more stark for those on the Afghan side of the border. Pakistan, on the other hand, has emerged as a strong and stable state despite facing its own set of challenges. The integration of FATA into KP was a landmark move, providing former tribal areas with greater access to development resources, political representation, and economic opportunities. This merger was not just a political decision but a reflection of the strong affinity the Pashtuns in these regions have for Pakistan. The development projects initiated in KP and Balochistan have improved living conditions for millions of Pashtuns, solidifying their sense of belonging within Pakistan. Pashtun leaders in Afghanistan have openly expressed dismay at the state of their country. Calls for a stronger connection with Pakistan have grown louder over the years, reflecting the deep dissatisfaction with the Afghan state’s inability to provide stability and economic opportunities. Pakistan’s investments in infrastructure, its military capability, and its growing regional influence make it a natural partner for the Pashtun population in Afghanistan. Claims that Pakistan will eventually absorb the Pashtun-dominated areas of Afghanistan are not far-fetched but are a natural outcome of the current geopolitical realities. The perpetuation of the 'Greater Afghanistan' myth has external roots. Propaganda machines, funded by hostile elements, encourage Afghan nationalists to propagate such ideas. This tactic, aimed at destabilizing the region, serves the interests of those who wish to weaken Pakistan and disrupt regional cooperation. However, the ground realities stand in contrast to these dreams, as more and more Pashtuns in Afghanistan express their desire for greater connectivity with Pakistan. This propaganda must be seen for what it truly is: an attempt to fan the flames of ethnic nationalism in a region that has long been intertwined with a heterogenous mixture of history and nationalism. Such ideas only serve the short-term interests of those funding these provocations, with little concern for the long-term peace and prosperity of the region. The dream of a 'Greater Afghanistan' is not just impractical; it is a hallucination rooted in ignorance or deliberate mischief. Afghanistan’s future lies not in expanding borders but in addressing its internal challenges—poverty, ethnic strife, and political instability. Pakistan, on the other hand, continues to progress and build a strong, inclusive society where Pashtuns play a crucial role in the nation’s success. As Pakistan develops and strengthens, the calls for its leadership in Pashtun regions of Afghanistan will only grow louder. Any notion of a Greater Afghanistan is not only a dream but one fueled by those detached from reality, fanned by enemies of Pakistan, who seek to destabilize the region for their own ends. The future belongs to a united Pakistan, where Pashtuns are equal partners in progress. Long live Pakistan!	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQILP51T0FcGD	2024-11-07T09:13:39-08:00	
Pakistan: Decentralize To Thrive – OpEd	Pakistan, a country long plagued by political instability, corruption, and inefficient governance, stands at a critical juncture in its history. Despite its rich cultural heritage, strategic geopolitical significance, and a young, dynamic population, Pakistan remains trapped in a cycle of underperformance, particularly when it comes to governance. At the heart of the problem lies a deeply fragmented administrative system, one that has long been out of sync with the diverse needs of its provinces and people. To break this cycle and chart a path to lasting stability, Pakistan needs to embrace a radical restructuring of its provincial governance system—a framework that will decentralize power, allow local communities to chart their own destinies, and foster more accountable, transparent, and efficient governance. The need for this restructuring is rooted in the centralization of power in Islamabad, which has historically marginalized Pakistan’s provinces, fostering inequality, resentment, and inefficiency. While Pakistan’s 18th Amendment in 2010 made strides toward devolving powers to provincial governments, the reality is that the provinces still struggle with weak institutions, a lack of resources, and bureaucratic inertia. The central government remains deeply involved in provincial affairs, often with little regard for local realities. This top-down approach has stymied economic development, hindered the delivery of public services, and left many Pakistanis feeling disconnected from the political process. What Pakistan needs now is a reimagined provincial structure, one that fully empowers local governments to take charge of their economic, social, and political futures. It is not enough to simply give provinces more administrative powers; we must redesign the governance framework to reflect Pakistan’s complex demographic, cultural, and economic realities. This means establishing a system of governance that decentralizes decision-making, reduces corruption, increases transparency, and encourages local innovation. Here are three key principles that must guide the restructuring of Pakistan’s provinces for effective governance: The first step toward meaningful change is shifting from a largely ceremonial federal system to one in which provincial and local governments have the power to make decisions on issues that directly affect their populations. Currently, provincial governments in Pakistan are not equipped with sufficient autonomy to implement policies that reflect the specific needs of their regions. In many cases, federal directives override provincial policies, particularly in sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The solution is a more robust devolution of powers, particularly to local governments. Local governments should have greater control over public resources, revenue generation, and policy-making in areas such as education, health, and law enforcement. For instance, in Balochistan, where a history of neglect by the central government has fueled unrest, local leadership should have the ability to prioritize development projects, negotiate directly with foreign investors, and allocate resources based on local needs rather than waiting for Islamabad’s approval. This type of local empowerment is crucial not only for improving the delivery of services but also for fostering a sense of ownership among Pakistan’s diverse communities. When people feel that their local leaders are accountable to them, rather than to a distant capital, trust in government grows, and governance becomes more responsive and efficient. One of the primary reasons that Pakistan’s provinces struggle to fulfill their governance responsibilities is a lack of financial independence. While the 18th Amendment made strides in granting provinces more control over their budgets, the distribution of national resources remains highly uneven, and federal transfers are often delayed or insufficient. Without the ability to raise their own revenue, provinces are left dependent on Islamabad for funding, undermining their ability to develop independently. A truly effective provincial governance system requires a significant overhaul of Pakistan’s fiscal structure. This means allowing provinces to generate and retain their own revenue, particularly through taxes and natural resource extraction. For example, provinces like Sindh, with its vast industrial base, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rich in natural resources, should be able to collect taxes and reinvest that revenue in their own development priorities. At the same time, a system of equalization payments can ensure that poorer provinces like Balochistan are not left behind in terms of funding. Fiscal autonomy does not mean complete independence from the central government; it means giving provinces the tools they need to be self-sufficient while still contributing to national welfare. A fair and transparent revenue-sharing mechanism, coupled with stringent accountability measures, will ensure that provinces use their resources responsibly and effectively. Even with more power and resources, provinces cannot deliver effective governance without strong institutions to manage those resources. Pakistan’s provinces face significant challenges in terms of bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and lack of professional expertise. The provincial civil services, in particular, have been hampered by outdated structures and a lack of skilled personnel, resulting in poor implementation of policies. To address this, Pakistan must invest in building the capacity of provincial institutions, with a focus on professionalizing local bureaucracies and training a new generation of technocrats, administrators, and policy experts. This should involve partnerships with international development organizations, think tanks, and universities to create training programs and mentorship opportunities for provincial officials. Moreover, transparency and accountability must be built into provincial governance structures, with regular audits, open data initiatives, and citizen oversight to combat corruption and ensure that public funds are used effectively. A strong provincial governance framework must also ensure that there is adequate representation of marginalized groups, including women, minorities, and indigenous communities. These groups often find themselves excluded from decision-making processes at both the provincial and national levels, further exacerbating social inequality. Special provisions must be made to ensure their active participation in the governance process. Restructuring Pakistan’s provinces is not an easy task. It requires political will, societal consensus, and a long-term commitment to reform. But the potential benefits are clear. By decentralizing power, promoting fiscal autonomy, and building strong provincial institutions, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its provinces and create a more inclusive, effective, and responsive system of governance. If Pakistan’s provinces are allowed to govern themselves in a way that is attuned to local needs, Pakistan as a whole will be better positioned to address its myriad challenges, from economic inequality to terrorism to climate change. A new framework for progress is not just a theoretical exercise; it is an urgent necessity for the future of Pakistan. The time for reform is now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQNMnMhfkJSMi	2024-11-07T09:12:14-08:00	
Shifting Alliances: Bangladesh’s Quest For Autonomy And Justice –...	Under the premiership of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, Bangladesh witnessed widespread violence, corruption, nepotism, manipulation of the electoral process, favoritism, and discrimination. Moreover, the Awami League government faced criticism for its authoritarian tendencies, which included suppressing opposition and curbing freedom of expression. After the resignation of Prime Minister Hasina Wajid on August 5, 2024, due to nationwide protests against the government by students and the public, an interim government was formed under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus on August 8, 2024. The people of Bangladesh are yearning for a new governance model that prioritizes accountability and dismantles the clientelist practices that have flourished during Sheikh Hasina’s tenure. The student protesters calling on the new interim government liberate their state from corruption and nepotism. This newly formed interim government also faces the challenge of formulating its foreign policy and establishing new regional alliances with countries of interest. The current administrations of Bangladesh and Pakistan are eager to strengthen their relationship, focusing on regional cooperation and autonomy while addressing historical grievances within SAARC. Sheikh Hasina Wajid has been implicated in approximately 170 FIRs concerning significant human rights violations, including murder and genocide, leading to the arrest of several of her close associates. The public in Bangladesh believes that her government was heavily influenced by India, which compromised the nation's sovereignty. In response to corruption allegations, the interim government has frozen the financial accounts of Sheikh Hasina Wajid's family, reflecting widespread public discontent regarding her perceived alignment with Indian interests. Following an invitation from the interim government, a fact-finding team from the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) has been conducting an independent investigation into the alleged human rights violations facilitated by Sheikh Hasina Wajid. The people of Bangladesh welcome this investigation as an opportunity to expose the abuses tolerated during her tenure under Indian influence. This sentiment reflects a strong desire among the Bangladeshi populace for justice and the dismantling of the authoritarianism associated with the previous regime. Furthermore, the recent legislative modification has eliminated laws that provided additional security to the Hasina’s family. Bangladesh masses considered it a bold move toward political reform, criticizing the previous administration for relying on Indian help rather than addressing the public needs. Constitutional reforms are essential to impose ban on political parties involved in widespread human rights violations. Moreover, on October 6, 2024, the inauguration of the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters by caretaker govt of Muhammad Yunus marks a significant moment of boosting collaboration between the military and the government. However, this event strongly signals the Bangladesh Army's commitment to assert its autonomy and take decisive steps toward liberating itself from Indian influence, reflecting a renewed sense of national pride and independence. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, is facing serious allegations. He has engaged the services of a U.S. lobbying firm, Stryk Global Diplomacy, to influence American policymakers, including those involved in legislative processes. This strategy reflects an attempt to mitigate the backlash from his actions and to maintain a favorable image abroad. However, India's authoritarian stance as a regional power became evident when it expressed regret over Bangladesh’s request for a mutual meeting between the Chief Advisor and Indian Prime Minister Modi during the 79th United Nations General Assembly. This incident reflects India's reluctance to engage collaboratively with its neighbors, raising concerns about the state of regional diplomacy. India's authoritarian posture toward neighboring states has compelled Bangladesh to recall its envoy from New Delhi, highlighting the growing frustration with India's interference in its domestic affairs. This decision signifies a significant diplomatic rift, reflecting broader regional tensions largely attributable to India. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), influenced by its Hindutva ideology, conducted a closed-door meeting aimed at strategizing support for the Awami League (AL) in Bangladesh. Such actions attempt to manipulate the political dynamics in Bangladesh, further straining bilateral relations. India appears to struggle with accepting that Bangladesh is distancing itself from its influence. Recently, Bangladesh issued a strong protest against derogatory comments made by the Indian Home Minister regarding Bangladeshi nationals, signaling its commitment to uphold sovereignty against external pressures. During the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Bangladesh’s Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus held a meeting in which Bangladesh reaffirmed its support for the revitalization of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This meeting is viewed as a positive step towards enhancing regional cooperation in South Asia. Additionally, Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, Md. Jashim Uddin, is expected to visit Pakistan in the last week of November 2024, further indicating ongoing efforts to strengthen diplomatic ties. Moreover, in September 2024, a constructive meeting between the Pakistani High Commissioner and Foreign Secretary Uddin resulted in an agreement to hold an early Foreign Secretary-level meeting, also likely scheduled for late November 2024. To boost trade relations, Bangladesh's National Board of Revenue has eliminated the requirement for 100% physical inspection of goods imported from Pakistan, aiming to facilitate smoother trade operations. Both nations need to put aside their past differences and work towards improving bilateral relations. Due to Pakistan's liberal visa policy, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has encouraged its students to pursue educational opportunities in Pakistan. This initiative represents a renewed commitment to fostering people-to-people connections and enhancing bilateral understanding between the two countries. Bangladesh's support for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), echoed by similar sentiments from Nepal, presents a promising avenue for revitalizing the organization. This cooperative approach reflects a shared vision for regional collaboration and economic integration, paving the way for stronger ties among South Asian nations. The newly formed caretaker government in Bangladesh has a significant opportunity to work diligently on national development while maintaining a balanced foreign policy within SAARC, focusing on cooperation rather than regional grievances.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQGr3y_F8EWBC	2024-11-07T09:10:47-08:00	
Trump’s Victory: Implications For Pakistan – OpEd	Donald Trump’s second term as the US President is expected to have profound impact on geopolitics and global asset/ commodity prices, which would ultimately have implications for the ongoing macro recovery in Pakistan. There is a high probability of a 'clean sweep' by the Republican Party (it is likely to take control of both the US Senate and House), which will give Trump greater ability to execute his campaign pledges. Trump’s policies – cracking down on immigration and large import tariffs on China – are expected to be inflationary for the US economy and negative for global growth. If he is able to bring a quick end to both the wars, in Ukraine and Gaza, oil prices are likely to continue falling under the weight of weakening global demand. There are various caveats to these expectations: Global experts point to the strength of US institutions in checking/ taming some of the draconian policies Trump has pledged. Second, China has begun rolling out huge stimulus measures, both fiscal and monetary, to revive its ailing economy (particularly its large property sector). This could serve as a boost to global commodity prices. For Pakistan, the prospect of lower or stable oil/ commodity prices is positive. US-China trade war improves the opportunity to attract Chinese industries into Pakistan. Certain exports out of Pakistan, including steel and textiles, may become more competitive in the US. But, it could be a challenge for Pakistan to execute CPEC Phase 2 in the face of deteriorating US-China relations. At this stage, the event does not materially affect outlook of continued macro stability in Pakistan – continued disinflation and foreign exchange reserves buildup – and equity market re-rating, According to Pakistan’s leading brokerage house, Inter Market Securities: Oil prices are more likely to fall or stabilize around US$70/bbl over the medium term. Trump is likely to encourage greater shale oil production in the US, while at the same time, he would work to bring an end to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Global inflation could make a comeback as Trump promises to slap up to 60% import tariffs on China and up to 20% from elsewhere. He has also committed to deport illegal immigrants from the country – which could stoke another round of labor shortage in the United States. US interest rates may remain elevated as the resurgent inflation could lead to a slowdown of rate cuts in the US, leading to a stronger greenback against other major currencies. This could mean that global equity flows into the emerging and frontier markets would remain weak. Raising debt through Eurobonds could therefore become difficult for Pakistan. The USD index has appreciated 5% since September, while the US 10-year bond yield has risen to 4.5% from 3.6% by end September – both have risen in anticipation of Trump’s re-election. Global growth could be slower and commodity prices, depressed if Trump administration impose higher import tariffs on China, then growth in China could be undermined (notwithstanding the stimulus measures the Chinese government has recently begun rolling out. This would spell an extended period of down-trending commodity prices and a global oversupply in some key commodities (steel, petrochemicals) and products (EVs). Weak US participation in achieving global climate goals could reverse or slow down the recent trend of multilateral lenders (IMF, WB and ADB) ramping up loans to developing economies for building defense against climate change. Possible implications for Pakistan A decline in global commodity prices would maintain the dis-inflationary trend in Pakistan. However, a fresh wave of global inflation will be felt in Pakistan through a stronger greenback and imported inflation. At this stage, the brokerage house maintains it outlook for average inflation in Pakistan over the next 12 months to be around 9% and expect the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to cut the policy rate up to 11% by June 2025. US-China trade war could make some exports out of Pakistan more competitive in the US, compared to imports from China. These would include HVA textiles, flat steel, tires and cement. However, if PKR-US$ remains stable while other regional currencies depreciate against the greenback, it could undermine the competitiveness of Pakistani exports. Pakistan could see greater Chinese FDI. As Chinese industries would continue to set up facilities outside China to avoid import tariffs, some could potentially be set up in Pakistan. However, for this to happen, Pakistan would have to offer a more stable policy environment to Chinese investors, and the government may have to drop plans to renegotiate the power tariffs of CPEC power plants, in our view.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQHsTEUSXbVxo	2024-11-07T09:09:07-08:00	
India’s Diplomatic Tightrope Act – OpEd	As the era of unipolarity is almost over, major powers as well as the rising powers from across the globe are eyeing to maximize their strategic and diplomatic footprint. International organizations play a critical role in the geopolitical maneuverings. China and the US have global competitiveness while states like India are ogling for regional supremacy. In the same vein, Pakistan amid her huge financial crunch is refurbishing its posture. The 2024 SCO summit, held in Islamabad, marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan's efforts to revitalize its international stature. The summit, attended by heads of state from member countries, underscored Pakistan's diplomatic maneuvering within the region. India was represented by Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who stood in for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This diplomatic engagement reflects the interplay of state interests in a multilateral setting, reinforcing the notion of 'complex interdependence' as outlined by Keohane and Nye, where states prioritize diplomacy even amid geopolitical tensions. Pakistan has always prioritized promoting an atmosphere where peaceful coexistence is the outcome. This behavior has often negatively affected Pakistan’s interests, but her quest for ensuring global peace has been consistent. Considering regional hostilities, emanating from her western and eastern neighbors it has still relied on diplomatic resolutions rather opting an offensive approach. Amidst ongoing economic challenges and regional instabilities, Pakistan's commitment to multilateralism has allowed it to regain a significant diplomatic foothold. The 2024 SCO summit in Islamabad, attended by key global actors, illustrates this resurgence. Even Indian Prime Minister could not afford bypass the meeting, so he sent Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar on his behalf. Despite expectations that J. Shankar would continue with his typical dig at Pakistan, portraying it as a state sponsoring terrorism the rhetoric was tempered by recent developments. Canada’s expulsion of Indian diplomats implicated in transnational terrorism, a move that undermined India's moral high ground. As reflected in the theory of 'constructivism' in international relations, this turn of events showcases how norms and perceptions are shaped by evolving political dynamics, influencing state behavior on the global stage. Primarily, J. Shankar’s speech at the SCO forum manifests Chanakya Kautiliya’s teachings on hiding true motives and seemingly keeping good intentions. While India projects itself as a champion of multilateralism and peaceful coexistence, it simultaneously pursues strategic autonomy under the aegis of the United States. This duality reflects India's efforts to position itself as a regional hegemon, leveraging its relationship with major powers to evade accountability. The transnational terrorism activities linked to New Delhi underscore this lack of restraint, as India capitalizes on the absence of effective international oversight. J. Shankar in his speech repeatedly focus on 'three evils' terrorism, extremism, separatism that aims to target Pakistan, as it always framed it as a source of cross border terrorism in global forums. Here it aimed to downplay the growing unrest in India where it is faced with active separatist movements in Manipur, Khalistan and Kashmir. Its social fabric is shrinking against religious and ethnic minorities. Since last four years, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom has consistently recommending the US department of State adding India in the list of 'Country of Particular Concern,' owing to the gross violation of human rights against religious minorities, where they have been lynched by vigilante groups their homes and worship places being bulldozed. The laws are discriminatory against minorities such as Citizenship Amendment Act, cow slaughtering laws, etc. and the government officials’ hatred speeches openly call for violence against them. As far as terrorism is concerned, India has been caught red handed in transnational repression where its diplomats along with High Commissioner expelled from Canada for their involvement in transnational terrorism activities in Canadian soil. The US also foiled Indian attempt to kill Sikh activities on American soil. Indian spying network recently caught in Australia, its naval officers were spying in Qatar for Israel. While in Pakistan, Kulbhushan Jhadev, a serving officer of Indian Navy caught for spying and involvement in terrorist activities. RAW was involved in up to 20 assassinations Kashmiri activists in Pakistan in 2020. India being a critical of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) claimed it to be against its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In SCO summit, J. Shankar reiterated the same stance via emphasizing need for cooperation based on sovereignty and territorial integrity aimed at criticizing CPEC project contrary to India itself promoting connectivity to Central Asia. India’s strategic posturing towards the western bloc portrayed in J. Shankar’s speech who promoted multi-polarity & rebalancing in his speech, where India aimed at consolidating its influence through QUAD and other Indo-Pacific initiatives. While on other hand, its strategic alignment with Western bloc excludes China and Russia. Furthermore, his desire to make SCO platform for honest dialogue is unrealistic amid bilateral tension with Pakistan where it is unwilling to engage with Pakistan bilaterally. Although India accepted the invitation to join SCO summit, its reluctance to engage in any bilateral talks with Pakistan was apparent. India attended SCO summit 2024 with a purpose to pursue its strategic objectives in the contesting geopolitical landscape. It tried to portray its anger towards the US and Canada amid its bashing by the formers concerning transnational terrorism. In light of growing concerns about New Delhi’s human rights abuses, it is a challenge for the Modi government to not only refute the charges but also to keep the relations with the West smooth. The delicate balance approach depicts that India wants to garner maximum from both blocs but wants to pursue its hegemonic designs in the region as well.

The Horn Of Africa States: President Trump’s Re-Election And The ...	The Horn of Africa States region has been a significant geopolitical battleground on the world stage since the opening of the Suez Canal in the second half of the nineteenth century. The region’s history, however, indicates that it was always a major economic player connecting Asia to Africa and Europe from Pharaonic times. It still is, as it overlooks one of the major shipping lanes of the world. That it is also the source of the Blue Nile which provides most fresh water to Northeast Africa (Sudan and Egypt) adds to its major geostrategic importance. The closeness to Yemen and hence the Houthi/Iranian/Israeli troubles on the other side of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, further adds to its significance, which is also complicated by the Gulf States dynamics and activities in the region. Its own historical ethnic and religious idiosyncrasies and hence conflicts do not help either. A lot of rhetoric in this regard and 'nationalism' playing foul and fooling tunes only add to the miseries of the populations of the region. It is, therefore, a region which attracts all major powers. In the recent past, it was the communist ex-Soviet Union against the capitalist world. Today it is the West against China and the BRICS crowd. The Iranian/Israeli war and the Palestinian issue also impact the region indirectly because of its location. The Horn of Africa States region is a resource rich region (Read my Article: The Horn Of Africa States: A Resource Rich Region – Op-ed and published in Eurasiareview.com on November 4th, 2024). It has a large youthful population which could both be a labor source with many years of working life ahead of them and a market. It also presents itself as an efficiency manufacturing base because of a cheaper labor cost and it enjoys a large material resource base, involving agriculture, marine and sub-soil. How would the new administration of President Trump affect the region? This is an important question that must have come to the minds of many Horn Africans. We shall attempt in this short article to address our thoughts in this respect. President Trump is a businessman, and his politics follow his acumen in the art of dealing and making business transactions and investments. He will no doubt encourage American businessmen and corporations to be provided with easier access to markets, involving perhaps removal of regulatory barriers. He will no doubt pursue businesses that show investment returns quicker. The region should, therefore, be prepared to attract those American corporations which may help in the extraction of the sub-soil wealth of the region including gold, silver and uranium and/or lithium and copper and cobalt of which the region owns substantial deposits and reserves. American firms could be enticed to invest in the region’s food production for export to regions like the Gulf States, where they could make good returns, but also benefitting the region through the employment of the large youthful population of the region. It would definitely be much better for the region to work with investing corporations and firms instead of NGOs which have been a burden and a plaque on the region or for that matter wait for government aid, which does not add one iota to the development process of any country. This will, of course, require pro-business administrations in the region itself, which emphasize on development instead of personal political preservations. It is not only the governments but also the regional corporations which should benefit from the pro-business administration. We know that President Trump has supported African exports to the United States through the AGOA project or the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Bilateral deals in this respect would be more beneficial for the Horn African exporters than going through multilateral agreements, including transactions through the IMF and the World Bank Group. A growing economic pie in the region would require investments in infrastructure, education, health, and technologies. A sustained resource exploitation and managed well can create the necessary income and hence provide the finances required for developing these projects. Life is a chain where every action is connected to another. This will need the Horn African leadership to manage the resources of the region better and cooperate with those who are interested in investing in the region. Certainly, Trump in his competition with the Chinese will become a better business partner for the region, should the region be willing. On the security front, the Trump administration is isolationist but will continue to defend the interests of the United States anywhere. There should be no doubt about that. While the administration will continue the pressures on terrorism, the United States will be more concerned about the presence of the Chinese in the region. Note the only foreign naval base of China is in Djibouti. With China being Africa’s largest trade Partner at present, the Trump administration may put some countries in the region into diplomatic difficulties, because of their large Chinese footprints. This is, however, to be seen. The Horn of Africa States region, perhaps, needs to take stock of its situation and redefine its path. This will require the countries of the region to revisit their relations and establish cordial and cooperative platforms avoiding the recent interferences in each other’s internal affairs, such as the Ethio-Somali interstate conflict. This issue bedeviled some of those partners who may have wished the conflict to disappear and attracted other actors to the region. Ethiopia should make the first move to make peace as it did instigate the latest problem between Somalia and Ethiopia. A united Horn African dynamic would have helped the region better in negotiating with others and especially with the Trump Administration which prefers straight deals instead of clumsy so-called diplomatic maneuvers which only cause more problems as they are generally built on cheating and lies. This would enable the region to procure fair trade deals on good terms. This would help in reviving the manufacturing businesses of the region such as the clothing, the leather, and the gold industries. The region’s ownership of large reserves of gems and precious stones would have helped it build a successful jewellery industries both for local consumption and for exports. It may also build on a thriving tourism industry. Perhaps a Trump Tower in one of the beautiful beaches of the region would help, where a significant mobile tourist population from Europe and the Americas can descend on those currently empty beaches and enjoy the beautiful sun and sand of the region and this will be copied by other tourism companies worldwide. America’s oil corporations have been in the region for nearly a century, and they certainly own concessions signed with previous governments of the region, which are currently under force majeure clauses. These could be re-invigorated, which would add to the wealth of these corporations and the region. The Trump Administration would love to see deals in this respect, noting that the Horn of Africa is the last oil and gas frontier in the world. This would put his administration as the American Administration which drilled first oil and gas in the region. Now that President Trump is back, we shall see how the region will dance with the shift in American politics. It is certain that he will work for American interests, but how this will affect the region will have to be seen. We see opportunities for both the United States and the Horn of Africa region, and we hope they will work together for mutual benefits.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQJYgsT78IPbW	2024-11-07T09:06:05-08:00	
Lessons Learned From The 2024 US Presidential Election – OpEd	The 2024 U.S. presidential election has sparked many discussions on the evolving political landscape and the key issues that influenced voters. Reflecting on these results reveals several crucial lessons for future campaigns and governance. 1. Challenges for Black Female Candidates: Despite increasing representation and visibility of women and minorities in politics, the 2024 election illustrated the persistent challenges Black female candidates face in reaching the highest office. Structural barriers, implicit biases, and the need for broader voter outreach are issues that continue to shape electoral success. Future efforts must focus on fostering a more inclusive political environment to break down these longstanding obstacles. 2. Immigration and Asylum Policies: Immigration, especially regarding asylum seekers, remains a hot-button issue. Calls for stricter policies, including deportations, resonated with a significant portion of voters. The outcome suggests a growing consensus for a more controlled approach to immigration, yet it also highlights the need for humane policies that balance security with compassion. 3. The Dominance of Economic Concerns: Once again, the economy proved central to voters’ decisions. Rising costs, job security, and income inequality were top concerns. The phrase, 'It’s the economy, stupid,' held true, reinforcing the idea that economic policies that directly improve citizens’ daily lives are crucial for gaining voter support. 4. Skepticism Towards Media and Polling: This election underscored a deepening distrust in mainstream media and polling, as many voters felt misrepresented by the narratives these sources projected. Future campaigns may need to reconsider their reliance on traditional media outlets and polling data, focusing instead on direct communication with voters through digital platforms and community outreach. 5. Caution on Foreign Policy and Military Involvement: Lastly, voters expressed a clear preference for avoiding involvement in global conflicts. The outcome suggests a shift towards prioritizing domestic concerns over international entanglements, signaling a public weariness with prolonged military engagements abroad. Future administrations may face pressure to adopt a more restrained and diplomacy-focused foreign policy. The 2024 USA election provided a strong mandate on key issues like representation, economic priorities, immigration, media trust, and foreign policy restraint. These insights will shape political strategies and policies moving forward, guiding candidates to address the evolving expectations of the American electorate.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQLTlHaSdsw7b	2024-11-07T09:04:31-08:00	
Biden Lost Against Trump, Not Kamala – OpEd	Convinced as I am that there are some very positive aspects of Trump's election, economy and foreign policy, I believe that this is where we need to start to be able to say, as I believe I can say, that Kamala Harris did not lose the 2024 election but Joe Biden did. Superficial commentators on the election results miss some things. 1- Biden when he declared he was giving up competing said that his resignation did not depend on health reasons. If the President says so - paraphrasing Shakespeare,- we must believe him, because the President is a man of honor. And this cannot be questioned. 2. But if the responsibility for the withdrawal was not health, then it was the polls. But then the President should have resigned to cut the umbilical cord that unified Kamala's image to his, leaving her free to decide her own electoral program without overlaps, which were already clearly losing. That was not the case. Biden remained on the political scene as President, and Kamala was unable to express her own political campaign. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (German: Im Westen nichts Neues,) by Erich Maria Remarque is the case: 'Nothing new on the Democratic electoral front, one might say in relation to Biden’s replacement with Kamala. Voters are not stupid. They understood it. Why would they have changed their preference of Trump for that of Kamala Harris-Biden? If there were no changes there was no reason to do so, and no one did. And this is what the 'I told you so' style commentators miss. Biden gave up competing but continued to occupy the political scene as President. He spoke about the economy, attended meetings (see the leader of Israel and Ukraine), with his cumbersome presence he superimposed his image on that of Kamala, preventing her from expressing her own differentiated political proposal if any. What is the difference between Biden and Kamala? asks the American voter. None. It is only natural that Kamala's negative vote would have reflected and confirmed that of Biden's negative polls. In the image of future voters, differentiating Biden from Harris was impossible. Kamala was a junior version of Biden. It is only obvious that if there were no differences, the results would have been the same. And so it was. So that what i say does not seem like hindsight considerations, taking advantage of the hospitality of this magazine on more than one occasion I have written a- that Biden having withdrawn from the electoral campaign should have resigned as President b. Kamala should have differentiated herself from the fundamental principles of Biden's campaign to demonstrate to voters that she was not a copy of Biden but an autonomous candidate, but to do so Biden should have resigned as President. c. I suggested that in foreign policy and economics it was more important than ever for Kamala to indicate to Americans that there were substantial differences with Biden's policies. The Democratic general staff made a fundamental mistake. Candidate Kamala Harris should need to express a personal electoral strategy copying Biden she would loose. And for Biden resignation there were two cases. If health reasons justified his withdrawal, he should have resigned as President. If they were not health reasons but polls, the electoral campaign should have distanced itself from Biden thanx to his resignation. This did not happen. Kamala, also due to a natural dependence as vice president for four years, continued to slavishly follow Biden's same path. The leveling out in foreign policy and the failure to address the problem of inflation were sensational. It is therefore no surprise that Kamala's election results have reaffirmed exactly Biden's bad polls, something that the hasty 'I told you so' commentators fail to grasp. Biden's continued presence on the political scene has prevented voters from forming their own idea of ​​the candidate - PERSONAL AND DIFFERENT - In fact, the American voter took it for granted that he would continue Biden's policies. and Biden's continued presidential activity has confirmed this. Biden failed in the polls. Kamala failed in the votes. Biden, it has been written several times in articles hosted by this newspaper, should have resigned to leave the Democratic candidate free to express her presidential visions. This was not the case - For the common voter, given Biden's continued presence, Kamala was a minor electoral double of Biden. That said, Mr. Trump, in some economics and foreign policy, for what you have declared, I personally completely agree, they are good for America and for the world. But there must be no doubt: you defeated Biden. In conclusion. Kamala was sent to the slaughter to correct a losing situation, but she was not given the margins to correct. Biden lost the elections, not Kamala.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQHaW42jO4oa7	2024-11-07T09:03:12-08:00	
Narrative Intelligence: Detecting Chinese And Russian Information...	By Joe Stradinger (FPRI) -- As geopolitical conflicts are increasingly shaped by misleading and deceptive information, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has become an indispensable tool in understanding adversarial information operations and being able to compete in the information environment. Noting the value of OSINT, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently published a framework for the intelligence community to leverage commercially available information. Competition in the information environment among major powers is not new or unique. Today, Russia and China strategically employ information operations as part of their attempts to undermine US interests. China has actively used information operations to generate favorable strategic outcomes in Africa. Russian and Chinese messaging is also aligned in exploiting how the Israel-Hamas conflict is characterized. In this competition space, the distinction between signal and noise is more heightened than ever. As the volume of data increases, so does the challenge of identifying what matters — the relevant information that can be synthesized into actionable intelligence. This makes OSINT crucial for tracking and analyzing security threats as well as for monitoring the ebb and flow of online narratives that can influence public opinion and shape national security policy. Derived primarily from online content published by malign actors, narrative intelligence (NARINT) is an increasingly critical tool of OSINT analysis. It refers to the study and analysis of disinformation and propaganda surfaced on social media platforms, news sites, internet forums, blogs, and the dark web. By thoroughly assessing these materials, analysts can gain a clearer understanding of the narrative tactics foreign entities are using to create hostile divisions and erode basic trust in the nation’s institutions. NARINT is particularly critical to detect, analyze, and compete against adversarial information operations that attempt to undermine US national security interests. It can parse through news, blogs, forums, social media, the dark web, digital broadcasts, and other sources to provide insights that are critical for early indications and warnings. Moreover, it can show how narratives shift and affect public sentiments and opinions about conflicts. Fig. 1: Examples of Russian and Russia-aligned sources amplifying articles about internal division within NATO over its support of Ukraine. We can illustrate all this by examining how Russia and China have employed sophisticated information operations to manufacture and amplify divisions about how NATO members support Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Figure 1 shows how AI-powered content aggregation and enrichment can detect and surface Russia-aligned sources amplifying and propagating narratives about internal division within NATO. We can see how Russia has strategically employed information operations to exploit and amplify divisions between NATO members. For instance, Russia has amplified narratives of dissent and disagreement among NATO allies over military aid, economic sanctions, and long-term strategy in Ukraine. Russia attempts to weaken the unified front that has been instrumental in countering its advances. Fig. 2: Theme tracing locates media items that contain similar thematic emphasis, and places them along a timeline with SCAME-rich information about the sources amplifying them. China has emerged as an opportunistic supporter of Russia’s information operations, amplifying Russian narratives that serve both nations’ interests in diminishing Western influence. Figure 2 shows how Chinese state media, other official platforms, and their affiliates often echo Russian positions on the conflict, presenting a united front that undermines Western policies. The alignment of Chinese support with Russian information operations intensifies the challenge for NATO to maintain a cohesive strategy and public support for Ukraine. It also undermines popular support for NATO’s efforts by creating the impression that the bloc is rife with internecine dissent, and too disorganized to unite effectively around its support of Ukraine. Figure 3 illustrates a theme trace from 11 May to 20 May 2024 that shows how Chinese outlets amplify similar stories to Russian propaganda. Fig. 3: AI-powered text vectorization allows analysts to search for articles that amplify similar themes, and track the spread and evolution of narratives over time. Given the volume of content on social media, it’s impossible to be comprehensive, but the evidence speaks for itself. According to one study, nearly 20% of all search results on TikTok lead to some form of disinformation. In one recent survey, 65% of users said they had encountered some form of disinformation on TikTok. Those who push false narratives tend to package them in such a way as to manipulate audience emotion, meaning relatively small volumes of fake news items often gain considerably more traction than legitimate coverage. Online audiences, it seems, prefer galvanizing disinformation and confirmation bias over more objective news, which they often find ‘boring.’ On Telegram, the situation may be even more dire. A 2020 study conducted at Oxford University claimed that 'Out of the top dozen news sources examined, 33% of all views go to junk news sources.' Given that Telegram has over 400 million users worldwide, its significance as a source of disinformation isn’t in doubt. It doesn’t help that consumers of junk news tend to be considerably more engaged than mainstream news audiences, meaning they are far more inclined to amplify false narratives than others are to share valid ones. And with much of Telegram’s content originating in Russia and Iran, it seems likely that the amount of disinformation on the platform will only increase over time. As noted above though, social media is not the only means by which malign actors distribute propaganda and disinformation. They also rely on state-run media outlets, as well as proxy publications that operate independently but contribute to official narratives all the same. A cluster of Russian newspapers has been working to deepen the tension between NATO members over how best to aid Ukraine. These include TASS, Sputnik, and RT (formerly Russia Today). Assisting them in this effort are various other entities, among them South Front News, Global Times, and The People’s Voice. In addition to social media and news sites, malign actors often employ other means for pushing false narratives. One of these include internet forum sites, such as Reddit, where anonymous manipulators sometimes make false claims in the hopes of garnering engagement from other users. Beyond online forums, there are also a number of video-sharing sites that manipulators use to spread disinformation. The best-known of these is YouTube, but Odysee and the Canadian-based site Rumble are frequently used as repositories of false propaganda as well. A number of entities have used these and similar sites to push the theme of disunity between the US and the EU over how best to aid and equip Ukraine. One such entity, the Hindustan Times, an Indian-based news outlet, often amplifies pro-Kremlin narratives. In mid-April it published a video reporting on a disagreement between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne. In approximately one month’s time, the story has garnered 35,000 views and 185 comments. Similarly, the India-based Firstpost, also a Russia-friendly publication, posted an item in mid-2023 depicting a bitter divide between the EU and NATO over the same question. One year later, it has garnered 872,000 views, 14,000 positive reactions, and 5,973 comments. Russia leverages a broad network of media outlets — often spearheaded by state-controlled media entities — to disseminate targeted misinformation and disinformation aimed at political groups within NATO countries. These efforts are designed to stoke anti-war sentiment by emphasizing the human and financial costs of the conflict. By magnifying isolated incidents of friction among NATO allies, such as disputes over the levels of military aid or the enforcement of sanctions, Russia attempts to foster a narrative of disunity and inefficiency. The Kremlin’s aims appear to be to weaken international resolve and try to diminish domestic support for Ukraine within these countries, thereby obstructing the collective defensive measures critical to Ukraine’s resistance against the Russian invasion. Fig. 4: Narrative mapping can show geographic locations of amplifiers, and the targets of the narrative items they’re amplifying. This narrative shows Russian and Russian-aligned influencers amplifying articles about internal division within NATO over its support of Ukraine. Russia has recently amplified a narrative claiming that Volodymyr Zelensky is no longer the legitimate president of Ukraine. Using georeferencing and enriching metadata, we entered a simple description of the claim — 'Zelensky no longer legitimate president of Ukraine' — and the system’s vector analysis techniques initially surfaced over 450 narrative items. Figure 5 illustrates how these AI models can rapidly surface and visualize who is amplifying this false narrative and how they are aligned over time. Adjusting the narratives’ similarity threshold to 84.7% (a relatively tight setting), we zeroed in on 89 items containing thematically similar content. Predictably, the amplifiers were predominantly Russian and Russia-aligned publications, but no small percentage of them are from Australia and Canada, and are not publishers at all but rather sources active on social media who are more akin to 'influencers,' an indication that Russia understands the importance of having western social media users co-amplify the narratives pushed out by the Kremlin and its state media mouthpieces. Fig. 5: A vector-based theme trace on the Russian-generated narrative that Volodomyr Zelensky is not the legitimate president of Ukraine reveals dozens of items published by Russian state media outlets, and amplified by a number of social media influencers, including a number from Australia and Canada. As strategic competition continues to intensify, the necessity of detecting and understanding adversarial narratives has never been more critical. Information warfare does not pause or discriminate. Russia and China are both adept at crafting and rapidly propagating narratives that promote their national interests and undermine those of their rivals, but based on the past few years’ analysis of their respective efforts, there are, generally speaking, some noticeable differences between Russian disinformation campaigns versus their Chinese counterparts. From what we see, Russian disinformation campaigns are sometimes coordinated by the Kremlin and pushed downward through state media outlets. Sometimes these campaigns are amplified by media-savvy oligarchs networks, members of which range from organizations behaving much like small- to medium-sized media outlets, to individuals operating inside Russia, throughout Europe, and often in the US and Canada. The Kremlin appears to leverage loosely coordinated networks The Kremlin and the oligarch media appear to work together. Sometimes oligarch media put their own spin on the official Kremlin line, simultaneously amplifying it while getting their own message out in the process. Russian information operations show a generally higher level of familiarity with US culture, regional differences, and political factions, leading to more effective content that typically resonates better with their target audiences. Like Russia, the Chinese government also pushes its disinformation campaigns downward through its state media outlets and affiliates, but absent the kind of oligarch media network in Russia, its content appears more centrally controlled by the upper echelons of the CCP media apparatus. However, China has begun to leverage regional and local outlets to amplify its messages. For the time being, China does not seem to have the familiarity with, or depth of understanding of, US culture as their Russian counterparts, which further hampers their campaigns’ effectiveness. That said, the effectiveness of these campaigns in shaping international perception and influencing policy decisions should not be underestimated. Developing robust mechanisms to identify and counter these narratives is crucial for maintaining strategic advantage and ensuring national security. The integration of AI into these endeavors significantly enhances intelligence capabilities. AI-based technologies can analyze vast amounts of data, detecting patterns and shifts in narratives at scale and at speeds that far surpass the capacity of human analysts, and with a degree of accuracy that continues to improve extremely rapidly. By employing AI-driven tools, intelligence professionals can quickly identify emerging adversarial narratives, assess their potential impact, and alert decision-makers in real-time. This approach allows for timely and informed responses, enabling the discovery of aligned narratives and actors and the crafting of effective aligned narratives that support US interests. Narrative intelligence that combines comprehensive publicly-available information with AI has become critical to effective competition in the information environment. Given how malign actors exploit the openness of the information environment, it is imperative that the US leverage OSINT and AI to compete in the cognitive domain. Narrative intelligence plays a critical role in enabling first-move advantage in the information environment.

The Price Of Eggs: Why Harris Lost To Trump – OpEd	It takes some skill to make Donald J. Trump look good. Two Democrats have succeeded in doing so: Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024. The conceit of both presidential campaigns, and the belief that attacking a staggeringly grotesque moral character for being such, was laughable. (When a Clinton mocks groping philanderers and creepy molesters, one must reach for, well, the Starr Report?) In certain countries, abominating and execrating your political adversary for being a moral defective might work. In the United States, such figures can draw benefit from being outside the constraints of law-abiding society. They are quite literally outlaw spirits that still speak of that nebulous notion called the American Dream while encouraging everyone else to come for the ride. Realising it involves treading on toes and breaking a few skulls on the way, but that’s the expectation. From the start, the Democrats had tied themselves in knots by convincing President Joe Biden that he could not only last the tenure of his office but run against Trump. Doing so, and deriding those wishing to see a change in the guard, created a needless handicap. Throughout late 2023 and early 2024, it became clear that the party worthies were doing their best to shield Biden’s cognitive decline. The sham was cruelly exposed in the June 27 debate with Trump. Panic struck the ranks. With little time to regroup, Vice President Harris was close at hand, selected by Biden as the appropriate choice. But Harris landed with a punctured parachute weighed down by the crown of presumptive nomination. There were to be no opponents (the 2016 challenge of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton which annoyed the party mandarins would not be repeated), no primaries, no effective airing of any challenge. It was easy to forget – at least for many Democrats – that Harris’s 2019 bid for the nomination had been spectacularly poor and costly. An ailing president would also keep his occupancy in the White House, rather than resigning and giving Harris some seat warming preparation. While the change caused the inevitable rush of optimism, it soon became clear that the ghost of Hillary’s past had been working its demonic magic. The Harris campaign was unadventurous and safe. All too often, the vice president hoped that messages would reach the outer reaches of the electorate from cocooned comfort, helped by a war chest of fundraising that broke records ($1 billion in less than three months), and a battalion of cheerleading celebrities that suggested electoral estrangement rather than connection. Then there was the problem as to what those messages were. These, in the end, did not veer much beyond attacking Trump as a threat to democracy, women’s rights and reproductive freedoms. They tended to remain unclear on the issue of economics. From foreign to domestic policy, Harris failed to distinguish herself as one able to depart from the Biden program in her own right. Instead, it was hoped that some organic coalition of anti-Trump Republicans, independents, Black voters, women and American youth would somehow materialise at the ballot box. In a September 16 meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, longtime allies of the Democratic Party, Harris failed to convince its leaders that she would protect the livelihood and jobs of workers better than Trump. Within a matter of days, the union publicly revealed that it would not be endorsing Harris as Democratic presidential candidate, the first since 1996. Her interviews were minimal, her exposure to the outside treated with utmost delicacy. The Republicans, on the other hand, were willing to get their hands dirty with an extensive ground campaign that yielded electoral rewards in such battleground states as Pennsylvania. The Early Vote Action effort of conservative activist Scott Presler proved impressive in encouraging voter registration and increasing absentee and early vote counts. His efforts in securing votes for Trump from Pennsylvania’s Amish community were strikingly successful. Trump, in sharp contrast to his opponent, was so exposed to the point of being a potential assassination target on two occasions. He showed the electorate he was worth the tag. He personalised with moronic panache. He babbled and raged, and made sure he, as he always does, dominated the narrative. Alternative media outlets were courted. Most of all, he focused on the breadbasket issues: the cost of groceries, housing and fuel; the perceived terrors of having a lax border policy. He also appealed to voters content with reining in the war making instincts so natural to Harris and neoconservatives on both sides of the aisle. Fundamentally, the Democrats fell for the old trick of attacking Trump’s demagogy rather than teasing out their own policies. The Fascist cometh. The inner Nazi rises. Misogyny rampant. Racism throbbing. This came with the inevitable belittling of voters. You cast your ballot for him, you are either an idiot, a fascist, or both. Oh, and he was just weird, said the unknown and already forgotten ear-scratching Democrat vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, whatever that means in a land where weird is so frequent as to make it its most endearing quality. It is remarkable that Trump, a convicted felon, twice impeached in office, a person so detached from the empirical, the logical, and the half-decent, would be electable in the first place. Even more remarkable is that such a figure has won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. The glorious Republic likes its show and treats elections like marketing exercises. Its defenders often pretend that those reaching its highest office are not mirrors but transcendent figures to emulate. Trump – in all his cocksure hustling and slipshod approach to regulation and convention – shows many in the electorate that the defect and the defective can go far. A few final lessons. The Democrats would do best to listen to those who would otherwise vote for them. Focus on the economy. Talk about the price of eggs and milk. Ditch the lexicon on ill-defined terms of supposedly useful criticism such as fascism, a word the users almost always misunderstand. And always be careful about pundits and pollsters who predict razor small margins in elections. Polls, and people, lie.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy2TOWeedvPHp	2024-11-06T17:25:07-08:00	
India And China Vie For Leadership Of Global South – Analysis	By Ronak Gopaldas The rivalry between China and India, both BRICS members, extends to their bid to lead the global south. As Western dominance wanes, both Beijing and New Delhi are advancing distinct yet globally influential agendas, each leveraging unique strengths that shape global alliances and institutions. For African nations, where development and decision-making sovereignty are key, the choice between China and India as global south leaders is significant. Each offers advantages and challenges with implications for Africa’s future. Although neither has officially declared a bid for this leadership, their actions and statements signal intent. India’s role in pushing for south-south cooperation at forums like the G20, and advocating for more equitable representation in global governance, align with its leadership vision. China’s assertive diplomacy, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its increasing investments in African and Latin American infrastructure projects, highlights a claim to leadership rooted in economic influence. The rivalry is stoked by narratives in each country’s foreign policy community and think tanks, which see India’s democratic alignment and China’s developmental success as competing models for the global south. Officially, both countries underscore their solidarity with developing nations but avoid overt declarations of competition, instead positioning their respective approaches as solutions to developing countries’ needs. India, as the world’s largest democracy, resonates strongly in Africa, where democratic governance is often seen as a path to stability and growth. India’s commitment to democratic values and its policy of non-interference align well with Africa’s emphasis on political sovereignty and diversity. Many African nations also share historical ties with India, rooted in the Non-Aligned Movement and anti-colonial solidarity, which reinforce India’s appeal as a trusted partner. This is further strengthened by the influential role of the Indian diaspora in Africa. China’s strength in infrastructure and financial investment provides immediate support India’s development approach centres on human capital and technology transfer, often through private sector initiatives. This model, focused on skills building, matches Africa’s need for sustainable, locally adaptable solutions. India’s experiences with its own diverse population enable it to respond effectively to Africa’s varied needs. Through public-private partnerships, India has achieved progress in healthcare, education and digital access, which could provide scalable models for African countries facing similar challenges. On the global stage, India has played a leading role in minilateral and multilateral groupings like the Quad and G20, and by fostering ties with the United States, Europe and BRICS countries. India’s role as a bridge between the global north and south has proven advantageous, as seen in its push to include the African Union in the G20. India’s assertive stance on issues like the Ukraine conflict has also resonated with African nations seeking an independent global voice. This context has bolstered India’s standing in the global south, with African countries increasingly viewing India as representing their collective interests. India’s ability to balance relations with both Western and non-Western powers appeals to African nations navigating similarly complex geopolitics. However, India’s limited financial resources compared to China, pose challenges in scaling its influence across Africa. Domestic issues like poverty alleviation and infrastructure development may further limit India’s capacity to prioritise Africa consistently. The lack of an India-Africa Forum Summit since 2015 also raises questions about India’s long-term commitment. India’s focus on skills, technology transfer and democratic governance provides for long-term growth China’s economic might makes it a compelling global south leader, especially through its infrastructure projects that meet urgent needs. Africa’s vast infrastructure deficit – in transport, energy and telecommunications – finds an eager partner in China’s BRI, which has made a visible impact across the continent. BRI projects help African economies integrate with global trade routes, enhancing export potential and fostering regional connections. China’s achievements in poverty reduction – viewed by many African countries as a model for economic transformation – add to its appeal. China’s stance on non-interference aligns with African leaders’ preference for sovereignty, and African countries wary of Western conditionalities often find China’s approach refreshing. Further, China’s creation of alternative global institutions – such as the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative – presents African nations with options beyond Western-led frameworks, appealing to those who seek diverse partnerships. China’s technological prowess, particularly in 5G, digital payments and artificial intelligence, offers transformative potential for African economies. The country’s involvement in telecommunications provides affordable digital infrastructure necessary for economic development. However, China’s authoritarian government raises concerns among Africa’s democratic nations, and financial dependency on China has cast a shadow on its image. Transparency issues, contentious labour practices, and the environmental impacts of large-scale projects have also sparked criticism. These factors lead some African leaders to question whether China’s transactional approach aligns with their long-term goals. China’s reputation is also affected by controversies around COVID-19, espionage allegations and assertive foreign policies, potentially diminishing its appeal as a global south leader. By engaging both, Africa can build a diversified development approach that minimises dependency on one partner Some argue that China’s inclusion in the global south is convenient but contrived, compromising its leadership credibility. Critics point to China’s high GDP, robust trade, investments and military power, which align more with great power status than the global south. Beijing, however, maintains that solidarity with developing countries is the foundation of its foreign relations. For Africa, the choice between China and India as global south leaders depends on the continent’s priorities and values. India’s democratic credentials, development model and trust-based partnerships are appealing, as is its growing role as a bridge-builder between north and south, especially among African countries seeking sovereignty in their partnerships. Conversely, China’s financial strength, rapid infrastructure development, and non-interference approach make it a vital partner, particularly for nations facing immediate development needs. Yet concerns about debt sustainability and China’s authoritative approach limit its appeal as a long-term leader. Ultimately, the choice need not be one or the other – both offer complementary roles that African countries can strategically leverage. China’s strength in large-scale infrastructure and financial investment provides immediate, transformative support. Meanwhile, India’s focus on capacity building, technology transfer, and democratic governance offers a pathway to sustainable, locally adaptable long-term growth. The recent rapprochement between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit could be a positive sign – though analysts remain sceptical given the substantive tensions. A more cooperative relationship could allow BRICS to consistently support Africa, addressing infrastructure and human capital development while promoting a more cohesive global south. By engaging with both China and India, Africa can build a balanced, diversified approach to development that minimises dependency on a single partner. This dual engagement allows African nations to draw on China’s resources to meet urgent infrastructure needs while benefitting from India’s people-centred initiatives that foster skills and independence. In doing so, Africa can assert its agency on the global stage, using the strengths of both to advance its interests.

A Disenchanted Japan Punishes The LDP – Analysis	By Kuniaki Nemoto Japan’s House of Representatives election on 27 October resulted in a hung parliament. Having ruled Japan since 2012, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost 68 seats, winning only 191. For the first time in 15 years, it failed to win the 233 seats required for a majority. The LDP’s long-term coalition partner, Komeito, also saw its seat count drop to 24, with the surprising defeat of its party leader. With a combined seat count of only 215, the LDP–Komeito coalition is short of the majority required to stay in power. Most of Japan’s fractured opposition is gaining momentum. The largest winner is the centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), with 148 seats — an increase of 52 seats. The centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPFP) quadrupled its seat count to 28. The Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), a right-wing regional party based in Osaka, secured 38 seats. Minor leftist parties retained their Diet presence, with Reiwa Shinsengumi and the Japanese Communist Party holding nine and eight seats, respectively. Two scandals drove voters’ punishment of the LDP. The first is the LDP’s collusion and close relationship with the controversial Unification Church, which was revealed after the assassination of the former prime minister Shinzo Abe. According to police investigations of Abe’s assassin, the Unification Church, which was closely associated with Abe, financially ruined the assassin’s family. Some ministers tied to the Unification Church were sacked and the government initiated the church’s dissolution process. Yet the LDP failed to do anything beyond disclosing a list of 121 members with some ties to the church. The second scandal related to misconduct surrounding the financing of the LDP’s internal factions. Many LDP members, especially members from Abe’s faction and the former LDP Secretary-General Nikai’s faction, did not report revenues from their factions’ fundraising parties in their financial reports. They then received these revenues as kickbacks as secret funds. The Abe faction, one of the largest factions inside the LDP, distributed 675 million yen to its members between 2018 and 2022. Prosecutors failed to indict most of the suspects though, since they could not find evidence and factions shifted the blame to their treasurers. Japanese citizens considered the long-ruling party’s reaction as lukewarm at best, as suggested by former prime minister Fumio Kishida’s plummeting approval rating. The LDP’s Party Ethics Committee decided to punish a mere 39 members, even though over 80 members were involved in the slush-fund scandal. The parliament held a Council on Political Ethics to question LDP members, but only 10 members appeared, since attendance is voluntary. Even those who attended offered no satisfactory answers. The Diet passed a revised Political Funds Control Act to increase transparency, despite the opposition’s criticism that it was insufficient. As a very unpopular Kishida finally decided to give up his party’s leadership, the LDP chose to hold a new party leader election — likely in an attempt to call a snap election when its new leader’s popularity was high. Nine candidates scrambled for the election, though no candidate was willing to restart a thorough investigation into the slush fund scandal. The Unification Church issue did not get wide attention, either. The newly elected LDP leader, Shigeru Ishiba, decided not to give LDP endorsements to 12 scandal-tainted politicians in order to regain the public’s trust in the party. In addition, though the LDP endorsed other scandal-hit members on their single-member district contests, it decided to ban dual candidacies. These moves did not help Ishiba’s popularity, with his approval rating falling to below 30 per cent a week prior to election day. A final blow to the LDP came just days before the end of the campaign. Akahata, the daily newspaper of the Japanese Communist Party, scooped the fact that the LDP allocated 20 million yen to local party chapters headed by LDP members, including ones running without LDP endorsements. Opposition parties heavily criticised this as covertly supporting scandal-hit members. On 27 October — voting day — the disenchanted public’s reaction against the LDP was harsh. For Ishiba to stay in power, he must win the upcoming prime ministerial nomination in a soon-to-be-held special Diet session. Ishiba may not be able to secure a majority of votes in the first round of the nomination, given the hung parliament. Former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, the newly elected leader of the main opposition CDP, quite ambitiously sought government turnover by attracting the other opposition parties. But as the DPFP and Ishin decided not to vote for Noda, the CDP leader does not seem to have sufficient headcounts, either. The prime ministerial nomination is then likely to move on to the second run-off round for the first time in 30 years. Since only a plurality of votes is required in the run-off, Ishiba seems to be better positioned for now. No matter who becomes Japan’s leader, the situation will be difficult and uncertain — any coalition will likely be a minority government that faces the constant risk of a no-confidence motion. Turbulent times await. About the author: Kuniaki Nemoto is Professor of Political Science at the Department of Economics, Musashi University.

To ‘Save Democracy,’ Facebook Bans ‘Dictator’ – OpEd	Facebook notified me on Sunday morning that eight years ago, I posted a link to my Washington Times article warning of Dictatorial Democracy regardless of whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump won the 2016 election. The opening sentence set the tone: 'The 2016 election campaign is mortifying millions of Americans in part because the presidency has become far more dangerous in recent times.' Facebook always gives users the option to 'Share a Memory' link. I tapped the button to automatically send a notice on 'Dictatorial Democracy' to all my Facebook friends and followers. No such luck: Facebook notified me that they had banned sharing the piece because it violated Facebook 'Community Standards.' Maybe if I had simply howled about one of the current presidential candidates being Hitler, that would have satisfied Facebook‘s Community Standards? Facebook chief Zuckerberg recently admitted that his company massively censored Americans at federal command during covid and other times. Is suppressing any mention of dictatorship a policy designed to placate federal overseers? Or are Facebook‘s Community Standards guardians really as dumb as Tim Walz? Why was mentioning 'dictatorial democracy' acceptable in 2016 but forbidden in 2024? After Facebook blocked my repost of the Dictatorial Democracy piece, I posted the above photo mocking their decision. Facebook banned the photo, too. Facebook permitted me to request a review of that ban. The response offered a multiple choice menu of protests. I was disappointed there was not a 'You people are boneheads' option. Their 'review' process seemed as vapid as their original decree: And how does the process work? Facebook‘s AI software checks to confirm the initial decision by Facebook AI to ban a post. I sit on the edge of my chair, awaiting the verdict from Facebook software. Actually, I thrashed Facebook seven years ago in USA Today for suppressing a post I did about FBI atrocities at Waco, Texas in 1993. That piece noted the Waco fire image was not the first time that Facebook erased an iconic image that the U.S. government would be happy to see vanish. Facebook likely deleted thousands of postings of the 1972 photo of a young South Vietnamese girl running naked after a plane dropped napalm on her village. After coming under severe criticism last year, Facebook announced that it would no longer suppress that image. But Facebook was already shamelessly craven to foreign governments, including Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, and India. I warned that Facebook’s 'nonchalance about engaging in the electronic equivalent of book burning abroad' signaled that the company could do the same here. Actually, the Dictatorial Democracy ban might not be the most inane ruling I have seen from Facebook this year. In June, they blocked my posting a link to a Future of Freedom Foundation podcast because it contained the cover image of my new book, Last Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty. Facebook claimed my post violated 'community standards' because it was spam. How could it be spam if it was clearly labeled and including a video and link from a reputable organization—well, at least reputable to libertarians, anarchists, and hooligans? Facebook notified me that I could appeal their ruling. Fine—I can explain their blunder in three sentences. No such option. Instead, they offered a series of pages where I could check a box that looked like it was designed for kindergarten. 'It’s not offensive in my region'—ya, that‘s a great option to sway the Facebook Content Moderation Police in Manila. I am pretty sure that the Facebook Appellate Division never sent me their verdict on this content. Looking at that strikedown of my book cover, I wondered: Has Facebook gone full Idiocracy? Or maybe that already happened during covid? Facebook placated the Biden White House by promising to delete any posts or comments that suggested 'COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured'—even though federal agencies now admit that the virus likely came out of a US government-funded lab in Wuhan. On March 21, 2021, White House Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty notified Facebook that suppressing false information on COVID was not enough. A Facebook official assured the White House that Facebook was also suppressing 'often-true content' that might discourage people from getting vaccinated. White House officials even ordered Facebook to delete humorous memes, including a parody of a future television ad: 'Did you or a loved one take the COVID vaccine? You may be entitled…' President Biden denounced Facebook for killing people because it did not mindlessly repeat the Party Line on covid. In June 2023, Zuckerberg admitted that the feds 'asked for a bunch of things to be censored that, in retrospect, ended up being more debatable or true. That stuff…really undermines trust.' A few weeks after Zuckerberg‘s comment, Federal Judge Terry Doughty ruled that the White House and federal agencies 'engaged in coercion of social media companies to such extent that the decisions of the social media companies should be deemed that of the Government.' Doughty slammed the Biden administration for committing potentially 'the most massive attack against free speech in United States history.' Unfortunately, condemnations of federal censorship by federal judges apparently did nothing to put starch into Facebook‘s spine. Or maybe Facebook would massively censor its users even if it didn’t expect any rewards from Washington? On August 27, Zuckerberg sent a letter to a congressional committee stating that 'senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured' Facebook to censor content. Zuckerberg regretted that his company cowered, more or less: 'I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.... We made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn’t make today.' But Zuck promised that Facebook would 'not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any Administration' in the future. So we should trust that Facebook will not again become a willing executioner of Americans‘ freedom of speech, except for any references to 'dictator' that might discomfit people. My 2016 piece declared, 'The United States may be on the verge of the biggest legitimacy crisis since the Civil War.' That legitimacy crisis has worsened over the past two presidential terms. But at least Facebook will be here to assure we never run out of cute kitty photos.

Grassroots Roles The Only Way To Shift US Middle East Policy – Op...	History tells us that US presidential election results mean little in terms of how the country deals with two key audiences: the Middle East, including its current and future conflicts, and the role of Arabs in America. No matter the outcome of votes like this week’s, American policy will continue to follow the same path, although it may be more nuanced and have a different tenor and tone. While the conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran are being fueled by billions of American dollars, the actual policies are being driven by Israel’s government. And in American politics, Israel enjoys Teflon-like protection from major change. Republican Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election will be little more than a news story and a subject of discussion for the pundits. Meanwhile, the Israeli genocide in Gaza will not stop until Israel wants it to stop. And Israel will also decide how far it will go in its wars with Lebanon and Iran. As for Arabs in America, there will be a lot of pictures and smiles with the winning candidate. A lot of back-slapping. And maybe some jobs and appointments for some Arabs and Muslims. But this does not mean there will be a change in American foreign policy or any enhancement in their engagement with government. Fundamentally, the US’ Middle East policy did not change the last time Trump was president between 2017 and 2021. There was no recognition of a Palestinian state or easing of support for Israel. Accords were signed with several Arab countries that sought American financial or diplomatic assistance. America’s support for Israel in the UN Security Council is rock solid and the US ambassador to the organization, regardless of who holds the seat, will continue to veto any resolution that tries to significantly change the path Israel is currently taking. US ambassadors to the UN have cast 91 vetoes in the council since the world body was founded in 1945, with nearly half protecting Israel and more than 30 directly blocking Palestinian rights. These votes have been consistent under both Republican and Democratic White House administrations. American presidents do not brag about that veto record, but it is a fundamental fact that will not change just because one party or another has taken control of the White House. It did not change under Democratic President Joe Biden either. Despite press releases about engaging in a 'partnership' with Arab Americans, that relationship was dead on arrival. All the Arabs and Muslims appointed to key White House and State Department posts were muzzled. They were not allowed to engage in media interviews unless they were tightly choreographed and controlled. A Kamala Harris presidency would also not have been any different. There is only one area of American politics that can change. It is not on the national level, such as the presidency or even representation in the US Congress. It is at the local level. Despite the perception, the headlines and the news reporting, American politics starts at the grassroots level, not at the top. Only when Arab Americans change the attitudes and understanding of their neighbors in their cities, towns and counties will American foreign policy start to show a seismic shift. That is how Israel did it. It funded huge public relations campaigns, involving the news media, movies and even entertainment, to change how Americans saw the Arab-Israeli conflict. It portrayed Israelis as victims of the 'terrorist' Arab world and 'educated' (i.e., brainwashed) Americans into being sympathetic with Israel’s needs and suspicious of Arab demands. Israelis were embraced as if they were American, while Arabs were demonized, largely because of their faith — a historical remnant of the Crusades, as Christianity continues to be pitted against Islam. But who cares about facts when defending Israel? Facts mean nothing in that equation. Palestinians kill 1,200 Israelis and it is a mini version of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Israel then kills more than 44,000 Arabs and Muslims in response and it is a mere consequence of Israel defending itself. Change will not come from electing a new president. But it will come from electing Arabs and Muslims to local government offices. The lowest levels of government have the greatest power and the most direct and personal contact with the American people. Meanwhile, the offices of the highest levels of government reflect broader policies that are the result of societal perceptions. You cannot change US foreign policy by electing a new president. But you can change it by altering how American society sees the Middle East and all its issues through getting Arabs and Muslims into local government offices. Change in America happens one person at a time. But that means that more Arabs and more Muslims need to run for local political office, pursuing a less grandiose goal. Sure, serving as a congressman or senator carries much prestige and a semblance of authority and power. But a position as a trustee or alderman in a village or city in America, or even as a mayor or state legislator, has much greater weight in terms of impacting public perception in a substantive way. When our peers at the grassroots level learn to trust us and understand our history, then and only then will American politics change at the international level. It is a simple dynamic in which egos and arrogance have to be shelved in favor of pragmatism and less grandiose, less selfish personal airs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy_Lr4n4uf8L2	2024-11-06T16:55:21-08:00	
Why Lower-Income Workers Are Trending Republican – OpEd	It’s hard to be an economist and, at the same time, be a Democrat. The reason? Most left-leaning Democrats reject the main teachings of economics. Yet more than 80% of academic economists are Democrats. For every Republicaneconomist on college faculties, there are 4.5 Democrats. Consider just a few of the ways in which what economists know differs from what liberal Democrats think. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a slew of congressional Democrats say that corporate greed is the cause of inflation, and two-thirds of Democratic voters agree with them. Yet, there is no such thing as a greed theory of inflation in any economics textbook. The Democratic solution to the problem of inflation is typically price controls, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has actually introduced a bill to impose them. Yet there is no textbook support for general price controls—especially on the Biden-Harris team’s favorite target: the price of groceries. The Biden-Harris administration supports rent control, as do half of Democratic voters. To be fair, almost the same percent of Republicans and independents also favor it. Yet almost no economist supports rent controls because of the negative effects discovered in over 200 studies. Like Biden, Harris wants to raise the corporate income tax rate while claiming that no one earning less than $400,000 would see a tax increase under her plan. Yet, all economists know that corporations do not pay taxes. People do. Every serious look at the corporate income tax concludes that some of the tax is paid by labor in the form of lower wages. One study concludes that the entirety of the corporate tax is paid by labor! The contrast between what economists know and what liberal Democrats think does not reflect mere differences over what public policies to choose. It represents two completely different understandings of how the economy works. What is true of academic economists is also true of highly educated, higher-income people who work in the private sector and have some basic knowledge of economics. They include quite a few billionaires, such as Mark Cuban and Bill Gates. Increasingly, they are voting for Democrats, even though they have the sophistication to know that the Democratic views described above are wrong and the Democratic policies are bad. At the same time, blue-collar, noncollege graduates are trending Republican. How do we explain this realignment? High-income, highly educated people often vote for liberal Democrats for two reasons: guilt and mythology. It is not unusual for these folks to think they won the genetic lottery unfairly. They were born in the right ZIP code to the right parents and with the right genes. They feel guilty about that. As for the mythology, that is summarized by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who became almost apoplectic the other day over the thought of large numbers of blue-collar workers voting for former President Donald Trump. Krugman wrote: 'Since the 1970s our two main political parties have diverged sharply on economic ideology. In general, Democrats favor higher taxes on the rich and a stronger social safety net; Republicans favor lower taxes on corporations and the wealthy paid for in part by cutting social programs.' In other words, Republicans favor the rich and Democrats favor the poor and the middle class. The problem: Krugman’s view of the world is a myth. Republican tax cuts through the years have sought to lower tax rates and broaden the base. And just about every time they legislated, Republicans threw more and more people off the tax rolls. As a result, the bottom half of the income ladder is paying almost no income tax at all. From President Ronald Reagan to Trump, the Republicans have shifted the burden of the income tax to the rich—so much so that today, we have the most progressive tax system in the world. The second part of the myth is the idea that Democrats are friends of those at the bottom of the income ladder. In almost all large cities, low-income families are forced to send their children to the worst schools, live in the worst housing, and endure the worst environmental harms. Virtually all these cities are managed by liberal Democrats. And the more Democratic the city, the worse things are: more homelessness, more segregated housing, more segregated schools, and more income inequality. By contrast, such Republican ideas as enterprise zones, enterprise programs, and charter cities would liberate people. As for the 'safety net,' welfare-entitlement spending on those at the bottom 20% of the income distribution averaged $64,700 per household in 2022. The vast bulk of that spending goes to medical, housing, education, and agribusiness interests, however. Poor households get very little from the government in cash, which is why they stay poor. That may be why the bottom half of the income ladder is trending Republican.

New Leader, Same Old Problems For UK’s Conservatives – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro For the world, the UK Conservative Party’s election of a Black female as leader is something to be applauded. She is not the first woman leader of the party, since Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Liz Truss have all preceded her and been in government too. All have left their mark on the country, both positively and negatively, each for their own reasons. Yet, the election of Kemi Badenoch is not a surprise for the tolerant, multicultural nation that is the UK, as she succeeded Rishi Sunak, the first British Asian prime minister, who was defeated at the last general election in July. The gender barrier has long since been crossed in the UK, both at the government level and in the royal realm, as the modern world knew the legendary Queen Elizabeth II, who reigned for seven decades and followed in the footsteps of other famous female sovereigns like Queen Victoria and Elizabeth I. Badenoch will be the second person from a minority background to have a shot at the highest executive office in the country if her leadership survives until the next general election, which is due by the summer of 2029. But is Badenoch the right person to lead the Tory party? During the Conservatives’ spell in power from 2010 until July’s election defeat, the party was widely viewed as having deeply divided the country and nearly collapsed its economy, while many Tory MPs pushed the electorate to score a historic own goal by convincing them that they would be better off outside the EU, rather than being part of the economic, social and political union on their doorstep? Maybe Badenoch will do a great job managing the party in opposition. She will have to try to unify its splintered wings, ranging from the right-wing tribe that led the country in the years after the Brexit vote to the center-right forces that opposed the UK’s European exit and who were deeply marginalized as a result. The latter were the ones that built, over many decades, the reputation of the Conservatives as the country’s main 'party of government.' I am minded to think that Badenoch will be just another leader who will have a shot at bringing the party back from the wilderness it put itself in following the Brexit referendum. Time will tell if she is lucky enough to survive the internal conflicts the party has been suffering from since falling into the grip of certain unsavory, self-serving figures who evidently put themselves, their friends and their party ahead of the country. Above all, I find it hard to see in Badenoch anything more than a figure who will be used by others in the party, due to her Nigerian background, to try to whitewash the accusations of racism levelled against the party and the Tories’ anti-immigration and anti-EU stances. Many believe that the political party she now leads has been funded during recent election campaigns by rich donors who do not hide their contempt for people of other colors and creeds. Clearly, Badenoch, a Black woman and the daughter of Nigerian parents, born in Wimbledon in South London, who spent her childhood in Lagos and the US, must be tainted with the same brush as the leaders she has served under, especially Boris Johnson. The former PM was a remainer who switched to leading the campaign to leave the EU at the strike of a pen, and far from any conviction. Many believe that Badenoch is also an opportunist, having served in various ministerial roles in the Johnson government that vowed to 'get Brexit done,' despite previously being on the record as saying that Brexit would be bad for British business and particularly traumatic for the UK car industry. The question is whether she has it in her to rally voters and heal the rift between the country and the Conservative Party due to their many lies and scandals, as well as the tarnished integrity of those she served alongside in a government that was unceremoniously ejected from power. The Tory party has always had a talent for breaking the mold in politics by promoting 'different' personalities to the top jobs, like Benjamin Disraeli, the UK’s only Jewish prime minister, Andrew Bonar Law, a Canadian, and even John Major, who was seen as the boy from Brixton — a poor neighborhood in South London known for its large Afro-Caribbean community. In selecting the controversial Badenoch — a computer engineer who worked in IT publishing and banking before becoming digital director of weekly magazine The Spectator, which is known as the British right’s bible — the Conservative Party still looks far away from healing itself. In putting at the helm someone who is seen as combative and controversial and who is against 'woke,' the party is sticking to the route of far-right politics and populist forces along the lines of Donald Trump, Giorgia Meloni and Marine Le Pen. It is thought that Badenoch and her shadow Cabinet, with a total of just 121 Members of Parliament, are unlikely to succeed in effectively holding to account the centrist Labour government of Keir Starmer, unless of course Labour gives the Tories a lifeline by scuppering their own chances in government. Similarly, it is unlikely that she will shake off the taints of racism or the empty anti-migrant, anti-establishment populist rhetoric that have stuck to her party and unfortunately are not unique to the UK, as they have been making inroads in most democratic nations around the world.

How Trump Won And What Black People Should Do – OpEd	Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris must be a wake up call to Black people. The Democratic Party is a dead end and a movement killer. Our survival depends on getting that corrupt wing of the duopoly out of our lives and out of our politics. On the evening of November 8, 2016, this columnist realized that Hillary Clinton had lost. She hadn’t yet conceded, the polls were still open on the west coast, but she lost Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to Donald Trump. When he turned these formerly democratic states republican, he secured a victory in the electoral college and became the 45th president of the United States. Late that night and in the early morning hours I wrote, 'Dump the Democrats for Good' and pointed out what is still true eight years later. 'Black people are now in fear and in shock when we ought to be spoiling for a fight. All is not lost. Even the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship. Not the electoral ship, the political one. For decades black Americans have been voting for people who have done them wrong.' Trump is a political figure unlike any other in U.S. political history. He is a failed businessman who excelled only at self-promotion, who had never held public office, who differed only from masses of white people in that he was wealthier. It was often said that he 'spoke his mind' but that really meant that his every racist and ignorant utterance was on the minds of white middle Americans who felt validated by him. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the choice of the political establishment and corporate media. He seemingly went down to permanent defeat in 2020, although he never admitted he had lost, and on January 6, 2021 his followers vandalized the capitol while attempting to stop the electoral college certification. Since that time he lost a civil trial that found him guilty of rape and he was assessed a judgement of $350 million for defaming his accuser. He was convicted of falsifying business records in New York, which is a felony. He has been indicted in Georgia for attempting to overturn election results in that state, and he may face more charges regarding the mishandling of classified documents. Yet he is poised to become the 47th president of the United States. His own determination not to give up is largely responsible for this political comeback but the democrats share a large part of the blame in allowing their nemesis to once again occupy the white house. In 2020 democrats rigged the primary process in favor of former vice president Joe Biden. Biden was not popular with voters but he was with his party’s oligarchs. The other candidates left the race when they were told to and Bernie Sanders took a dive instead of fighting for his supporters. Many observers noted Biden’s frailty even then but he still had some political advantages. Trump was seen as being responsible for all the upheavals caused by the covid-19 crisis. He won in 2016 but only in the electoral college. He lost the popular vote and his approval rating never hit the 50% mark . Covid and the months-long Russiagate story proved too much in the 2020 campaign. Biden’s victory was greeted with celebrations but he was still the old right winger and his team falsely claimed he was 'the most progressive president since FDR' even though he was nothing of the sort.They said he would 'cut child poverty in half' but he allowed covid era support programs to lapse. He had no desire to fight against the oligarchs who insisted on continuing austerity. Millions of people who had Medicaid and SNAP benefits were suddenly kicked off of these life saving programs. Stimulus payments were gone and eviction protection and extensions of unemployment insurance payments were too. While working people continued to struggle economically, the Biden administration told them that economic indicators that have nothing to do with their lives were humming along and they were just too stupid to know they were doing well. Build Back Better legislation was supposed to provide some of the missing support but the oligarchy wasn’t having it. Build Back Better died and so did Biden’s chances of being re-elected. Instead of easing him out in 2022 or 2023 as one would expect, the democrats instead reordered the primary process to help their president who suffered from low approval ratings. Then came Biden’s very public collapse during his June debate with Trump. Anyone paying attention could see that Biden was not a well man, and his stumbling effort was an opportunity to get rid of him. Wealthy democratic donors took the lead in getting Biden to end his campaign. Democrats were then stuck with Kamala Harris. It would have been awkward to pass over the vice president and such a move would offend Black voters and thus Harris was anointed. They even dispensed with proposals to have an open convention which might have given some appearance of a process which had some veneer of democracy. Harris’ weaknesses were clear. Despite years in public office including as a senator who had her own presidential campaign, she was still unable to overcome personal deficiencies such as struggling to express herself whenever she was unscripted. Her lack of self-confidence was evident with her famous nervous laughter. She was also heartily disliked, as any prosecutor should be, and earned the nickname Copmala, because of her strict allegiance to the mass incarceration system. She dropped out of the 2020 presidential election without having won a single delegate. Her campaign website, usually a repository of pandering and sloganeering, had no content at all, except requests for money, for 50 days. Her campaign spoke of joy but nothing substantive that might inspire low motivation voters to make any effort. Even after a respectable debate performance against Trump, she resorted to being the Kamala Harris of old with her bad instincts intact such as in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, and bragged about being a gun owner who would shoot anyone who broke into her home. She continued her foolish appeal to the non-existent 'never Trump republicans,' fanciful creatures akin to unicorns, because they don’t actually exist. Harris pledged to include a republican in her cabinet and form a bipartisan commission to guide her in office. None of the unrequited republican love got her any votes. It must be pointed out that her biggest campaign obstacle was handed to her by her boss. The ongoing genocide in Israel has engendered revulsion among millions of people. Israel has now killed at least 200,000 people in Gaza alone and recently invaded Lebanon where it continues to commit war crimes of collective punishment and starvation and torture and rape, all with the help of the United States. The notoriously clumsy politician tried to talk out of both sides of her mouth, simultaneously claiming to work for a ceasefire while also promising to give Israel whatever it wants. She fooled no one, although she tried to by presenting a pro-Israel message in Pennsylvania while also showing pretend concern for Palestine in Michigan, a state with a large Arab population. Voters consistently showed bipartisan support for a ceasefire but support for genocide in congress was also bipartisan. The atrocities continued and democrats gave Trump an opening, allowing the candidate preferred by the Israeli government to claim he would be the peacemaker . While Kamala struggled to connect with democrats, Trump’s people don’t care about his criminal or civil cases. They don’t care if the corporate media don’t like him or if finance capitalists prefer the democrats. Mocking them makes liberals feel superior, but Trump supporters love their guy and don’t care about the opinions of those who don’t. This realization should have kept the Harris camp from calling him Hitler or a fascist when she should have been giving voters affirmative reasons to vote for her. As in 2016, a Trump victory should be the beginning of new Black politics. It should mean the end of Democratic Party as the focus of Black voters. Even though the Republican Party has been the 'white people's party' for 60 years, it is clear that seeing ourselves solely as electoral opposition is a losing proposition. So is believing that we must vote for democrats at all. Their party is lost, existing only as a money laundering operation, which is why Kamala Harris raised nearly $1 billion , more than twice as much as Donald Trump did. It is the party of the Israel lobby, weapons manufacturers, Wall Street, and big pharma, and as such offers nothing to Black people. Even their campaign promises are more meager over time. Biden campaigned in 2020 saying he would raise the federal minimum wage, but he didn’t and that made it impossible for Harris to raise the issue, assuming she thought about it at all. That issue is but one reason that we must let the Democratic Party die. Aside from a vague Opportunity Economy offering tax credits to small businesses and maybe giving up to $25,000 for a home down payment, she offered Black people nothing. She didn’t even mention bringing back the Voting Rights Act enforcement provisions. If a candidate has nothing to offer except repeating that they aren’t their opposition, then they are headed for defeat. Black people don’t have to be defeated because the democrats are. We still have agency. We can still organize instead of hitching our wagons to failure and betrayal. When they blame the Green party, Palestinian voters, Latino men, white women, or anyone else, we must hold up a mirror to their faces and point out that the fault is their own. If we hold on to traitors and losers, the fault will also be ours. Trump again enters office with majorities in both houses of congress and this time he won the popular vote as well. Beginning on January 20, 2025 he will have a free hand to do whatever he wants. Between now and then we need clear headed thought, and any laments about the return of segregation or the end of elections or other nonsense are unhelpful. I stand by and repeat what I wrote in 2016, 'The destruction of the Democratic Party and the creation of a truly progressive political movement is the only hope for black America.' It is also the only hope for the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiyx4bg70trmc9	2024-11-06T16:48:58-08:00	
Why Trump’s Victory Matters, And Why It Doesn’t – OpEd	By Connor O'Keeffe Donald Trump is the winner of the 2024 presidential election. After winning back states he had lost in 2020, Trump performed well in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania—states Kamala Harris needed to win. Trump has won more than enough electoral votes to win back the White House and is projected to win the popular vote. Republicans have also retaken control of the Senate. Control over the House of Representatives is still up for grabs but, so far, Republicans are on pace to take that too. Trump’s win represents another major and well-deserved repudiation of the Washington establishment. In 2016, Republican voters decisively rejected Jeb Bush—the establishment’s chosen GOP candidate—and sent Donald Trump to the White House on a refreshingly anti-establishment platform. While he largely governed like an establishment Republican in his first term, his occasionally anti-establishment rhetoric was enough to prompt a full-court press from the political class to first force him out of office and later to disqualify him from ever holding power again. In the realm of public opinion, the establishment’s chosen tactic was to label Trump a racist, misogynist, wanna-be fascist whose supporters back him simply because they hate everyone who isn’t straight, white, and male. As Murray Rothbard wrote in a controversial, but prescient essay back in 1992, the modern Washington establishment has shown a robust willingness to excuse and even side with explicit racists. They aren’t actually appalled or offended by off-color jokes and statements. They just recognize that it’s easier to get regular, everyday Americans upset about those things than the rhetoric that truly worries those in power—in this case, Trump’s honesty about how Washington screws the public over and his skepticism about the need to fight all these wars. The fact that Trump won again, after eight years of relentless demonization from those in power, is arguably an even bigger loss for the establishment than 2016. It is certainly a bad outcome for the establishment media. The Trump campaign made a very explicit choice to engage more with alternative media than any other campaign in history. Trump sat for hours-long interviews on some of the biggest podcasts and internet talk shows, bringing his message to millions of listeners in a conversational setting—the opposite of short, scripted sound bites. Meanwhile, the establishment was freaking out about newspapers not printing formal Harris endorsements. The establishment media is quickly losing relevance in our media environment, and this election result confirms that. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be worried about Trump’s second term. For one, there is clearly an effort by some neoconservatives and establishment Republicans to again co-opt Trump’s presidency. Trump, for his part, will probably be happy to bask in calling himself a winner while delegating the actual work to establishment figures who actually oppose many of the policies that make Trump popular with the American people. Trump is also explicitly bad on a number of issues—like his hawkishness toward China and Iran and his call for more government barriers to trade. And because these positions would grant more power and money to the political class, the prospect of them coming to fruition is far more likely than his better positions. There is also what has often been dubbed the 'only Nixon could go to China' effect, where nominally right-wing politicians have an easier time enacting left-wing policies, and vice-versa. For instance, Trump significantly escalated Obama’s policy and sent lethal aid to Ukraine back in his first term, in part to counter the establishment’s campaign to define him as a Russian puppet. Without vigilant, bottom-up pressure from the public, Trump could easily be worse on some issues than Harris would have been. Still, there is value in the American people again repudiating the political establishment by voting for a candidate they had clearly deemed unacceptable. If Trump can follow through on his promises to end the war in Ukraine, appoint a libertarian to his cabinet, and finally free Ross Ulbricht, and if he greenlights Elon Musk’s plan to start a government efficiency department with Ron Paul, then this election will prove to have been even more consequential. With all that said, however, it’s important to keep perspective and not get too carried away by all the focus on this one victory. The unfortunate fact is that some of the most significant issues facing the American people were not featured at all in this election cycle. The most frustrating example is all the damage caused by the Federal Reserve. As Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and countless other economists in the same tradition have explained, when supposedly independent central banks like the Fed print new money and transfer it to the big banks and other politically-connected groups, it transfers the public’s wealth to the political class through inflation and traps us in a never-ending cycle of recessions. Further, the federal government’s use of money printing allows them to hide and delay the cost of government programs. All the worst things Washington is currently doing to us and to people abroad are only politically possible because of the Fed. The price inflation our government forces on us is not only a blatant transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the politically-connected rich, it has incredibly damaging impacts on our culture. Thanks to Fed-induced permanent price inflation, people are encouraged to take on debt and be more shortsighted and reductionist in their economic decisions, firms become artificially big, the consumption of stuff takes priority over the cultivation and production of resources, the quality of our elites and leaders diminishes, and generosity recedes out of community life. As if that’s not enough, the political establishment has used its ability to conceal the cost of its programs in inflation and debt to build a massive military-industrial complex. The political class has spent the past eighty years finding and creating new enemies abroad to justify all the power centralized in and money spent on the war-making apparatus in Washington, DC. Eight decades of military engagements, proxy wars, and arming allies has been lucrative for federal bureaucrats, beltway 'national security' experts, and weapons companies. But it’s come at the expense, not only of the American public’s economic well-being, but our actual security. Today, the world is full of groups—ranging from remote bands of terrorists to nuclear-armed governments—that consider Americans their enemy thanks to foreign interventions conducted by our government that were completely unnecessary. Now, rather than admit their role in bringing about these dangerous conditions, the political class is using our perilous global moment to justify more foreign interventions. That same cycle where the government creates problems with interventions that are then used to justify more interventions is at work in countless other areas, such as the cost and quality of healthcare, the price of college, the affordability of housing, and more. And again, much of this is enabled and exacerbated by the Federal Reserve system. All of these are major issues that have serious impacts on the well-being of the American people. Yet they received little to no mention this election season. Inflation was mentioned a lot by both campaigns, but the rhetoric never touched on the true cause and only solution. Trump, to his credit, did have some good moments speaking out against 'forever wars' and promising to end the war in Ukraine. But his stance on Iran and China was often even more hawkish than the Washington establishment. The full context of the interventionist scheme creating and profiting off of the problems facing us at home and abroad was either not understood or intentionally ignored by both campaigns. The Washington establishment suffered an embarrassing defeat last night, and that’s reason to celebrate. But until the public comes to truly understand how they use central banking and interventionism to enrich themselves at our expense, the good that can come from elections remains frustratingly limited. It’s up to those of us who do to get to work. About the author: Connor O’Keeffe (@ConnorMOKeeffe) produces media and content at the Mises Institute.

COP16: A Disappointment, As Expected – OpEd	By Anusa Karki and Simone Galimberti The recently concluded COP 16 on Biodiversity held in Cali, Colombia, (21 October to 1 November) was largely a disappointment. Unsurprisingly, it was largely expected to end up in this way. Yet, despite the gloom, in Cali, an important new conversation was started, bringing biodiversity and climate negotiations closer and this should a process led by young people, especially from indigenous communities. On the downsides of the COP, first of all, no ground was made on the thorniest of the issues, the financing of the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework approved two years. The new funds pledged by a small number of developed nations, were, considering the challenges posed by the global biodiversity crisis, just symbolic and, in no way, close enough to match the gap in resources that we face for biodiversity’s preservation. There were some positive developments on the fronts of digital sequence information but, at the end, the mechanism that would propel multinational company to contribute out of their profits stemming from using genetic data from nature plants, will be only voluntary. Bridging the gap between climate and biodiversity The only ray of hope is the endorsement of a key agenda raised for years by indigenous people, the creation of a new body, within the framework of the Biodiversity Convention, that would fully represent them. It will take a lot more efforts in the coming years to define the contours and details of such body and turn it into something truly meaningful and empowering. But, before focusing on ways to make this new body strong and truly meaningful, perhaps the most important element of the COP is the fact that, the Colombian presidency was instrumental in bridging the gap between climate and biodiversity. At least, a long due discussion on converging the two, has been initiated, building on some promising developments that had happened at the COP 28 on Climate last year in Dubai. Young people, starting from youths from indigenous communities, have a special role in trying to forge ahead with this conversation on the linkages between biodiversity and climate. The long-term goal could be a radical re-design of how biodiversity and climate negotiations unfold. What we have now are two totally separated negotiating tables representing the worst of the so called 'silos approach' that, instead of unifying policy issues, it separates and divides climate discussions from the biodiversity ones. Focusing on new bottom up, democratic practices will be key factors in both securing a strong indigenous body and a new closer climate and biodiversity framework. A unified Planet Earth Convention? These are, as the President of the COP 16, Susana Muhamad, the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia, two sides of the same coin. Why not daring to think that one day, we will have a unified Planet Earth Convention, rather than two and, consequentially, have only one COP? Besides, we cannot forget two other important intergovernmental processes that are rarely talked about: on one hand, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)and, on the other hand, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). We believe that young people, especially youths from indigenous communities, should lead this radical rethinking through an extensive campaigning and policy making. But it is essential to invest at grassroots level in the capacity of youths. In this process, it is paramount that we must ensure that youths from indigenous communities are fully empowered so that their voices will be heard. For all this to happen, capacity building is essential. More and more young people must be fully knowledgeable of the multiple dimensions of the crisis affecting planet Earth. Effective capacity building through cutting edge technical knowledge, public speaking and advocacy, negotiations, leadership and strategic planning are essential but opportunities must be spread and accessible. The experience of creating Communities of Practitioners among youths, an experience that both authors have been involved with in Nepal, can also be a very powerful tool, where youths interested to know more, come together to develop their expertise. In addition, inclusive mentorship programs for women, youth and marginalized communities, starting from indigenous youths should be promoted. Such programs can foster a new understanding of the complex dynamics at play, in terms of policies, finance and networking. More funding availability is also crucial. Organizing programs mainly for youth, women and indigenous participants, providing orientation sessions and workshops, what it is really a long educational journey, will increase their understanding of complex issues. At the same time, sponsorship for attending the COPs is vital for these group as most of them couldn’t afford due to financial and logistical barriers. Without sufficient funding, such participation becomes a privilege that excludes more inclusive and diverse voices and knowledge that are decisive to better shape the global decision making. If young people, women, starting from those from indigenous communities, understand the COPs procedures and related international frameworks, they will be in a position to turn themselves in policy makers if allowed a chance that deliberative innovations can provide. We could also have what we call 'Planet Earth Youth Councils', where local youths, with interests on biodiversity and climate and in endangered species, can come together. We do not need a climate council or a biodiversity council but rather we need a united platform that should also collaborate with the local governments by basically aligning both climate and biodiversity with the agenda of localizing the SDGs. But how to start to allocate the resources to enhance youths ‘meaningful engagement? We need tons of creativity to promote and encourage grassroots based exercises in which young people, on the one hand, can really gain the needed cross cutting know-how and on the other hand, have local platforms to deliberate. Bottom up and participatory democracy On this regard, we believe that the ongoing wave of exercises of bottom up and participatory democracy that are being implemented throughout the world, could be useful to re-think the way power is shared not only throughout the complexity of the COP processes but also at local levels where action often lacks. There have been already many climate assemblies in which citizens talk about how to tackle the warming of the planet and its devastating effects. The problem is that, oftentimes, youths involved in climate and biodiversity campaigning and advocacy, are not aware of them. Reinventing the way democracy works seems eluding them: it is still not well understood that, only better forms of democracy, can help generate the needed consensus to ensure the viability of our planet and the one of our own species. But perhaps there is also another way. The upcoming negotiations for new body within the Biodiversity Convention, officially called the Subsidiary Body for Indigenous Populations based on article 8.J of the same Convention, could also inspire a youths led democracy awakening. In this case, to start with, what will count, is to truly have indigenous leaders, the real guardians of the most precious biodiversity still remaining on planet Earth, enabled in the decision making. Hardly the international community will seize the chance to innovate in terms of participatory governance, enabling indigenous people, especially women and young leaders, to lead. Yet, despite the odds, this new mechanism could, potentially, become a forum in which indigenous people, especially young indigenous leaders, have not only a voice but also a power, perhaps even a veto one. Such possible scenario should all premised on the principle, often forgotten, of free, prior and informed consent or FPIC, a pillar of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Indigenous people must lead regarding the future of our planet As non-indigenous persons, we believe that indigenous people must lead in any negotiations regarding the future of our planet. The latest developments from deliberative democracy, whatever its shapes and forms, could also support young indigenous leaders to propose bold ideas on how this body should work. We should keep in mind that the origins of many deliberative practices, now being exercised all over the world, are not at all alien to the cultures of indigenous people with their own unique forms of governance based on a culture of consensus. But such deliberative efforts could not only help with the future debate on reshaping the ways the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework is pursued. The potential of more democratic practices centered on biodiversity and climate, is much bigger. Let’s imagine an exercise that will end with indigenous people, especially women and youths, able to flex their influence within the Biodiversity Convention but also, a process that can also inspire changes in other different and yet complementary dimensions. First, it could engender similar discussions on rethinking the whole governance of both the biodiversity and climate negotiations, bringing them closer. Second, it could reinvigorate local bottom-up practices of decision making by injecting doses of fresh energies embedded by youths. On this, we need to be clear that local governance will be more and more centered on how we deal with climate change and biodiversity losses. Indigenous youths, by having a chance at making this new body truthfully powerful, can embolden a new generations of biodiversity leaders, in exercising power. The end outcome, we hope, would be a more coherent, unified 'Earth Commons Governance', internationally and locally that is co-led by youths.

Hurricanes And Boeing Strike Depress Job Growth, But Unemployment...	The October jobs report showed little gain in hiring, with establishments adding just 12,000 jobs. The number was depressed both by the effects of the hurricanes that hit the South last month and the loss of roughly 33,000 jobs due to the strike at Boeing. The economy has now added 15.3 million jobs since President Biden took office in January of 2021. We now have 5.9 million more jobs than at the pre-pandemic peak. (These numbers adjust for the BLS preliminary benchmark revision.) The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent as hiring apparently offset any hurricane-related layoffs. The hurricanes make it more difficult to gauge the underlying strength of the labor market, but the growth would clearly have been far more rapid without the unusual events hitting the economy in October. It is also worth noting that the response rate to the establishment survey was extraordinarily low at 47.4 percent. It is typically close to 60.0 percent, which suggests there could be large revisions when we get fuller data in the next two months. Hurricanes Likely Hit Job Growth Primarily in Construction and Restaurants The direct impact of the Boeing strike is easy to measure since we know the number of striking workers. (The indirect effect on supplier industries is more difficult.) The hurricanes would have both prevented hiring in some sectors and also led to some layoffs in businesses that were closed due to the storms. It seems clear construction employment was affected by the hurricanes, as the sector created just 8,000 jobs in October after averaging almost 20,000 jobs a month in the year to September. This weakness was driven largely by a drop of 6,600 jobs in residential specialty trade contractors Other industries likely affected by the hurricanes include restaurant jobs, where just 3,700 jobs were added compared to an average of more than 12,000 a month in the year to September. Also, amusement, gambling, and recreation which lost 7,400 jobs, and the loss of 6,400 jobs in the retail sector. Adding in these effects, it seems likely that we would have seen at least 100,000 jobs added in October without the impact of the strike and the hurricane. Healthcare Sector Again Led Employment Growth The healthcare sector added 52,300 jobs in October, slightly less than the average growth of 58,000 over the year to September. The other big job gainers were state governments, which added 18,000 jobs and local governments, which added 21,000 jobs. The government sector did not recover the jobs lost in the pandemic until September of 2023. The private sector had regained the lost jobs by April of 2022. Employment in the government sector is now 590,000, or 2.6 percent, above its pre-pandemic level. Manufacturing Lost 46,000 Jobs, Mostly Due to Boeing Strike The job loss in manufacturing was driven primarily by the 33,000 striking workers at Boeing. There was a drop in employment in the metal industries of 5,400, which was likely due at least in part to the strike. There was a decline in employment of 6,000 in the motor vehicle industry, although employment in the sector is still 31,500 higher than in October of 2023. Wage Growth Remains Solid One factor offsetting concerns about labor market weakness is that we continue to see strong wage growth. Wages have risen 4.0 percent over the previous 12 months. The pace actually accelerated slightly over the last three months, with the annualized rate of wage growth of 4.5 percent. With the rate of inflation falling towards 2.0 percent, this means that workers are seeing healthy real wage gains. Little Change in Average Hours Some of us expected a drop in the length of the average workweek as a result of businesses being closed by the storms. This seems not to have been the case. There was no change in the length of the average workweek or the index of aggregate weekly hours. There was a drop in the index of aggregate weekly hours for production workers, but this was driven entirely by a drop in manufacturing and construction; the index for the service sector was unchanged. It is also worth noting involuntary part-time employment actually fell somewhat in the month, hitting its lowest level since June. Prime Age Employment Rates Fell in October The employment to population ratios (EPOP) for prime age workers (ages 25 to 54), which had been near its all-time high, fell 0.3 percentage points to 80.6 percent. The drop was driven mostly by a 0.6 percentage point drop in the prime age EPOP for women to 74.9 percent. This is still above the pre-pandemic peak. The EPOP for men edged down 0.1 percentage point to 86.3 percent. Share of Unemployment Due to Voluntary Quits Falls The share of unemployment due to people leaving their job fell from 12.1 percent to 11.5 percent. The small number of people changing jobs is one of the anomalies in the current labor market. With an unemployment rate near 4.0 percent, we would expect this share to be above 14.0 percent. We know from the JOLTS data that layoffs are relatively low, so it doesn’t seem workers have much fear of losing jobs at present. It’s possible that with the huge round of job changes earlier in the recovery workers are more satisfied with their jobs than in the past. Also we have a relatively older workforce now, and workers are less likely to change jobs in their forties and fifties than in their twenties and thirties, but this is one of the anomalies in the current labor market. Black Unemployment Steady at 5.7 Percent The Black unemployment rate was unchanged in October. The 5.7 percent rate in October is 0.7 pp below the recent high of 6.4 percent rate in March, but still 0.9 percent above the all-time low hit in April of 2023. It is slightly above the pre-pandemic lows. The unemployment rate for Hispanics was unchanged at 5.1 percent. This is 1.1 pp above the all-time low of 4.0 percent in November of 2022. Mostly Bright Picture, but Hurricanes Make it Hard to Read This is the last major data release before the election. The economy’s performance under the Biden-Harris administration has been remarkable by most standard measures. The pandemic inflation that drove prices higher across the globe has been brought down and is now nearly back to the Fed’s 2.0 percent inflation target. With wage growth near 4.0 percent, wages are now outpacing prices by a substantial amount. Clearly much of the weakness in the establishment survey is attributable to the hurricanes. It’s also not clear how many jobs we should be creating at this point. Before the pandemic, the Congressional Budget Office projected we would create just 20,000 jobs a month in 2024, as baby boomers retired in large numbers. The surge in immigration changed that picture, but with immigration now slowed, we will surely see much slower job growth ahead than earlier in the recovery.

Securing The Skies: Why Bangladesh Needs A Multilayered Air Defen...	As the battlefield of the future keeps on evolving, an entirely new dimension of threats is unfolding across a proliferation of drones, missiles, and precision-guided munitions. The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) has become more accessible and much more capable, with adversaries in most regions now able to conduct intelligence gathering and precision strikes with minimal risk. Short-range projectiles to Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles continue to pose formidable challenges around the globe due to both their speed and destructive power. Precision Guided Munition (PGMs), designed to precisely engage a specific target with minimal collateral damage, adds complexity to any defense scheme. These developments make it critical that a multi-tiered air defense system be able to detect, track, and defeat a wide range of threats across multiple altitudes and distances. Bangladesh's air defense capability comprises short-range surface-to-air missile systems like the TRG-300 MLRS, a Turkish-made medium-range missile system, and the FM-90, presumably offering limited coverage against low-altitude, short-range threats. The Bangladesh Air Force (BAF's) fighter aircraft comprise the MiG-29 and F-7 series, which are meant for air superiority and ground attack. Yet, the absence of medium to long-range air defense systems creates vulnerability against high-altitude and long-range threats. Therefore, the offensive capacity of modern low-observable unmanned aerial vehicles and advanced missile technologies defeats or is beyond the capability of the existing systems to effectively counter. The strategic location of Bangladesh, working within the regional dynamics, urgently calls for a robust, multilayered air defense system. Geographically, it shares boundaries with states having developing air capabilities, namely Myanmar and India. Myanmar's purchase of advanced fighter jets such as the JF-17 Block II and Su-30SME and India’s acquisition of Rafale have given serious reasons for regional security concerns and allowed Bangladesh to improve its air defense in maintaining sovereignty and deterring warriors. On top of all the evolving nature of the aerial threat, ranging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to ballistic missiles, requires an integrated defense strategy. A multilayered system, so to say, integrates short, medium, and long-range defenses, hence promising a solid shield against various threats, with enhancement in national security and regional stability. The basic constituting elements for a comprehensive multilayer air defense system, operationally and technologically required to effectively counter such diverse aerial threats:SHORAD-Short-Range Air Defense: SHORAD systems operate to neutralize low-altitude threats like drones, low-flying aircraft, and helicopters. These guarantee a fast response through the use of mobile missile launchers and anti-aircraft artillery. The systems should be highly flexible and quick to offer protection to ground forces, as well as all other critical assets. Systems such as the Iron Dome have been effective in neutralizing short-range threats and have so far intercepted over 5,000 rockets at an accuracy of more than 90%. Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missiles (MRSAM): Such systems attack targets at medium altitudes and distances, notably cruise missiles and rotary-wing aircraft. MRSAM fills in operational envelopes on the interface between short-distance and long-distance defenses, therefore providing a multi-layer protective shield. Considerably, there is the David's Sling system, developed to intercept medium-range missiles and aircraft to date, to enhance defense against regional menaces. Long-Range Air Defense: Considering the above-said, the role of long-range systems is extremely important: they are crucial for area coverage and might be highly effective in intercepting high-altitude air threats, like ballistic missiles or strategic bombers. Examples include the Arrow system, which was created for chief interception purposes of long-range missiles, including ballistic ones, that work both within and outside the atmosphere. The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and ballistic missiles has, to a great degree, altered dynamics both in the field and in modern warfare, as was seen during the Russo-Ukraine conflict. Adversaries can easily access commercially available, low-cost drones capable of conducting surveillance, delivering munitions, and disrupting critical infrastructure. Russia, for instance, has taken to deploying Shahed UAVs targeting Ukrainian energy sites strategic predecessors for what technologies can execute. Also, ballistic missiles pose a heavy threat because they operate with a great deal of speed and potential for massive destructive power. With the increasing proliferation of such technologies, the chance of non-state actors and smaller states posing a threat to conventional defense systems is constantly growing, which is a demand for sophisticated and multilayered air defense systems capable of effectively detecting, intercepting, and neutralizing various aerial threats. Modernization is highly insisted upon in Bangladesh's air defense when the evolving nature of threats across the region is considered. The access to advanced technologies can allow an increase in the distance between detection and intercepting capabilities, hence viewed as an important strategic leverage against potential adversaries. It provides investments in radar-guided anti-air systems with enhanced detection and interception capabilities. AI-powered surveillance network architecture will improve response times and operational efficiency by facilitating real-time data analytics and threat assessment. Modernization spells not only enhanced defense preparedness but also brings Bangladesh at par with other military forces of the globe and protects its airspace and sovereignty. Even the Bangladesh Army is modernizing with a host of new technologies, robotics, and AI, evidence that modernization provides an edge in regional security dynamics. A multilayered air defense system drastically enhances national security for Bangladesh. Maneuvering a short, medium, and long-range defense against the variants of aerial threats provides multiple options, thereby further strengthening deterrence capability in the nation. The repercussions will be very well coordinated among the military branches concerning joint operations and efficiency. In essence, a critical protection system would be designed to ensure the survivability of the critical infrastructure against possible attacks to ensure economic stability and national resilience. It is thus multilayer defense that aligned Bangladesh with the rest of the world's military standards while reinforcing commitments toward sovereignty and regional stability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy98EkQdQV3vM	2024-11-06T16:15:01-08:00	
2047 And Beyond: Can India’s Democracy Withstand Hindutva? – OpEd	India’s path toward 2047, the centenary of its independence, reveals a troubling paradox. Once celebrated for its pluralism and diversity, India is now grappling with an ideological shift that threatens to unravel its inclusive foundation. Since 2014, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the rise of Hindutva ideology, an ideology that blends Hindu identity with Indian nationalism, has reshaped India’s domestic and international reputation, challenging the very principles on which the country was founded. If this trend continues, India could face a perilous future marked by fragmentation, deepening social divides, and international condemnation. The evolution of Hindutva from a fringe ideology to a political force is at the heart of India’s transformation. Under Modi’s leadership, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promoted a vision of India as a Hindu nation, alienating minority communities and redefining national identity. This shift is meticulously documented in The Atlantic (2022), which observes how Hindu nationalism, now a political mainstream, has embedded itself into India’s state machinery, influencing policies that many argue discriminate against religious minorities, particularly Muslims. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) are two such policies. The CAA, for example, fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from neighboring countries, signaling a shift toward an exclusionary identity framework (Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 2023). Global human rights organizations have responded with growing alarm. In its 2023 report, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) labeled India as a 'Country of Particular Concern,' citing escalating religious discrimination and state-sponsored persecution against minorities. Genocide Watch has issued similar warnings, raising the alarm over what it sees as a gradual but consistent progression toward large-scale violence against Muslims (Genocide Watch, 2024). These warnings stem from documented incidents of hate speech, physical violence, and intimidation against minority communities, which have become disturbingly common under the BJP’s rule. According to the USCIRF report, Hindu nationalist groups have grown emboldened, often acting with impunity, as government policies increasingly reflect Hindu nationalist rhetoric. The implications of this ideological shift extend beyond religious discrimination. India’s position on international indices underscores the domestic cost of eroding democratic freedoms. India now ranks 104th out of 179 countries on the Liberal Democracy Index, reflecting a decline in political rights, judicial independence, and freedom of speech. These trends are mirrored in the 2024 Fragile States Index, where India has fallen to 75th place, categorizing it as a state in the 'Warning' zone. The Digital India laws, introduced under the pretext of regulating digital content, have exacerbated the situation by suppressing dissenting voices. By early 2024, over 130 violations of free speech were recorded, highlighting the government’s efforts to control the narrative. The World Economic Forum even identified misinformation—propelled by the BJP’s IT cell—as one of India’s top risks, indicating that state-sponsored propaganda has permeated social media, distorting public perception and stifling critical voices (LA Times, April 18, 2024). This state-controlled narrative aligns with theories of hegemonic power consolidation, which explain how nationalist regimes often attempt to construct a homogeneous identity by marginalizing dissent and diversity. This phenomenon, examined in Georgetown’s Politics of Identity and State-Building (2023), aligns with India’s current trajectory. Hindutva, as an ideology, envisions a Hindu-majoritarian state that consolidates power through cultural homogenization and exclusionary nationalism. By championing this narrative, the BJP positions itself as the 'protector' of Hindu identity, fostering a climate where minority groups are increasingly sidelined. This shift not only risks alienating substantial portions of India’s population but also undermines the foundations of a pluralistic society, potentially leading to long-term social instability. The international community has not remained silent. Scholars, activists, and human rights organizations are actively calling for interventions to prevent what they view as a looming crisis. A February 2022 summit, India on the Brink: Preventing Genocide, organized by a coalition of global civil rights organizations, underscored the need for international attention to India’s human rights situation. Participants, including former UN officials and global human rights advocates, called for urgent measures to prevent further human rights abuses and warned of the risk of violence if the current trends persist (London Story, 2024). Dr. Gregory Stanton, president of Genocide Watch, has publicly stated that the international community has a 'moral obligation' to act preemptively, citing India as an example where early indicators of widespread violence are visible but remain largely unaddressed. The BJP’s response to such criticisms has been to double down on its narrative. By casting dissent as 'anti-national' and framing critics as enemies of the state, the government has managed to stifle significant opposition. This tactic of labeling dissenting voices as 'anti-Indian' not only deflects legitimate criticism but also undermines democratic principles, as individuals and institutions hesitate to speak out. Furthermore, the digital space—a crucial platform for discourse—has become a battleground where voices of opposition are censored or attacked. The rise of BJP-affiliated social media cells has exacerbated the spread of propaganda, leaving independent media in a precarious position and restricting public access to unbiased information. India’s current trajectory is unsustainable if it hopes to maintain its democratic fabric and its foundational principle of secularism. The consolidation of power under a singular nationalist ideology risks unraveling the diverse social fabric that has been the bedrock of Indian society. While proponents of Hindutva argue that this identity-centric approach strengthens India, the reality suggests that it alienates significant populations, deepens social divisions, and could lead to instability. If India does not address these concerns, it risks reaching its centenary in 2047 as a fragmented and polarized nation rather than as a unified, democratic powerhouse.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiywZp0AWpV8ee	2024-11-06T16:06:55-08:00	
Harnessing Power Of Moroccan Diaspora: King Mohammed VI’s Vision ...	In his recent speech marking the 49th anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI set forth an ambitious plan to revitalize Morocco's relationship with its global diaspora, addressing the evolving role and potential of millions of Moroccans living abroad. This is not merely a policy shift; it is a call to action for an era where the Moroccan diaspora is positioned as a central partner in shaping the nation's future. By restructuring the institutions that engage with overseas Moroccans, the King is weaving a tighter, more inclusive fabric of national unity that transcends borders and generations. The significance of this initiative goes far beyond administrative reform. It reflects a deep-seated recognition that Moroccans abroad are not just citizens dispersed across the world, but are ambassadors, innovators, investors, and cultural torchbearers. Their bond with the homeland is resilient, marked by a patriotism that has often been forged in the fires of defending Morocco's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the world stage. Yet, the King's message this year was clear: patriotism alone is no longer enough. The Moroccan diaspora must be equipped with tools, resources, and streamlined processes to become active, dynamic contributors to Morocco's progress. Central to this new vision is the restructuring of diaspora institutions into two primary entities, each with a clearly defined purpose. The first, the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad, is designed to serve as a reflection of the diaspora's diversity, a forum for constructive dialogue, and a source of policy guidance. By pushing for rapid legislation to formalize the Council's renewed mission, the King underscores the urgency of amplifying the voices of Moroccans abroad in shaping policies that affect them. The second entity, the newly announced Fondation Mohammedia des Marocains résidant à l'étranger, will serve as the operational engine behind Morocco's engagement with its diaspora. As an institution, it will consolidate previously fragmented efforts, coordinate a cohesive National Strategy for Moroccans Abroad, and manage a mechanism for mobilizing Moroccan talent worldwide. This move is not merely symbolic; it directly responds to long-standing calls from the diaspora for better access to participate in Morocco's development. It is a channel through which talented and successful Moroccans worldwide can bring their expertise, entrepreneurial spirit, and capital back to their homeland. But the King's vision extends beyond economic contributions. His call for the Foundation to bolster cultural, linguistic, and religious education for Moroccans abroad is a powerful reminder that the preservation of Moroccan identity is as much a part of nation-building as economic development. This approach signals a profound understanding that language, culture, and faith are not just private matters—they are pillars of national unity that must be actively nurtured, especially in a globalized world where these ties can easily fray over generations. The King also pointed to one of the most pressing challenges facing the diaspora: the inefficiencies and complexities of administrative and judicial processes. Through the digitalization and simplification of these procedures, Morocco can remove a significant barrier to diaspora engagement, fostering a more seamless connection between Moroccans abroad and their homeland. If implemented effectively, this could be a game-changer, positioning Morocco as a global leader in government services for its expatriates. At the core of this vision is an imperative to bring Moroccan expatriates into the fold as drivers of economic innovation. Currently, their investments account for only 10% of Morocco's private domestic investments—a figure that is strikingly low given the diaspora's vast economic power. King Mohammed VI's call for a dramatic increase in diaspora-led investments reflects a new era of inclusion, where Moroccans abroad are seen not merely as contributors, but as co-architects of Morocco's economic future. Perhaps most significant, though, is the underlying theme of mobilization. In these times, as Morocco asserts its territorial integrity and strengthens its international standing, the support of Moroccans abroad is indispensable. The King's speech reflects the reality that Morocco's fight for sovereignty is not just a domestic issue; it is a global campaign that requires the strength and solidarity of Moroccans everywhere. King Mohammed VI's address is a blueprint for a Morocco that is more resilient, more inclusive, and more ambitious. By building bridges with its diaspora, Morocco is not only securing resources and skills for national growth but is also championing a model of unity that is adaptable, forward-looking, and deeply rooted in shared values. This is the legacy of the Green March: a call for unity that, fifty years later, is being answered by Moroccans around the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy8Liuvyghb3b	2024-11-06T16:04:16-08:00	
European Union’s Anti-Chinese Electric Vehicles Policy: A Costly ...	The European Union (EU) advocates for a free-market economy and expects countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with their governments, to provide full support and platforms for European capital, industries, products, and services without imposing any form of trade restrictions. The EU asserts that the free mobility of European capital is central to its trade praxis. However, these same principles are not applied when capital, industries, and services flow from countries like China, India, or other nations in the Global South. The colonial white supremacists and EU’s policymakers consider countries in the Global South as dumping grounds for European products and services. The concept of free trade for Europe and restricted trade for the Global South is an extension of neocolonial trade practices and reflects a colonial mindset in action. The undemocratic and unaccountable European Commission has decided to impose a 35.3% countervailing duty (CVD) on electric vehicles (EVs) from China, in addition to the EU's 10% tariff. This means the EU has effectively imposed a 45.3% trade tariff on Chinese EVs, under the guise of protecting the European car industry, but at the expense of European consumers. These CVDs on Chinese EVs go against the interests of European consumers, who could have benefited from more affordable, technologically advanced Chinese EVs. However, the EU is indifferent to the interests of European consumers. Instead, it prioritises the interests of European capitalists and their car industries, with policies designed to serve car makers rather than car buyers. The EU provides subsidies to landlords, industrialists, and large corporations while undermining small farmers and small-scale enterprises. However, when China offers subsidies, it is labelled as unfair trade practice. The focus of Chinese subsidies is on consumer welfare, whereas EU subsidies are aimed at consolidating capitalist power for risk-free profit maximisation. Chinese subsidies prioritise consumer security, while EU subsidies are designed to protect capitalists, large industrialists, and their conglomerates. China’s subsidies support the growth of technologically advanced electric vehicles (EVs) to protect the environment and reduce pollution, while also making EVs affordable for its citizens. In contrast, the EU's anti-subsidy investigations and anti-dumping allegations against Chinese EVs are intended to protect corporate subsidies for European car manufacturers at the expense of European consumers. The tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs will raise prices in Europe, and EU subsidies will not reduce the production cost or selling price of EVs. These anti-dumping allegations aim to weaken the market for Chinese EVs in Europe, consolidating European capitalists' profits at the expense of consumers. Exploitation is at the heart of European colonialism, and it continues to affect European citizens today. Chinese EV brands like SAIC, BYD, Geely, NIO, and Dongfeng are leading producers of technologically advanced and durable electric vehicles. These companies not only offer high-quality EVs at affordable prices, making them accessible to consumers with low incomes, but they also ensure excellent customer service. So, why don't European EV producers create technologically advanced vehicles and offer competitive prices to consumers in Europe? The best path forward is to embrace free and open market competition, which would encourage better products and services at affordable prices. Instead of focusing on policies that benefit consumer welfare and experience, the EU is negotiating with China and the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) to set a market floor price cap, in line with the pricing mechanisms favoured by European EV producers. This policy is harmful to the interests of European consumers. Given the size of China’s automobile industry and scope of its domestic and international EV market, China and its companies can withstand the EU’s anti-Chinese market strategy. However, German and French car industries will face significant challenges, as they are highly exposed to the Chinese market both in terms of sales and production. If Chinese companies, backed by the Chinese state and government, were to stop investing in Europe, countries like Turkey and Hungary would immediately suffer. Chinese companies, such as BYD, are establishing new factories in these countries, bringing investment and generating employment. European car and EV producers, like Germany’s Volkswagen and Sweden’s Northvolt, are already facing difficulties due to the EU’s anti-Chinese policies. China’s economic and industrial overcapacity is a result of its hardworking and technologically advanced skilled workforce. It not only provides a competitive advantage but also offers a model that European states and governments could emulate for the benefit of their people. However, asking Europe to 'implement what it preaches' is a difficult task for a continent of colonial-era shopkeepers whose primary motive has always been profit at the expense of the people. This mindset remains unchanged among European capitalists and corporate elites today. Import tariffs contradict the values of a free and open market that the EU claims to uphold, yet they are imposed on Chinese EVs to protect European capitalists and their car factories at the expense of European consumers. This anti-Chinese stance exposes the EU's true priorities to the European public. The opposition of Germany and Hungary to the EU’s anti-China policies reveals the fault lines within the EU. European manufacturers are suffering due to these policies, as many EVs for Europe are built in China. Meanwhile, experts from the Atlantic Council fuel the controversy by arguing that Chinese EVs pose a security risk in terms of potential hacking and sensitive data collection. Such claims are not only unfounded but also a political strategy to discredit and undermine China and its achievements. In this context, how should China respond to the EU’s countervailing duties (CVDs)? It would be better for China not to react and retaliate by imposing similar tariffs on European products and services. Such a strategy would strengthen China’s position among the people of Europe, while undermining the anti-Chinese propaganda promoted by the European ruling elites. Instead, China should focus on creating alternative mechanisms for investment in cooperative industrial models, both within Europe and globally. These initiatives can generate employment opportunities and ensure good returns on Chinese investments. While capitalist market competition is not a strategy China should adopt, it must continue to follow its own path in service to the Chinese people and people around the world. This approach will not only help expand China’s model of development and industrialisation but also contribute to global prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy-KXxmZTctP_	2024-11-06T15:58:07-08:00	
Breakthrough In Energy-Efficient Avalanche-Based Amorphization Co...	The atoms of amorphous solids like glass have no ordered structure; they arrange themselves randomly, like scattered grains of sand on a beach. Normally, making materials amorphous — a process known as amorphization — requires considerable amounts of energy. The most common technique is the melt-quench process, which involves heating a material until it liquifies, then rapidly cooling it so the atoms don’t have time to order themselves in a crystal lattice. Now, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science (Penn Engineering), the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new method for amorphizing at least one material — wires made of indium selenide, or In2Se3 — that requires as little as one billion times less power density, a result described in a new paper in Nature. This advancement could unlock wider applications for phase-change memory (PCM) — a promising memory technology that could transform data storage in devices from cell phones to computers. In PCM, information is stored by switching the material between amorphous and crystalline states, functioning like an on/off switch. However, large-scale commercialization has been limited by the high power needed to create these transformations. 'One of the reasons why phase-change memory devices haven’t reached widespread use is due to the energy required,' says Ritesh Agarwal, Srinivasa Ramanujan Distinguished Scholar and Professor in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at Penn Engineering and one of the paper’s senior authors. For more than a decade, Agarwal’s group has studied alternatives to the melt-quench process, following their 2012 discovery that electrical pulses can amorphize alloys of germanium, antimony and tellurium without needing to melt the material. Several years ago, as part of those efforts, one of the new paper’s first authors, Gaurav Modi, then a doctoral student in MSE at Penn Engineering, began experimenting with indium selenide, a semiconductor with several unusual properties: it is ferroelectric, meaning it can spontaneously polarize, and piezoelectric, meaning that mechanical stress causes it to generate an electric charge and, conversely, that an electric charge deforms the material. Modi discovered the new method essentially by accident. He was running a current through In2Se3 wires when they suddenly stopped conducting electricity. Upon closer examination, long stretches of the wires had amorphized. 'This was extremely unusual,' says Modi. 'I actually thought I might have damaged the wires. Normally, you would need electrical pulses to induce any kind of amorphization, and here a continuous current had disrupted the crystalline structure, which shouldn’t have happened.' Untangling that mystery took the better part of three years. Agarwal shipped samples of the wires to one of his former graduate students, Pavan Nukala, now an Assistant Professor at IISc and member of the school’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and one of the paper’s other senior authors. 'Over the past few years we have developed a suite of in situmicroscopy tools here at IISc. It was time to put them to test — we had to look very, very carefully to understand this process,' says Nukala. 'We learned that multiple properties of In2Se3 — the 2D aspect, the ferroelectricity and the piezoelectricity — all come together to design this ultralow energy pathway for amorphization through shocks.' Ultimately, the researchers found that the process resembles both an avalanche and an earthquake. At first, tiny sections — measured in billionths of a meter — within the In2Se3wires begin to amorphize as electric current deforms them. Due to the wires’ piezoelectric properties and layered structure, the current nudges portions of these layers into unstable positions, like the subtle shifting of snow at the top of a mountain. When a critical point is reached, this movement triggers a rapid spread of deformation throughout the wire. The distorted regions collide, producing a sound wave that moves through the material, similar to how seismic waves travel through the earth’s crust during an earthquake. This sound wave, technically known as an 'acoustic jerk,' drives additional deformation, linking numerous small amorphous areas into a single one measured in micrometers — thousands of times larger than the original areas — just like an avalanche gathering momentum down a mountainside. 'It’s just goosebump stuff to see all these phenomena interacting across different length scales at once,' says Shubham Parate, an IISc doctoral student and co-first author of the paper. The collaborative effort to understand the process has created fertile ground for future discoveries. 'This opens up a new field on the structural transformations that can happen in a material when all these properties come together. The potential of these findings for designing low-power memory devices are tremendous,' says Agarwal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy2X59dic3WUj	2024-11-06T15:54:41-08:00	
Mighty Radio Bursts Linked To Massive Galaxies	Since their discovery in 2007, fast radio bursts—extremely energetic pulses of radio-frequency light—have lit up the sky repeatedly, leading astronomers on a chase to uncover their origins. Currently, confirmed fast radio bursts, or FRBs, number in the hundreds, and scientists have assembled mounting evidence for what triggers them: highly magnetized neutron stars known as magnetars (neutron stars are a type of dead star). One key piece of evidence came when a magnetar erupted in our own galaxy and several observatories, including Caltech's STARE2 (Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2) project, caught the action in real time. Now, reporting in the journal Nature, Caltech-led researchers have uncovered where FRBs are more likely to occur in the universe—massive star-forming galaxies rather than low-mass ones. This finding has, in turn, led to new ideas about how magnetars themselves form. Specifically, the work suggests that these exotic dead stars, whose magnetic fields are 100 trillion times stronger than Earth's, often form when two stars merge and later blow up in a supernova. Previously, it was unclear whether magnetars form in this way, from the explosion of two merged stars, or whether they might form when a single star explodes. 'The immense power output of magnetars makes them some of the most fascinating and extreme objects in the universe,' says Kritti Sharma, lead author of the new study and a graduate student working with Vikram Ravi, an assistant professor of astronomy at Caltech. 'Very little is known about what causes the formation of magnetars upon the death of massive stars. Our work helps to answer this question.' The project began with a search for FRBs using the Deep Synoptic Array-110 (DSA-110), a Caltech project funded by the National Science Foundation and based at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory near Bishop, California. To date, the sprawling radio array has detected and localized 70 FRBs to their specific galaxy of origin (only 23 other FRBs have been localized by other telescopes). In the current study, the researchers analyzed 30 of these localized FRBs. 'DSA-110 has more than doubled the number of FRBs with known host galaxies,' says Ravi. 'This is what we built the array to do.' Although FRBs are known to occur in galaxies that are actively forming stars, the team, to its surprise, found that the FRBs tend to occur more often in massive star-forming galaxies than low-mass star-forming galaxies. This alone was interesting because the astronomers had previously thought that FRBs were going off in all types of active galaxies. With this new information, the team started to ponder what the results revealed about FRBs. Massive galaxies tend to be metal-rich because the metals in our universe—elements that are manufactured by stars—take time to build up over the course of cosmic history. The fact that FRBs are more common in these metal-rich galaxies implies that the source of FRBs, magnetars, are also more common to these types of galaxies. Stars that are rich in metals—which in astronomical terms means elements heavier than hydrogen and helium—tend to grow larger than other stars. 'Over time, as galaxies grow, successive generations of stars enrich galaxies with metals as they evolve and die,' Ravi says. What is more, massive stars that explode in supernovae and can become magnetars are more commonly found in pairs. In fact, 84 percent of massive stars are binaries. So, when one massive star in a binary is puffed up due to extra metal content, its excess material gets yanked over to its partner star, which facilitates the ultimate merger of the two stars. These merged stars would have a greater combined magnetic field than that of a single star. 'A star with more metal content puffs up, drives mass transfer, culminating in a merger, thus forming an even more massive star with a total magnetic field greater than what the individual star would have had,' Sharma explains. In summary, since FRBs are preferentially observed in massive and metal-rich star-forming galaxies, then magnetars (which are thought to trigger FRBs) are probably also forming in metal-rich environments conducive to the merging of two stars. The results therefore hint that magnetars across the universe originate from the remnants of stellar mergers. In the future, the team hopes to hunt down more FRBs and their places of origin using DSA-110, and eventually the DSA-2000, an even bigger radio array planned to be built in the Nevada desert and completed in 2028. 'This result is a milestone for the whole DSA team. A lot of the authors on this paper helped build the DSA-110,' Ravi says. 'And the fact that the DSA-110 is so good at localizing FRBs bodes well for the success of DSA-2000.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy1EdSd4og-sX	2024-11-06T15:44:07-08:00	
Sewage Surveillance Proves Powerful In Combating Antimicrobial Re...	Waterborne diseases affect over 7 million people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and cost our health care system over $3 billion. But they don’t impact all people equally. A campuswide collaboration is using sewage surveillance as a vital strategy in the fight against diseases that spread through the water such as legionella and shigella. The ones that are most difficult to combat are diseases with antimicrobial resistance, which means they are able to survive against antibiotics that are intended to kill them. A recent paper in Nature Water offers an encouraging insight: Monitoring sewage for antimicrobial resistance indicators is proving to be more efficient and more comprehensive than testing individuals. This approach not only detects antimicrobial resistance more effectively but also reveals its connection to socioeconomic factors, which are often key drivers of the spread of resistance. The paper’s corresponding author is Peter Vikesland, the Pryor Professor of Engineering in the civil and environmental engineering department. The team is collaborating across Virginia Tech with experts such as Leigh-Anne Krometis in biological systems engineering and Alasdair Cohen and Julia Gohlke in population health sciences to focus on serving rural communities where the issues are most acute. The significance Globally, low-to middle-income communities bear the brunt of infectious diseases and the challenges of antimicrobial resistance. Sewage surveillance could be a game changer in addressing these disparities. This method not only captures a snapshot of antimicrobial resistance at the community level, but also reveals how socioeconomic factors drive the issue. The study The National Science Foundation Research Traineeship focuses on advancing sewage surveillance to combat antimicrobial resistance. The work is integral to broader efforts led by Vikesland and the Fralin Life Sciences Institute program for technology enabled environmental surveillance and control to sense and monitor waterborne health threats. The study analyzed data from 275 human fecal samples across 23 countries and 234 urban sewage samples from 62 countries to investigate antibiotic resistance gene levels. Socio-economic data, including health and governance indicators from World Bank databases, were incorporated to explore links between antibiotic resistance genes and socio-economic factors. The group utilized machine learning to assess antibiotic resistance gene abundance in relation to socio-economic factors, revealing significant correlations. Statistical methods supported the finding that within country antibiotic resistance gene variation was lower than between countries. Big picture, the team's findings show sewage surveillance is emerging as a powerful tool in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. It even has the potential to protect vulnerable communities more effectively.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy942CRBqVTZL	2024-11-06T15:40:45-08:00	
Coyotes Thriving Despite Human And Predator Pressures	Research led by the University of New Hampshire sheds light on how coyotes, North America’s most successful predators, are responding to various environmental pressures, including human development, hunting and competition with larger carnivores. Surprisingly, the study’s findings suggest that human hunting practices may actually contribute to increasing the number of coyotes. 'Intensive coyote removal can obviously reduce populations in the short-term, but removal can also result in younger coyote populations with higher reproduction and immigration rates,' said Remington Moll, assistant professor of natural resources and the environment and lead author. 'In our study, we detected more coyotes in places where hunting was allowed. This trend occurred over several years, suggesting that, on average, hunting did not reduce coyote abundance and perhaps increased it locally in certain areas.' Published in the journal Ecography, the study, one of the largest-scale studies of coyote populations to date, explored the complex dynamics shaping coyote populations across wide range of diverse habitats—from rural to suburban. It used data from over 4,500 cameras set up across the country by the Snapshot USA project, a national project that collects wildlife data from coordinated camera arrays across the contiguous United States. The data was combined with satellite-derived habitat metrics and analyzed using various advanced modeling techniques which allowed the team to evaluate the effects of habitat type, competition with larger carnivores, hunting practices and suburban expansion on coyote populations—providing the researchers with a clearer understanding of how coyotes respond to varying environmental pressures. 'Our work suggests that promoting the recovery of large carnivores, especially in certain habitats, is more likely to reduce coyote numbers than people directly hunting them,' said Roland Kays, a research professor with North Carolina State University’s College of Natural Resources and study co-author. 'With this data, we can now map them out across the country to provide the first abundance map of our country’s most important predator—an effort that could help in both conservation and coyote management.' Coyotes are the most successful carnivores on the continent. Having spread throughout the eastern United States, coyotes come into regular contact with humans. However, until now, the factors influencing the number of coyotes across suburban, rural and wild landscapes have remained largely unclear. Other key findings include that the presence of larger carnivores, such as black bears and pumas, influenced coyote numbers in a habitat-dependent manner. For example, black bears had a stronger limiting effect on coyotes in forested areas, whereas pumas exerted a similar influence in more open environment. Coyote abundance was highest in grasslands and agricultural landscapes—regions that provide ample prey and shelter. And, the impact of urbanization on coyote populations varied by scale: at smaller, local scales, urban development tended to reduce coyote numbers due to increased human presence and habitat fragmentation. However, at larger, suburban scales, coyote populations thrived, benefiting from the fragmented habitats and edges that offer access to both natural and human-modified resources. The study also highlighted significant regional variation in coyote populations across the United States, with particularly high numbers in the southwestern U.S. and lower populations in the northeast, reflecting the diverse ecological and geographical factors at play.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy_aHCNgGrPX3	2024-11-06T15:38:56-08:00	
North Korea Joins Russia In Ukraine War – Analysis	Russia’s recent mutual defence treaty with North Korea and subsequent ratification by Russia’s State Duma, the lower House of the country’s parliament, has injected a new dimension to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. This Russia-North Korea bonhomie has drawn Ukraine as a proxy battlefield for Korean Peninsula tensions. Those stakeholders working for peace are alarmed by this development as the fault-lines are showing bigger cracks. The larger implications are on issues of disruptive security, governance, and technological risks that threaten peace, growth, and opportunity in the Indo-Pacific region, with added focus on Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. The 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty signed in June in Pyongyang during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit includes a clause committing the two states to providing military support 'without delay' if either is attacked. The ratification of the security treaty by the Russian Parliament has led the Ukraine crisis into a hazardous new phase. Recent intelligence reports from the US revealed that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid fight against Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. As reported in the New York Times, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said North Korea had sent at least 3,000 soldiers into training sites in eastern Russia between early- to mid-October 2024. These soldiers believed to have travelled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. The soldiers then travelled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in Eastern Russia, where they are currently believed to be undergoing training. Though there is no information as of now if these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. The participation of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s war in Ukraine, though a dramatic move, also could mean a sign of Russia’s weakness, not strength, as Russia that boasts of a mighty military power had to depend on a tiny new allay for its war in Ukraine. Viewed differently, this unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is indeed a matter of worry as the security implications in Europe and the Indo-Pacific could be huge. Being concerned about this new twist as the Korean Peninsula and Inter-Korean issue has escalated further following the Russia-North Korea bonhomie, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador and urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean soldiers from Russia. Interestingly, the Kremlin has denied the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia despite satellite pictures testify to the contrary. Since the security environment centring on inter-Korean relations in the Korean Peninsula is already fragile and volatile, the deployment of third-party ground forces risks transforming the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into even more of a global security crisis. The military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is scaled up dramatically after Vladimir Putin visited North Korea and signed a comprehensive defense treaty in June 2024. After North Korea started supplying ammunition to Russia, bilateral ties between the two developed into a more sustained partnership. South Korea’s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that dozens of North Korean officers and one prominent missile development expert, Kim Jong-sik, travelled to Russian frontline positions providing direct guidance on using Pyongyang’s weaponry to Moscow’s forces. The presence of these officers marks North Korea’s significant shift from arms supplier to active participant. This collaboration offers mutual benefits. Due to the prolonged war, Russia badly needed munitions and potential manpower from North Korea. In the three-year conflict, Russia has the casualty of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers and therefore it is expected that Russia would induct around 10,000 troops from North Korea by December 2024. Putin is aware that North Korea has a massive conventional military, with 1.3 million active soldiers and an additional 7.6 million on reserve, almost a third of its population. North Korean soldiers are experienced and serving a mandatory eight to ten years but their actual capabilities is less known since the country remains isolated. It is also believed despite bold claims, North Korea possess outdated weapons systems. This is because an estimated half of the KN-23 missiles used by Russia believed to have exploded midair. This offers crucial insights to how sophisticated are North Korea’s military technological capabilities. Pyongyang’s adversaries such as the US and South Korea are obviously aware of this. There are other adverse consequences that Kim Jong-un need to factor in. The distressed member of troops deployed to the frontlines would be more miserable now, though they continue to stay under domestic control and have no option than to suffer. Also, if some North Korean troops decide to use this opportunity to defect or claim exceptional considerations if captured as prisons of war, human rights issue can make international highlights. The world knows that the Kim regime takes defection as a serious affront and issues strict punishments, including imprisonment of family members or even execution for some returned defectors. Obviously South Korea is alarmed as it would have reason to feel that North Korea’s military involvement in Ukraine could both legitimise Pyongyang’s weapons program and provide combat experience that could threaten South Korean security. Seoul also contends that North Korean troops in Ukraine violate UN precedents, including recent UN General Assembly resolutions condemning military cooperation with Russia. There is indeed a danger that the participation of a third nation in Ukraine conflict risks triggering a global war, given the complex web of security alliances and the potential for escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia however counters that the current cooperation between Russia and North Korea does not run counter to the security interests of South Korea and that such cooperation is being realized within the framework of international law. The US considers the involvement of North Korean troops in the Ukraine conflict on Russia’s behalf as a major escalation and shall have serious impact not only in Europe but in the Indo-Pacific as well. The Russia-North Korea defence deal signals a fundamental shift in global power dynamics. Japan too is concerned about the deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia as worrying, given its impact on the security of the region surrounding Japan. So, the situation is more complicated and risk threshold is feared to be breached any time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAtOquzvuSidQ	2024-11-06T09:27:22-08:00	
Trump’s Victory Seen Through India’s Eyes – OpEd	Trump's electoral politics matches Modi's in India Republican party candidate Donald Trump's decisive victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election looks remarkably like Narendra Modi's sweeping victories in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections in India. Both Trump and Modi won against candidates or parties which were clueless about the mood and aspirations of the people at the grassroots level, while they were clued into them. In the US, the earlier Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, was aged and infirm. His midstream replacement, Kamala Harris, was younger and fit. She also performed creditably in the debate with Trump. But her campaign lacked clear messages to the voters about her plan to tackle America's problems, other than Trump's fascistic predilections. But fighting fascism was an issue only among a section of the elite, the Left liberals, not the hoi polloi. The common man whether White, Latino, Brown or Black, was facing real life issues like unemployment and illegal immigration. On these, Harris did not have a clear or original line. In foreign policy, there was no indication that the US under Harris would not bumble as it had been bumbling under Biden. In the case of the Indian leader in 2014, Narendra Modi, he was a beacon of hope for the youth wanting India to come out the psychological rut that it had got into under the 10-year rule of the Congress party. Modi came on to the scene as a gust of fresh air. Though subsequently, his economic performance only enriched the rich, he whipped up Hindu nationalism especially after a terror act just before the 2019 elections. He reaped a good harvest of votes as a result. In the 2024 elections Modi was mauled, but not eliminated as he was able to remain in power with the help of two allies. In the 2024 elections, the Congress had exploited some of the grievances of the people, but it had not cultivated the Hindu constituency, the biggest in the country. The Congress' support base was widespread but it had no large core constituency. In the US, Trump had popular issues to exploit other than the broader issue of the Biden Administration's lacklustre performance both at home and abroad. Biden's effort to restore peace in the Middle East was insincere and ineffective. So were its efforts to help Ukraine stop the Russian war machine. Sanctions against Russia and Iran had failed to deliver results. In Asia, China could not be contained. And on top of all that, Democratic candidate Harris did not have a fresh approach to any of these issues. Trump's campaign rode on the resentment of disenchanted voters. It capitalized on the cultural fractures and tribal politics that Trump has long exploited, TIME magazine wrote after Trump's victory. His support base, which was thought to be confined to the White poor majority, had expanded to included Latinos despite his threats of mass detention and deportation of migrants. Erika Lee in her book 'America for Americans,' argues that Trump's immigration policies and statements are part of a long tradition of xenophobia-against Southern Europeans, against newcomers from Asia, Latin America and the Middle East-a tradition that has lived alongside America's self-perception as a nation of immigrants. The Whites were not put off with Trump's threat to unleash revenge against political enemies through the justice system or to use the military against US citizens. Surveys showed that men, particularly young men, were turning away from Biden the most, especially over the economy. They appreciated Trump's brashness and habit of smashing norms, TIME said. Trump's announcement of 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate helped counter Harris on the age issue. The female vote was posing a challenge because of his no abortion policy. Finally, on October1, he issued a statement that he would not have a federal policy on abortion but leave the matter to the States. This helped him get female votes. TIME pointed out that in the final weeks of the campaign, billionaire Elon Musk poured more than US$ 100 million to help Trump in swing states. 'Musk hired staffers and incentivized them with pay outs to reach voters. He personally camped out in Pennsylvania, seen by both sides as the pivotal battleground state, and handed out US$ 1 million checks in sweepstakes for registered voters who signed a petition.' In the election's final weeks, Musk used Far-Right's conspiracy theory that Democrats were 'importing' undocumented immigrants to swing states to irrevocably tilt the electoral map in their favour, TIME pointed out. 'If Trump doesn't win,' Musk warned, 'this is the last election.' Trump told TIME that he plans to use executive power to begin mass deportations of undocumented migrants. There will be a massive purge of the federal bureaucracy to weed out elements opposed to him using his control over the judiciary, the magazine further said. According to Al Jazeera, Trump will revive his 'America First' foreign policy, indicating a turn towards isolationism and less international collaboration. But he will continue to be pro-Israel. While in office, Trump had moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move that was widely denounced. He also recognised Israel's claim to the occupied Golan Heights in Syria. But he did some good too. He brokered the 'Abraham Accords' between Israel and the Arab States. When he was President earlier, he unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 agreement that saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions against it. He heaped crippling sanctions on Iran and authorised the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Trump wants to stop the war in Ukraine but he may not negotiate a settlement but could stop funding NATO which will impact on Ukraine's ability to fight Russia. Trump has said that he will withdraw from NATO because its European members are not contributing enough. Trump places the US's economic relationship with China above other issues, such as human rights. He may go for a trade and tariff war with China as he did in 2018. He slapped tariffs on more than US$250 billion on Chinese imports. Nevertheless, Trump has expressed an affinity for China's strongman leader, President Xi Jinping as he said about Russia's Putin and India's Modi. Trump may also put stiff tariff barriers on imports from India, if India continues its protectionist policies. Likewise, he may not let India off the hook in the case of the attempted assassination of an American citizen of Indian origin, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, allegedly by India's agents. It is a question of America's sovereignty. The case is in a New York court. Although Trump seemed to be sympathetic to the Hindus' plight in Bangladesh, he is unlikely to please India on strategic and economic issues just as a matter of goodwill. Trump is quintessentially a transactional politician. For every favour he does to India, he would expect a reciprocal gesture. There will be no free lunches under his watch.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAggsbnJ6wvLl	2024-11-06T09:25:54-08:00	
Trump Wins US Presidential Election	Former U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to earn a new four-year term as the country’s leader. In a tightly contested race, Trump secured at least 277 of the 538 available electoral votes in Tuesday’s election, giving him the necessary majority to become the first U.S. leader to win non-consecutive terms since the 1890s. Harris, the Democratic candidate who joined the race late after President Joe Biden dropped out in July, was trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency. Trump claimed victory early Wednesday as he thanked his supporters at a rally in Florida. 'This was a movement like nobody's ever seen before, and, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,' Trump said. He pledged to 'fix our borders' and 'fix everything in our country.' Trump also said he would work to deliver a 'strong, safe and prosperous America.' A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in Washington that she would not address the gathering overnight but would speak later Wednesday. In the U.S. system, where the presidential election is tallied in a series of state-by-state contests, both Harris and Trump were quickly declared winners in states where their parties enjoy clear majority support, while the nation focused on roughly seven so-called battleground states that were expected to tip the balance in the direction of the winner. Ultimately it was Trump’s victories in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin that gave him the advantage. Republican success Tuesday extended to Congress, where the party won back a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats. Control of the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet decided early Wednesday. Trump served from 2017-2021 but left office after losing to Biden in an election that Trump continued to falsely assert that he won. That denial helped fuel the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters who disrupted the official tallying of the 2020 election results. Trump and his allies also launched numerous legal challenges after the 2020 vote, with state and federal judges eventually dismissing more than 50 lawsuits. Since leaving office, Trump was convicted of 34 charges linked to hush money payments he made to an adult film actress in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for November 26. Trump was also indicted in three other cases, including two accusing him of trying to illegally overturn the 2020 election and another alleging he took hundreds of highly secret national security documents to his Florida home. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated for a new term on January 20. A key foreign policy focus in a new Trump administration will be relations between the United States and China, including subjects such as trade, Taiwan and China’s actions in the South China Sea. Trump instituted a series of tariffs against Chinese imports amid a trade war with China during his previous administration. Vincent Wang, dean of the college of arts and sciences at Adelphi University, told VOA Mandarin that China would be less likely to take an aggressive stance than it would have been if Harris won. 'If Trump is elected, I think China may not dare, because he doesn't go through drafts, he has already said harsh words. If he wakes up today, he might say he's going to raise tariffs by 200 percent. If he wakes up tomorrow, he might want to bomb Beijing. So I think this so-called this Trump-type deterrent, on the contrary, will make them a little bit more restrained,' Wang said Tuesday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAtxN6At-sKBb	2024-11-06T09:21:00-08:00	
Central Asian Economies Are Booming As Region Builds On Energy, I...	As the war in Ukraine continues to reshape global trade routes, Central Asia’s economies are showing impressive growth, according to a recent report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD projects the region’s GDP will expand by 5.1 percent in 2024 and accelerate to 5.9 percent in 2025, fueled by rising revenues from commodities, increased infrastructure spending, and market-oriented reforms. With remittance flows surging, wages on the rise, and a boom in tourism, especially in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, Central Asia’s economies are seizing new opportunities while navigating increased scrutiny from the West. Governments across the region are ramping up investment in vital infrastructure sectors like transport, logistics, and energy to sustain growth. The EBRD also noted that 'intermediated trade' with Russia - once a major growth driver - has hit a ceiling following last year’s rapid expansion. In Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s largest economy, the EBRD forecasts 4.0 percent growth in 2024, rising to 5.5 percent in 2025 as the country pursues infrastructure projects and expands its Tengiz oil field. The country’s strategic position and energy exports make it a pivotal player in the region’s economic landscape, as it continues to balance its international trade commitments. As nuclear energy gains renewed attention globally, Kazakhstan's substantial uranium reserves - over 10 percent of the world's total – will enhance its significance as a key global supplier. Kyrgyzstan, a fast-growing hub for regional tourism, is expected to see GDP growth of 9 percent in 2024, moderating to 7 percent in 2025. While this growth is supported by hospitality and transport, some analysts argue that Kyrgyzstan’s accelerated rise stems from its possible role in helping Russia evade sanctions. Since 2022, trade with the EU has increased more than tenfold, with some reports citing 'false invoicing' practices allowing goods to be rerouted to Russia without physically entering Kyrgyzstan. In response, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned several Kyrgyz companies last year, also warning banks against facilitating trade with sanctioned Russian entities. Under mounting international pressure, Kyrgyz authorities imposed a one-year ban in September on banking transactions for import-export deals where goods do not physically enter the country. They also established the 'Trading Company of the Kyrgyz Republic,' a state-owned entity exempt from this ban and tasked with managing such trade - a move some critics have already labeled as 'nationalizing' financial flows associated with sanctions evasion. The new trading company is expected to collaborate with state-owned RSC Bank and Aiyl Bank, along with the recently registered private Asman Bank, which has ties to Russia, to facilitate transactions in alternative currencies, including cryptocurrencies, potentially circumventing Western financial restrictions. In Tajikistan, the EBRD projects 8 percent growth in 2024, driven by higher wages, a focus on infrastructure, and precious metals exports, though the country faces volatility in remittances from Russia. Tajikistan has several massive investment projects in hydropower and mining underway. Meanwhile, Turkmenistan is expected to maintain steady 6.3 percent growth through 2025, backed by public investments and streamlined customs procedures. While improved trade efficiency supports the country’s transportation sector, Turkmenistan remains highly dependent on gas exports to China, leaving it exposed to shifts in Chinese demand. Uzbekistan is also seeing strong economic momentum, with 6.0 percent growth anticipated in both 2024 and 2025, bolstered by remittances, tourism, and industrial expansion. However, a persistent energy deficit threatens to cap growth in the coming years. While Central Asia’s per capita GDP has tripled since 2000, the region still lags behind global standards of living. Nikolai Podguzov, chairman of the Eurasian Development Bank, emphasized that sustained economic progress will require more industrialization. 'If we want fast and sustainable growth, industry is essential,' he said, highlighting the need for Central Asian economies to generate high-value jobs and raise incomes to improve overall living standards.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrfGulsZuxtn_	2024-11-06T09:14:45-08:00	
Can Trump Make America Great Again? – OpEd	Allies and supporters of the United States who praise it as the champion of democracy, freedom and human rights will now be rushing to join the media queue to congratulate the incoming president. In their public messaging, they are likely to extol the outcome as yet another example of American exceptionalism and a role model for the countries of the world they regard as autocratic and necessary to bring down to uphold their definition of democracy and the western rule of law. Privately though, they will be feeling and reacting differently. They are also likely to be very afraid of what will now follow. The explanation is not far to find. Though portrayed in Western media as offering vastly different visions of the US for the next four years as well as being diametrically opposed in their foreign policy objectives, both Harris and Trump concur in adherence to the slogan made famous by Trump: that is to 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). It is a slogan which Democrat party leaders embrace just as strongly but would rather not let the rest of the world be aware of or knowledgeable about. How Will MAGA impact US Foreign Policy? Post election, Trump can be expected to push the MAGA foreign policy agenda hard and at the expense of the interests and concerns of the rest of the world. MAGAs foreign policy impact will be felt not only by countries which the US sees as rivals and enemies - China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Serbia, Venezuela, Belarus and others. It will also inflict costs on allies including Canada, European Union nations, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and a few others such as the Philippines previously provided with generous financial and military support by a moneyed and powerful benefactor which is now relatively impoverished and less influential. Countries not hitched to the American ideological bandwagon that see themselves as independent such as Mexico, India and Vietnam will find that sitting on the fence in the next four years will be much less comfortable as the new US president will not shield or spare them from the looming policy changes in trade, economy, finance, immigration, security, climate change and wherever else he sees as important and necessary to uplift the US and stem its decline. Earlier in July, the Economist drew up a table ranking the vulnerability of various countries likely to be impacted by a new Trump presidency’s core policies. The table, The Trump Risk Index, assessed the exposure and vulnerability of America’s 70 largest trading partners to potential policy changes. No similar table was drawn up for a Harris presidency indicating that the newspaper had doubts on her possible victory. Source: Increasingly, we find that liberal and conservative American analysts - both now recognizing that the US is in an existential crisis - are converging in support of MAGA to be the focus of US foreign policy. The crisis, a long developing one, exposes not only the deep divisions within American society with equal numbers on Republican and Democrat sides of the political fence in disagreement on the domestic policy reforms that the country badly needs. It also brings to attention the current status of the US described by Trump as 'a failing country'. It is a description that some Americans have taken umbrage with but which many Democrat supporters agree on too whilst denouncing the Republican and Trumpian rhetoric and record on failing to improve the state of the nation. What is perhaps most unsettling is that the disorder and instability in the US may see the new President become more reliant on US military superiority to ensure American dominance in global geopolitics. The US military might again be called upon to underpin the foreign policy actions needed to make America great again. Is a last hurrah coming to ensure that the US continues its defence of the unipolar world that it has shaped and imposed on the rest of the world and which the western military-industrial-media complex is fixated on preserving? Leaders around the world will be hoping that President Trump will work to ensure that the US plays a key role in upholding and championing the much impaired and endangered cause of peaceful coexistence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrcQprKvkyXGe	2024-11-06T09:12:52-08:00	
Wings Of Unity: Indus Shield 2024 Military Exercise – OpEd	A landmark multilateral military exercise Indus Shield 2024 conducted by Pakistan, serves as a testament to the nation's commitment to regional stability and its growing role in international defense cooperation. This exercise, which brings together a diverse range of military forces and strategic partners, demonstrates Pakistan's evolving security posture, its commitment to peace in the South Asian region, and its expanding role in global defense networks. Indus Shield 2024 is not just a routine military exercise; it is an emblem of Pakistan's strategic vision for defense diplomacy and international collaboration. It underscores the country’s position as a significant player in the South Asian security complex and highlights its growing influence in global defense forums. Pakistan’s military is regarded as one of the most capable and experienced in the region, and exercises like Indus Shield allow the country to showcase its operational readiness, interoperability with allied forces, and commitment to maintaining peace in a region marked by volatility. The name 'Indus Shield' is symbolic of Pakistan's deep historical roots and its geographical and cultural importance. The Indus River, one of the world’s oldest civilizations' cradle, is not only a vital natural resource for the country but also a metaphor for the defense of peace and stability. By invoking this name, the exercise emphasizes the nation's resilience, as well as its role as a regional stabilizer, much like the river itself which sustains life across Pakistan’s vast plains. Pakistan’s geostrategic position in South Asia places it at the nexus of multiple security concerns. To the west lies Afghanistan, which has faced decades of conflict, and to the east is India, with whom Pakistan has had a complex and often adversarial relationship. The region also grapples with other security challenges, including terrorism, insurgency, and the broader challenge of great-power competition between global powers like the United States, China, and Russia. Given these factors, Pakistan has had to continuously adapt its defense strategy to ensure both internal stability and regional peace. This has meant not only strengthening its own military capabilities but also fostering closer defense ties with international partners who share an interest in maintaining peace and security in South Asia. The Indus Shield exercise is a key element of this broader strategic effort, emphasizing joint military training, counterterrorism collaboration, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, and interoperability with allied forces. By hosting and participating in exercises like Indus Shield 2024, Pakistan sends a clear message about its commitment to countering the growing security challenges in the region. Whether it's the threat of cross-border terrorism, the need for peacekeeping missions, or the need for stability in the Indian Ocean region, these multinational defense collaborations demonstrate that Pakistan is not only a passive observer of regional events but an active participant in shaping the security landscape. One of the key goals of the Indus Shield exercise is to enhance the interoperability of military forces. Modern warfare increasingly requires coordination and seamless communication between forces from different countries and backgrounds, a necessity underscored by Pakistan’s strategic partnerships with various regional and global powers. The ability to work effectively with allied forces is crucial, particularly in the event of multinational peacekeeping operations or humanitarian crises. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise brings together a wide range of military forces from various countries, with Pakistan at the helm. These exercises involve comprehensive training in counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, urban warfare, border security, and disaster management. Such joint training programs ensure that the participating nations' forces can operate in unison during crises or conflict situations. Military interoperability is particularly important for Pakistan, as the country is an active member of a range of international security organizations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the Pakistan-China military cooperation. As these alliances grow stronger, exercises like Indus Shield allow participating countries to harmonize their tactics, techniques, and procedures, ensuring swift, effective responses in the face of evolving security challenges. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise reflects Pakistan's proactive stance in expanding its defense cooperation beyond its immediate neighborhood. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to broaden its military relationships with countries across Asia, Europe, and even the Middle East, recognizing that defense cooperation is not only about countering traditional military threats but also about addressing non-traditional security concerns like climate change, cyber threats, and the rise of non-state actors. In addition to its traditional military partnerships with China and the United States, Pakistan has strengthened its defense ties with Russia, Turkey, and the Middle Eastern states. These collaborations are integral to Pakistan's broader vision of a multi-dimensional security strategy that addresses both traditional military threats and non-traditional security challenges. As a result, exercises like Indus Shield provide a platform for these countries to share intelligence, exchange best practices, and develop joint solutions to common security concerns. The growing role of Pakistan in regional and global defense cooperation is also facilitated by its increasing participation in multinational peacekeeping and disaster relief operations. The Pakistan Army, recognized for its expertise in peacekeeping, has consistently contributed to United Nations missions around the world. By hosting multinational exercises such as Indus Shield, Pakistan strengthens its position as a reliable partner for peace and stability in both regional and international forums. One of the focal points of Indus Shield 2024 is counterterrorism and counterinsurgency training. Pakistan has been at the frontline of the global war on terror, facing both internal and external security threats from various militant groups. The country has invested heavily in counterterrorism operations in its border regions, particularly in areas bordering Afghanistan and India. These operations have ranged from eliminating militant groups operating in the region to enhancing border security and intelligence sharing. By focusing on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, Indus Shield contributes to enhancing the capabilities of participating countries to deal with asymmetrical threats. These threats, including those posed by insurgent groups and terrorist organizations, require a unique set of skills that blend traditional military expertise with intelligence gathering, technology, and cooperation across borders. In this context, Pakistan’s experience in these domains serves as an invaluable resource for allied nations. The exercise also enables participants to build joint strategies for dealing with the root causes of terrorism, including economic instability, political marginalization, and sectarian violence. In addition to its military objectives, the Indus Shield exercise also emphasizes humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Pakistan is located in a region prone to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones, and the Pakistan Army has developed a reputation for its swift and effective response to such crises. These operations often involve not just the military, but also civilian agencies and international partners. In this regard, Indus Shield 2024 also focuses on improving the capabilities of participating forces in disaster response and management. The participation of international partners in humanitarian missions further strengthens Pakistan’s international standing. By demonstrating its capacity to coordinate and collaborate with global forces in disaster relief, Pakistan not only showcases its military proficiency but also its commitment to the welfare of humanity. Indus Shield 2024 represents a significant step forward for Pakistan in its quest to reinforce regional stability, deepen its international defense cooperation, and expand its role on the global stage. The exercise serves as a powerful reminder that security in South Asia cannot be ensured in isolation. It is a collective responsibility that demands active collaboration, trust-building, and the ability to work together in the face of common threats. As the world becomes more interconnected and security challenges grow increasingly complex, Pakistan’s role as a key player in international defense cooperation will continue to grow. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise is a clear indication that the country is committed to being a central force for peace and stability in the region and beyond, marking a new chapter in its defense diplomacy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrYL5m2tuYvIU	2024-11-06T09:11:20-08:00	
The Case For New Provinces In Pakistan: Enhancing Governance And ...	Pakistan’s administrative landscape, divided into 38 divisions across its four provinces—Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Balochistan—along with two autonomous territories, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), is a complex tapestry reflecting the country’s vast geographic and demographic diversity. As a nation of over 220 million people, Pakistan’s current administrative structure struggles to balance governance, development, and representation across varied regions and ethnicities. The creation of new provinces, proposed by many as a means of enhancing these aspects, deserves serious consideration. This shift could be transformative, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources, effective governance, and greater political representation. Proponents of new provinces argue that provincial autonomy could unlock numerous benefits, including streamlined administration, enhanced political representation, and localized economic development. At present, the allocation of resources and development funds is heavily centralized. For instance, areas like South Punjab and Hazara often feel marginalized within their respective provinces, with resources disproportionately directed toward provincial capitals and economic hubs like Lahore and Karachi. New provinces could bring local governments closer to the people they serve, fostering greater accountability and empowering residents with improved access to funds and services. Pakistan’s challenges are not unique, and there are global precedents for devolution and provincial restructuring that offer valuable insights. Kenya’s shift to 47 counties in 2013 was driven by similar goals of localized governance and resource allocation, allowing more equitable development across the country. India’s decision to carve out the state of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh in 2014 similarly aimed at empowering a region that had long felt neglected under the larger state structure. The benefits of such models are clear: decentralization can mitigate ethnic, linguistic, and political tensions while enabling smaller administrative units to address local issues more effectively. More recently, Indonesia’s plans to create additional provinces in the Papua region underscore a growing recognition of the need to accommodate regional aspirations within a framework that promotes national unity. In Pakistan’s case, the creation of provinces such as South Punjab, Hazara, and FATA could address longstanding grievances and foster a sense of inclusion among historically marginalized populations. Potential Provinces and Their Unique Needs Several proposed provinces are frequently mentioned in discussions of administrative restructuring in Pakistan, each with its own unique case: South Punjab Province: This region, which forms a significant part of Punjab, has long felt marginalized due to a perceived lack of resources and infrastructure development. A new province here would allow for a more focused approach to development in southern Punjab, enabling policies tailored to local economic needs, which are often agricultural. Hazara Province: Located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hazara is home to distinct linguistic and cultural groups who have advocated for provincial status for years. Establishing Hazara as a separate province could improve governance by catering to its specific cultural and social needs, which are often overshadowed within KP’s broader Pashtun-majority landscape. FATA Province: Formerly a federally administered tribal area, FATA was merged into KP in 2018. However, the integration process has faced challenges, and many argue that FATA would benefit from provincial status to better address its unique development needs and longstanding socioeconomic challenges. Seraiki Province: Similar to South Punjab, the Seraiki-speaking region of Punjab has its distinct linguistic and cultural identity. A Seraiki province could empower the people of this region by giving them control over their own administrative and economic priorities, fostering a sense of cultural pride and representation. Karachi Province: Karachi, Pakistan’s economic heart, presents a unique case. Its diverse population, massive economic output, and urban challenges necessitate a governance model that can address urban planning, law enforcement, and infrastructure issues more effectively. Provincial status could enable Karachi to better manage its resources and cater to its complex demographics. Gilgit-Baltistan Province: Although GB has a certain degree of autonomy, it is yet to be granted full provincial status. This change could give its residents greater political rights and improve federal investments in critical areas like infrastructure and tourism, boosting the region’s potential for sustainable development. Establishing new provinces is a complex process that requires careful planning, particularly in a diverse and politically dynamic country like Pakistan. A gradual, phase-wise approach could help manage this transition smoothly. Rather than attempting to overhaul the administrative landscape in one stroke, the government could prioritize certain areas where the demand for provincial status is most pressing and where the potential benefits are clearly identifiable. For instance, South Punjab and Hazara could serve as pilot projects, allowing Pakistan to assess the impacts of provincial restructuring and make adjustments as necessary. The phase-wise model would also enable local governments to gradually assume control over finances and administrative responsibilities, reducing the risk of political and bureaucratic resistance. While the creation of new provinces has potential benefits, it is not without challenges. The financial cost of establishing new provincial governments, administrative bodies, and infrastructure would be significant. Additionally, the redistribution of resources and political power could provoke opposition from existing provincial administrations. Pakistan’s federal government would need to ensure that this restructuring does not exacerbate existing political tensions or encourage separatist sentiments. Moreover, the process must prioritize inclusivity and local participation. The federal and provincial governments should engage with local communities, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to build consensus and address concerns about the administrative, economic, and political implications of new provinces. The creation of new provinces in Pakistan is an idea whose time has come. With an increasingly diverse population and mounting governance challenges, Pakistan must consider administrative reforms that promote equitable development, representation, and political stability. Learning from international models, Pakistan can navigate this transition through a measured, inclusive approach that empowers its regions while strengthening national unity. By taking steps toward restructuring its administrative landscape, Pakistan can lay the foundation for a future marked by stronger governance, enhanced political representation, and sustainable economic growth	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrfZ4JDQt8owx	2024-11-06T09:09:59-08:00	
Atmanirbhar Narishakti: Concept, Components And Challenges – OpEd	The concept of Atmanirbhar Narishakti (self-reliant women’s empowerment) has evolved from India’s historical movements for women’s rights and empowerment, but it gained focused momentum under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and its origin, evolution, and development rooted within India's social, political, and economic contexts. Now, it is a key initiative in India that emphasizes empowering women to become self-reliant, independent, and active contributors to the economy and society. This concept aligns with the broader goals of the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) mission initiated by the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Its key components and focus areas include: a. Economic Empowerment: Promoting women's participation in entrepreneurship through loans and financial incentives under schemes like PM Mudra Yojana and Stand-Up India. Encouraging self-help groups (SHGs) by linking them with markets and financial institutions. b. Skill Development: Initiatives to enhance women's skills through Skill India programs. Training in digital and traditional skills, such as handicrafts, agriculture, and IT. c. Health and Well-being: Focus on Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao to improve education and healthcare opportunities for girls. Promotion of menstrual hygiene and maternal health programs. d. Social Security and Support: Programs like Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and National Creche Scheme to support working mothers. Insurance schemes such as PM Jan Dhan Yojana and PM Suraksha Bima Yojana for women's financial security. e. Legal and Policy Support: Steps to enhance safety through women's helplines, One-Stop Centers, and stricter laws against domestic violence and harassment. Amendments to encourage more women in leadership and decision-making positions, such as reservation in government roles and education. The Atmanirbhar Narishakti Yojana, often announced as part of national budget measures, aims to foster inclusivity by ensuring women's active participation in achieving India's economic self-reliance. By integrating empowerment with economic policies, the movement intends to unlock the untapped potential of millions of Indian women, promoting their development alongside national growth. Origin and development In ancient India, women enjoyed considerable respect and agency in certain spheres. However, in the medieval period, women's status declined due to societal restrictions, practices like purdah, and limited education and its larger aspects include: a. Colonial Era (19th-20th Century): Social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Savitribai Phule began campaigns against practices like sati, child marriage, and promoted women's education. The Indian National Movement also saw active female participation, with leaders like Sarojini Naidu and Aruna Asaf Ali, who advocated for women's rights along with political independence. b. Post-Independence Development: The Indian Constitution (1950) recognized gender equality and prohibited discrimination based on sex (Article 15). Over the years, the government initiated several welfare and empowerment programs. Key Policy Interventions: 1955: The Hindu Marriage Act outlawed polygamy and introduced divorce rights for women. 1975: India celebrated International Women’s Year, reflecting global awareness of gender issues. In the 1990s, liberalization led to greater focus on women’s economic inclusion. Self-help groups (SHGs) gained importance, especially in rural areas, promoting financial independence for women. c. Emergence of the Concept: Atmanirbhar Bharat and Atmanirbhar Narishakti (Post-2020): The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan was launched in 2020 to promote self-reliance and economic resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This larger mission emphasized local production, entrepreneurship, and sustainability across sectors. Atmanirbhar Narishakti emerged as an integral part of this initiative, reflecting the recognition that achieving self-reliance for India requires empowering women as economic contributors. d. Recent Development and Focus Area: Since 2021, the Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative has grown through targeted programs and policies. These developments highlight the evolving priorities: Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Support: Expansion of self-help groups (SHGs) to promote women-led micro-businesses. Programs like the Mudra Yojana providing loans to women entrepreneurs. Skill Development Programs: Special training under Skill India focusing on both traditional crafts and modern technologies. Promotion of digital literacy through PM Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA). Social Reforms and Welfare: Mission Shakti introduced to address safety and protection for women. Focus on menstrual health and well-being under various health programs. Legislative Changes: Enhanced reservation policies to promote women's participation in governance and politics. Reforms addressing domestic violence and workplace harassment to ensure a safer environment for working women. Atmanirbhar Narishakti reflects a modern evolution of India’s women’s empowerment agenda, moving beyond welfare to active economic participation. Rooted in historical movements and refined by modern socio-economic needs, this initiative aligns with the vision of a self-reliant India where women's contributions are pivotal to national growth. This concept's strength lies in integrating economic independence with social equality, empowering women not just as beneficiaries but as drivers of change and development. Potential challenges The Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative, despite being ambitious, faces several challenges in achieving its goals of women’s empowerment and economic self-reliance. These challenges are rooted in economic, social, cultural, and structural issues that have persisted in India for decades. a. Economic Challenges: Limited Access to Finance: Despite schemes likeMudra Yojana, many women still face difficulties in accessing formal credit due to lack of collateral, limited financial literacy, and dependence on male family members. Women-led enterprises are often small-scale and struggle to access markets and value chains, limiting their growth. b. Structural and Institutional: Inadequate Infrastructure and Support Systems: Lack of access to childcare services, safe transportation, and healthcare facilitieslimits women's ability to participate in the workforce, particularly in rural and urban slum areas. Many women entrepreneurs struggle with the digital divide—limited access to technology and internet connectivity hampers efforts toward digital literacy and entrepreneurship. c. Safety and Legal Issues: Workplace Harassment and Violence: Women often face harassment and discrimination at workplaces, especially in the informal sector where labour laws are weak or poorly enforced. Fear of gender-based violence in public spaces limits women’s mobility and participation in economic activities. Ineffective Grievance Redressal Mechanisms: Despite the introduction of One-Stop Centers and women's helplines, many women do not report harassment due to social stigma or distrust in the legal system. d. Digital Divide and Technological Exclusion: Limited Digital Literacy: A significant digital divide exists between men and women, with women having less access to mobile phones, the internet, and digital skills. As digital platforms become central to financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, this gap puts women at a disadvantage in accessing government schemes, markets, and e-commerce opportunities. Challenges in Remote Learning and Work: Women often face difficulties balancing remote work or learning with household responsibilities, highlighting the gendered nature of time poverty. Policy and Governance Gaps: Lack of Awareness about Government Programs: Many women, especially in rural areas, are unaware of existing schemes and benefits available under Atmanirbhar Bharat and related initiatives. Bureaucratic processes and corruption further complicate access to these programs. While efforts have been made toward women-centric policies, there is a lack of gender-responsive budgeting to ensure adequate allocation of resources for women’s empowerment programs. The Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative offers a promising vision of empowering women and promoting self-reliance. However, its success hinges on addressing the multi-faceted challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrZ6-Qp0PgOG3	2024-11-06T09:08:34-08:00	
Trump’s Return: Navigating Peace In The Israeli-Palestinian Confl...	With Donald Trump’s return, the White House is set to undergo significant shifts in both domestic and foreign policy. Donald Trump’s return to the presidency re-opens a complex chapter in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the recent intensification of violence in Gaza. The conflict, marked by devastating casualties and destruction, has brought international attention back to the underlying tensions between Israel and Palestinians, with Gaza as a flashpoint. Trump, who campaigned on promises to end 'Endless Wars' and prioritize American disengagement from foreign entanglements, now faces the challenge of addressing this crisis. In a region where diplomatic peace efforts have historically struggled, Trump’s approach to the conflict will need to evolve to reflect both his commitment to reducing U.S. involvement in wars and his strong alliance with Israel. In Trump’s first term, he brokered the 'Abraham Accords', which established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. While these agreements marked a shift toward regional cooperation and economic growth, they bypassed Palestinian leaders, leaving unresolved core issues such as Palestinian sovereignty, the future of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. While the accords generated economic opportunities, particularly in tourism and trade, they also underscored a new regional alignment focused more on countering Iran than addressing Palestinian grievances. As an armed conflict between Israel and Palestine has been taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7th 2023, Trump’s new administration may face pressure to revisit these unresolved issues. His previous strategy prioritized economic initiatives for Palestinians through a 'Peace to Prosperity' plan, which proposed billions in foreign investment in Palestinian territories. This approach, however, was criticized for offering economic incentives in place of addressing Palestinians’ aspirations for sovereignty and self-determination. For a sustainable solution, Trump’s administration might need to shift from purely economic strategies to a more comprehensive diplomatic engagement that includes Palestinian leadership, as economic development alone has proven insufficient in achieving lasting peace. The geopolitical landscape in the Middle East has also shifted since Trump’s last term. At the same time, recent normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran indicate a thaw in relations that could reshape regional dynamics. Trump’s potential continuation of the Abraham Accords could include attempts to bring Saudi Arabia into formal normalization with Israel, but Saudi Arabia has maintained that resolving the Palestinian issue is crucial before it formalizes relations. Trump’s re-engagement in the region may require a delicate balance advancing the accords without sidelining Palestinian aspirations, particularly with Gaza’s instability affecting regional stability. One of Trump’s most controversial decisions during his previous term was his 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This move was celebrated by Israelis but deeply alienated Palestinian leadership, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The decision significantly strained U.S.-Palestinian relations, with Palestinian leaders subsequently disengaging from U.S.-led peace efforts. If Trump hopes to foster a more balanced approach, he might consider symbolic gestures to Palestinians, such as re-opening the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem – a move President Biden had suggested but did not fully execute. This gesture could signal a willingness to recognize Palestinian interests without retracting support for Israel, thereby re-establishing diplomatic channels with Palestinian authorities. The recent Gaza war has highlighted the urgency of addressing Palestinian grievances within any U.S.-backed peace framework. To this end, Trump’s strategy could involve pairing economic support for Palestinian communities with meaningful diplomatic engagements. Working closely with moderate Arab allies like Jordan and Egypt, his administration could create a more credible peace process, bridging economic development with political dialogue. However, Trump’s 'America First' policy and promises to end foreign conflicts mean that his administration would likely aim to facilitate peace efforts without entangling the U.S. in direct military interventions. If he is to uphold his commitment to avoid 'Endless Wars', Trump may prefer diplomatic support to military involvement in any escalation related to Gaza. Building trust with Palestinians, who have long viewed the U.S. as heavily pro-Israel, remains another critical challenge. Issues such as settlement expansion, the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state, and refugee rights remain central to any viable peace plan. The Gaza crisis illustrates how unresolved grievances can quickly destabilize efforts for broader peace in the region. For Trump to make progress, his administration may need to address these political issues alongside economic ones, acknowledging the importance of sovereignty and security for Palestinians to reduce the risk of future escalations. Trump’s second term offers him a chance to shape a new path forward in the Middle East. With the Abraham Accords as a foundation, his new administration can build on regional normalization while also considering the realities on the ground in Gaza. However, balancing his campaign promises to avoid U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts with the need for active diplomacy will be challenging. Should Trump succeed in crafting a strategy that brings together both economic and political dimensions, he could create a lasting legacy in the region. As he takes office, the international community is watching closely to see if his administration can navigate this complex terrain and achieve stability in a conflict that has resisted resolution for decades. For Trump, this may be a defining moment; a chance to leave a lasting legacy by shaping a new and more stable Middle East.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-11-06T09:07:00-08:00	
Next Up—New Supreme Court Justices – OpEd	According to the Washington Post, Donald Trump won the Catholic vote 56 percent to 41 percent. That’s a great triumph for religious liberty. As we previously documented, there were far more victories for religious liberty under the Trump administration than under Biden-Harris. He is poised to enhance his record. To do that he needs to lock in a religious-friendly Supreme Court for decades to come. Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch; the first two are Catholic and Gorsuch, who was raised Catholic, is Protestant. All are good on religious liberty. Chief Justice John Roberts, another Catholic, is mostly reliable on this issue. Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both staunch Catholics, are rock solid on this First Amendment right. Thomas is 76. Alito is 74. Both have served with distinction. They are bright and courageous and have been subjected to incredible vitriol. Indeed, they have survived attempts to destroy them by the masters of personal destruction: those who work in the media, left-wing advocacy organizations, the entertainment industry, and education have worked overtime to smear them. The Left failed to bring them down. Halleluiah. But early next year it will be time for them to step down. If Trump can appoint two more just like them—he can’t do any better—he will secure a religious-friendly court for decades. There is nothing the Catholic bashers would like less.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrZ7XZWGWhlJv	2024-11-06T09:05:33-08:00	
Orban And European Meetings In Budapest: ‘It’s My Party And I’ll ...	By Alexander Faludy Hungarian PM Viktor Orban will host two key meetings of European bodies in Budapest this week. Isolated among EU partners, Orban will be looking to a Trump US election win to bolster his position. On Thursday and Friday, Budapest’s Puskas Arena will play host to two important European fixtures — with much at stake for the home side. Unusually, these will be political not sporting events: the 4th meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) followed by an informal session of the European Council the next day. The EPC was founded in 2022 in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It’s an intergovernmental format for fostering European-wide cooperation beyond EU borders. The EPC comprises all European countries except for Belarus, Russia and the Vatican, but also includes Turkey and the states of the South Caucasus. The European Council is the EU’s meeting of heads of state and government. While lacking legislative power (which belongs to the EU Parliament and Council of Ministers), it is vital for guiding the bloc’s policy agenda. Regardless of the outcomes of these events, their mere occurrence in Budapest is remarkable. Hungary’s six-month stint as president of the Council of the EU, which ends on December 31, has so far faced a symbolic boycott, with many member states as well as the European Commission choosing to be represented at meetings by officials and not at minister/commissioner level. Technical legislative work has continued while the Hungarian presidency itself has been robbed of symbolic capital. To boycott or not to boycott? Orban’s government has long experienced a strained relationship with the various EU institutions and member countries, on account of a deteriorating rule-of-law situation at home and his government’s close ties to Russia. The presidency boycott, however, arose principally 'because of Orban’s unauthorised and provocative ‘peace mission’ to Russia and China in early July,' says Peter Balazs, a former EU commissioner and Hungarian foreign minister. That trip breached protocol with Orban erroneously purporting to represent the EU, not just Hungary, and occasioned a backlash from Brussels and member states. Yet in relation to this week’s Budapest summits. Balazs thinks there’s a degree of hesitation about whether to maintain the boycott. National leaders, Balazs believes, will have been 'wondering what’s better for the EU?': either to boycott and 'thereby give Orban another chance to play the victim vis-à-vis the liberal mainstream'; or to attend and 'use this important gathering to make sharp criticisms of Orban’s ‘illiberal regime’ in his own country and before a wide international audience'. Counting in favour of continuing the boycott is Orban’s trip to Georgia on October 28, where he endorsed the ruling Georgian Dream party’s victory following disputed elections, raising issues akin to July’s ‘peace mission’. EU leaders may also have reservations about attending the Budapest meetings given Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto’s appearance last Thursday at the Russia-led Minsk International Conference on Eurasian Security in Belarus. Szijjarto‘s presence undermined the EU policy of isolating Belarus because of its close ties to Russia. He was photographed enjoying notably cordial interaction with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, with whom he also met privately. Afterwards, the Hungarian foreign minister attempted to deflect criticism, telling journalists: 'We have a sovereign right to negotiate with whomever we want.' Szijjarto’s trip was preceded by a Wednesday meeting at Budapest’s US embassy of ambassadors and defence attaches from NATO countries. A US embassy statement said the meeting was convened 'to discuss the security aspects of the Government of Hungary’s recently announced policy of economic ‘neutrality’.' US Ambassador David Pressman said Hungary’s 'growing dependencies on Moscow and Beijing have security implications for the US and Euro-Atlantic interests'. Indeed, 'that a discussion about an Ally’s ‘neutrality’ policy was necessary speaks for itself', he added. Yet, as Balazs argues, fellow European prime ministers may use the Budapest meetings as an opportunity to challenge Orban over his policies and behaviour. The chance that colleagues will deploy their presence, not absence, to embarrass the Hungarian premier are raised by the recent example set by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. When Orban addressed the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on October 9 to outline Hungary’s EU presidency program, von der Leyen didn’t boycott the event, rather she used a response statement to deliver a blistering critique of Orban, accusing him of undermining Europe’s shared response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and EU solidarity. 'There are still some who blame this war not on the invader but on the invaded; not on Putin’s lust for power but on Ukraine’s thirst for freedom,' Von der Leyen said, before castigating an uncomfortable-looking Orban, seated nearby, for weakening EU security. 'How can it be that the Hungarian government invites Russian nationals into our Union without additional security checks? And how can it be that the Hungarian government would allow Chinese police to operate within its territory?' she asked rhetorically. Balazs thinks it likely that not only von der Leyen but also other European leaders will repeat this strategy in Budapest. Geza Jeszenszky, a fellow former foreign minister who has also served at different times as ambassador in Washington in Washington and Oslo, agrees. 'Orban, with his vociferous hostility to the EU – which he simply calls ‘Brussels’ – has become most unpopular among his colleagues… At the upcoming EU summit Hungary’s policies will be severely criticised,' Jeszenszky tells BIRN. Playing the Trump card As of late Monday afternoon, no draft agenda had been released for either meeting – despite such documents typically being available seven to ten days in advance. The lack of information may have reflected either, the Hungarian government’s generally restrictive approach to communication or, uncertainty for the hosts’ regarding how to populate the program. But then on Monday evening, Zoltan Kovacs, the government’s spokesperson, posted on X more details about the EPC meeting, which will begin with a plenary session, followed by discussions on two major issues: migration and economic security. 'In the migration session, we’ll address all aspects of illegal immigration, while the economic panel will examine the interconnectedness of energy, transport, IT, and global trade – key pillars of European security and prosperity,' Kovacs posted. Orban’s ultimate approach to both meetings will depend significantly on the outcome of the US election on Tuesday. As previously reported by BIRN, Orban is understood to have extended an invitation to Donald Trump (still only a candidate) to address EU leaders either online or in person. Hungary’s prime minister has also made no attempt to disguise his support for the Republican nominee. 'We will open several bottles of champagne if Trump comes back,' he told journalists in Strasbourg following his bruising encounter with von der Leyen on October 9. Orban can be expected to steer the meetings in one of two possible directions, depending on the outcome of the US vote. If Trump is victorious, he’s likely to initiate a ‘grand strategy’ discussion regarding Europe’s positioning vis-à-vis the US and the Russia-Ukraine war. In case of a Kamala Harris win, however, he’ll likely keep discussion more narrowly focused on the priorities of Hungary’s presidency like 'stemming illegal immigration' and 'promoting a farmer-oriented EU agricultural policy'. In theory, Orban could expect some support from other leaders on such issues given that attitudes both to migration and the implications of the Green New Deal have hardened considerably of late. Other governments, including those of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, advocate tougher border controls. Yet for these governments Hungary is unlikely to be regarded as an honest broker. 'No EU member state favours illegal migration, but Hungary pretends as if that were the case, causing irritation. Actual progress at the meeting is highly unlikely,' predicts Jeszenszky. Betting on the US election is a high stakes gamble given it’s on a knife-edge. The latest polls put Trump and Harris neck and neck, both nationally and in the crucial swing states that will determine which candidate gains a majority in the electoral college. According to Garvan Walshe, formerly a foreign policy advisor to the UK’s Conservative Party and now a visiting fellow at the CEU Democracy Institute in Budapest, 'If Trump wins, Orban will use it as a moment of triumph to position himself as the one European who can command Trump’s ear'. Conversely, in the event of a Harris victory, Walshe thinks that Orban 'will struggle not to be alone at his own party'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQxR8ou-W2fwnFCzTaAsyb	2024-11-05T16:17:07-08:00	
The Fourth Branch Of US Government Faces A Reckoning – OpEd	By Kimberlee Josephson Jeff Bezos recently released an op-ed on why the Washington Post will be refraining from endorsing political candidates and why he believes faith needs to be restored in journalism. At the start of the article, he gives an analogy to illustrate the media’s present problem: Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first. Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. These statements are easy to understand, but the matters involved are complex. A voting machine can be made to work properly, and newspapers can go to great lengths to verify sources and situations, but as for the second part of Bezos’s statements about believing it to be true, well, that’s tricky. How deeply one believes, how long one has believed, how one came to be a believer, and what constitutes the core elements of what one believes are important factors. Moreover, understanding why some choose not to believe is just as important as understanding why some do. Boomers may claim that the news used to be a believable source, while Zoomers, having been raised in the noisy digital age, may never feel like legacy media can be trusted. It is also worth noting that conflicted feelings about what one believes can emerge at any time and can be influenced by circumstance. For instance, with the holidays drawing near, many children are questioning their belief in Santa and are adjusting their behavior after having not thought about the jolly gift-giver since last December. Similarly, as this election season comes to a close, many adults are questioning their confidence in a two-party system and are re-evaluating the role politics plays in their everyday life. When it comes to making tough decisions, or understanding that which is hard to believe, we tend to take cues from others and seek to validate our viewpoints, just like children who question their parents after hearing from friends that Santa is not real. And, with this presidential election, many are having a hard time believing the choices we’ve been given and are looking for guidance as well as reassurance. According to a poll conducted by the American Psychiatric Association, 73 percent of U.S. adults are anxious about the election. People have tuned in in high numbers for Ezra Klein’s talk with Vivek Ramaswamy, Bari Weiss’s moderated debate between Ben Shapiro and Sam Harris regarding 'Trump or Kamala?,' and Joe Rogan’s long sit-down with none other than Donald Trump. People are hungry for information and desperate to justify casting their ballot, which brings us back to Bezos’s last-minute decision to do an about-face on the Washington Post’s decades-long practice of endorsing presidential candidates. Bezos is right about the fact that a newspaper endorsement is unlikely to swing someone’s vote choice; however, many people were likely relying on it as a reference point. In fact, Bezos’s judgment call resulted in roughly 250,000 readers, about 10 percent of the Washington Post’s audience, canceling their subscriptions. And while some news outlets followed suit and others helped pave the way (L.A. Times and USA Today), other outlets have chosen to double down on their political positions. The Atlantic gave their endorsement of Kamala Harris earlier this month and re-released that endorsement in an email blast after Bezos’s announcement. News outlets have long helped to inform the populace as well as politicians of hot topics and changes in culture and public opinion—and they do so in one of two ways. A media outlet can be impartial and functional with what it covers (which is easier said than done), or it can take a stance and be transparent about it. Most outlets like to think they do the first when reporting, but in reality they’re doing some form of the second method with muddled transparency. When news outlets endorse a candidate, it serves as a spotlight for where interests and allegiances lie. For those looking to consume information from outlets on opposite ends of the spectrum, these signals help. Media bias is real, and while reporting should always be based on facts, readers should always be aware of how perspectives and preferences can vary greatly in relation to what gets reported and by whom. Thomas Sowell aptly advises that 'If people in the media cannot decide whether they are in the business of reporting news or manufacturing propaganda, it is all the more important that the public understand that difference, and choose their news sources accordingly.' The Washington Post’s readers had an expectation for an endorsement but instead found themselves facing cognitive dissonance over the paper’s position, and some subscribers as well as employees made their jaded feelings known. Even if one argues that Bezos made the right move, it undoubtedly should have been done further out from Election Day. Indeed, the rapport a newspaper has with its readers relies on communication being both timely and relevant, in addition to being true. And the timing and tone of Bezos’s op-ed clearly rattled the relationship status it had with many who will no longer refer to the Washington Post as a trusted source. Overall, the news sector must come to terms with the fact that confidence in the media is at an all-time low and while regaining trust will be an uphill battle, it is one that must be fought. Americans have access to more information than ever before, but it seems we are far from being truly informed. In his book Who Governs?, Robert Dahl notes that an informed and engaged electorate is ideal, but reality often reveals constituents to be a far cry from policy experts and apathy to be commonplace. It is for these reasons that the media matters—the media can (and should) help to educate and energize the electorate. The press has an instrumental role to play in the political realm; it is referred to as the fourth branch of government for a reason. If the fourth branch fails to live up to its role, we will all be worse off for it. As Oscar Wilde quipped, 'In America, the president reigns for four years, and journalism governs forever and ever.' The American media mustn’t shirk from its role, and the American people are right in wanting more from it. We may not trust the news, but my God, do we need it.

To Reduce Violent Conflict, Support Non-Violent Resistance Moveme...	By Dr Bryan Sims It is unsurprising that as the world entered its 18th consecutive year of democratic decline, it was also experiencing a record number of conflicts, with 2023 being among the most violent years since the end of the cold war. This year’s Stockholm Forum on Peace and Development successfully unpacked the complex intersectionality among factors driving instability and violence throughout the globe. Yet while the topic of authoritarianism was raised over and over again during the Forum, it was treated primarily as a governance problem. In fact, authoritarianism is a cross-cutting and fundamental threat to peace and security. The authoritarianism–kleptocracy–conflict nexus Addressing authoritarianism is integral to addressing peace and security challenges. A recent policy paper by the Atlantic Council and the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict reminds us that a more authoritarian world is likely to lead to more interstate warfare. In contrast, research finds that the more democratic states are, the less likely they are to wage wars against each other. But that is not the only security risk of rising authoritarianism; autocratic governments are also more likely to harbour violent extremists than are democracies. Among the drivers of the authoritarian resurgence is the growth of kleptocracy, where networks of ruling elites use public institutions to steal public funds for their own private gain. Together, authoritarian governance and kleptocracy feed vicious cycles, undermining the rule of law and delegitimizing authority, which in turn reinforces a myriad of conflict drivers, which in turn reinforces authoritarian governance and kleptocracy. As we contemplate how to resolve violent conflicts in a rapidly evolving security landscape, we need to recognize that the drivers of violence today are not just local but are driven and sustained by kleptocratic networks of autocrats and violent non-state actors who profit from illicitly gained resources. As the historian Anne Applebaum notes, these networks: control state-owned companies, across multiple countries, that are making investment decisions worth billions of dollars; are purchasing security cameras from China, bots from Russia, and spyware from Israeli companies and their subsidiaries throughout the European Union; are laundering illicit financial gains through vast networks in the United Kingdom and the United States (especially in the states of Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Wyoming); and laundering their own reputations to make them appear to be good global citizens. These actions have weakened the domestic and international institutions responsible for maintaining peace and security. The wealth and power generated by kleptocratic networks help to put actors who drive conflict beyond the reach of these institutions. That is exactly why engaging non-violent resistance movements and the non-traditional institutions they create is critical to building sustainable peace and security. Non-violent resistance movements defend democracy and strengthen security Non-violent civil resistance movements have great, and underutilized, potential to help to secure sustainable peace by addressing the key drivers of conflict in their local and regional contexts. They are rooted in communities and led by and for people facing injustices. They use non-violent direct-action tactics to shift power. And they are twice as effective as armed struggles in advancing democratic aims. Non-violent collective action inspires dignity, agency and three ‘collectives’: collective responsibility, collective ownership and collective identity. Leveraged together, these enable non-violent resistance movements to demonstrate effective tactics that can be scaled and replicated both locally and transnationally. Change rarely happens without meeting fierce–and violent–opposition, as has been seen recently in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Iran, Myanmar, Sudan and Syria. However, while not always successful, non-violent resistance movements do in fact incentivize non-violent pathways to peace. And they can also reduce the risk of atrocities; research shows that armed uprisings are subject to mass killings nearly three times as often as non-violent campaigns. Where to go from here Since the Stockholm Forum, I have had the opportunity to connect with many Forum participants from non-violent resistance movements, civil society, government agencies and donors across geographies and sectors. Three things are clear. First, all recognize the underlying role that authoritarianism and kleptocracy play in driving insecurity and violence in both fragile and stable countries around the globe. Second, all recognize the urgent need to think strategically and collectively to tackle this set of problems. Finally—and unsurprisingly—there is no agreement on a path forward. In my current role as a donor, I believe inclusive strategies are needed that transcend sectors, geographies and levels—from grassroots up to powerholders. Donors should try to build or support cross-sectoral and transnational relationships capable of leveraging diverse knowledge, skills, networks and proximity to power. Such partnerships enable actors with shared goals to simultaneously challenge multiple policies, processes, relationships and power structures that enable insecurity and violence. We know what these partnerships look like: they were the global anti-colonial and anti-Apartheid non-violent resistance movements, and include today’s demands for climate action and justice. Developing and implementing comprehensive strategies to support relationships linking non-violent resistance movements to one another and with other sectors is not just a possibility: collaboration among governments and philanthropic organizations is making these strategies a reality. One example is Powered by the People, a public–private partnership between the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and private foundations that is upskilling and connecting activists around the world, and building partnerships between non-violent resistance movements and key actors in areas such as transparency, anti-corruption, banking and regulation, advocacy, strategic litigation and human rights—to name just a few. Leveraging governmental and philanthropic funds allows donors to better coordinate, collaborate and exploit each other’s strengths. Access to external funding has been a key demand among non-violent resistance movements globally. As donors in the peace and security field, if we are serious about building sustainable peace in an increasingly violent world, we need to meet this demand.

No Matter Who Wins, Half The Country Won’t Believe In The Electio...	By Tho Bishop Today, in theory, will conclude the 2024 presidential election, one of the most bizarre in American political history. From inner-party coups to assassination attempts, Kamala’s Brat summer social media trend to Trump’s courting of comedian podcasts, the campaign cycle has been saturated with the unconventional. It has, of course, also seen its expected share of shallow, political, rhetorical rhetoric and general economic illiteracy, which are the cornerstones of modern democracy. The general superficial nature of mainstream political discourse, though, should not distract us from recognizing foundational truths about the state of modern American politics. No matter the outcome, the legitimacy of American democracy is broken. In 2020, this was in full display, as was the response from Donald Trump and his supporters. Fueled by the unprecedented changes to the election under the shadow of covid, President Trump refused to concede the election. Polls showed the majority of his supporters agreed with him, and from that seed of distrust grew renewed concerns over illegal voters, manipulable voting machines, and rising awareness over the security of vote-by-mail ballots. To this day, large portions of the country continue to believe the Biden administration was illegitimate. How would Democrats have reacted in the face of a similarly close race resulting in a Trump victory last election? While the counterfactual is impossible to consider in practice, hints were already publicly available before election day 2020. In Biden campaign war games, John Podesta, a long-time Democrat operative, outlined a strategy quite similar to the one Trump embarked on. As reported at the time, this included Democrat-swing state governors being pressured into promoting friendly alternative electors to vote in the electoral college under the guise of reversing Republican 'voter suppression' efforts. Unlike the Republican response in 2020, this appeal would have been strengthened by blue-state secession threats should Trump have been inaugurated. Would Joe Biden have followed through with this strategy if this alternative timeline had played out? We will never know. Nor can we know the potential effectiveness of this strategy, though it is likely such efforts would have been treated quite differently than Trump’s response. Still, as we look forward, what is clear here is that the willingness for either side to accept, without question, the basic machinery of American politics has broken down significantly. The centralization of power within Washington, which consistently elevates the stakes of national politics, coupled with significant ideological shifts (particularly on the left), and the perceived danger Trump represents to American political institutions, regardless of his demonstrated ability to follow through after 2016, has created a dynamic where the incentives to concede power for the alleged 'national good' have all but broken down. Each side is motivated by a spirit of self-preservation, not politics. This explains the response from the professional political class to Trump’s election. The intelligence agencies immediately worked to undermine his credibility with the promotion of a false narrative of Trump-Russia collusion. Selected members of Trump’s team saw themselves caught up in investigations. Military and foreign policy leadership would deliberately conceal information and ignore orders handed down from the elected Commander-in-Chief. The result is a unique era of political chaos and hysteria. But from this disruption of political norms becomes the exposure of the underlying unsustainability of the American regime. Bipartisan recklessness on spending, amplified with covid-era fiscal insanity, has manifested itself in ways that political propaganda is proving increasingly difficult to conceal. America’s interest rate payments have passed a trillion dollars, becoming one of the major line items for any future budget. The Fed’s recent significant interest rate cut actually resulted in higher treasury yields, in large part due to growing concerns about America’s long-term fiscal viability. Internationally, America’s explicit weaponization of money and banking has created new challenges as well. The Biden administration’s over-reliance on financial warfare towards Russia has elevated international interest in the BRICs and other non-US-controlled financial networks. The cracking of American global dominance will create additional stresses to traditional Washington foreign policy, particularly if a Harris-led administration doubles down on neoliberal and neoconservative figures in key strategic positions, such as her flirting with the idea of a Liz Cheney cabinet position. These hard realities create new challenges beyond the traditional calculations of political will, and partisan legislative makeup is inevitable, no matter the election’s outcome. The greater challenge to the regime will be domestic. A Trump victory will be a severe refutation of the regime’s reliable public opinion-molding institutions of the corporate press and traditional court intellectuals. A Kamala victory could represent the last gasp of these same forces, as public faith in the media and academia has slipped down to near Congressional-distrust. Replacing traditional media outlets is the rise of podcasts, social media, and other alternative forms of communication, all of which have become key aspects of political campaigns. With this decentralization of news consumption comes greater polarization in national narratives, making it harder for the regime to construct its own preferred lines. This further stresses any of the traditional means by which Washington has consolidated public support behind its leadership. Will Trump supporters accept the governance of an administration that has, over the course of the past four years, accused them of supporting a modern form of Nazism? Will Harris voters accept a president that they view as a domestic fascist threat? We know the answer because we’ve seen the reality play out over the past eight years. Only those who reside in the isolated corridors of Washington or New York can still cling to the delusional fantasy that a defeat of Trump will return the Republican Party to the control of the Bushes and the Romneys. If we accept that traditional Washington politics is mortally wounded, what can replace it? Covid provided a look at what extremely polarized state responses to a national crisis can look like. Hopefully growing distrust of the federal government will lead to more of these outcomes. Trump’s first term was dotted with significant pushback from blue states on a number of issues. Who takes the White House is likely to have a significant impact on the federal response. Democrats have already signaled that their response to the fracturing political environment will likely be an escalation in censorship efforts on alternative platforms, particularly Elon Musk’s X. Similar attacks have already been ongoing with leftwing regimes in Europe and Brazil. Additionally, methods like the de-banking of opposing political interests, and various forms of legal persecution can be expected, based on the last two Democrat administrations. No matter the specifics, it is likely a Harris victory will see escalation from DC in trying to tighten their control over fraying political trust. The direction a Trump administration takes opens other possibilities. Trump has signaled increased willingness to marshal federal forces for matters such as immigration enforcement and political unrest. What is more interesting is whether or not a broader administrative strategy will be dedicated to pushing power away from the deep state and into the hands of state and local government, such as the campaign rhetoric over abolishing the Department of Education. Alternatively, there are some on the right who cling to the hope of transforming federal control into making the Washington bureaucracy an active tool for their own preferred brands of intervention. That strategy will only fuel the very problems that have created the political environment that has allowed for populist politics to thrive. In any case, the 2024 election will provide few solutions to the underlying pressures eroding American political norms. Regardless of the outcome, half the country will feel like they live under an occupational government. In doing so, the public is becoming more aware of the true nature of the state.

Iranian Regime Experts Highlight Tehran’s Strategic Impasse – OpE...	Tehran now faces a choice. Individuals, organizations, and governments often encounter complexities when making decisions; at times, they must choose between bad and worse. In the current context… continuing the war means further blows to Iran, potentially extending beyond military strikes to harm Iran’s political standing and create fundamental issues for us.' These statements are from an analysis by a government-affiliated analyst published in Ham-Mihan newspaper on November 2, portraying the regime’s impasse. For a long time, terms such as 'deadlock,' 'stalemate,' 'quagmire,' and 'no way forward, no way back' have been frequently used in state-affiliated newspapers and media to describe the current situation of the regime. On September 11, Shargh newspaper published an article titled 'We are Checkmated,' written by Mostafa Hashemi-Taba, a former presidential candidate close to regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei. He wrote: 'All signs, both external and internal, show that we are in a deadlock. This is not related to this government or that one, and everyone knows we are stuck, but they pretend otherwise, saying ‘hopefully, it’s just a minor issue’… This deadlock is not only because of U.S. sanctions and related European and East Asian measures; even if we woo the U.S., accept the FATF, and face no trouble with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the deadlock will still continue.' A significant point in the current situation is that regime experts and officials clearly link the regime’s impasse to the consequences of its warmongering policies. They write: 'The events of the past year have shown that Iran’s power strategy is weaker and more unstable than expected… When the prolonged conflict escalated into a full-scale confrontation and parts of Hezbollah were paralyzed, it became evident that Iran’s perception of its power was overestimated' (Ham-Mihan newspaper, October 1). In this situation, Khamenei has confronted the reality that the same warmongering policy he adopted a year ago to shield the regime from uprisings and the threat of social protests has now become so entrenched that it has transferred the crisis into the regime itself. It is worth noting that after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Massoud Ali, a cleric in Khamenei’s circle, said in a speech aired on state TV on October 24: 'After Ismail Haniyeh’s martyrdom, for two months we did not respond adequately. During those two months, the media and social networks were filled with questions! Commanders of the IRGC, General Bagheri, General Salami, General Hajizadeh were accused of political impotence. The term ‘political impotence’ was widespread, with questions like why are you hesitating, why don’t you retaliate? Severe mistrust had set in!' Another significant point from the admissions of regime theorists and officials is what a government analyst in Ham-Mihan newspaper on November 3 called an 'existential problem.' He emphasized that at the end of the warmongering policy, the regime is not choosing between 'bad and worse,' but 'worse and the worst.' He explained, 'It may go beyond military strikes, affecting Iran’s political standing and even leading to an existential problem for us.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQxR8ou-W2f-HkcjPNb2VG	2024-11-05T16:10:27-08:00	
Complex Systems And The US Election – OpEd	With the US presidential election mere days away, American citizens first and foremost – but also people in other countries, given what is at stake – need to reflect on the gravitas of the situation. It is no exaggeration to say that the outcome of this election will determine further developments, not only in the US but in the world at large. The choice facing American voters is reminiscent of Robert Frost’s famous poem: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. -- The Road Not Taken What is the upshot of Frost’s poetic reflection on choosing a path between two beckoning to him? That choices are sometimes difficult because one cannot, with certainty, tell where one’s chosen ‘path’ will lead to; not even if indications suggest that one of the options facing one has been decided on more often than the other one. In fact, most people are likely to select the one that more people appear to have chosen than the other. The final stanza of Frost’s poem suggests, however, that having decided on the less popular alternative turned out to have been the better choice; it ‘has made all the difference.’ Analogous to the poem, it appears that, if the ‘popularity’ of the alternatives facing the American people were to be determined by the sheer media space occupied by memes, discussions, articles, surveys, and reports favouring one candidate over the other, Kamala Harris would be the favoured contender. If media exposure were the deciding factor, and people – like Frost facing the two paths – had to judge which candidate seemed the more popular, Harris would be it. But, again judged by media popularity, choosing in favour of the ostensibly less attractive (because less conspicuous in the legacy media) candidate may indeed ‘make all the difference’ because, like the path ‘less travelled by,’ this person may have as-yet hidden (or deliberately covered-up) qualities or potential only discoverable if one chooses in his favour. This is partly the case because, as many people would agree, the prominence enjoyed by Harris in mainstream media space is misleading, to say the least. It does not factor in the comparative prominence of Donald Trump in alternative media, which, although largely invisible to those Americans still dependent on the likes of CNN, Fox, ABC, CBS, and so on, may actually outweigh that of Harris. Like Frost’s path ‘less travelled by,’ Trump may have qualities that belie the signs of its lesser ‘prominence’ in the space of media power (or powerful media). Moreover, if the sheer complexity of the situation is taken into account, it would appear that Donald Trump actually has a huge advantage over Kamala Harris. It may well be that he features ‘less prominently’ in mainstream media than Harris as far as the explicit statement of her preferability as future president is concerned, but when prominence is measured in terms of mainstream demonisation of Trump, his mainstream media presence probably exceeds hers. Why is this significant? In a word, because of the complexity involved. Consider this: Trump is one man, and on reflection, it would appear highly unlikely that one man could hold the destiny of the world in his hands, as it were, even if there are probably millions of his supporters who would claim just that. The point is that we have not yet learned to ‘cut off the head of the king,’ as Michel Foucaultfamously argued about power. As he demonstrated in his philosophical history of modes of punishment, Discipline and Punish (Vintage books, 1977), the modern age is characterised by a dispersion of power throughout society, with no centre of power, such as the king. Instead, we witness a network of ‘micro-centres’ of power, which are interconnected in a complex, non-teleological (non-purposive) manner. This contrasts with the pre-modern world of centralised hierarchies of power, emanating from the king or queen’s court, and connected with relatively few institutional positions occupied by individuals in service to the royal apex of power, such as the general of the king’s army. Hence, even if one might be tempted to perceive in someone like Donald Trump the equivalent of the pre-modern king, the comparison does not hold, which is easy to demonstrate by focusing on the complex network of constantly changing relations in which Trump (like every other person who wields power today) is inscribed. It is only because of such a person’s position in the network of forces that they can exercise power. We live as individuals whose lives cannot be isolated from these complexly evolving relationships, and what we are is determined, not by some essential centre of identity, but this ‘identity’ results from configuring and constantly reconfiguring relationships. As Keith Morrison reminds us (in Complexity Theory and the Philosophy of Education, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell 2008: 16): Change is ubiquitous, and stability and certainty are rare. Complexity theory is a theory of change, evolution, adaptation and development for survival. It breaks with simple successionist cause-and-effect models, linear predictability, and a reductionist approach to understanding phenomena, replacing them with organic, non-linear and holistic approaches respectively…in which relations within interconnected networks are the order of the day… By ‘complexity’ one should not only understand something numerical, such as a world with a total population of about 8 billion people, although this adds to its complexity. Rather, the total (and constantly changing) number of living beings in the world (including humans) are all interconnected in almost incomprehensibly complex, systemic ways, including economically and biologically, and these are interconnected, in turn, with inorganic natural elements such as air, soil, and water. The consequences of complex interconnections amount to continuing changes taking place all the time, as different elements and actors continually affect one another. For example, human industrial-economic activities affect the quality and composition of the soil, water, and air on the planet, which affect all living beings in turn, in an ongoing reciprocal process. In total, all these mutually connected subsets of elements and living entities comprise the planetary ecosystem, which is an overarching, complex system. What does this have to do with Donald Trump as candidate in the imminent US presidential election? To answer this question one has to remember that what makes complex systems so special is not only that they normally comprise a large number of components, but that they are ‘open’ in a double sense: they are open to the ‘influence’ of their environment, but in addition, every one of their constituent parts is open to changes in the system; that is, it is affected by such changes (even if no component has access to the behaviour of the system as a whole). So, for example, a social-ecological subsystem such as a family is embedded in broader subsystems such as schools, urban, suburban, or rural areas, which are (in turn) situated in certain socioeconomic contexts and specific kinds of culture. An individual in a family will unavoidably be affected by all the differences and changes in the broader subsystems in which they live. Urie Bronfenbrenner’s well-known ecological theory for human development (so-called ‘develecology’), which focuses on the kind of relations involved in social systems and subsystems like the ones referred to above, enables one to comprehend the intricate interrelations involved. Bronfenbrenner’s theory shows how everything in (and ‘surrounding’) an individual’s life codetermines his or her relative well-being in complex ways. The complexity of a person’s insertedness in these overlapping subsystems can be gauged from Shelton’s succinct account of Bronfenbrenner’s schema for understanding it (Shelton, L.G., The Bronfenbrenner Primer – A Guide to Develecology, New York: Routledge, 2019: 10): Bronfenbrenner’s scheme is a system of concepts: the person exists in a system of relationships, roles, activities, and settings, all interconnected. Individual development takes place as the developing person ages, constructs an understanding of his or her experience, and learns to act effectively within the system in which she or he is participating. Simultaneously, the development of the person changes the system. The system changes because as a person develops, his or her actions change, and other people in the system therefore respond differently to the developing person. At the same time, the settings the person participates in are interrelated with each other and with other settings. As well, the settings are part of the culture in which the whole system of settings and the roles, relationships, and activities within them are embedded. It is not difficult to grasp the concept of the virtually untraceable, constantly changing and increasing, number of interactions (and their effects) among people and settings that this involves. Bronfenbrenner’s account of complex social conditions implies that every individual action in a social context has an effect on the actions of others, which, in turn, changes the social context, and the latter, again, influences the future actions of people involved. In the case of Donald Trump it is no different. I wrote earlier about the manner in which mainstream media demonise Trump, and suggested that this enhances his media presence, and therefore his conspicuousness in America’s social and political space. Furthermore, given the unavoidably complex relations involved, such negative portrayals of Trump are not necessarily bad for the latter. Take President Biden’s recent remark that Trump supporters are ‘garbage.’ Fed into the complex web of communication, and interpersonal relations in the US, one might expect that this would only serve to reinforce the polarisation that already exists in the American political field. But it is not that simple: sure, it would make dyed-in-the-wool Democrats snigger with delight, and confirmed Trump supporters foam at the mouth, but – as might have been expected – when Kamala Harris responded to Biden’s thoughtless remark by saying that she would ‘strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,’ another twist was registered in the grid of consequential linguistic utterances – one that might cause some Democrats to feel a twinge of shame at Joe Biden’s folly, and correspondingly, warm to Kamala Harris’s show of political ‘decency,’ as well as to Donald Trump as a target of such an unfair comment. It is not beyond the realm of the possible that some people might even change political allegiance, prompted by Biden’s comment, given that, in an already complex set of interrelations, few things are as complex as the human psyche. This is why human beings are not conclusively predictable. With great perspicacity, Brent Hamacheck casts more light on the reasons for Trump’s candidacy for the presidency being so complex – something that some would claim makes it impossible to predict the outcome of the election, but others (including myself) would understand as being in Trump’s favour. Hamacheck comments on ‘the three reasons people hate Trump,’ and divides Trump haters into three groups – Silly, Subconscious, and Sinister – the first two of which, he claims, are susceptible to being rationally persuaded about the error of their feelings, while the last group should be regarded with justified suspicion and disapproval. The ‘sillies’ hate Trump because of his brash, sometimes vulgar personality, which, Hamacheck avers, has nothing to do with his capacity to govern well and formulate sensible policies. This is why they could be convinced that they should change their attitude towards Trump as potential president. Those who hate the ‘orange man’ at a subliminal level, on the other hand, do so – according to Hamacheck – because of the inner conflict he causes in them through his unapologetic love for America. The conflict, explains Hamacheck, obtains between guilt (for living in a prosperous country like America), shame (brought about by Trump telling them America is great), and altruism (linked to the virtue of self-sacrifice, which is undermined by Trump advocating precisely the opposite). Both of these groups can, according to Hamacheck, be cured of their redundant hatred for Trump. In fact, there are already people like this who have stated their intention of voting for the Republican. The last group – the ‘sinisters’ – however, are not conflicted over what Trump represents, but are ‘vehemently opposed to it,’ says Hamacheck. They are the globalists for whom the valorisation of a country’s unique spirit and value is totally anathema because they want to dissolve all national boundaries and dilute all sense of national identity, both of which stand in the way of their globalist ambitions. It should be clear why Hamacheck’s analysis is pertinent to what I have written above about complexity. It reveals just how difficult it is to predict with certainty where and how the sentiments of individuals concerning a prominent personality like Trump would take them when it comes to voting.

All That Glitters May Not Be Gold For Japan’s Semiconductor Reviv...	By Joseph Negrine In the new age of industrial policy, advanced economies are driving public–private partnerships and abandoning notions of laissez-faire competition. As of September 2024, the Japanese government has spent over US$25 billion on subsidising semiconductors, the ‘new oil’ integral to civilian and military technologies. While the potential economic gains from Japan’s semiconductor manufacturing revival are colossal, Japan must not overlook the potential negative economic and security externalities. Semiconductor dominance is a crucial aspect of geopolitical and economic superiority in the US–China ‘technological cold war’. Global disruptions like the Russia–Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the need for resilient supply chains. In 2021, chip shortages that increased semiconductor lead times cost the global automotive industry over US$200 million. The United States is attempting to stifle China’s semiconductor industry through coordinated export controls with the Netherlands and Japan. Both countries are crucial because they specialise in producing lithography equipment and associated materials that are chokepoints in China’s chip supply chain. Japan, which dominated semiconductor markets in the 1980s, seeks to regain strategic autonomy. Its subsidies between 2021–23 accounted for 0.71 per cent of GDP — a higher proportion than all other countries. The potential gains, much like the subsidies, are not insubstantial. The semiconductor market is projected to be worth US$1 trillion by 2030. Japan can capture significant parts of industry revenue by providing superior products. A successful semiconductor strategy could be very good for Japan. Japan’s Economic Security Promotion Act, passed in May 2022, recognised a stable semiconductor supply and domestic industry as urgent national tasks. This is being achieved by coordinated onshoring and offshoring efforts that promote public–private collaboration. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Domestic Investment Promotion Project subsidises companies to domestically relocate, while its Overseas Supply Chain Diversification Project is expanding production facilities across Southeast Asia. But the economic gains from subsidising semiconductors are far from a done deal. Successful industrial policy at the frontier, where Japan’s Rapidus intends to produce, is fundamentally different to the historic use of industrial policy for ‘catch-up growth’ in developing countries. Subsidies that fail to ignite breakthrough technologies sacrifice government resources without providing a long-term benefit. Industrial policy is economically justifiable where interventions in international oligopolies lead competitors to retrench production. But Japan’s competitors show no signs of scaling back their semiconductor ambitions at the frontier. Despite having the largest semiconductor subsidy to GDP ratio, Japan’s investments pale in comparison to the US$52.7 billion in subsidies over five years under the 2022 US CHIPS and Science Act. China’s state-led semiconductor subsidies, while hard to calculate due to a lack of public data, are estimated to exceed US$150 billion. A compounding issue is that, in a constantly evolving environment, companies may demand further government support to maintain technological leadership. Given its dreams of fiscal consolidation, Japan must clarify whether its subsidies will be timely and temporary in this dynamic area. Game theory indicates that retaliatory policies that further distort economic efficiencies lead to worse collective outcomes. International Monetary Fund analysis points to a ‘tit-for-tat dynamic’ in the new era of industrial policies. Whether a subsidy arms race will avoid a ‘race to the bottom’ then becomes a question of whether these industrial policies have positive cross-border effects. The OECD suggests that tit-for-tat policies could magnify negative international spillovers and undermine the rules-based trading system. Due to the billions of dollars being invested into semiconductor manufacturing, major countries are at risk of a deepening talent shortage. Though Japan’s labour markets are beginning to mobilise, its semiconductor strategy will be buffeted by an expected shortage of 40,000 semiconductor engineers. Whether the United States can successfully disable China’s advances in AI may be neither possible nor desirable for Japan. Even with significant cooperation, there are criticisms that these efforts ‘can only slow China, not stop it’. Attempts to alienate China may intensify its commitment to developing semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, as it leads to stronger commercial partnerships within China. It is also doubtful that Japan desires to stop China’s AI developments. The government has emphasised the importance of diversifying supply chains beyond China. But this does not mean a complete decoupling from the nation’s largest trading partner and the world’s largest semiconductor consumer. In May 2024, then Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida made a joint declaration with China and South Korea at the Ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting, reaffirming a commitment to ‘strengthening supply chain cooperation and avoiding supply chain disruption’. Japan’s position in the US–China conflict is somewhat paradoxical. Its incoherent engagement with China is also seen in discussions concerning regional economic integration. The relative positions of the three nations in this economic security dilemma may fluctuate amid the election build-up in Japan in late October 2024 and the United States in November 2024. Japan’s semiconductor strategy is just one part of an interdependent system. Beyond questions of economic efficiency, the subsidies raise concerns about backsliding free markets, US–China tensions and regional stability. In this setting of considerable uncertainty, Japan must take a serious look before it leaps into further investments in its semiconductor revival.

Thailand: Ruling Party Has Lost Credibility After Reneging On Lès...	By Nontarat Phaicharoen Thailand’s ruling Pheu Thai Party has lost its trust with citizens by breaking with an electoral promise of including royal defamation cases in a proposed amnesty bill for political prisoners, analysts said. In late October, the party reversed course by announcing it would now exclude so-called lèse-majesté cases in its version of the bill. During the 2023 campaign, Pheu Thai, then a party in the opposition, had pledged that it would appeal to the courts to show leniency in the cases of people imprisoned for or charged under the draconian royal insult law, saying its use had been politicized. Pheu Thai’s decision to exclude such cases in the proposed amnesty legislation shows the party’s true character, political analyst Olarn Thinbangtiao told BenarNews. 'Pheu Thai has now gone bankrupt in terms of credibility,' said Olarn, a political science associate professor at Burapha University. 'They have repeatedly broken their promises, exposing that their democratic ideals and justice are merely fictional narratives.' For instance, Pheu Thai reneged on its promise to join forces with the now-disbanded Move Forward Party to form the government. The lèse-majesté law, framed under Article 112 of the country’s criminal code, carries a maximum jail term of 15 years for each conviction. At least 27 people are currently imprisoned under the lèse-majesté law, according to the group, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. And 274 people face 307 royal defamation cases from 2020 until September this year. Pheu Thai probably took a lesson from the Move Forward Party, which was disbanded in August for 10 years for promising to abolish the royal defamation law, said Sunai Phasuk, a Thai advisor to Human Rights Watch. Pheu Thai itself faces the specter of disbandment, with the election commission announcing on Oct. 21 that the party was being investigated for an alleged political violation. 'Pheu Thai has chosen to break its promises, possibly calculating that this reduces political risk, especially after seeing the Move Forward Party dissolved for proposing Article 112 reforms,' Sunai told BenarNews. View from the street Among Thai citizens, there appears to be an age divide on how Pheu Thai’s turnaround on the amnesty bill is being viewed. Peerawat Veeraviriyapitak, a student in Bangkok, said that the party had gone back on its promise. 'Right now, it seems like Pheu Thai is going back on what they previously said,' Peerawat told BenarNews. 'If some people didn’t actually commit a crime, they should be granted amnesty too.' But retiree Teerasak Kambannarak agreed with Pheu Thai’s decision. 'Article 112 should not be included in the amnesty bill, as the monarchy is an institution we should protect and uphold,' Teerasak told BenarNews. While campaigning before last year’s general election, Pheu Thai said that Article 112 cases ought to be included in an Amnesty Act. Then-party leader and now-Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra had said that royal defamation cases were problematic because anyone could file charges – a fact that has allowed the law to be used as a political weapon. Paetongtarn’s father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, also faces Article 112 charges. He was charged in May for comments about the monarchy he made during a 2015 interview in South Korea. Parliament is considering four amnesty bill drafts, which include pardoning actions seen as provoking periods of political unrest in the Southeast Asian nation since 2006. All four target politically motivated offenses. These include violations of articles 114, 116, 117 and 118. They are related to sedition, actions aimed at changing laws, incitement to strike for political change and activities against national symbols. Two of the four drafts – one by the main opposition party People’s Party (formerly known as Move Forward) and a public initiative – called for the draft law to include Article 112 cases. Parliament is set to review the amnesty bills next month. Historical precedent Article 112 has fundamentally become political, said Kitpatchara Somanawat, an assistant professor at Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Law. 'Over the past 5-10 years, questions have arisen about the monarchy’s political involvement,' Kitpatchara told BenarNews. 'Academic works have suggested connections, leading some to view political expression about the monarchy as an active citizen’s duty. Therefore, Article 112 violations are inherently political crimes, not ordinary ones.' Thailand has a historical precedent for such an amnesty measure. In 1978, the government granted amnesty to those arrested after the October 1976 protests in which 40 people were killed and 3,000 others thrown behind bars. Ironically, several of those former students given amnesty now hold positions in Paetongtarn’s government. They include Phumtham Wechayachai, deputy prime minister; Prommin Lertsuridej, the prime minister’s secretary-general and Pheu Thai MPs Adisorn Piengkes and Chaturon Chaisang. Thailand’s political divisions will never end if the government decides to exclude Article 112 cases under the proposed amnesty law, political analyst Olarn of Burapha University warned. 'Pheu Thai’s decision may affect future democratic discourse and reform efforts in Thailand,' he said. 'These political issues will remain dormant until the next development because we’re just hiding problems under the carpet.' Ruj Chuenban in Bangkok and Wanna Tamthong in Chiang Mai contributed to this story.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc1Olt81YM2ZlnDZfY58bKN	2024-11-05T15:47:44-08:00	
Decoding Africa’s Interest In BRICS – Analysis	By Samir Bhattacharya From 22 to 24 October, Russia hosted the 16th annual BRICS Summit in Kazan under the theme 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.' Attended by 36 country leaders along with the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, the event’s success underscored a growing interest in multilateralism led by Global South. This success is also evident in the increasing number of developing countries from Africa queuing up to join the group. So far, South Africa has been the only African member of BRICS. However, following the latest expansion in 2023, Egypt and Ethiopia have participated as members for the first time in the recent BRICS summit. During the summit, the BRICS alliance officially announced the addition of 13 new nations as partner countries, including three African nations: Algeria, Nigeria, and Uganda. The continent’s increasing interest in joining BRICS underscores the emergence of new global powers and multipolar world order, creating significant opportunities for African nations to lessen their traditional reliance on Western powers while forging stronger alliances with emerging economies. This shift also allows African countries to redefine their global engagement. As the 2024 BRICS summit concludes, this article examines the motivations that African states have to join the organisation. Economic implications: BRICS as Africa’s economic ally Recognising their current low levels of development, African leaders have been strengthening ties with external powers while expressing their frustrations with economic exploitation by their traditional partner countries, stringent conditions set by Western-led financial institutions, and overall Western dominance in the global order. Instead of depending solely on lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, many African nations have started prioritising economic cooperation with BRICS. For instance, several Junta-led governments in Africa, who came to power unconstitutionally by coup, are banned from accessing the IMF and the World Bank. New financial alternatives such as the New Development Bank (NDB) present a viable alternative for these countries to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and lessen their vicious burden of debt and sanctions. While African states are working to create alternative economic and governance structures to challenge the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and the IMF still have a significant presence in Africa. For instance, BRICS members Egypt and Ethiopia rely on IMF funding. Egypt recently secured a US$8 billion bailout amid economic challenges, and Ethiopia has received a US$3.4 billion extended credit facility (ECF),to help with financial pressures. This indicates that moving away from dollar reliance and existing financial institutions remains a distant goal. Nevertheless, African nations are optimistic about securing concessionary loans and funding through the BRICS NDB. The NDB aims to strengthen economic partnerships within BRICS Plus and improve access to diverse markets, enhancing trade and investment opportunities in emerging economies. At its ninth annual board meeting in South Africa from 29-31 August 2024, the NDB emphasised its commitment to a more inclusive and flexible financing approach better aligned with the long-term development goals of BRICS members and other developing countries. Additionally, BRICS’ initiatives to introduce new financial payment systems that work towards de-dollarisation are garnering admiration from many developing countries in the Global South. While having a common currency anytime soon seems premature, countries like India and China have started promoting trading in local currencies. This will help Africa dodge the uncertainties related to dollar fluctuations, giving them more choices and unlocking their full potential. BRICS and Africa's security landscape Although African countries pursue a multi-alignment strategy, engaging with both the US and other major powers has inherent challenges. With shifting geopolitical dynamics, the African Union (AU) and other individual African countries seek to realign with BRICS to help tackle peace and security challenges. BRICS’ support for the AU in promoting the peace process in South Sudan and for regional organisations like the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in counteracting the security threats faced by the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mozambique emphasises BRICS’ endorsement of a collective African approach to shared challenges. This endorsement of homegrown solutions that highlight Africa’s role in promoting regional stability may result in increased resources for the continent. Furthermore, BRICS’ backing for African peace initiatives could foster greater collaboration among BRICS nations, ultimately providing Africa with enhanced resources for peacebuilding and security. BRICS and Africa’s quest for leadership Africa seeks a new brand of leadership, requiring statesmen who understand the fundamentals for future global collaboration, particularly in economic matters. Many African countries aim to emulate the leadership of India, China, and other BRICS members as champions for the Global South who promote political equality, respect for sovereignty, and fairness in cooperation. However, Ethiopia and Egypt’s status as rival countries has raised concerns about internal cohesion among African members of BRICS. This was evident when BRICS foreign ministers abruptly ended a meeting in New York on 26 September 2024, due to disputes between Egypt and Ethiopia over a UN Security Council reform. BRICS and Africa’s Grain Exchange Amid climate change, fragmented markets, and food insecurity, the BRICS Grain Exchange could be a game changer for much-required agricultural investment in Africa. Creating a grain exchange could revolutionise Africa’s agricultural landscape by stabilising grain prices. With BRICS facilitating a more structured market, price volatility for producers and consumers would be significantly reduced. A BRICS-backed exchange market would help Africa diversify its export portfolio, boosting foreign exchange earnings. The way forward For Africa, BRICS underscores a significant opportunity to enhance its role in global governance and development. The BRICS Youth Summit and the establishment of a BRICS Youth Council present crucial avenues for African youth engagement. The BRICS project of inter-parliamentary cooperation provides a platform for African countries to connect with emerging economies on issues of governance, political stability, and policymaking. This exchange of ideas has the potential to ultimately strengthen Africa’s political institutions and promote improved governance practices. However, before joining BRICS, African countries must address their internal instability and set their policy priorities. In parallel, the current group members should focus on reviewing their foundational instruments rather than rushing to expand. Undoubtedly, the diverging political, economic, and cultural interests among its members would hinder the group from reaching its objectives. Clearly, despite the growing interest in BRICS, practical challenges exist. The way AU collectively addresses these challenges will ultimately determine its success.

Moscow Likely To Trigger Outrage If It Forces Protesters To Fight...	Moscow has used a variety of measures to fill the ever-depleting ranks of its army in Ukraine to avoid the declaration of a new mobilization (see EDM, July 30, August 7, October 10). Many in Russia fear that a new mobilization could spark massive protests and even threaten the current regime, given what happened after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization in September 2022. These measures range from paying enormous bonuses to pardoning violent prisoners and even releasing those charged but not yet convicted of crimes (see EDM, September 18, 2023; Verstka, July 24). Now, it appears set to take another step in this direction by forcing protesters into the Russian military, regardless of the issues animating their demonstrations. The Kremlin has compelling reasons to send protesters to fight. While protests against the war have been small and scattered, protests regarding other issues have been growing despite the rising tide of repression, especially in non-Russian republics. The risks, however, of taking such a step are significant, including a dramatic increase in anti-war attitudes and larger and more impassioned demonstrations. Most importantly for the Kremlin, it could also lead to a decline in support for Putin himself, potentially prompting a move against him and his regime (see EDM, March 8, 2021, April 13, 2023, July 30;TRTRussian, February 10). The first indication that the Kremlin may soon draft protesters comes from Dagestan, one of the poorest, most Islamic, and most restive regions in the Russian Federation. Dagestan, however, also has the potential to be the region where such a change in policy is most likely. The North Caucasian republic was the site of some of the most dramatic protests against Putin’s partial mobilization two years ago and has often been considered a bellwether for policies Moscow frequently goes on to extend to the Russian Federation as a whole (Vedomosti; RBC, February 8, 2018; see EDM, September 29, 2022). Recently, a group of Dagestani veterans of Putin’s war in Ukraine called on the republic’s leadership to send those protesting land transfers to veterans to fight in Ukraine (Kavkaz Realii, November 4). This issue could easily intertwine with complaints about the war, especially where regional leaders have been forced to use more forceful means to meet the state-imposed recruitment quotas because they lack the funds to pay the bonuses other, better-off regions can afford (Sibir Realii, April 27; Window on Eurasia, April 29). As the war continues, this fundamental reality is likely to intensify in Dagestan and spread to other poorer republics and predominantly non-ethnic Russian regions as well—precisely the places where Putin has drawn for the soldiers to fight in Ukraine (Window On Eurasia, September 29, 2022). Despite this, two other issues Dagestan faces attract more attention and obscure this reality even as they exacerbate it. These include the growing land shortages due to the republic’s burgeoning population and unresolved conflicts arising from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s deportation of nationalities and their return. Both of these problems are behind the call by Dagestani and ethnic Avar veterans of Putin’s war in Ukraine for the impressment of ethnic Chechens resisting the transfer of land to said Avars. The Chechens are opposed to this because they believe—with support from Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov—that the territory is theirs and should become the nucleus of a restored Chechen district in Dagestan or even transferred en bloc from Dagestan to Chechnya. (On this complicated history and its current manifestations, see EDM, February 27, 2020; Window on Eurasia, March 8, March 13). The Avar veterans are outraged by this Chechen resistance, which has taken the form of challenges to the deeds given to the Avar veterans last summer and the removal of border markers between the two republics. The former forced the Dagestani authorities in Makhachkala to meet with the Avars at the end of October to reassure the veterans that their rights will be respected (RIA Dagaestan, August 6; Administration of the Municipality of Kazbekovsky Region, October 31). The ethnic Chechens in Dagestan, for their part, show no signs of backing down and insist that the land transfers to the Avar veterans are a violation of Makhachkala’s program to restore the Chechen Aukh district in Dagestan by 2025, claiming that they will continue to engage in protests against any moves by the Avars or anyone else that threatens that goal (Kavkaz Realii, March 4; VK.com/che_fighters, August 15; Window on Eurasia, October 20). The Avars, however, insist that the land Moscow and Makhachkala have given them is beyond the borders of the promised Chechen district (Kavkaz Realii, April 27). Neither the Chechens in Dagestan nor the Chechens in Grozny accept this, and more protests are likely in the coming weeks and months. Given Moscow’s concerns about an explosion in the most Islamic republic of the Russian Federation, as well as about Chechnya’s increasing support for ethnic Chechens in Dagestan, the Kremlin has been drawn into the disagreement. Most commentators have focused on the ethnic and religious aspects of the situation, but as important as these are, Moscow is more focused on the needs of the army for Putin’s war in Ukraine. Any question of dragooning protesters into the Russian army, even from a single republic, is likely to cast a far larger shadow in the short term. Forcing protesters in Dagestan to serve in the army will raise the specter that something similar will soon happen elsewhere, intimidating many and outraging others, creating new problems for Moscow. Kremlin officials understand that, but they also know that if Moscow fails to compel demonstrators to serve, it will not be able to maintain, let alone grow, the size of its military force in Ukraine. Putin certainly believes that he can keep things quiet by increasing repression to focus on his immediate goal. That likely means he will give the green light to drafting protesters first in Dagestan and then elsewhere. This may be a good bet in the short term, but it looks to be a losing one in the longer term. Consequently, what appears to be on the verge of taking place in Dagestan now could soon cast a large, dark, and fateful shadow on the Putin regime.

Iran Sentences 3 To Death Over Assassination Of Nuclear Scientist	(RFE/RL) -- Iran's judiciary says three people have been sentenced to death by a lower court over the killing in 2020 of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in what Tehran says was an Israeli-orchestrated operation. 'The sentencing of these three people was carried out in the Revolutionary Court of Urmia, and they were sentenced to death in the initial stage, and the case is currently in the appeal stage,' Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for Iran's judiciary, said at a news conference in Tehran.Urmia is a town In Iran's northwestern province of West Azerbaijan close to the border with Turkey.The sentencing of the three, who have not been named, comes at a time of rising tensions between Iran and Israel amid the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel has been blamed for the assassination of at least four other Iranian nuclear scientists suspected of working on Tehran's military nuclear program. Fakhrizadeh, known as the father of the Islamic republic's nuclear program, had been under U.S. sanctions for his role in Iran's nuclear research and Israel accused him in 2018 of being the architect of Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.'After some investigations, three out of eight people arrested in West Azerbaijan province were accused of spying for the occupying regime of Israel,' Jahangir said, adding that the case is now in the 'appeal stage.'The three were also accused of bringing unspecified equipment from abroad into Iran for the attack 'under the guise of smuggling alcoholic drinks.'Jahangir said the case against the other defendants is still ongoing.Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in a brazen ambush of his vehicle in the town of Absard, near Tehran on November 27, 2020, which Iran at the time blamed on Israel while suggesting the United States also had an indirect or direct role.The circumstances of the attack remain unclear. Initial reports immediately after the killing suggested Fakhrizadeh was targeted by a truckful of explosives, several gunmen, and a suicide attacker.Just days later, the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) offered a different account, saying a machine gun equipped with a 'satellite-controlled smart system' that employed 'artificial intelligence' was used in the pinpointed killing of the scientist that left his wife, who was traveling with him, unharmed. Israel has not commented on Fakhrizadeh's killing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc1Olt81YM2ZidY27SclBTg	2024-11-05T15:39:18-08:00	
Cambodia: Former Adviser To Hun Sen Jailed Following Bribery Conf...	A former adviser to Senate President Hun Sen who was accused last month of soliciting bribes has been arrested after confessing in a six-minute video that he defrauded millions of dollars from people who sought favors and government positions. Ly Sameth said in the video, which was posted on Hun Sen’s Facebook page on Monday, that he had 'made the most serious mistake that affects the honor and dignity' of Hun Sen, who served as prime minister for more than three decades before stepping down last year. Hun Sen retains power as Senate president and as head of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party, or CPP. As party president, Hun Sen appointed Ly Sameth as his personal adviser on Feb. 22, 2022. 'Yes, I used the Samdech’s name to get other people’s money,' an emotional Ly Sameth said in the clip, using an honorific to refer to Hun Sen. 'This is true and this is not the first time, and not only that, I even said that all the money was handed over to Samdech.' Authorities arrested Ly Sameth in Sihanoukville on Monday. A detention order from the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s investigating judge described him as 'a businessman with no education or illiteracy.' He was transferred to Prey Sar prison on the outskirts of Phnom Penh on Tuesday. Hun Sen wrote on Facebook last month that Ly Sameth had defrauded several Cambodians over the last two years, including one incident in which US$10 million was paid. That post was apparently prompted by a video message he received from Kan Sok Kay, the recently appointed governor of Kandal province’s Lvea Em district, which is located across the Mekong River from Phnom Penh. Kan Sok Kay said he gave US$30,000 to Ly Sameth to get the appointment, according to Hun Sen. 'I have signed, appointed and promoted tens of thousands of civil servants and members of the Armed Forces,' Hun Sen wrote. 'I never accepted intervention from anyone, no matter what request or bribe.' Ly Sameth’s assets should be frozen, and Phnom Penh court officials should issue an order to return money he accepted from people, Hun Sen wrote at the time. He assigned his lawyer, Ky Tech, to investigate the various complaints. Other apology videos RFA was unable to reach National Police Commissioner Sar Thet and Phnom Penh Municipal Court spokesman Ey Rin to ask about the timing of Ly Sameth’s arrest. Ly Sameth’s confession video, which was posted before his arrest, was similar to various public apologies and in-person appeals for forgiveness made to Hun Sen in recent years. Last month, a prominent overseas opposition activist announced in a video that he was switching his allegiance to the CPP, two months after his brother was arrested on incitement charges while trying to flee the country. Journalist Mech Dara also posted an apology video last month, several weeks after he was jailed and charged with incitement related to social media posts he made in September. Lawyer Kong Sam Onn, who has represented defendants in many high-profile criminal cases, told Radio Free Asia that authorities should further investigate to see who else was involved in the bribery solicitations. 'The person who bribes, and the person who takes the bribe, are both equally guilty and have the same penalty under Criminal Code and Anti-Corruption Law,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWez1Vr8dDjXG569GrtU_Ua2	2024-11-05T15:36:15-08:00	
Officials: Bomb Threats Against US Voting Locations Coming From R...	By Jeff Seldin A series of Election Day bomb threats sent to polling locations across the United States appears to be coming from Russia, according to new assessments from federal and state officials. The initial bomb threats early Tuesday put a temporary stop to voting at some locations in parts of the southeastern state of Georgia. State officials quickly determined the threats were not credible. 'We identified the source, and it was from Russia,' Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters. 'They're up to mischief, and it seems they don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election,' Raffensperger said. 'They think if they can get us to fight amongst ourselves, they can count that as a victory.' Only the effort to disrupt the U.S. election appears to be much broader. The FBI Tuesday said it is 'aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states,' adding that many of the threats 'appear to originate from Russian email domains.' A U.S. official confirmed to VOA that in addition to Georgia, bomb threats were sent to polling locations in the Midwestern swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin. 'None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,' the FBI said. 'We will continue to work closely with our state and local law enforcement partners to respond to any threats to our elections and to protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote.' The suspected Russian ploy builds on other last-minute attempts to disrupt the U.S. election. Earlier Tuesday, as many U.S. voters prepared to cast their ballots, the FBI warned voters of at least two efforts to use the bureau's name and likeness to promote false narratives. In one case, FBI officials pointed to faked news clips urging Americans to 'vote remotely' because of the increased threats of a terror attack. In the other, the FBI cautioned that social media accounts were spreading video of a fabricated news release about five prisons across the country involved in a vote-rigging scheme. The bureau said both videos are 'not authentic.' The FBI did not say who was responsible for creating the videos, which began to circulate just three days after two other fraudulent videos purporting to be from the FBI began circulating on social media. The earlier videos falsely stated the bureau had apprehended three linked groups for ballot fraud and made false claims about the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. In recent days, U.S. intelligence officials have assigned responsibility for other videos, not referencing the FBI but claiming to show voting irregularities to Russian influence actors. Russia has denied any involvement. The latest incidents are part of what some U.S. officials have described as a 'firehose of disinformation' and follow a warning from U.S. intelligence agencies late Monday that Russia, and to a lesser extent Iran, were likely to intensify their influence operations on Election Day and in the days and weeks that follow. 'Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences,' according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close,' the CISA statement said. 'These efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials.' But CISA, which helps oversee the security of U.S. election infrastructure, said Tuesday the election was running as smoothly as could be expected. 'At this point, we are not currently tracking any national level significant incidents impacting security of our election infrastructure,' CISA Senior Adviser Cait Conley said during a briefing with reporters. Conley said earlier that CISA has been tracking some disruptions related to weather and other issues such as equipment failures, describing them as 'really routine and, honestly, expected types of disruptions.' CISA officials have warned that informational websites and infrastructure related to the election could be targeted by ransomware or distributed denial-of-service attacks. But they have emphasized that while inconvenient, such attacks would have little impact on the ability of Americans to cast ballots, since none of the country's election systems are connected to the internet and because 97% of voting precincts have paper backups. Still, there are concerns U.S. adversaries may try to seize upon any disruptions to incite panic and even violence. 'We know our foreign adversaries see this window of time, both Election Day and the days immediately following, as an opportunity to stoke further division and undermine American confidence in our democratic institutions,' Conley said. 'And that is regardless of who wins.' Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and advocacy organization that has election observers stationed across the country, said Monday there has been tension at some polling places. 'We're seeing instances of folks being yelled out at the polls,' Suzanne Almeida, the group's director of state operations, said during a call with reporters.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWez1Vr8dDjXGy8uCzcBC_y3	2024-11-05T15:34:22-08:00	
2024 Presidential Election In The US And Its Implication For Myan...	We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.' As quoted by Thomas Jefferson, U.S. citizens are participating in a historic turnout in the 60th quadrennial presidential election to choose between two contrasting candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. This significant election highlights stark policy differences that could impact both domestic and foreign affairs. While the economy is the top issue among voters, a large majority (69%) cite at least five of the ten issues surveyed by the Pew Research Center as very important to their vote. Among Trump supporters, the leading issues are the economy (93%), immigration (82%), violent crime (76%), foreign policy (74%), and healthcare (55%). For Harris supporters, issues such as healthcare (76%), Supreme Court appointments (73%), the economy (68%), abortion (67%), and foreign policy (54%) are of top importance. While current foreign policy has focused heavily on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East, and China, strategic competition with China—now one of the world’s two largest economies, alongside the United States—will be one of the most consequential foreign policy challenges confronting the next presidential administration. It will face an increasingly contentious relationship with Beijing on both trade and security issues. Focusing solely on Taiwan and overlooking Myanmar would be a missed opportunity in crafting a strategic policy on China. Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are essential components in diverse industrial and high-tech applications. China, the world’s largest producer of REEs, accounts for 70% of global annual mine production, while the United States (14%), Australia (6%), Myanmar (4%), and Thailand (2%) make up the rest. China sourced 72% of the U.S.'s rare earth imports in 2022, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Ironically, China imports REEs from Myanmar, with a 52.1% year-over-year increase in imports, reaching the highest level in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence's Global Trade Analytics Suite. A shortage of REEs would be considered a significant national security threat for the United States, which heavily relies on imports, primarily from China. This dependence could be used as leverage to disrupt vital military and technological applications, such as advanced weaponry, aircraft, and renewable energy systems—essentially creating a potential chokepoint for U.S. national security. On February 1, 2021, Min Aung Hlaing and the military ousted the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government in a coup. The coup was met with strong resistance through widespread, peaceful demonstrations and the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM). The brutal crackdown by the military led to the formation of armed resistance across the country, marking the beginning of a violent new chapter known as the Spring Revolution. This involved genuine nationwide resistance by all ethnic groups, brought together into a unified front with aligned political objectives and military cooperation. The Myanmar crisis was the first foreign policy challenge for the Biden administration. The U.S. immediately condemned the coup and the violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations, as well as the atrocities committed by the military. However, the administration became passive in dealing with the crisis. Unlike the United States, which has been largely sidelined, China has played an important role as the most influential foreign actor in Myanmar. China is the largest investor in Myanmar, which is also strategically important for China’s access to the Indian Ocean, providing a critical alternative route from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca. Additionally, the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor is a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative. China seeks to use its influence in Myanmar to encourage a stable environment that can boost Chinese investments and secure perpetual stability along its 1,250-mile border. Despite Beijing’s preference for state-centric diplomacy, China initially conducted backdoor diplomacy through various groups and special envoys, as long as U.S. involvement remained minimal. As Myanmar’s junta loses its grip on power, China still seeks to maximize its influence with all parties in the civil war. However, China opposes the collapse of the junta. China is also concerned about the rise of rebel groups that have built an alliance with the National Unity Government, which Beijing fears could be influenced by the West due to their engagement in humanitarian assistance and advocacy for democracy. The passage of the Burma Act in December 2022, which provides a framework for U.S. engagement and support for democracy in Myanmar, has further complicated China's position. Shortly after the collapse of the Northeast military command center in Lashio, China became more proactive, shifting its posture by pressuring rebel forces for a ceasefire, blocking imports, and tightening border controls. Myanmar remains a diplomatic and security headache for China: the same situation as before the coup, where different actors will listen to China only to an extent and act according to their own interests, sometimes surprising China. The ongoing civil conflict and the rise of anti-junta forces have complicated China’s approach. Additionally, Beijing is uncomfortable with the junta’s close military ties to Russia. The next U.S. administration, regardless of which candidate wins, will face several critical considerations. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces could serve as a counterbalance to China’s regional dominance. If Kamala Harris wins, the Harris administration should address the shortcomings of the current administration’s symbolic support, which has inadvertently led to paradoxical effects, particularly regarding China’s influence over the resistance forces fighting against the military dictatorship—the perpetrators of regional instability. If Donald Trump prevails, the national security-focused Trump administration must adopt a fresh outlook on Myanmar, which might seem like an unimportant spot in Southeast Asia, but is, in fact, a potential source of essential resources for national security, particularly rare earth elements. The Myanmar situation presents an opportunity for the next U.S. administration to demonstrate leadership in promoting democracy while addressing strategic interests in Southeast Asia. By engaging more actively with Myanmar’s pro-democracy forces and working with regional allies to articulate clear, strategic policies on Myanmar that align with broader U.S. interests in Asia-Pacific stability, human rights, and economic security, the U.S. can potentially influence the balance of power in this critical region. For the citizens of the U.S., 'the ballot is stronger than the bullet,' as quoted by Abraham Lincoln.

In Middle East, EU Is An Economic Giant But A Political Dwarf – O...	By Osama Al-Sharif The EU has seen its geopolitical influence decline throughout the world in recent years, but no more so than in the Middle East, a region historically, economically and culturally closer to it than the US. The Europeans have been losing political influence for decades, especially after endorsing the US-sponsored peace accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. Exclusive US oversight of the Oslo process sidelined the EU as a block, as well as the UN and Russia, although these three entities remain members of the Quartet — in addition to the US. But Washington has made it clear that it will neutralize any meaningful role of the Quartet to avoid laying any serious pressure on its ally and proxy, Israel. But the EU’s political influence on parties to the Israel-Palestine conflict has also declined in recent years. In this case, it suffered a fatal blow following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing brutal Israeli war on Gaza, which is ongoing and has now stretched to Lebanon. The Europeans, including the British after leaving the union, are divided when it comes to exerting meaningful pressure on Israel to cease its assault on Gaza. Following the Oct. 7 attacks, European leaders flocked to embrace Benjamin Netanyahu and to declare that Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against the aggressor, meaning Hamas and Islamic Jihad. But they soon realized that Netanyahu had unleashed an indiscriminate blitz whose aim was not to decapitate Hamas, as he has claimed, but to kill civilians, destroy infrastructure and eventually drive more than 2.2 million Palestinians toward death, either by direct bombing or by starvation and disease. It became clear that Netanyahu had other plans as he waged what nongovernmental organizations, UN rapporteurs and even the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court have described as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Still the EU has vacillated, as members like Hungary and Austria have rejected calls to bring collective punitive measures against Israel. The leading critical voice of Israeli atrocities in Gaza is foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who has been banned from entering Israel, Gaza and the West Bank by the far-right Israeli government because of his bold statements. Europe exhibited such divisiveness and lack of a coherent foreign policy when three European states — Spain, Ireland and Slovenia — decided to recognize a Palestinian state in May. The UK, which is widely recognized as triggering the decades-long conflict and causing the Palestinians’ historic injustice, has made no such move. France sat on the fence on this issue as it battled the rise of the pro-Israel far right at home and the decline of its economic influence within the EU. Germany, the EU’s economic and political powerhouse, remained loyal to its blind support of Israel and denial of its war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank. Italy and France took the step of stopping all military shipments to Israel. But at no point was the EU able to initiate a dialogue with the Biden administration about reining in Netanyahu and preventing his doubling down on what is now clearly a crime of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza. The EU has become dependent on Washington’s support of its policy on Ukraine, the most crucial geopolitical challenge to the bloc since its inception. Yes, the EU and its members remain the biggest donor to UNRWA and other UN agencies working for the welfare of the Palestinians. Brussels is also the biggest financial supporter of the Palestinian Authority. However, such financial support is undercut by its inability to produce a decisive political stand that would influence the trajectory of events in the Occupied Territories. The EU and individual member states have imposed sanctions on Jewish settler groups in the West Bank, as has the US. But that has not prevented Netanyahu’s far-right government from unleashing a settler-led wave of terror and mayhem against West Bank Palestinians. And when South Africa brought what has become a seminal charge of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice, Germany and, at one point, the UK moved in to defend Israel and attempt to throw out the case, despite the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have so far been killed. Historically, the EU has been a progressive entity when it comes to addressing the plight of the Palestinians and how the conflict should be resolved. In 1980, it issued the famous Venice Declaration, which recognized the Palestinian right to self-determination and the concept of the two-state solution based on UN Security Council resolutions. Aside from the US’ dominant role in managing peace talks between Israel and the PA, which have been nonexistent for almost 15 years now, the EU has gone through significant internal transformations that have eroded its role in the international arena, especially the Middle East. While the EU remains the third-largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product, its economies have been suffering from slow or negative growth, rising inflation, immigration, both legal and illegal, too many regulations, Donald Trump’s first-term tariffs policy and pressure to increase defense spending, NATO challenges and, finally, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The last of these has depleted the EU’s resources and, together with the immigration issue, allowed the far right to make historic gains in local, national and EU-wide elections. Euroskeptics like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni now want to 'change' the EU from within, extracting benefits while hollowing out its real spirit of unification. The UK’s influence in the Middle East is also waning. The Gaza war has singled out the US as the only player that is capable of stopping the massacre of Palestinians and preventing a regional spillover. But it is Israel’s pivot to becoming a rogue state — its parliament last week voted to abolish all agreements with UNRWA­­ — that is putting the EU and its fundamental value system under pressure. The group does not influence Israel, while several state members continue to defend Netanyahu’s genocidal war. Its economic support of the Palestinians does little to change the needle as far as a political settlement is concerned. Moreover, the rise of other global and regional powers, such as China, Russia and the Gulf states, has created new diplomatic channels and alliances, reducing Europe’s relative importance. One should add that Europe’s responses to various other Middle Eastern crises, including the Syrian civil war and the so-called Arab Spring, have been criticized as slow and ineffective, damaging its credibility. And unlike the US, the Europeans have a modest military presence in the Middle East, thus limiting their diplomatic options when it comes to intervening in the Israel-Palestine conflict. While the EU as a group is still an influential economic power, it has proven to be a political dwarf when it comes to addressing geopolitical challenges, not only in the Middle East but in the Southern Mediterranean as a whole. This has been most evident in France’s failure to intervene in the Israel-Lebanon showdown, despite Paris seeing itself as a guarantor of its former colony’s stability.

The Search For Happiness – OpEd	By Jonathan Power Want to be happy? Even if Trump wins? Read on! Sigmund Freud, the great psychiatrist, said that people can never be fully happy. But most people are reasonably happy, according to numerous surveys. Even in the slums of Calcutta a majority are. Read 'The City of Joy' by Dominique Lapierre. According to one survey Nigerians are the happiest. (But other surveys say it is Denmark, a country with a cradle to the grave welfare system where one doesn’t have to worry so much about one’s health or old—falling in love, doing well in an exam, having a child born, being rescued at sea and so on. These are called by psychologists 'peak experiences'. They don’t last long. Georgio Armani, the fashion designer, who seems to have everything—a job he loves and is very successful at, a couple of beautiful houses, a nice car and a gorgeous looking wife—says you can’t get hold of happiness. It is there and then it’s gone. For most people happiness declines from the time of their youth until they are around 40 and then turns a corner and increases until they are 70 and over. Presumably it takes that long to get on top of life, answer or accommodate to its demands and find a measure of peace. Divorce or separation from a partner one has loved immensely can wreak havoc with happiness. The death of a child even more so. Indeed, people say that in many cases parents never recover from that. A survey According to a survey in Switzerland comparing cantons, the more democratic cantons have a happier population. But no one knows if this applies to countries. But we do know that democracies don’t go to war with each other, creating untold misery and broken families. A strong religious belief also works as a boost (even if non-believers are content that they are more rational). Acts of charity and joining a club of like-minded people also bring happiness. In Aldous Huxley’s novel 'Brave New World' the following conversation takes place between a young man, nicknamed 'the Savage', and an official. 'Don’t you want to be comfortable?', enquires the official. 'I don’t want comfort', the Savage replies. 'I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want goodness, I want sin.' 'In fact', the official observes, 'you’re claiming the right to be unhappy' 'All right then,' says the Savage, 'I’m claiming the right to be unhappy.' A small minority of us are like that, but not many. In the middle class Most of us in the middle class seeking more happiness and a more comfortable life by buying a car, a new computer, a set of furniture or going on a luxury holiday will be disappointed to find that after the initial pleasure happiness wears off. But if we didn’t seek these things national income would go downhill – the hospitals and schools would decline as taxation revenues from sales taxes fell. Then, of course, unhappiness would set in. It seems in capitalism we do need the majority of us to be selfish and acquisitive (even if we make some room for those who reject materialism as long as they are a small minority). John Stuart Mill was wrong when he wrote that he looked forward to a stationary state 'where economic growth and ceaseless economic striving would end with the realization of abundance'. The greatest economist of them all, John Maynard Keynes, wrote: 'The time is not far off when economic problems will take a back seat where they belong and the heart will be occupied by the real problems, the problems of life and human relations, of creation and behaviour and religion.' But this goes against what we know: society at large has to stay on the economic treadmill, or it will fall apart. (But that is no excuse for bankers’ salaries or a debilitating distribution of income.) All of us will lose happiness if we become unemployed, retire on too modest a pension, get depressed, are discriminated against or suffer ill health. Extreme pain is probably the worst thing imaginable. With the right medicines 90% can be helped, but many hospitals won’t give pain priority and some pain-relieving drugs are banned, such as in the US morphine-based drugs because they are subject to abuse by drug addicts. Doctors are under-trained in medical schools to deal with pain. The American constitution talks about the right to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'. We have some way to go. For 17 years, Jonathan Power was a foreign affairs columnist for the International Herald Tribune.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-o83ZgXm-4UF	2024-11-05T15:29:22-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Region’s Prospects – OpEd	A little over a century ago, the region was always a net exporter o f goods and services to the outside world. Today, it is a net importer of most of what it consumes. This should pose an important question mark for the leaders of the region. How has the region changed from a net exporter of goods and services to a net importer in just over a century? It is not an easy issue to address in a short article such as this represents but one should note that the Horn of Africa States region needs to work hard. The trend we see is not comfortable and especially when we know that the region could do much better than it currently does. This is a severe drain of the meagre resources it receives through its exports and from its migrant populations outside the region. The aid and grants which is received from some helping hands cannot and will not sustain the growing population of the region. They usually take them back, these helping hands, whatever they provided through different channels including employment of their own personnel at the expense of local qualified people. As Macrotrends, a premier research platform for long term investors reports, the region continues to import more than it exports. As of 2023, the region imported some US$ 40 billion (2022: US$ 38 billion) while it exported only half of that at about US$ 20 billion (2022: US$ 18 billion). The following are compilation tables by the author of the data Macrotrends has given on the exports and imports of the Horn of Africa States. The institution does not have any information on Eritrea, but which in any way is small and would not change the trends of the region as a whole. The exports of goods and services, according to Macrotrends, 'represent the value of all goods and other market services provided to the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services. They exclude compensation of employees and investment income (formerly called factor services) and transfer payments.'

They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services.

The run into BRICS as seems to be the case on the part of Ethiopia is not the answer to the dilemma of the growing negative differential between exports and imports and should this trend continue, the region will remain to be always, as is presently the case, at the mercy of others. The region is required to correct this growing negative trade balance. Most of the imports include food imports when the region can produce more than it needs and can even export, as it used to do in the past. The region can re-initiate the old manufacturing industries and in particular, its clothing industry, its gold industry, its leather industry, and its implements industries at least to reduce the import content of these commodities and more. Energy is a substantial bill which adds to the deficit and the region is substantially endowed with local energy sources such as wind, geothermal, solar and hydropower, which it can deploy to reduce the energy import bill. Although it is easily said than done, the oil and gas reserves also offer another opportunity, which the region should emphasize on despite the trend to do away with fossil fuels. This would, however, stay with us over the next hundred some years and the region should not wait long to explore all the possibilities in this regard. Somalia already seems to be working in this respect and the other countries of the region should do the same. A positive change can only occur when there is the right attitude and the right environment. Currently the continuing civil wars and the instabilities they entail, the drifting apart of the countries of the region, and the continuing interference of foreigners in the affairs of the region are not helpful. The interference of some countries of the region in other’s internal affairs of the same region are not helping either. The Red Sea and Gulf States dynamics have also negatively impacted the region, and it is where the necessity for the region to collaborate and cooperate is needed. Apparently most foreign parties deal with each country separately and hence play on the weaknesses of each country against the other which weakens the region. A common approach of the region would have done better for the region and would have lessened the issues upon which the foreign interfering parties play. It is where an economically integrated platform for the region would have helped most, allowing for the movement of labor, capital, goods, and services to move easily between the countries of the region. Could this ever happen – an economically integrated Horn of Africa States region? It is a million Dollar question but the prospect we see, nevertheless, and it is our hope the regional leaders would revisit their books and work towards that goal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-ry51QE7HLhO	2024-11-05T15:27:09-08:00	
India On The Edge: Fractures And Fragile Relations – OpEd	As India approaches its centenary of independence in 2047, it faces a landscape fraught with both external challenges and internal discontent, revealing unsettling fractures in national unity. The inauguration of the high-altitude Sela Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh, opposed vehemently by Beijing, exemplifies the increasingly strained ties with China, as well as the precariousness of India’s regional diplomacy. This infrastructure project, intended to solidify India’s presence in a strategically sensitive zone, has intensified China’s unease. Chinese officials have openly criticized the development, viewing it as New Delhi’s attempt to assert military advantage in disputed territory (CNN, 2024; Business Today, 2024). According to South China Morning Post (2024), the Chinese response highlights Beijing’s perception of India’s border policy as overtly aggressive, a stance that could escalate beyond diplomatic protests. Such infrastructure-driven displays of strength suggest that India’s actions are not solely aimed at national security but also reveal its aspiration to dominate the region. This approach is not limited to the Sela Tunnel. India’s maneuvers on the Doklam plateau, where New Delhi stepped in to counter Chinese infrastructure projects on Bhutanese soil, underscore a growing willingness to confront China and assert its sphere of influence (The New York Times, 2024). By involving itself in Bhutan’s affairs, India not only drew China’s ire but also sent a message to smaller states that it remains a dominant power in South Asia. However, this assertive posture risks alienating its neighbors. Scholars have suggested that such a dominance-based approach aligns with the theory of hegemonic power, which posits that a state often masks its control as stability-seeking behavior but in reality undermines the sovereignty of its smaller neighbors (The Diplomat, 2019). In India’s case, Bhutan, Nepal, and even Bangladesh may perceive these moves as less about regional security and more about consolidating New Delhi’s influence at their expense. India’s strained relations with Nepal and Bangladesh further illustrate the ramifications of this hegemonic stance. With Nepal, a long-standing border dispute has fostered diplomatic friction and anti-India sentiment within Nepalese borders, reflecting broader concerns over sovereignty. In Bangladesh, relations have fluctuated, with recent tensions questioning India’s commitment to regional cooperation (BBC, 2024). For a country striving for leadership in South Asia, such rifts undermine India’s claims of being a unifying force, leaving a troubling void that could destabilize the regional order. As South China Morning Post (2024) notes, these issues exemplify the paradox of India’s regional ambition: the more it seeks to assert control, the more it risks creating a zone of instability. While these international issues challenge India’s image as a stabilizing power, internal fractures hint at an even more profound threat to its unity. Societal divisions have grown more pronounced, reflecting deep-seated grievances among various communities across the nation. As tensions rise between different groups, the potential for conflict increases, exacerbating the fragility of India’s social fabric. The central government’s focus on a majoritarian agenda, coupled with inadequate attention to the needs and rights of minority communities, has led to growing disillusionment. The result is a country where the promise of unity in diversity is increasingly called into question. The push for regional autonomy and recognition of diverse identities must be understood within the broader context of India’s federal structure, which has historically accommodated diversity through linguistic and cultural recognition. Yet, as The Diplomat (2019) observes, the increasing centralization of power under the current administration threatens to erode this delicate balance. A governance model that prioritizes regional identities over centralized control could offer a path to cohesion. But if the central government continues to dismiss these concerns, it risks widening the fault lines across different regions. India’s approach to its internal divisions must therefore become as nuanced as its diplomacy, or the calls for autonomy may evolve into a full-blown crisis of identity. Looking toward 2047, the sum of these challenges paints a picture of a country at a crossroads. India has the option to pursue a more cooperative approach, both internally and externally, that respects the aspirations of its citizens and neighbors. Externally, India would benefit from recalibrating its approach to regional disputes—pursuing dialogue and trust-building with Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh rather than asserting dominance. Domestically, it must engage constructively with all communities, acknowledging their cultural and economic needs. Through proactive measures that uphold unity within diversity, India could indeed achieve a stable and unified statehood in its centennial year. However, if these challenges are met with rigidity and indifference, India’s future may indeed hold a disquieting turn. The implications are profound: failing to mend these fractures risks a future where 2047 marks not a century of unity but the unraveling of India’s fragile cohesion—a somber reflection on a path that could have been one of resilience and unity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-tZq1YHa6Gi2	2024-11-05T15:25:34-08:00	
King Salman Invites Najib Mikati To Attend Arab-Islamic Summit Ai...	By Najia Houssari The caretaker prime minister of Lebanon, Najib Mikati, received an invitation on Tuesday from King Salman bin Abdulaziz to participate in the extraordinary joint Arab-Islamic summit scheduled for Nov. 11 in Riyadh. The summit will address Israeli assaults on the Palestinian people and Lebanese territories, coinciding with an increase in Israeli drone strikes in Beirut, southern Lebanon and Bekaa, resulting in further civilian casualties. Mikati received the invitation from Waleed Bukhari, the Saudi ambassador to Lebanon. The invitation stated that participation in the summit is a 'reaffirmation of Arab and Islamic solidarity in efforts to halt Israeli aggression and to promote the pursuit of a just resolution to the Palestinian issue, ensuring the rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.' Israel’s ground war in has completed its 44th day, and the toll since Hezbollah opened the southern front 13 months ago exceeds 3,000 dead and more than 13,000 wounded. As the assaults diminished in the southern suburbs of Beirut, residents had the chance to inspect their homes and retrieve whatever belongings they could. However, the confrontations remained intense in the southern regions, and airstrikes continued in the south and in the Bekaa region. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted the Jiyeh area, 28 km south of Beirut, killing a woman and wounding seven people — who were taken to Sibline Governmental Hospital. Airstrikes hit a building near Sheikh Ragheb Harb Hospital in Toul, and a shop in Jwaya. An airstrike on the outskirts of Bazouriyeh caused injuries, while four people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the town of Baflieh in the Tyre district. An elderly woman, Ghadia Al-Suwaid, who had insisted on staying in her home in the border town of Al-Dhayra Al-Fawqa, was suspected to have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers. The woman’s relatives told the National News Agency that 'they entered the town in the morning and did not find her.' Meanwhile, a Red Cross convoy, in coordination with UNIFIL, headed to Wata Khiam, also on the border, to complete the recovery of 15 bodies from rubble after airstrikes hit their home eight days ago. The Red Cross retrieved five bodies two days ago, but larger machinery was needed to continue clearing the rubble. An airstrike on the town of Deir Kifa killed two people and wounded several others. Israeli military vehicles were seen advancing at the Shebaa Farms toward Al-Sadana heights and Shebaa Gate, where clashes were reported between Israeli forces and Hezbollah members. On Tuesday morning, Israeli forces tried to infiltrate Rmeish but were forced to retreat after clashes with Hezbollah fighters, while in Haris an unknown motorcyclist was killed in an Israeli airstrike. In Bekaa, an Israeli drone targeted a car on the road between Hortaala and Talia, carrying a displaced family from Baalbek. The raid killed three siblings, Nathalie, Raed and Mohammed Naji Dandash, and wounded their mother, Iman Fawzat Habib, who was transferred to Dar Al Amal University Hospital. Hezbollah claimed to have struck 'a gathering of Israeli soldiers in Doviv and Ma’ale Golani barracks, and another … in the hills of Kfar Shuba. We bombed an explosives factory in Hadera, south of Haifa, with a salvo of qualitative missiles.' Israeli army spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, meanwhile, claimed that Israeli forces had destroyed 'an underground infrastructure of about 70 meters long and confiscating weapons and rocket launchers in rugged and underground areas in southern Lebanon.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLRFpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-05T15:23:39-08:00	
Iran’s First Privately Developed Satellites Launched Into Orbit O...	In a milestone for Iran’s private space sector, satellites 'Kowsar' and 'Hodhod' were successfully launched into orbit aboard a Russian Soyuz launcher, marking the country’s initial private effort in satellite production and space deployment. Iranian satellites Kowsar and Hodhod were sent into space as part of a payload carried by the Russian Soyuz launcher, which delivered 53 satellites to orbit. This launch represents a significant advancement for Iran, highlighting the first satellite manufacturing and launching attempt from its private space sector. The Kowsar satellite, weighing 30 kilograms, is a high-resolution sensing satellite designed for applications in agriculture, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. With a resolution capability of 3.45 meters, Kowsar surpasses Iran's goal of producing satellites with 10-meter ground sample distance (GSD) cameras by 2025. Kowsar has a lifespan of 3.5 years in orbit, positioned at an altitude of 500 kilometers, and is capable of capturing six frames per second over a 15-kilometer range. Its imaging is achieved using an RGB camera with 3.45-meter resolution and an NIR camera with 5.5-meter resolution, supported by a maximum platform weight of 35 kilograms. The satellite’s orbital period is 5,677 seconds, with pointing and stability accuracies of 1 degree and 0.05 degrees per second, respectively. Power is sustained by its 44 watt-hour production capacity, and it consumes 29 watt-hours to operate its payloads. Meanwhile, Hodhod serves as a small communications satellite intended to create satellite-based communication networks and enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. Targeted at regions with limited terrestrial communication access, Hodhod offers communication solutions in remote and inaccessible areas. Built to the CubeSat standard, the satellite operates in a 500-kilometer orbit and supports precision agriculture, transportation, logistics, and environmental monitoring. Its primary mission focuses on expanding IoT capabilities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLREAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-05T15:21:00-08:00	
Haiti: Convent Founded By Mother Teresa Burned Down In Continued ...	By Madalaine Elhabbal In an escalation of violence, an armed Haitian gang has looted and burned down a Missionaries of Charity convent, which had been founded by Mother Teresa herself in 1979. According to a report by Zenit news, the devastating attack took place on the night of Oct. 26. The group of attackers was led by one of Haiti’s most infamous gang leaders — ex-police officer Jimmy Chérizier, also known as 'Barbeque.' Chérizier heads up the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, a coalition of nine gangs based in the capital city, Port-au-Prince. He has been a principal agitator in efforts to topple the remnants of Haiti’s government. Chérizier and his men looted the convent and its adjacent aid dispensary before leaving the property in flames. None of the nuns were injured, as police had asked them to vacate the property a month before the attack, according to a Vatican report. The Missionaries of Charity has provided free medical care to vulnerable members of the surrounding community since its establishment, serving approximately 1,500 inpatients and 30,000 outpatients per year, according to the report. 'Stolen items are now openly sold in the market near the San José school,' Sister Paësie, founder of the Kizito Family — a religious community located in the largest slum in Port-au-Prince — told Zenit.

At the beginning of the year, six nuns belonging to the St. Anne’s congregation were abducted by gang members. Widespread chaos and violence from gangs have been rampant throughout the country since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse by a group of mostly foreign mercenaries in July 2021. Moïse had refused to vacate office after his term ended in February 2021 and had faced calls from opposition parties to step down on account of his alleged corruption and incompetence. Then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry assumed office, which provoked further aggression. Chérizier has threatened civil war if Henry does not resign. 'The situation in Port-au-Prince is unacceptable, intolerable, and inconceivable,' Father Baudelaire Martial, CSC, of the Congregation of Holy Cross told CNA in August. 'We live in very precarious conditions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLRJp-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-05T15:19:18-08:00	
Dance Of Electrons Measured In The Glow From Exploding Neutron-St...	The temperature of elementary particles has been observed in the radioactive glow following the collision of two neutron stars and the birth of a black hole. This has, for the first time, made it possible to measure the microscopic, physical properties in these cosmic events. Simultaneously, it reveals how snapshot observations made in an instant represents an object stretched out across time. The discovery was made by astrophysicists from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and is published in the international scientific journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. New method of observation shows the creation of heavy elements The collision of two neutron stars has created the smallest black hole yet observed. The dramatic, cosmic collision resulted in, apart from the birth of a black hole, a ball of fire, expanding with nearly the speed of light. In the following days it shone with a luminosity comparable to hundreds of millions of Suns. This luminous object, aka a kilonova, shines this bright because of the emission of large amounts of radiation from the decay of the heavy, radioactive elements created in the explosion. By combining the measurements of the kilonova light, made with telescopes across the Globe, an international team of researchers, led by The Cosmic DAWN Center at the Niels Bohr Institute, have closed in on the enigmatic nature of the explosion and come closer to the answer of an old, astrophysical question: Where do the elements, heavier than iron, come from? Observatories all over the Globe took part in the observations 'This astrophysical explosion develops dramatically hour by hour, so no single telescope can follow its entire story. The viewing angle of the individual telescopes to the event are blocked by the rotation of the Earth. But by combining the existing measurements from Australia, South Africa and The Hubble Space Telescope we can follow its development in great detail. We show that the whole shows more than the sum of the individual sets of data' says Albert Sneppen, PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute and leader of the new study. The explosion resembles The Universe shortly after the Big Bang Just after the collision the fragmented star-matter has a temperature of many billion degrees. A thousand times hotter than even the center of the Sun and comparable to the temperature of the Universe just one second after the Big Bang. Temperatures this extreme results in electrons not being attached to atomic nuclei, but instead floating around in a so-called ionized plasma. The electrons 'dance' around. But in the ensuing moments, minutes, hours and days, the star-matter cools, just like the entire Universe after the Big Bang. The fingerprint of Strontium is evidence of the creation of heavy elements 370,000 years after the Big Bang the Universe had cooled sufficiently for the electrons to attach to atomic nuclei and make the first atoms. Light could now travel freely in the Universe because it was no longer blocked by the free electrons. This means that the earliest light we can see in the history of the Universe is this so-called 'cosmic background radiation' – a patchwork of light, constituting the remote background of the night sky. A similar process of the unification of electrons with atomic nuclei can now be observed in the star-matter of the explosion. One of the concrete results is the observation of heavy elements like Strontium and Yttrium. They are easy to detect, but it is likely that many other heavy elements which we were unsure of the origin of, were also created in the explosion. 'We can now see the moment where atomic nuclei and electrons are uniting in the afterglow. For the first time we see the creation of atoms, we can measure the temperature of the matter and see the micro physics in this remote explosion. It is like admiring three cosmic background radiation surrounding us from all sides, but here, we get to see everything from the outside. We see before, during and after the moment of birth of the atoms', says Rasmus Damgaard, PhD student at Cosmic DAWN Center and co-author of the study. Kasper Heintz, co-author and assistant professor at the Niels Bohr Institute continues: 'The matter expands so fast and gains in size so raidly, to the extent where it takes hours for the light to travel across the explosion. This is why, just by observing the remote end of the fire ball, we can see further back in the history of the explosion. Closer to us the electrons have hooked on to atomic nuclei, but on the other side, on the far side of the newborn black hole, the 'present' is still just future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID7bxGkpaS-gs	2024-11-05T15:16:55-08:00	
Small Reductions To Meat Production In Wealthier Countries May He...	Scientists and environmental activists have consistently called for drastic reductions in meat production as a way to reduce emissions and, in doing so, combat climate change. However, a new analysis concludes that a smaller reduction, borne by wealthier nations, could remove 125 billion tons of carbon dioxide—exceeding the total number of global fossil fuel emissions over the past three years—from the atmosphere. Small cutbacks in higher-income countries—approximately 13% of total production—would reduce the amount of land needed for cattle grazing, the researchers note, allowing forests to naturally regrow on current pastureland. The return of trees—long known to effectively absorb, or sequester, carbon dioxide (CO2)—would drive significant declines in fossil fuel emissions, which the study’s authors estimate would roughly equal three years’ worth of global emissions. 'We can achieve enormous climate benefits with modest changes to the total global beef production,' says Matthew N. Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies and the lead author of the analysis, which appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). 'By focusing on regions with potentially high carbon sequestration in forests, some restoration strategies could maximize climate benefits while minimizing changes to food supplies.' The analysis found that pasturelands, especially in areas that were once forests, hold immense promise for mitigating climate change. When livestock are removed from these 'potential native forest' areas, ecosystems can revert to their natural forested state, capturing carbon in trees and soil. The paper’s authors see high- and upper-middle-income countries as viable candidates for reduction in beef production because they have some current pasture areas that do not produce very much grass per acre, exist where grass grows only during a short growing season, and are in areas that could, instead, grow vast, lush forests with deep soils that work to sequester carbon. This differs significantly from other regions, including sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where much more pasture can grow year-round, producing more feed for animals per acre than northern countries. In addition, the research team sees ways lower-income regions could increase the efficiency at which cattle are fed and raised on grass as a way to offset the minor loss in production from higher-income countries. 'This isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution,' Hayek emphasizes. 'Our findings show that strategic improvements in the efficiency of cattle herds in some areas, coupled with decreased production in others, could lead to a win-win scenario for climate and food production.' The study reveals an even more dramatic potential for climate mitigation if the scope of restoration was expanded. The researchers found that removing cattle, sheep, and other grazing livestock from all potentially natively forested areas globally could sequester a staggering 445 gigatons of CO2 by the end of this century—the equivalent to more than a decade of current global fossil fuel emissions. 'Importantly, this approach would still allow livestock grazing to remain on native grasslands and dry rangelands, which are places where crops or forests cannot easily grow,' says Hayek. 'These areas support more than half of global pasture production, meaning that this ambitious forest restoration scenario would require cutting global cattle, sheep, and other livestock herds by less than half. These findings underscore the immense potential of natural forest restoration as a climate solution.' The PNAS study used remote sensing technology to track pasture productivity—the amount of grass produced annually that livestock can consume—in order to estimate the climate benefits that reductions would yield. 'Even if two different areas can regrow the same amount of carbon in trees, we can now know how much pasture, hence beef production, we would have to lose in each area to grow those trees back,' explains Johannes Piipponen, a doctoral candidate at Finland’s Aalto University and coauthor of the study, who led this technical advance. 'For many consumers in high-income regions, like Europe and North America, reducing excessive meat consumption benefits both their health and the environment. However, until now, it has remained rather unclear where the required decreases in production could begin.' Maps produced by the team’s research can identify areas where policies could be prioritized for reducing beef production and hastening forest recovery—for instance, by offering forest land conservation incentives or buyouts to beef producers. The authors acknowledge that ecosystem regrowth is not a substitute for efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions. But, it can serve as a powerful complement to combat climate change. 'In many places, this regrowth could occur by seeds naturally dispersing and trees regrowing without any human involvement,' says Hayek. 'However, in some places, with especially degraded environments or soils, native and diverse tree-planting could accelerate forest restoration, giving regrowth a helping hand. This long-term regrowth would benefit the climate for decades to come, with significant regrowth and carbon capture beginning within just a few years in many areas, and lasting for 75 years or more until forests nearly mature.' The authors also emphasize that while the findings do not call for extreme changes to global food production and trade patterns, swift action is necessary in order to meet climate goals. 'Within the next two decades, countries are aiming to meet critical climate mitigation targets under international agreements, and ecosystem restoration on converted pasturelands can be a critical part of that,' observes Hayek. 'Our study’s findings could offer paths forward for policymakers aiming to address both climate mitigation and food security concerns. As countries worldwide commit to ambitious reforestation targets, we hope that this research can help identify and prioritize the most effective areas for carbon sequestration efforts while considering global food needs.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID3FkfDZIGQ90	2024-11-05T15:14:39-08:00	
Limited Political Choices In Capitalist Democracies – OpEd	The advanced capitalist countries—including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several Western European nations—have failed to offer their citizens a genuine range of choices in terms of availability and accessibility of multiple political parties, different ideologies, alternative policies options, and visions for the future. Despite relative prosperity and established democratic frameworks within these countries often present limited, binary options within their political systems. These dominant options based on two party system shape political discourse with policies and ideologies that are often indistinguishable. This lack of choice is not accidental; it is a deliberate design to protect the economic interests of both ruling and non-ruling elites within a capitalist framework. Although multiple political parties officially exist and registered in these advanced capitalist countries, they often exist in name only or work as interest groups. These smaller parties are frequently marginalised within mainstream political discourse, particularly in the media and in electoral democracy as elections are too expensive in a market led society. As a result, they struggle to gain visibility, which limits public awareness of diverse perspectives and reduces the influence of alternative ideas on issues crucial to both citizens and the country. This media emphasis on dominant parties narrows the spectrum of political choices available to citizens, reinforcing the status quo and restricting meaningful ideological and policy choices which are confined within two party system. This bipolarisation of politics hinders the deepening of a democracy that serves both people and the planet. The advocates of capitalism have long argued that capitalism is not only necessary condition for freedom but also essential for democracy. Such ahistorical arguments frame capitalism as the foundation upon which democracy and freedom rest. It suggests that economic liberty under capitalism naturally leads to political and social freedoms. The idea is to reinforce capitalism as central to every democratic decision-making processes, political institutions and structures of governance. Such an ideological foundation gives capitalism upper hand and weakens the foundations and functioning of democracy. The primacy of capitalism as an ideological project weakens diversities of decision-making processes within a democratic set up. Therefore, the single window systems of decision making emerged to facilitate interests of capitalism. Work and starve is not freedom, it is another form of slavery. Developed economy with deprived people in an alienated society is not ideal for human lives. The democratic systems within capitalist societies neither provide genuine freedom nor uphold true democratic values. Instead, they restrict political choices, limiting the availability of alternative political perspectives, as it is easier to manage a few elite classes than to address the needs of the working masses. Subsequently, capitalist democracy shapes society and promotes policies that align with the interests of a select few dominant elites. The dominance of two-party systems—such as the Democrats and Republicans in the USA, Labour and Conservatives in the UK, and similar polarising duality of political trends in France, Australia, and Japan—illuminates how capitalist democracies offer only limited, binary options in their electoral processes. These two dominant parties ultimately represent two different facets of capitalist interests, offering minimal choice to citizens while maintaining the status quo. Capitalism and its political cultures are incompatible with democratic diversities. It stands in opposition to fundamental democratic values, particularly freedom of political choice, which is essential for a thriving democratic society. Capitalism inherently creates cultures of democratic deficit, making true political diversity nearly impossible to realise. By streamlining political processes and consolidating decision-making, capitalism safeguards its own interests, which are threatened by democratic decentralisation. Capitalism often forms alliances with authoritarian, reactionary, feudal and religious forces and ensures their electoral victory with the help of mass media and propaganda. Therefore, capitalism often undermines robust democracies with multi-party systems, advocating for 'efficiency' as a justification for limiting political plurality and centralising power. The two leading capitalist democracies, the UK and the US, exemplify how democracy can be undermined by the bipolarisation of politics, where two dominant parties offer only two different versions of capitalist interests. This system effectively erases alternatives, even within existing democratic frameworks. Leaders like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Bernie Sanders in the United States encountered significant obstacles, as the entrenched capitalist political structures suppressed even minimal progressive, liberal, and democratic ideals. Capitalism, at its core, is fundamentally opposed to the values of democracy, prioritising the protection of property, property owners, and their interests under the guise of democratic principles. Bipolarisation of politics with two dominant political parties are concomitant with requirements of capitalism. Radical democracy can only be achieved through the political mobilisation of working people, whose struggles have the potential to deepen democracy and embrace a diversity of ideals, policies, and visions for an egalitarian society free from inequality and exploitation. It is impossible to uphold the interests of working people without continuous struggle for radical democracy. In essence, working class struggle is not only merely a fight to preserve democracy itself but also a movement to protect people from the exploitative nature of capitalism. Working class struggles are inherently struggles for democracy. It is time to embrace and celebrate the ideals of working-class struggles ensure the democratic politics and policies of peace and prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID2SGgqUU2Ifs	2024-11-05T15:12:06-08:00	
Bio-Based Fibers Could Pose Greater Threat To The Environment Tha...	Bio-based materials may pose a greater health risk to some of the planet’s most important species than the conventional plastics they are designed to replace, a new study has shown. Such materials are increasingly being advocated as environmentally friendly alternatives to plastics, and used in textiles and products including clothing, wet wipes and period products. However, microfibres of the materials are emitted into the environment through the laundry cycle, the application of sewage sludge as fertilisers, or the simple wear and tear of textile products. Despite increasing quantities of bio-based products being produced and sold all over the world, there has been little research to assess their potential impact on species and ecosystems. To address that, a new study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology tested the effects of conventional polyester fibres and two bio-based fibres –viscose and lyocell – on earthworms, a species critical to the health of soils globally. The study found that in high concentrations of fibres, 30% of earthworms died after 72 hours when exposed to polyester, while those exposed to the bio-based fibres experienced much higher mortality of up to 60% in the case of lyocell and 80% for viscose. A second experiment, using environmentally relevant concentrations of the fibres, indicated that earthworms housed in soils containing viscose fibres exhibited reduced reproduction compared to those exposed to polyester fibres. Earthworms in the soils containing lyocell fibres showed reduced growth and also higher rates of burrowing within the soil compared to exposure to the other types of fibre. The researchers say the study highlights the complex nature of global efforts to reduce the threat of microplastic pollution, and the importance of testing new materials being advocated as alternatives to plastics before they are released on the open market. The study was carried out as part of the BIO-PLASTIC-RISK project, led by researchers at the University of Plymouth and the University of Bath, and supported with £2.6million funding by the Natural Environmental Research Council. Dr Winnie Courtene-Jones, lead author on the new study and now a Lecturer in Marine Pollution at Bangor University, said: 'Over 320,000 tonnes of bio-based and biodegradable fibres were produced globally in 2022 and research shows that substantial quantities of that will end up in the environment. However, evidence of their ecological impacts has been lacking. Our study has shown that bio-based fibres have a range of adverse effects on earthworms – animals which are critical to the functioning of the environment. It highlights the importance of gathering further evidence before alternatives to conventional plastics are made available even more widely.' The new study follows research published earlier in 2024 which highlighted that being exposed to the materials used in biodegradable teabags can result in earthworm populations experiencing up to 15% greater mortality, and have a detrimental effect on earthworm reproduction. It has been published just a few weeks before the United Nations gathers world leaders meet in Busan, South Korea, for the final round of negotiations regarding a possible Global Plastics Treaty. Professor Richard Thompson OBE FRS, senior author on the new study and Head of the University of Plymouth’s International Marine Litter Research Unit, will be at those discussions along with policy makers, scientists and other delegates from across the world. He added: 'It is clear that along with recycling and re-use, tackling plastic pollution will require a reduction in the quantities of plastics used and produced. There is increasing interest in alternative materials that could be used as substitutes for plastic, but this publication further emphasises the importance of testing new innovations in relevant environmental settings prior to widescale adoption. I firmly believe it is possible to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, but independent scientific evidence will be critical in helping us avoid unintended consequences as we look for solutions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID9aJOktci3qz	2024-11-05T15:10:44-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Hails Italy’s Contributions To Euro-Atlant...	Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Italy today (5 November 2024), where he met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and President Sergio Mattarella. He underscored the importance of continuing to strengthen deterrence and defence, and step up support to Ukraine. 'Keeping our one billion people safe is NATO’s most sacred duty, and that is why we are ramping up our defence industrial capacity,' the Secretary General said, adding that 'we need to go further and faster, for our own deterrence and to support Ukraine.' The Secretary General underlined that Italy is 'a staunch and reliable Ally, contributing in many ways to Euro-Atlantic security.' He highlighted Italy’s lead of NATO’s new battlegroup in Bulgaria, its contributions to NATO’s deployments in Hungary and Latvia, and the deployment of Italy’s jets to protect Allied airspace and ships to keep crucial seaways open. 'Italy is once again leading our peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, KFOR, helping to foster stability in the Western Balkans,' he added. The Secretary General thanked Prime Minister Meloni 'for being such a strong supporter of Ukraine.' He underscored that Allies and partners 'will continue to stand by Ukraine, because Ukraine’s fight is our fight,' and welcomed Italy’s strong support for the action plan adopted at the Washington Summit for a stronger, more strategic and results-oriented approach towards NATO’s southern neighbourhood. During his visit, Secretary General Rutte also visited the Italian facilities of the defence manufacturing group Rheinmetall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYtyM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-05T09:24:23-08:00	
Beyond Russia-Africa Summits: Unlimited Opportunities And Unprece...	Under the aegis of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Roscongress, the Russia–Africa Partnership Forum will host its highly anticipated first Ministerial Conference from 9th–10th November 2024 at the Sirius Federal Territory in the southern coastal city of Sochi. According official reports, this two-day conference will be under the patronage of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the programme includes a plenary session to be attended by officials, and also round tables and discussions focusing on aspects of declarations from the first and second summits respectively held in 2019 (Sochi) and in 2023 (St. Petersburg). The programme architecture released for the first Ministerial Conference would enhance building on the strategic decisions taken both at the first and second Russia–Africa summits and bring together the heads of ministries of foreign affairs of Russia and African countries, the African Union Commission (AUC), as well as the executive bodies of regional integration associations from Africa. The heads of African regional organizations as well as representatives of government agencies, financial institutions, Russian and African businesses, public and scientific communities, and the media are part of the conference. It would be an opportunity to review the culmination, within the context of geopolitical shift at a critical stage, the evolving relations between Russia and African countries, which is high level of cooperation in several areas: from the collaboration and implementation of economic projects, energy and food security dimensions, the development of bilateral trade and investment partnerships, and scientific-technical, healthcare, tourism and education. These would broadly be discussed with special attention to cooperation between countries of the African continent and the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition, the business programme includes a presentation of the English-language version of the Africa 2025. Prospects and Challenges policy brief prepared by a team of experts at the HSE Centre for African Studies with the support of Uralchem Group, which aims to provide guidance for African experts, scientists, and decision-makers. Reviewing Sochi Summit (2019) Russia has a long time-tested relationship with Africa. After the symbolic Russia-Africa summit in the Black Sea city of Sochi in October 2019, both Russia and Africa adopted a joint declaration, a comprehensive document that outlined the key objectives and necessary tasks that seek to raise assertively the entire relations to a new qualitative level. That official document shows there has been a great interest in the further development of relations between Africa and Russia. Until the 2023 summit, priority areas of economic cooperation in which concrete results could be achieved. Documents showed 92 agreements, contracts and memoranda of understanding were signed at that first Russia-Africa summit. The agreements signed there worth a total of $12.5 billion. Reviewing St. Petersburg Summit (July 2023) The socond summit renewed the commitment to support the struggle for the eradication of colonialism and the establishment of independence of African States, and strengthening their national sovereignty. The 74 point-declaration pointed out explicitly the growing sustainable collaboration in mechanism for dialogue partnership, political and legal cooperation, strengthen cooperation between States to counter new challenges and threats, strengthen trade and economic cooperation, as well as engage Africa in comprehensive spheres including scientific and technical, humanitarian, educational, cultural, sports, health, youth and information cooperation. Joint inter-governmental Commissions Long before holding the two historic summits, there are joint commissions handling matters on trade and economic between Russia and a number of African countries. According to the official documents of Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 28 of such joint commissions were created and have been functioning admirably these several years. The primary responsibility is to coordinate projects and oversee its implementations in Africa. Until today, none has reported any completed infrastructure projects undertaken, completed and handed over to any African country since Soviet's collapse in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have never, throughout the post-Soviet history of relations between Russia and Africa, cut white ribbons marking the completion of any projects in Africa. Provision of Nuclear Energy In the nuclear power sector, here are a few developments. Russia pledged to thrash out energy deficiency which has affected more 800 million of Africa's 1.4 billion people. Energy shortage negatively affects both domestic and industrial use, and has made provision of nuclear energy its policy priority across Africa. Under an official authorized license from the Egyptian regulator and under the signed intergovernmental agreement, Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation has started the construction of the planned four power units at the El Dabaa nuclear power plant in Egypt. The bilateral agreement was signed as far back in November 2015. Research shows that Russia granted a loan $25 billion for the construction of the nuclear power plants which covers 85% of the work. The remaining expenses be covered by the Egyptian side by attracting private investors. The NPP design envisages four 1200-MW power units with VVER-1200 reactors. Construction is expected to be completed by 2028-2029. Late February 2020, Chairperson of the Federation Council (the Upper House or the Senate), Valentina Matviyenko, headed a Russian delegation on a three-day working visit aimed at strengthening parliamentary diplomacy with Namibia and Zambia. According to an official release from the Federation Council, the visit was within the broad framework mechanism of parliamentary consultations between Russia and African countries. The key focus were on political dialogue, economic partnership and humanitarian spheres with Namibia and Zambia. The delegation held talks with President Edgar Lungu at the State House in Lusaka, Zambia. Matviyenko said: 'Now the start of the construction of a center for nuclear science and technology has been suspended due to financial issues.' According to her that request was submitted to the Russian president and was being carefully considered by the ministries and departments. And it was expected to jointly find options for funding to roll out the construction of a center for nuclear science and technology. More than thirty years, Russia has been pushing for post-Soviet relations. Russia and South Africa are BRICS members. South Africa has also had nuclear contract signed with Russia back from 2015 under Jacob Zuma, at the time of his presidency. According to research sources, main reason why the 2015 nuclear power agreement thrown out by the South Africa's parliament, it attributed to the fact that the agreement was an opaque unilateral deal with Moscow. South Africa's parliament did not discuss and approve the mega-project for the country. According to analytical reports, African countries which signed agreements for such construction of nuclear plants by Russia as follows: Algeria (2014), Ghana (2015), Ethiopia (2019), Republic of Congo (2019), Nigeria (2012, 2016), Rwanda (2018), South Africa (2004), Sudan (2017), Tunisia (2016), Uganda (2019) and Zambia (2016). Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed with Kenya in 2016 and Morocco in 2017. A simple 'memorandum of understanding' on nuclear with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali in July 2023 in St. Petersburg went viral world-wide as part of Russia's information propaganda, to show its preparedness to support their development initiatives of these French-controlled African states. Sustainable Food Security Russia also has a full-fledged ambitious interest to guarantee sustainable food security by supplying grains across Africa. Russia is a leading producer as well-known. But a critical examination of this corporate deal reveals that Russia's grain supply would still remain as a soft bait (i) to reinforce the existing time-tested relationships with Africa and (ii) to earn revenue from exports to Africa. Notwithstanding that Africa is blessed with huge expanse of land and climate for agricultural production to feed its population. Some experts and international organizations have also expressed the fact that African leaders have to adopt import substitution mechanisms and use their financial resources on strengthening agricultural production systems. Establishing food security is important for millions of people facing hunger in Africa and is crucial for sustainable economic development and long-term prosperity of the continent. A few African countries have adopted import substitution, agricultural policy and strategically working towards self-sufficiency. Interfax reports indicated that Russia expected to export up to 70 million metric tonnes of grain in the 2023-2024 agricultural year. In the previous season, Russia shipped 66 million tonnes worth almost $16.5 billion. Besides that, Russia plans to earn estimated revenue amounting to $33 billion by exporting food to African countries. Military-Technical Cooperation Russia has an indivisible security relationship with many African countries. Notably, Russia's military influence has been increasing in Saharan-Sahel region, an elongated landlocked territory located between North Africa (Maghreb) and West Africa, and also stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Quite recently, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and, more significantly have also created their own military bloc, the Alliance des États du Sahel (translates in English as the Alliance of Sahel States), citing reasons as fighting frequent militant attacks and against indiscriminate manipulation by foreign governments. For better or for worse, by creating their own Alliance of Sahel States (AES), it exposes ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) powerlessness, weaknesses and its long-term inability and incompetency to deal with regional problems, particularly rising insecurity in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned this security issues during his opening and closing speeches at St. Petersburg summit and even previously, indicating its importance on Russia's agenda with Africa. At the end, both Russian and African leaders reaffirmed their collective stance to deal with the persistent ethnic conflicts and militant threats among the magnitude of wide range of priorities. In fact, there were five key documents and one of them focuses on ‘Strengthening Cooperation to Combat Terrorism’ which neatly relates to this theme under discussion. Often said that Russia has rich experiences as in developing an effective set of measures to counter terrorism, curtail illegal activity, and provide dependable protection for citizens. Therefore, Russia's Ministry of Defense together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs express profound readiness to coordinate in sharing their experiences with African partners, particularly in the Saharan-Sahel. Revisiting the first summit declaration which says in part, 'firm intention to fully contribute to achieving peace and security' points to the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity on these countries in the region. The first primary step is implementing joint programmes to build the necessary capacity of the requesting African States and train African peace-keeping personnel at specialized educational institutions of the Russian Federation and inside African States. It has to be noted clearly that Russia works for its revenue from increased exports. Therefore, several agreements signed would allow Russia a full access to exploring natural resources in exchange for its military assistance. Updatedly, Russia has signed bilateral military-technical cooperation agreements with more than 20 African countries. Notable Quotes – Federation Council Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachev told a roundtable on Russia's strategic interests in Africa at Valdai Discussion Club, that Russia's Western opponents are trying to prevent African states from taking part in Russia-Africa summits. In Senator Kosachev's opinion, several meetings, conferences and summits have been successful, 'but, in many respects, its results remained within the dimension of politics' and were not translated into additional projects in trade, economic, scientific or humanitarian cooperation. 'Trade turnover speaks for itself. Roughly, the European Union’s trade with Africa stands at around $300 billion, China's – at around $150 billion, and the United States – approximately $50-60 billion. Despite the tendency to grow, our current turnover is around $20 billion,' Senator Kosachev added, quoting trade figures to illustrate his argument. – Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Jacob Mudenda, during the conference on Russia-Africa, organized within the framework of International Development on Parliamentarism forum in March 2023 said: 'participation in the conference is another opportunity to discuss many issues, compare positions, develop solutions and give impetus to further cooperation, but it is important to turn words into concrete actions.' He further argued that it was distinctively evident from the large number of African delegations that had been invited, so far, to Moscow over the past few years, and that marked a new chapter to re-activate relations with Africa. But, Russia's influence might not take roots anytime soon if the conference declarations are not vigorously and promptly implemented. Russia-African Interactive Symbolism The history of Russia–Africa Summit is the highest-profile and largest-scale event in Russian–African relations, aimed at bringing about a fundamentally new level of mutually beneficial partnership to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The goal of the event is to promote efforts to strengthen comprehensive and equal cooperation between Russia and African nations across all areas of society including politics, security, economic relations, science and technology, and the cultural and humanitarian spheres. The first Russia–Africa Summit took place on 23–24 October 2019 in Sochi under the motto of ‘For Peace, Security and Development’. This was the first time such a large-scale event had been held in the history of modern Russia, and was unprecedented in Russian–African relations. The second Russia–Africa Summit was held in July 2023 in St. Petersburg under the the same motto of ‘For Peace, Security and Development’. This was the second time such a large-scale with participation of high-level government delegations from both sides, and was described as unprecedented in bilateral relations. At both Summits the participants identified priority areas of economic cooperation where concrete results could be achieved in subsequent years. At the closing in Sochi and St. Petersburg, declarations were adopted outlining the approval of goals and objectives for the future development of Russian–African cooperation across politics, security, economics, science and technology, culture and the humanitarian sphere. Logical and Final Words Much time has elapsed, but meetings, conferences and summits are consistenly organized to review the past and current stage of relations. Russia and Africa are the new centers of the emerging multipolar world. But more admittedly, Africa has become competitive but still continues attracting external players to significant sectors. In this context, Russia undoubtedly needs to adopt its approaches and mechanisms necessary for driving effective cooperation in order to take the relations to the next level in this new changing conditions of global politics and economics. Basic questions, often and simultaneously asked are: what steps are needed to give a new impetus to bilateral economic relations? What are the key initiatives and competencies that can create a deeper strategic partnership between Russia and Africa? Regardless of the fact that the continent has enormous reources both natural and human, Africa's development issues are still very lamentable, and leaders are excited at Africa being described as poorest in the world. In a nutshell, African leaders pay lip service in pursuit of working towards attaining their own economic sovereignty. In fact 80% of Africa's population still live in abject poverty. The Global Development Index shows that African governments continue to pursue trivial development questions, poor governance and deep-seated corruption. In practical terms, Africa has rather exposed the collective weaknesses, inability to sharpen development priorities, gross mismanagement and incompetencies of Africa leaders. It is shameful and incredible for characterizing being used as pawns in geopolitical reconfiguration, but instead African leaders essentially have to take cognizance of the key necessity and acknowledge the popular hyperbolic saying ‘African problems, African solutions’ and/or alternatively the ‘Africa We Want’ within the framework of the Agenda 2063 as widely propagated by the continental organization - the African Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYtzK9wBhb35rc	2024-11-05T09:22:28-08:00	
One Person, One Vote, One Joke…On Democracy – OpEd	As Americans, we hold dear several core democratic values, none more basic than 'one person, one vote.' But our contemporary economic realities have essentially obliterated this core value’s essence. 'One person, one vote,' we’re relearning this year, simply cannot exist in an America where a single individual can hold 1.4 million times more wealth than the typical American household. That particular single individual, Elon Musk, currently holds a personal fortune worth over $260 billion. The net worth of America’s median family, according to the latest Federal Reserve data? Less than $200,000. How much of Musk’s fortune — and the fortunes of his fellow super rich — is going into the 2024 presidential and congressional elections? A just-released report from Americans for Tax Fairness has found that 150 of America’s wealthiest have already contributed $1.9 billion to the candidates they find most friendly to how our richest see the world. That $1.9-billion total, Americans for Tax Fairness points out, will most likely run well over $2 billion by the time this year’s election dust has settled. But that same $1.9 billion has already surpassed, by a stunningly wide margin, the $1.2 billion that over 600 billionaires spent on electing presidential and congressional candidates in 2020. Who’s benefiting from all this billionaire loot? Nearly three-quarters of this $1.9 billion — 72 percent — is going to support Republican candidates. The Democratic Party candidate share: 22 percent. And how much wealth will the 150 billionaires that Americans for Tax Fairness has been tracking have left in their personal fortunes after subtracting their hundreds of millions in 2024 political contributions? Plenty. The $1.9 billion these super rich have laid out so far amounts to a mere 0.07 percent of their collective $2.67 trillion in wealth. Musk himself had at last count poured at least $133 million into electing his favorite candidates, with Donald Trump by far and away the biggest beneficiary. That sum almost certainly understates what Musk is actually spending on campaign 2024. Billionaires like Musk, analysts at Open Secrets note, can also contribute anonymously to political campaigns through 'dark money' groups that need not reveal their donors. Let’s assume for a moment that Musk’s overall outlay for Trump’s election ends up in the vicinity of $200 million, less than 1 percent of his personal net worth. In backing Trump, he could hardly be making a more profitable investment. With Trump once again in the White House, Musk could look forward to lower tax bills, better access to lucrative federal contracts for his SpaceX, and fewer regulations on the rest of his sprawling business empire. He would be richer than ever. And so would the rest of his super-rich peers. Should we fear for our democracy at that prospect? We most certainly should, as the New Yorker’s Charles Duhigg makes frighteningly clear in his just-published analysis of Silicon Valley’s enormous new political power. Back in 1982, the year Forbes began annually publishing a list of America’s 400 richest, Big Oil dominated the upper ranks of America’s richest. Nine of our wealthiest 15 on that initial top 400 list owed their good fortune to the oil industry. High-tech now dominates the Forbes 400. On the 2024 Forbes 400, billionaires who owe their fortunes to high-tech occupy 10 of the top 15 slots. Like their Big Oil predecessors, today’s high-tech rich haven’t just accumulated great wealth. They have gained enough of a political punch to make elected leaders think twice before getting in the way of anything Big Tech wants to see happen. The most brazen of today’s Big Tech punchers now come from the highly speculative cryptocurrency sector. Silicon Valley venture capital firms have invested billions into crypto. These same investors have invested mega-millions in super PACs, with the prime goal, the New Yorker’s Duhigg details, 'of convincing politicians that the political consequences of being anti-crypto would be intensely painful.' The crypto crowd chose the California U.S. Senate primary this past March as a high-profile opportunity to get that message across. That primary drew a host of candidates, all seeking to become one of the top two finishers who would square off against each other in the November election. This broad field included Rep. Katie Porter, a nationally known consumer champion. Crypto’s movers and shakers decided to go all-out in the primary against her. Porter, for her part, had never devoted much attention to crypto. But that didn’t matter. For the crypto crowd, getting into the California Senate race against Porter, a popular member of Congress, would be an ideal opportunity to intimidate other politicians, 'to warn anyone running for office,' as an industry insider told the New Yorker, 'that, if you are anti-crypto, the industry will come after you.' Crypto’s top super PAC would go on to deluge California’s airwaves with ad spots that blasted Porter as a 'bully' and a 'liar,' never mentioning anything about crypto at all. Porter ended up finishing third with a mere 15 percent of the primary vote. Message delivered. 'Candidates in New York, Arizona, Maryland, and Michigan,' notes the New Yorker’s Duhigg, soon 'began releasing crypto-friendly public statements and voting for pro-crypto bills.' Crypto-related super PACs have so far spent over $100 million on 2024 political races. Donald Trump, predictably, has now emerged as an exuberant crypto champion, and crypto dollars have played key roles in the primary defeats of two high-profile congressional progressives, New York’s Jamaal Bowman and Missouri’s Cori Bush. The sort of billionaire muscle-flexing that Big Oil and now Big Tech have inflicted upon American politics, we need to keep in mind, has an impact that goes beyond the political fates of individual politicians. That muscle-flexing serves to keep off the table any serious discussion of America’s fiercely unequal distribution of income and wealth. Ever notice one of those pre-election polls that ask the American public to rate the importance they give to the 'issues' facing the nation. The Pew Research Center, for instance, this past spring did extensive polling on what the Center deemed 16 'top problems' facing the United States, everything from inflation and illegal immigration to domestic terrorism and the affordability of health care. Nothing on that Pew list directly highlighted any aspect of our deep-seated economic inequality. The Pew 'issues' list made no reference whatsoever to concerns ranging from billionaire political influence to the vast gap between CEO and worker pay. And that should not surprise us. Inequality-avoiding 'issue' lists reflect the logical consequence of what happens in modern societies where wealth sits explosively concentrated. That wealth funds the think tank reports that shape the nation’s ongoing dialogue over what issues matter. That same wealth owns our nation’s most influential mass media and can strike fear, as the crypto political saga demonstrates, in lawmakers who don’t toe the plutocratic line. In the 2024 election cycle, that concentrated wealth has, by and large, gone unchallenged. We can’t afford to let that happen again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYt9YhHtUTRrHG	2024-11-05T09:20:06-08:00	
The Jerusalem Temple And Its Older Brother: The Ka’ba – OpEd	Narrated Abu Dhar: I said, 'O Allah's Messenger, which mosque was first built on the surface of the earth?' He said, 'Al- Masjid-ul-,Haram (in Mecca).' I said, 'Which was built next?' He replied 'The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in Jerusalem) .' I said, 'What was the period of construction between the two?' He said, 'Forty years.' (Sahih al-Bukhari 3366 In-book reference : Book 60, Hadith 45 USC-MSA web (English) reference : Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 585) The Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) and the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca are the two most well-known sites for monotheistic pilgrimage in the world. The Islamic Hajj to the Ka'ba in Makkah, and the Jewish Hajj to the Temple in Jerusalem, have been alternate swings of a single sacred pendulum connecting earthly humans to one monotheistic Divine source in the heavens. The Ka'ba was the original site of the Islamic Hajj. Destroyed in the days of Noah, it was later rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. After several centuries it was desecrated by later generations of idol worshipers. During the centuries while the Ka'ba was desecrated, Prophet Solomon built a Temple in Jerusalem for Jewish Haj on the site where Abraham bound his son Isaac as an offering to God. Four centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed in 587 BCE by the Babylonians. Then the Temple was rebuilt with the support of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, and lasted for almost six centuries. As Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE) states; Jewish pilgrims came to Jerusalem from the ends of the earth, and from all the compass points. But with the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, the pilgrimage Hajj aspect of the week-long harvest festival of Hag Sukkot, began a gradual decline in the spiritual consciousness of the Jewish People. The first time Hag/Hajj is mentioned in the Torah is in that famous scene when Prophets: 'Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go into the wilderness, that they may hold a feast (Hag) for me.'' [Exodus 5:1]or better: 'And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a Hajj/pilgrimage feast for me in the wilderness.'' But that one-time Hajj never occurred because Pharaoh refused to free the Jewish People thus incurring Divine wrath. The normative annual two Jewish Hajj week-long pilgrimages was the liberation celebration of Haj Passover; and especially the gratitude celebration of the harvest festival of Haj Sukkot. The Torah declares: 'Celebrate Hajj Sukkot for seven days after you have harvested the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns...Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Hajj of Matzah (Passover), the Hajj of Weeks, and the Hajj of Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 16:13-16) Hajj Sukkot was so important during the centuries when Solomon's Temple stood that the holy week of Sukkot was often called simply 'the Hajj' because of the very large numbers of Jews who came up to the Temple in Jerusalem. Hajj Passover is also celebrated as a weeklong pilgrimage. The third Hajj of Weeks is similar to Islamic Umrah, the non-mandatory lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, which may be performed at any time of the year. Although they share common rites, Umrah can be performed in less than a few hours; while Hajj is more time-consuming and involves many more rituals. The third Jewish Hajj of Weeks, like Umrah, is much simpler than Hajj Passover and can be performed in less than a few hours; on any one day during the seven weeks following Hajj Passover. The Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is the largest mosque in the world and it surrounds one of Islam's holiest places, the Ka-ba. Unlike other mosques which are gender segregated, men and women can worship at the Al-Masjid Al-Haram together. The Holy Temple (Beit ha-Mikdash) of Jerusalem had two successive Temples on the Temple Mount where there now stands the Dome of the Rock. The Jerusalem Temple complex was separated into different areas where male priests, men, women and non-Jews could all come to worship the one God. Why is the Ka'ba the older brother of the Jerusalem Temple? Prophet Abraham is connected to both sacred sites. Prophets Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the destroyed Ka'ba; and 40 years later, Prophets Abraham and Isaac were tested on the hill where the Jerusalem Temple would someday be built by Prophet Solomon. Since Islam is the last of the Abrahamic religions it is the most universal of them. Since Judaism is the first, and for over twelve centuries the only ongoing monotheistic religion, it is the least universal and the most pluralistic and tribal of the three Abrahamic religions. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for more than a dozen centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Prophet Abraham, the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) was the first, and only prophet, to successfully establish, through the descendants of his own two sons, three ongoing monotheistic religions, that have lasted into the 21st century: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; that now make up about half of the world's population. Judaism discourages people who are interested in converting to Judaism because Judaism is the only true religion. Indeed, most non-Jews who become Jewish do it to unify a marriage or because they have a Jewish ancestor even if they do not yet know it. Judaism is not a missionary faith and so doesn't actively try to convert non-Jewish people (in many countries anti-Jewish laws prohibited converting to Judaism for centuries). However, the modern Jewish community increasingly welcomes would-be converts. A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism. As Prophet Micah (4:5) states: 'For all the (other) peoples walk each in the name of its god; and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.' Five hundred years before the birth of Prophet Muhammad Rabbi Yishmael, one of Judaism's most important rabbis was recorded as saying: 'In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel ... They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple, and construct a building (the Dome of the Rock) on the site of the (ruined by the Romans) sanctuary'. Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) There is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. Just as the Ka'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). When all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Prophet Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Prophet Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBpWgqOMKUrZz	2024-11-05T09:18:38-08:00	
The Rise Of Political Extremism In Pakistan: A Test For Democrati...	As Christophe Jaffrelot observed, 'Pakistan has been branded by scholars as, among other things, an ideological state (like Israel) because of the political interpretation of Islam by its founding father.' Quaid-e-Azam promoted Islamic ideology not to stir up extremism, but to bring about unity and progress. However, the scenario at that time turned out to be quite different. He was firm in his beliefs until his death in 1948. His ideology never gave way to extremism. Today, the legacy of religious symbolism has shifted, often taken advantage of for political gains, and is now chipping away at the democratic foundations of Pakistan. The Political Utility of Religion Successive Pakistani leaders have learned to wield religious sentiment for political advantages. For example, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (1971-77) jumped on the bandwagon of Islamic socialism. General Zia-ul-Haq (1977-88) laid down strict Sharia law. Benazir Bhutto (1988-1990, 1993-1996) was not as overt as Zia, but she played the religious card to curry favor with conservatives. The Sharif family (1990-1993, 1997-1999, 2013-2017, 2024-present) kept up the tradition of using the religious card to win over public support. Imran Khan, the so-called Oxford graduate, went even further to win hearts and minds locally. In this regard, the U.S. president Ronal Reagan once said, 'If we ever forget that we are One Nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.' He stressed the connotation of recognizing the role of a higher power in guiding and unifying a nation. His objectives were to bring together the nation. However, the religious misinterpretation has widened the gap among Pakistanis. Addressing these issues requires us to look into the roots of the problem, stand up to extremist ideologies, reach out to different communities, break down barriers, and set aside differences to build a more inclusive society. Extremism’s Challenges to Democracy Religious radicalism has taken a firm hold in Pakistan's political mainstream. Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which entered the political mainstream in 2015, has garnered massive public support. They have staged massive sit-ins in Punjab until their demands were met. They wield strong public support and can bring the whole of Punjab to a standstill. If this issue is not nipped in the bud, it could spiral out of control. The empowerment of religious extremism tarnishes Pakistan's international standing. Evidence of this is Pakistan's placement on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list due to terror financing concerns. Economic Hardship as Fertile Ground for Extremism On the economic front, Pakistan is weathering the storm of the toughest period in its history. The lack of employment is adding fuel to the fire of misery. With a population of 220 million, more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. Inflation is on the rise with each passing day. In early 2023, inflation skyrocketed to nearly 38%, placing immense strain on lower- and middle-class households. As Aristotle said in this regard, 'Poverty Is the Parent of Revolution and Crime.' Poverty is the mother of crimes. Indeed, it can even lure in the educated class, who are like navigating a storm without hope of return. The lack of economic opportunities and high unemployment rates open the door for the youth to fall under the spell of extremist leaders, who are wandering like lost falcons. This creates fertile ground for the young population to soak up extremist ideas because they have too much time on their hands. It's essential for the government to step up and address these issues to turn the tide and curb the spread of extremism. The Role of Political Polarization The democratic history of Pakistan is rife with ups and downs. Political instability has become the norm. Leaders put their vested interests first, leaving the common people to bear the brunt of the consequences. Recently, the political rivalry between Imran Khan and the Democratic alliances has reached a boiling point, where it does not seem likely to return to normal. This widening gap further erodes the common will and their belief in democracy. Regional Security Implications The rise of extremism threatens the very fabric of South Asia's socio-economic stability. The resurgence of the Afghan Taliban in 2021, can embolden extremist organizations. The long, porous border cannot be properly monitored and sealed as it requires extensive resources, time, and effort. The government should keep a close watch on extremist ideology before it creates fertile ground for terrorism, like the TTP, to sink deeper roots in Pakistan. If this issue is not addressed promptly, it could snowball into an unmanageable crisis. In this scenario, the Kashmir issue paints a unique picture. For decades, Pakistan has been playing the religious card to rally massive support for the cause of Kashmir. Tension over the Kashmir issue creates a space for ultra-religious groups to push their narrative and gain traction. Pakistan leverages extremist ideology to drum up support and generate freedom fighters against India. In this regard, when the state nurtures extremism, there should be a proper cost-benefit analysis. Does this extremism provide short-term gains, or does it pose more challenges to the democracy upon which Pakistan was founded? Policymakers should tread carefully to ensure this does not pose a threat to the democratic values that are the bedrock of Pakistan's foundation. Strengthening Democratic Institutions as a Path Forward Countering extremism requires a multi-pronged approach, putting political differences aside and recognizing the urgency of the moment. Before the nation faces another wave of terrorism, it’s crucial to take action. Extremism plants the seeds of ideologies, which later morph into terrorism. First and foremost, economic reforms are the need of the hour. Poverty initiative programs like the Ehsaas program need to be ramped up and get to the bottom of the real causes of poverty. With a population of 220 million, more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. This sows the seeds of threats to democratic norms and values. When democratic societies are built on extractive politics, it shakes the very foundations of peace at the grassroots level. Unfortunately, Pakistan's education expenditure is in a miserable state. The outdated curriculum churns out degrees instead of skills. According to the World Bank report in 2022, Pakistan spends only 1.97 per cent of its GDP on education, whereas the tiny island of Maldives forks out4.58 per cent, Bhutan pumps in 4.7 per cent, and Nepal allocates 3.2 percent of their GDP. The meager investment in education means more illiterates will come out of a population of over 220 million. The more illiterate people there are, the more prone to extremism the nation becomes. Education can lay the groundwork for tolerance. Conclusion Political extremism is one of the biggest threats Pakistan is grappling with today. If it remains unchecked, it will not only threaten peace and stability at the domestic level, but also tarnish the nation's reputation on the international stage. It is high time for leaders to get to the root of the issue before the curse of extremism takes deeper root. Leaders should ramp up investment in education and bolster democratic institutions. By eradicating the curse of high illiteracy rates and tackling the root causes of extremism, the nation can secure its democratic future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBiCPTXDW2KOw	2024-11-05T09:16:48-08:00	
The ICC Case Against Hasina Wajid – OpEd	The recent downfall of Sheikh Hasina's regime in Bangladesh has opened a Pandora's Box of allegations against her government. As the dust settles, international attention has turned to the darker side of her 15-year rule, marked by widespread human rights abuses, political oppression, and a systematic dismantling of democratic norms. A plea filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) accuses Hasina Wajid of crimes against humanity, reigniting a debate on her government's brutal tactics to suppress dissent and consolidate power. The ICC plea against Hasina Wajid revives longstanding grievances about her alleged involvement in suppressing dissent, which her opponents claim echoes her father’s controversial legacy. Sheikh Hasina, during her back-to-back 15-year rule, had decimated the opposition and shut all safety valves, resulting in a volcanic eruption of public anger. Her opponents claimed her government had indulged in corruption, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. In addition, the administration, along with supporters of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, had fought pitched battles with demonstrators. At least 300 people were reportedly killed. This was the build-up to her eventual departure, which was followed by the Bangladesh army chief announcing an interim set-up. The unceremonious departure of the 'Iron Lady' marked the end of a governing paradigm that is best characterised as a competitive authoritarian regime, which, without the protests, may have transitioned into a one-party autocracy. While the immediate cause of her toppling stems from protests against the quota system, Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies and sense of invincibility had been creating structural conditions for eventual reckoning. Bangladeshi voices have consistently accused Hasina of targeting Islamic scholars and opposition figures, highlighting a deep-rooted concern over freedom and democracy under her rule. The recent deaths of students during protest intensify fears about human rights violations, fueling speculation that this violence stems from political motives backed by influential foreign allies. Since 2009, Hasina had ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist. Systematically, she clamped down all political opponents. Her main political rival, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who served twice as prime minister, was caught in a web of legal cases and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2018. The leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami also faced brutal persecution; many of them were convicted and executed by a so-called international crimes tribunal. In the final days before her unceremonious end, Hasina had exhorted Awami League supporters to fight the demonstrators, which brought the country to the brink of a civil war. Indian intelligence agency RAW’s support of Hasina raises concerns among Bangladeshis who fear that foreign interference is destabilizing their nation’s sovereignty. Allegations of Hasina’s involvement in the genocide of Bengali Muslims in prior decades have resurfaced, with many citing these claims as part of a larger pattern of state-led repression. The global community has turned a blind eye to Hasina’s government actions, calling for international accountability to prevent further bloodshed. The current charges bring an unprecedented spotlight on Bangladesh’s history of authoritarianism, raising questions about democratic erosion in South Asia. Hasina’s crackdowns on Islamic scholars were attempts to consolidate power by marginalizing voices she perceives as threats to her political ideology. The ICC plea serves as a critical test for Bangladesh’s judicial independence, as many question whether local courts would have pursued these charges under political pressure. Calls for justice are echoing beyond Bangladesh, with rights organizations urging the ICC to address these alleged crimes and set a precedent for protecting human rights in the region. India provided covert support to Hasina, enabling her to create a parallel military force within Bangladesh, which some claim has roots in the Mukti Bahini—an alliance viewed as an extension of India’s influence within the country. Hasina’s close ties with India have enabled her to control Bangladesh’s security forces, allegedly using a network reminiscent of the Mukti Bahini to silence dissent and enforce pro-India policies under the guise of national security. India’s backing allowed Hasina to cultivate a 'shadow army' that operates with little accountability, reviving fears of a Mukti Bahini-like entity acting as a tool of intimidation against political opponents and Islamic groups. As South Asia’s longest-ruling authoritarian leader, Hasina spent her entire politics controlling all the unknowns through authoritarian approaches. Ironically, it was these very approaches that ultimately cemented her downfall. Only time will tell if justice will prevail in Bangladesh. The ICC case against Hasina Wajid marks a pivotal moment in the nation's history, raising hopes for accountability and a brighter future. As the world watches, the outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications for the region and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBmLfZrvquG-s	2024-11-05T09:15:17-08:00	
Kamala Would Be A Great President, One Of the Best, And Trump Doe...	The name of the president of the most powerful countries in the world will soon be known. I hope that Kamala will be named president of the US, a country that, contrary to what is not recognized by ungenerous critics, has led a unique cultural leadership in the history of the planet. And this is the fact to be celebrated while waiting for the appointment of the next president. And this is one of the greatest contributions that we could expect from a Kamala victory. Knowledge is democracy. Knowledge is the highroad to the end of discrimination, the real virus of life’s desease. Respect of law is democracy. We should remember that in the contest between Kamala and Donald. With America we have entered the democracy of knowledge era, departing from a time of unlimited masses of individuals historically ignored by the development of knowledge and kept at levels of total and perennial inferiority. Never in the cultural history of humanity has there been anything comparable to the democracy of knowledge in terms of numbers, produced by the Internet and now by AI. Thank you America! We owe you gratitude for this unparalled democratic achievement in all parts of the world. Again, knowledge is democracy. The passage of writing from symbols and ideograms to letters made it possible to transcribe possible knowledge. This was a great step in democracy. The introduction of movable type made knowledge available to all who could read. An even higher step in the democracy process. Certainly the institution of the Justinian code was a incredible cultural revolution because for the first time the public power was considered as a citizen and obliged to respect the laws, and this was made available in writing to the courts. Again a giant step forward for democracy. The persistence of common law instead of codified law is a cultural legal delay that opens the way to discrimination and arbitrariness. In substance, all great cultural achievements made with regard to democracy were linked to knowledge. That is why the Internet and AI revolutions are one of the largest planetary democratic revolutions for the masses to have ever occurred. America has made it possible. Today all of us, in the Western and Eastern worlds, North and South, are indebted to the USA for this spectacular democratic revolution of knowledge, a revolution that is improving production, the quality of health and above all favors access to knowledge without national or caste limits to billions of individuals of any nation, ethnicity: this is the most phenomenal gift of the democracy of knowledge produced by America. Let’s not forget this, and it should be remembered for whatever one might say about say about politicians, including Trump, that this gigantic step forward for democracy is the result of private initiative, of the market, of business, not of the government. The merit of the American government is that it has not conditioned private initiative, but even promoted it for security reasons, That is a matter of fact. Of course, there are downsides to American politics that should not be ignored in terms of democracy in foreign states. Often it protects leaders who aren't democratic, say for instance in South America, but as the old American saying goes, 'there is no such thing as a free lunch.' But what does this introduction on knowledge and democracy have to do with the electoral outcome that is expected? It has everthing to do with it because the United States is, and remains, the driving force of modern progress in the entire world -- and those who benefit from this in the rest of the world must recognize this beyond the differences between the two candidates. For me, Kamala is a fantastic candidate who would bring back the role of law to American society. She would do it, because she is an intelligent woman in her own right, she is not the result of media manipulations. She would certainly make possible a phenomenal cultural leap in gender equality that Obama was unable to produce due to racaial discrimination. We would have expected Obama to take a historic step in this fight against discrimination - an area in which instead he failed. Obama as the first black president should have eradicated racism from America, betraying just expectations. Just as we would expect from a Jewish American president a definitive eradication of religious reasons from political discrimination, as did Kennedy as a Catholic president. Today, or rather yesterday in 2020, no one cared that Biden was Catholic, just as nobody should care if XY president were jewish. There are cultural political expectations that non-Americans expect from America. Those same reasons that lead us to condemn in no uncertain terms the racist and disriminatory policy of Benjamin Netanyahu who is succeeding in the epic enterprise of alienating Israel from the favor of those who consider the Holocaust a heinous tragedy to be remembered continuously. Kamala is a special person. If she wins the election, I believe she will be an exceptionally good president. However, Kamala has also failed to understand that there are two elements in the Trump campaign of enormous significance for the United States and for the world. That is in the area domestic politics and the other in international politics. With respect to domestic politics, we must condemn the tax exemption of the super-rich that Trump will promote, whether they are individuals or companies. But we must not forget that they constitute the most powerful engine of American development and that as such must be protected and safeguarded. The American dynamo is one of innovation and entrepreneurial culture, small and large. Trump defends this, but he is does so in the wrong way. On the international level, the fact that the Ukraine war was heavily funded against Russia with NATO aggression through the increasingly stringent encirclement of that country is a resounding diplomatic error. There is a historian of economics of great value who teaches at my alma mater, Columbia University, Jeffrey Sachs who makes this magnificently clear. Ukraine is a sharp thorn in Russia's side that NATO, ignoring Secretary of State Baker's commitments to Gorbachev, and violates a total absence of historical sense and diplomatic vision. The Ukrainian war, certainly fostered even if not justified, by efforts to bring NATO a stone's throw from Moscow, has caused a strengthening of Russia and China relations, which a diplomat like Zbigniew Brzezinski would have judged to be one of the greatest possible diplomatic mistakes in American history. Trump says he will correct this situation and that is a very good thing. As I said above, I believe Kamala will be a phenomenal president if she is elected. But if the next president is Trump, with all his blatant flaws, he has good points in the vast area of things we don’t like. Let's expect from him two great policies worthy of the best cause that must be respected in the best interest of Europe itself. Pushing for entrepreneurship in America is good, very good, and solving peacefully Ukraine’s war is even better. Both goals are worth pursuing not only in the interest of America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBpkqqfhnNjbd	2024-11-05T09:12:34-08:00	
Beyond The Revolution: Building A New Bangladesh – Analysis	By Rimon Tanvir Hossain (FPRI) -- Once touted as the 'Iron Lady' of Asia, Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was both the longest-serving Bangladeshi head of state and the world’s longest-serving female. However, on August 5, 2024, her reign came to an unceremonious end as a student-led revolution, which started after the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstated a quota system for government jobs on June 5, 2024, forced her to flee to India and resign from office. Today, 'July 36' refers to the date of Hasina’s resignation and subsequent collapse of her Awami League government, which has also been heralded in pop culture as Bangladesh’s 'Second Independence.' According to a report by the Human Rights Support Society, more than 30,000 people were injured and more than 875 were killed in the collective unrest, 77 percent of whom died from gunshot wounds. While Nobel laureate and social entrepreneur, Dr. Muhammad Yunus’s appointment to lead the fifty-three-year-old nation—born after a revolution celebrated and strongly supported by Western capitals to provide Bangladesh a fresh start—was positively received at home and abroad, his task of assuring that the country’s institutions regain public trust, once captured by Hasina’s fifteen-year electoral autocracy, is daunting. The growing challenges ranging from Islamist parties, communal tensions, surging inflation, and inability to hold perpetrators of the revolution’s victims accountable seem distant from reaching the solutions the Yunus-led interim government promised: establishing reforms in the election commission, civil administration, and implementing judiciary and security forces in time for the upcoming elections. The Roots of Unrest: The Quota Reform Movement The student-led protests, initially known as the Quota Reform Movement, sought to change the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) quota which was done away with in 2018 but brought back with the June 5, 2024, High Court decision. The BCS Quotas have a deeper connection to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, due to the fact that 30 percent of the 56 percent of reserved civil service positions were reserved for descendants of Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters ('Muktijuddhos'). The Muktijuddhos fought against the Pakistan Army and helped win independence in the nine-month war with Indian and Soviet support. Over the years, the fact that the biggest quota—relative to the 10 percent of positions reserved for women, 10 percent reserved for people from underdeveloped districts, 5 percent for indigenous people, and 1 percent for people with disabilities—went to families strongly associated with the Awami League for their role in winning the 1970 Pakistan General Elections (which led to full-scale war) became increasingly perceived as a base forconsolidating the Awami League through entrenchment in the state bureaucracy. The BCS positions offered stable, lifelong employment with government-provided cars, housing, and other benefits, which the students leading the protests argued was designed to favor Awami League supporters. Rising youth unemployment, which has gone from 8 percent when Hasina came to power in 2008 to 16 percent, coupled with bias in the state bureaucracy to provide loans and other benefits to private-sector leaders associated with the Awami League, further added to the intensity of this Quota Reform Movement. Behind the quota was the even larger electoral autocracy operated by Hasina and her Awami League party, who after winning her electoral mandate in 2008, continually crushed the opposition and repeated this every five years through ballot stuffing, strong-arming the media, and voter intimidation. The US State Department issued stern warnings ahead of both the 2018 election and prior to the most recent January 2024 election. Deputy Assistant Secretary of South and Central Asian Affairs Afreen Akhter offered Hasina an ultimatum to allow for a caretaker-run election in October 2023, which the Awami League abolished in 2011. In the lead-up to the most recent January 2024 election, the Awami League also faced US and E.U. scrutiny and even sanctions with regard to their domestic security forces—namely, their elite paramilitary force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). On December 10, 2021, the US Treasury Department placed sanctions on RAB as well as its former and current leaders for human rights abuses. Sweden-based investigative and public interest journalism platform founded in 2019 by exiled Bangladeshi journalist Tasneem Khalil, Netra News, also reported how RAB ran a secret prison for dissidents and other opponents to the Hasina regime called 'Aynaghor' (House of Mirrors). This was followed by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s May 24, 2023, announcement of visa restrictions on former and current pro-Awami League and opposition officials for undermining democracy ahead of the January 2024 elections. A statement issued by the US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller mentioned 'these individuals include members of law enforcement, the ruling party, and the political opposition' and that 'their immediate family may be found ineligible for entry into the United States.' Ultimately, Hasina evaded all these carrots and sticks to allow a free and fair election on January 2024, while the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the election. This timeline of sanctions and other disciplinary measures made by the United States was put into perspective within the Biden administration’s wider democracy promotion campaign, of which Bangladesh was a clear target for its strong people-to-people ties, business and trade interests, and diaspora-lobbying with respect to human rights. The Quota Reform Movement in the perspective of this wider US democracy promotion agenda proves that the Hasina regime was unwise not to heed warnings and shot itself in the foot by relentlessly capturing institutions and leveraging their resources to crush any sign of opposition. A Slow Start to a Quick Fix: Yunus’s Interim Government Yunus received much fanfare after being sworn in as Chief Advisor to the Bangladesh interim government on August 8, 2024, only three days after Hasina’s resignation and flight for refuge in India. The eighty-four-year-old Nobel Laureate was invited to lead the new transitional government after the student advisory board picked him as their leader, but received the more requisite support of Bangladesh’s only surviving institution—the Bangladesh Army. Immediately upon Yunus’s swearing-in, lawlessness, communal tensions, difficulty for the country’s rapidly growing economy, and accountability for revolution victims were all on the agenda. Hasina and the Awami League were notorious for summoning all arms of the state’s security apparatus on protestors and civilians alike. These forces included not only the RAB but also the Bangladesh Border Guard forces as well as the student wing of the Awami League, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). The Chhatra League in particular has earned much notoriety, as their coordination with government security forces since their 2019 murder of Abrar Fahad—a dissenter whose Facebook post expressing concern over a water deal with India led to him being killed in a Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) dorm—was on full display during the Quota Reform Movement. While the country underwent internet shutdowns during the Quota Reform Movement and protestors were subject to 'shoot-on-sight' orders by Hasina, the Chhatra League was provided arms, ammunition, and access to the internet to better coordinate their efforts in stopping the protests. Following Hasina’s ousting, the estimated 100,000 members of the Chhatra League have been abandoned as targets for retribution after the Yunus-led interim government declared BCL a 'terrorist organization' under the 2009 Anti-Terrorism Act and banned it on Wednesday, October 23, 2024, for their serious misconduct during the July unrest. Even though the Yunus-led interim government has overseen Dhaka University banning the activities of political party student wings on September 19, 2024, which also includes the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami student branches, Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dol and Bangladeshi Chhatra Shibir, clashes between these groups continue. Additionally, Washington has expressed much concern over the need to contain the Islamist elements operating within Bangladesh, which Hasina’s Awami League and successive Indian governments were keen on clamping down on. On August 28, 2024, still within the month of Hasina’s ousting, the Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s main Islamist party which has never earned more than eighteen out of the Bangladeshi Parliament’s three hundred seats, had their 2008-imposed ban lifted on them. Additionally, the day before on August 27, 2024, the leader of the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) leader, Jashimuddin Rahmaani, was freed by the Yunus-led interim government. Rahmaani was originally jailed on August 2, 2013, for his role in murdering an atheist blogger and since his release has requested Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of the neighboring West Bengal state of India, to 'declare independence from India,' further suggesting to hoist 'Islamist flags in their capital of Kolkata.' These recent developments have led to a perception in New Delhi and Western capitals that Yunus is allowing free reign to the most dangerous elements of Bangladesh’s Islamist cadres, who are actively preparing for the upcoming elections which have yet to be given a date. Of immense concern to both India and its transnational diaspora has been the extent of communal violencethat has rocked Bangladesh after Hasina’s ousting. According to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist ChristianUnity Council, there have been over 2,010 attacks on Hindus or their properties in fifty-two districts out of the country’s sixty-four districts, and five Hindus have been killed in these attacks, two of which were confirmed as Awami League members. Due to the Awami League’s close ties to India, performative commitment to secularism, and an iron-fist policy towards Islamists, the Hindu minority in Bangladesh votes in majority for the Awami League and is also perceived by Islamists as a key constituency that lobbies for pro-India policies. Many Bangladeshi, Indian, and Western analysts, journalists, and commentators alike have argued that the Yunus government has done a generally decent job in addressing the communal tensions, with visits to temples and urging students and the common citizen to protect minorities themselves. On August 6, 2024, Congressmen Raja Krishnamoorthi and Shri Thanedar wrote separate letters to Blinken, advocating on behalf of the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. On the same day, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, US Senator Ben Cardin, released a statement urging Bangladesh to form a responsible caretaker government 'that will promptly organize inclusive democratic elections. The people of Bangladesh deserve a government that honors their voices, respects their will, and upholds the dignity of their nation.' On September 20, 2024, US Senators Cardin, Murphy, Van Hollen, and Merkley issued a letter to Yunus directly, urging reforms and accountability in Bangladesh. The letter stated: 'While many celebrate this new chapter in Bangladesh, a concerning volume of those celebrations have turned violent, with documented reports of reprisals targeting police as well as minority Hindu communities and those perceived to be supporters of Hasina’s government. As a result, the country has witnessed gaps in law enforcement and a lack of protections for those facing violent attacks, including members of the Hindu community and Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazaar.' Four days later, Yunus met with US President Joe Biden at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), where Biden congratulated Yunus and affirmed a close partnership between the United States and Bangladesh rooted in democratic values and strong people-to-people ties. Yunus gifted Blinken, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Italian Prime Minister GiorgiaMeloni with a book of paintings known as the 'Art of Triumph,' capturing scenes from the July 36 student-led revolution. The gesture of gifting these Western heads of state photo books was in line with trade and education diplomacy interests as roughly 10,000 Bangladeshi students study in Canadian universities, making Canada a 'study destination of choice' among Bangladeshi students, and the European Union’s role as Bangladesh’s largest trading partner, accounting for 20.7% of Bangladesh’s trade. At the General Assembly, Yunus also met with Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines, where they reaffirmed their commitment to expanding the two countries’ bilateral cooperation. The long-held demand by the Awami League government for the Pakistani government to apologize for its genocideduring the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and Pakistan’s unwillingness to do so has held back bilateral ties according to Foreign Policy columnist and South Asia Brief writer Michael Kugelman. However, while steps were made in regard to this longstanding issue in 2021 with an exchange of letters between former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Hasina, Yunus’s willingness to engage Pakistan without mention of the 1971 chapter suggests this grievance in bilateral relations may not be as much of a constraint in Bangladesh-Pakistan relations post-Hasina. While some of the Awami League ministers were detained—some on their way out of the country—many fled during the month of the student-led revolution. Bangladeshi news sources like the Daily Star and Prothom Alo have documented how a total of thirty current and former Awami League ministers weredetained and are currently being subject to proceedings. Meanwhile, Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, who served as an advisor on Information and Communications Technology affairs to Hasina, has hired a former Trump lobbyist and actively operates as the de facto leaderof the Awami League in an attempt to make a comeback for the upcoming election. On the day of Diwali, Thursday, October 31, 2024, US presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted that he 'strongly condemned the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh,' further stating that it would have 'never happened on my watch,' before tying these developments to Ukraine and the Southern border. In the same tweet, he promised to 'also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left' and 'also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Narendra Modi.' This timely statement by Donald Trump signals both a nod to the Indian American vote as well as Hindu Nationalist and Awami League lobbies, attempting to undercut Kamala Harris’s appeal to Indian Americans by explicitly claiming that she 'ignored Hindus,' while also signaling a preference for the Awami League. Viewed within the backdrop of US electoral politics, Bangladesh is a partisan issue, and given Yunus’s former criticism of Trump back in 2016, the interim government can expect a less supportive White House if Trump returns to the White House after the 2024 US general elections. In Between Rising Powers: Bangladesh in the Eyes of New Delhi and Beijing The collapse of Hasina’s regime was a strategic failure for the Awami League’s long-time and premier supporter—India. Since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, where India played a leading role through covert support to the guerilla war, India has sustained a favorable trade imbalance, security cooperation, political alignment, and common cause over the containment of Islamist elements within Bangladesh. However, recent developments and the trajectory set for the next Bangladeshi election seem to swayagainst New Delhi’s favor, as anti-Indian sentiments have reached all-time highs and the Awami League has very little legroom to launch a comeback, given their reputation from their bloody crackdown on the Quota Reform Movement. Another key supporter of Hasina’s regime was the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Bangladesh is the second-biggest destination of Chinese military imports according to the Stockholm Peace International Research Institute (SIPRI). Between 2016 and 2020, Bangladesh bought 17 percent of all Chinese military exports and two-thirds of the Bangladesh Air Force weapon arsenal is currently made up of Chinese weapons. In line with the 2002 Defense Cooperation Agreement signed between China and Bangladesh, making China the only country with a broad defense agreement with Bangladesh, Dhaka has also inaugurated a Chinese-built naval base for the Bangladesh Navy at Pekua in Cox’s Bazar in 2023, BNS Sheikh Hasina, where two Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) officers were in attendance. According to a CSIS report entitled 'Submarine Diplomacy,' published in November 2023, commercial satellite imagery revealed significant progress on this naval base, which both signaled Beijing deepening its influence in the Bay of Bengal while also attempting to strengthen ties between Bangladesh and Myanmar, aimed at undercutting New Delhi’s influence in its neighborhood. Since 2010, half of Myanmar’s and two-thirds of Bangladesh’s arms imports have come from China. However, Bangladesh’s military still conducts annual bilateral exercises with the Indian military, most recently in October 2023, showing how Dhaka balances India and China even as it actively courts Beijing. Over a fourth of world trade passes through the Bay of Bengal each year, with ports located in the bay that handle 33 percent of global trade and half of the world’s container traffic. Additionally, the Bay of Bengal is located at a strategic chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. This chokepoint is vital because it controls maritime access to the Far East and is used by a large amount of international shipping. Upon Hasina’s ousting, in one of her first statements from her refuge in a military base in India, she stated that she could have remained in power had she acquiesced to a US demand for a military base in Bangladeshi territory — St. Martin’s Island. The Padma Bridge, inaugurated in February 2022, is Bangladesh’s largest bridge, standing at 3.88 miles in length and 60 feet wide, able to carry 10,000 tons, and projected to boost the country’s GDP by 1.2 percent. Proposed in 1998, the bridge had many setbacks in construction due to the withdrawal of support by the World Bank in 2015 after allegations of corruption. A Chinese engineering firm, China Major Bridge Co., hadtaken over construction of the bridge following the World Bank exit. The Padma Bridge is the largest bridge built by a Chinese company outside of China and was dubbed the 'dream bridge,' by the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen. Ambassador Wen further stated that not only will the bridge 'contribute to the connectivity in South Asia,' but also that whenever China’s President Xi Jinping 'mentions Bangladesh, he will mention the Padma Bridge.' Additionally, a much-needed $12.65 billion dollar nuclear power plant in Rooppur is pledged to be 90 percent financed by Russia as of 2023. Putin has also made inroads in Dhaka, helping the country shift away from energy dependence on India, while also benefitting from Bangladesh abstaining from a recent 2023 UN vote to cease the war in Ukraine. Washington’s Approach for Bangladesh’s Role in the Indo-Pacific Bangladesh plays a tough balancing act in the Indo-Pacific due to its immense population, resource endowments, and strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. This was played to Hasina’s hand, who sought to balance neighboring Beijing and New Delhi while maintaining Bangladesh’s role as an important trading partner to the United States and European Union. Her capture of state institutions, momentum for turning the country into a one-party state, and ability to navigate the trail of Western sanctions, all while maintaining consistent economic growth at a 7 percent annual rate, attests to this small-state-leverage playing larger powers off one another. Ultimately, mass rebellion and inability to provide effective governance and economic opportunity succeeded where coercive US measures could not. With Yunus at the helm, Bangladesh is under a transitory governance scheme where Washington has a more receptive head of state. However, commitment to free and fair elections that releases far-right Islamist elements, while committing to deepening Western and Indian interests, presents a conflict of interest. More pressing, the Chinese inroads made in Bangladesh with BNS Sheikh Hasina, military imports, and the Padma Bridge have distanced Washington as a strategic competitor in the region. The steps Washington takes next with Bangladesh must account for the need to assure an effective democratic framework for elections, state security and law and order for the regime that assumes power after the interim government holds its election. The announcement that Yunus would not run himself and the momentum gained by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Islamist parties has raised alarms in New Delhi and Western capitals, with Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh recommending at the Indian Air Force Commanders’ Conference to be ready for 'new challenges' in response to the changing posture of the incumbent and coming regime in Dhaka. In response, the former Bangladesh Army Chief of Staff, Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, has led the Bangladesh military to assess putting the country on war footing under a model of the French levée en masse—referring to the French Revolution’s policy of requiring all able-bodied men to serve the military to defend the nation. Washington is uniquely poised to help Dhaka deter any confrontation with New Delhi, while also reeling the strategically-located country from China’s embrace ahead of the 2027 projected Chinese invasion ofTaiwan. Diplomatic overtures and economic cooperation can collectively aid in preventing Bangladesh from becoming another autocratic regime, as well as from becoming a vassal for Beijing’s interests in the Indo-Pacific neighboring its regional rival, India. However, Yunus must hold the line against Islamists, as Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen, recently praised Jamaat-e-Islami as a 'well-organized party.' Yunus must also continually court the United States and European Union in order to reel Bangladesh from the crosshairs of China’s grand strategy in South Asia. While the Yunus-led interim government’s decision to lift the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami was rooted in ending the Awami League’s one-party governance, Beijing’s open embrace of Islamist forces who have historically antagonized Washington, New Delhi, and European capitals has raised alarms for the country’s trade, people-to-people ties, and defense posture. A Bangladesh where institutions are captured by the anti-Awami League axis of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami will allow Beijing unprecedented leverage in Bangladesh, given both their anti-Indian and anti-Western track record, ongoing rhetoric, and overall platforms. The Yunus-led interim government is Washington’s last window ofopportunity to chart a prosperous and democratic Bangladesh for decades to come, or it can serve as a missed opportunity that offered China and Russia an indefinite foothold.

Iran And Russia Seek To Reshape Global Hegemony With New Bilatera...	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met in Kazan, Russia, during the latest BRICS (a loose political economic grouping originally consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) summit, held on October 22–24 (Kremlin.ru, October 23; see EDM, October 28). This follows an earlier meeting between the two leaders on bilateral ties in Ashgabat on October 11 (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, October 11). Given that Iran has recently inaugurated a new president who seeks to improve foreign relations, the bilateral agenda was quite expansive, accounting for both countries’ interest in developing closer ties in light of their respective conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Both sides have found themselves in a similar position—isolated by the West, targeted by sanctions, and eager for new allies—and look to establish closer political and military cooperation. Moscow and Tehran are motivated to introduce an agreement that would reflect their changing preferences and underline their shared opposition to the collective West. Cooperation between the two countries has seen incremental improvement across various fronts since 2022 despite mutual distrust. This trend is expected to culminate in the signing of a comprehensive agreement that promises to redefine the scope of their strategic partnership (Amwaj, September 19). Although an exact date for such a signing has not yet been established, both Moscow and Tehran will likely look to ratify some sort of treaty by the end of the year, as both sides are eager to quickly sign an agreement, demonstrated by their ambitious designs in bilateral ties (see EDM, September 18). The exact contents of what would be in this agreement are unknown. Compared with a previous treaty signed by the two countries more than twenty years ago, the expected agreements will likely involve much more extensive political, economic, and cultural ties (Russian Council, July 22, 2021). A heavy emphasis will likely be placed on military and security cooperation, as this is the cornerstone of their expanding relationship (see EDM, July 22, December 12, 2022, March 6, 2023, February 22). More precisely, drone and missile production is sure to top Moscow and Tehran’s agendas, given that their respective conflicts with Ukraine and Israel have proven to both the importance of such weapon systems (see Terrorism Monitor, November 4, 2022; see EDM, July 22, 2022, September 14, 2023, October 16). The two sides are also likely to double down on greater training assistance and Iran’s purchase of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and potentially S-400 missile systems (Euronews, October 25; Kyiv Post, October 27). Outside of defense, the new agreement is also set to extend collaboration into areas such as trade, media, education, space exploration, cultural exchange, and a common payment system (see EDM, December 13, 2021, May 1; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, August 10, 2022; Iran International, December 15, 2023; The Moscow Times, November 4). Moscow and Tehran will also be eager to resolve disagreements impeding the construction of major gas pipelines in Iran, implementing liquified natural gas projects, and undertaking swap operations involving natural gas and oil products (Iran International, October 14, 2023; The Moscow Times, October 1). Infrastructure will be a critical topic of discussion. Moscow and Tehran have tried to improve and expand the vital International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) (see EDM, June 7, 2023, March 6; Tehran Times, September 17). Running along the Caspian Sea and connecting Russia with Iran’s southern ports, creating access to the Indian Ocean and South Asian markets, this corridor has been a historic trading route between Russia and Iran since the sixteenth century, used by both to bypass Ottoman influence and access distant markets across the region. While Iran and Russia have been historical adversaries more often than not—having vied for influence in the Caucasus and Middle East throughout the imperial era—their cooperation does have historical roots. In the late sixteenth century, Safavid Iran and the Russian Tsardom joined forces to counter Ottoman expansion. Similarly, in today’s context, Russia and Iran’s warming relationship is driven by shared grievances against the West and their common desire to challenge the world order. Tehran’s support for proxy regimes throughout the Middle East and Moscow’s support for the Syrian regime have both been viewed as examples of their efforts to counter Western influence in the region (see EDM, July 31, 2017, February 5, July 29, October 7; Anadolu, September 28). For Iran, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and its subsequent isolation from Western diplomatic institutions acted as a defining moment that pushed Russia into closer relations with the Islamic Republic. Isolated from Western trade and facing heavy sanctions, Russia’s pivot to the Middle East and Asia has made Iran an indispensable partner. Iran has supported Russia with advanced weaponry, and these budding ties even extended to proxy conflicts, such as Moscow’s alleged support for the Houthis in Yemen, even at the risk of damaging Russia’s relationships with other regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have traditionally opposed the Houthis (see EDM, August 8, October 7). Moscow’s shift to a more pro-Iran stance has become much more pronounced in recent years. Even so, direct military support in Iran’s conflicts, particularly with Israel—which harbors a large Russian population— remains unlikely. Nevertheless, leaders in Iran and Russia envision a multipolar world premised on challenging Western geopolitical and economic hegemony. This fits into a more comprehensive continuum of countries, China being the principal actor, looking to create alternative alliance networks and key geopolitical leaders globally. The rise of transnational organizations such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization marks a new era in global geopolitics, with Russia and Iran positioning themselves as ascending powers (see EDM, July 15, October 16; see China Brief, July 12).

China’s Expanding Role In The Middle East – Analysis	By Mauricio D. Aceves Extensive discourse is taking place regarding the power vacuum in the Middle East following the waning presence of the U.S. In this frame, regional actors have increased their influence over the specific issue of stability. Hence, it is crucial for all countries to diversify their ties when seeking a new balance, beyond their familiar stakes of economic interest and energy security. In this scenario, China offers an alternative, furthering its early strategic engagement around investments, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and geopolitical calibrations, to fit smoothly alongside a new, multipolar order narrative. The echoes of this strategy are also heard in other latitudes. In parallel, China has also increased its presence in Latin America, primarily through investments in communications, technology, and infrastructure for connectivity. The role of China in the Middle East can be categorized into a troika of domains—the economic and geopolitical scope includes the supply chain, financial systems, investments, technology and technical knowledge transfers, trade and energy security. The second refers to bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, including the convergence inside organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), BRICS, and the many displays of diplomacy, from the cultural to the military. The third reflects the political approach with non-state actors and the open communications channels through the political labyrinth of the region. China does not aim to control regional dynamics or guarantee security. China’s policy is to be the master of economic dialogue and the use of incentives while avoiding direct involvement in conflicts and creating adversaries. Economic development is the sword, and pragmatism the road. The Middle East has historically stood at the crossroads of geopolitics, even for China’s vision. The Persian Gulf provides China with over a third of the oil it imports;[1] Qatar is China’s most significant source of imported gas, and Turkmenistan is the second.[2] Nowadays, China is the largest trade partner of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia.[3] The region became an essential destination for Chinese exports and services linked with infrastructure, communications and information technologies. More than 60% of maritime trade between Europe and China[4] crosses the many seas of the region: the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Oman, the Bab al-Mandeb and Hormuz Straits. Beijing has invested in Oman’s Duqm Port and has built oil pipelines to the Port of Fujairah and facilities at Khalifa Port in the UAE. It holds stakes in at least 20 port projects in the Middle East and North Africa. Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen remain potential sites for further Chinese port development. This intensifying web of possibilities and realities is the first step of a growing China presence in the Middle Eastern supply chain and mirrors the world’s geopolitical priorities. However, conflicts compromise the transit through these chokepoints between the Indo-Pacific and the Mediterranean waters. The Houthis’ reactivity in the Gulf of Aden, the instability in the Horn of Africa or even the chapter of the stuck Evergreencontainer ship in the Suez, show how vulnerable these areas are. Avoiding exposure has been China’s central policy, but in the foreign domain, China has certainly been active and visible. The Chinese military base in Djibouti at the entrance of the Red Sea and the naval presence close to Hormuz, ostensibly aims to deter piracy and more easily participate in joint military exercises. So far, these cards have not been used to interfere in ongoing conflicts, but only to protect Chinese assets and guard commercial routes. Military engagement is for Beijing, the last option when threats to overseas national interests are imminent. Nor does China perceive military non-state actors or ongoing regional conflicts as direct threats. This fact conditioned its approach to relying on diplomacy rather than military engagement. But this strategy has limits. Scalations and the spread of conflict might involve different approaches. Providing technology and components for dual purposes, civil and military, or supporting the development of the military industry[5] [6] have been small but significant steps toward military involvement through business means. The SCO, BRICS, the Digital Silk Road and the Global Security Initiative show that China’s presence deep inside the arteries of the Middle East have entered a new stage of engagement. The comprehensive strategic partnerships with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE demonstrate the accurate calibration of diplomacy, navigating the political differences. Even considering the long-lasting support to Palestine and the condemnations of military actions of Israel in Palestine and Lebanon, China has developed economic ties with Israel and simultaneously reinforced relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran. China is the top trading partner for Iran and Israel.[7] China’s 25-year cooperation agreement with Iran signed in 2021, and the mediatory role played by Beijing in the Joint Trilateral Statement with Iran and Saudi Arabia, gives China legitimacy and reduces the perception of China as a rival. Earlier this year, Chinese envoys met Hamas’ political leaders in Doha; concurrently, China attended talks with top Israeli diplomats and the Palestinian Authority, and later in July, China hosted a summit with representatives of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in Beijing. These interactions seek to maintain communication with all actors, even when political and warfare conditions make mediation efforts an unviable task. However, diplomatic inertia over the Middle East appears to be taking root, especially with the devastating situation in Palestine and the multiple fronts opened by this Pandora’s box. Other actions could be analyzed if the conflict spreads and harms global stability. China’s ties with the Middle East are traversing into uncharted seas. The weight of China has grown in the Middle East. Nowadays, it’s easy to find banks with China’s flag in the region’s leading cities. China’s embassies in Riyadh, Cairo, and Tehran are more influential than ever. China’s ability to understand partners’ motivations has resulted in a foreign policy that is a mix of incentives and defined consequences; it is aware of the importance of establishing a transparent set of geopolitical priorities in a long-term frame. A new version of the 'Great Game'[8] has started in the Middle East, and its inner powers are in the leading roles, but China will be that player always on the chessboard with more pieces and moves in hand, than ever.

Government Efficiency Is A Tall Order For Musk – OpEd	Former president Donald Trump says Elon Musk may serve as the 'Secretary of Cost-Cutting,' and Musk foresees a Department of Government Efficiency under his command. The SpaceX boss might dial it back to a previous attempt during the Carter Era. The victor over Gerald Ford in 1976, Carter tackled inefficiency in the federal bureaucracy with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. According to Office of Personnel Management, the 'keystone' of the Act was the Senior Executive Service, (SES) established to 'ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality.' SES leaders 'possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective on government and a public service commitment that is grounded in the Constitution.' The SES bosses also 'serve in the key positions just below the top Presidential appointees. SES members are the major link between these appointees and the rest of the Federal workforce. They operate and oversee nearly every government activity in approximately 75 Federal agencies.' Taxpayers had a right to wonder how it worked out. 'When Jimmy Carter set up the Senior Executive Service nearly three years ago, it was touted as the ideal place for the government’s top managers, an elite niche where Uncle Sam’s best and brightest would toil at greater risk but with the promise of greater rewards,' wrote Karlyn Barker of the Washington Post in October, 1981, 'but it hasn’t worked out that way.' Many SES members complained about pay, promotions, and the bonus system. On the other hand, Barker provided little assessment of SES job performance that would merit higher pay. The SES represented less than one percent of the federal workforce but between 2008 and 2011 SES bosses received more than $340 million in bonuses, on top of annual salaries that ranged from $119,000 to $179,000. The bonuses were not subject to budget cuts and SES influence continued to surge. According to a 2015 report, the SES boasted 217 members in the army, 318 in the Navy, 179 in the Air Force, 473 in the Department of Defense, 594 at Homeland Security, and a full 786 at the Department of Justice. 'All other' federal agencies accounted for 1,785 SES members, with a grand total of 7,791. In his 2015 executive order, 'Strengthening the Senior Executive Service,' President Obama set out to 'facilitate career executive continuity between administrations.' By May 31, 2016, agencies with 20 or more SES positions were to develop a plan 'to increase the number of SES members who are rotating to improve talent development, mission delivery, and collaboration.' And so on, all without any long-term assessment of job performance. For all but the willfully blind, the SES had become another bureaucracy, but hardly the only evidence of government waste, fraud, and abuse. John C. Beale, once the highest-paid employee at the Environmental Protection Agency, told his bosses he was a CIA spy working in London, India, and Pakistan when he was actually holed up at his vacation home. Beale pulled off this ruse for 20 years, performing little if any work. The fraudster continued to draw his government paycheck and retention bonuses even after he retired. SES Employees Are Still Government Workers Like government employees in general, SES bosses enjoy an array of special protections against dismissal. Elon Musk would have a hard time firing them, but the SpaceX mogul may not get the chance. Donald Trump would have to win the election, hardly a done deal, and there’s more to consider. The SES operates in 75 government departments including the Department of Homeland Security, which now controls the United States Secret Service, before 2003 part of the Treasury Department. As it turns out, the SES also deploys personnel in the Secret Service, responsible for protection of the president, and since the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, presidential candidates as well. At a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to prevent a 20-year-old with no tactical experience from scaling a rooftop and unleashing eight shots, one wounding former president Trump, and other shots killing one attendee and wounding two others. Not much SES efficiency was on display, but government agencies have succeeded in making the election season more exciting.

US Nuclear Defense Should Not Be So Costly – OpEd	After a decades-long post-Cold War halt to designing, manufacturing, and testing new nuclear arms, the United States is implementing a three-decade-long, $1.7 trillion program to modernize and increase its already sizable arsenal of nuclear weapons, according to a recent New York Times report by W. J. Hennigan. This program, which is already over budget and behind schedule (as most weapons programs tend to be in the Pentagon’s uncompetitive procurement environment), is also an overreaction to other nuclear weapons powers. It should be pared back significantly. During the nuclear insanity of the Cold War, during the late 1980s, the world had around 70,000 nuclear warheads, up from roughly 3,000 in 1955. As a result of arms control and the end of the Cold War, the number now stands at about 12,000 globally. The United States currently has about 5,748 warheads in its nuclear arsenal compared to Russia’s 5,580. Together, both arsenals contain more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads. When New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which limits long-range nuclear warheads and delivery systems, expires in early 2026, the United States is considering adding warheads to its arsenal. China currently possesses 500 warheads, is on schedule to double that number by the turn of the decade, and may build up its force further by 2035. Russia has also overhauled its nuclear arsenal. Hennigan seems to accept that nuclear and conventional military activities by Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran should govern the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nonetheless, he laments that the 'future of arms control appears bleak' after forty years of progress in reducing the number of nuclear warheads; appears to blanch at the staggering cost of U.S. nuclear modernization; and argues that although Congress decided the United States needed to modernize its nuclear arsenal more than a decade ago, the American public is still woefully uninformed about the nature of a program slated to cost nearly double each year ($57 billion) what the entire World War II-era Manhattan Project did. However, Hennigan comes up with few solutions to what seems to be an incipient nuclear arms race. He is correct in three of his four assumptions, but the solution can be found by correcting the erroneous remaining one. Hennigan is correct that the program's cost is already astonishing and growing, that most of the American populace is entirely ignorant of it, and that the prospect for bilateral or multilateral arms control is gloomy. That gloom stems from the impression that China plans to break out of its previously astute posture of maintaining only a nuclear force for minimum deterrence. With China unconstrained in its nuclear modernization, the United States (and maybe Russia, too) is leery of continuing the constraints of the New START Treaty. Yet even if other countries continue their nuclear refurbishment or buildups, is it smart for the United States, which has a debt held by the public of $26.3 Trillion(about 98 percent of the GDP), to do so on such a grand scale? Currently, the United States is modernizing (and maybe augmenting) all three legs of its Cold War-era nuclear triad. The triad consists of land-based long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) based in silos in the Western states, long-range bomber aircraft that can deliver nuclear weapons, and stealthy, and therefore invulnerable, ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) that can now deliver nearly 1,000 powerful warheads. During the Cold War, the United States could afford such overkill in its massive destruction capability. The American people should now ask whether the United States could adopt a less costly but adequate minimum deterrent strategy, such as China did in the past, to use the savings to help facilitate an economic miracle. Two legs of the triad are vulnerable to an adversary’s nuclear first strike. New ICBM (Sentinel) missiles deployed into stationary and easily targeted land-based silos are not likely to get any less vulnerable to an enemy first strike than the existing Minuteman III missiles. New long-range, nuclear-capable U.S. bombers (the B-21 Raider) would be vulnerable to a surprise attack on the ground before takeoff or, if they do get airborne, vulnerable when trying to penetrate very capable Russian or Chinese air defenses. The United States (and other great powers) really only need a nuclear force surviving an enemy’s first strike that can hit all major targets in the attacking country to deter other great powers from launching nuclear attacks on it in the first place. If there are 500 major targets in Russia or China and two warheads are needed to destroy each target, the United States could take out those targets by creating a survivable but powerful, minimum nuclear deterrent with about 1,000 warheads placed aboard twelve invulnerable undersea Columbia-class SSBNs. (Any small nuclear arsenals of North Korea and Iran are lesser included cases). Thus, the ICBM and bomber modernization programs could be scrapped. Building only those twelve submarines would cost $130 billion instead of the $1.7 Trillion to modernize the entire triad force, according to the Times report. Critics will label this nuclear 'monad' unilateral disarmament, but it is really just eliminating the costly and wasteful massive overkill in our current nuclear forces. The foolish nuclear arms race among the great powers may continue, but the United States safely can unilaterally choose to opt out of it.

Markets Made Of Glass: How The Fed Destroyed Economic Resilience ...	By Artis Shepherd Central to any good investor’s decision-making process is determining the degree to which the target of investment is 'robust to the downside.' Can the investment maintain its value—or even continue to provide sufficient return on capital—in the event of a pullback in the broader economy or a specific sector? Warren Buffett has aptly referred to this feature as 'margin of safety.' While critical to rational decision-makers, margin of safety seems quaint in today’s era of speculation and central bank front-running. Rather, in place of acquiring expertise and performing rational due diligence, speculators in capital markets rely on perpetually loose monetary policy and periodic bailouts. Markets worldwide, but particularly in the US, now exhibit a profound lack of robustness. Central banks—the Federal Reserve foremost among them—have become enablers of the political and crony classes, responding to any material drop in asset prices with swift jawboning, followed by enactment of loose monetary policy until speculators’ nerves are settled. The problem is that easy money entails a constant behind-the-scenes destruction of what’s truly important to an economy—sound money, low time preference, personal productivity, and quality of life—while emphasizing the frivolous and absurd. The Greenspan-Fed Put A put option or 'put' is a contract that allows the holder to sell a security or asset at a specific price ('strike price'), regardless of the current price ('spot price') of the underlying security or asset. Put options are actionable when spot prices decline below the strike price, allowing holders to exercise their put at the higher strike price, thus limiting their downside. While the Federal Reserve had been acting as a backstop to capital markets for decades prior, the genesis of the Greenspan Put was 1987. October 19 of that year, now known as 'Black Monday,' saw a single-day 20 percent drop in the US stock market. Invoking the familiar rationale of 'systemic concerns,' newly-appointed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan swiftly opened the monetary floodgates and lowered interest rates, reversing the prior trend of rate hikes. Perhaps more importantly, Greenspan issued a statement the day following Black Monday in which he expressed the Fed’s 'readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.' Despite the 'systemic concerns' canard, the stock market crash was the only noteworthy event on Black Monday. Credit markets did not seize up and the US Main Street economy was unimpacted. Greenspan’s Fed reacted exclusively to the drop in the stock market. Actions taken by Greenspan’s Fed led to an immediate rebound in stock prices, and all-time highs were reached soon after. Similar actions were taken by Greenspan multiple times during his tenure, including the absurd Fed-supervised bailout of Long Term Capital Management—a hedge fund comprising too-clever-by-half bond traders, academics, and other Wall Streeters who attempted to leverage and arbitrage their way into financial stardom but ended up losing billions. Over the years, the Greenspan Put has morphed into the Fed Put, with successive Fed chairmen employing the same techniques as Greenspan in propping up stock prices, namely, loosening monetary policy at any hint of a downturn by injecting liquidity and lowering interest rates while jawboning the markets so as to settle nerves and allow institutional speculators to front-run such policy. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is of course guilty of this, even before the hyperbolic actions taken during the covid panic of 2020. In 2018, shortly after his appointment, Powell suggested he would raise interest rates and embark on a path of quantitative tightening—taking liquidity out of the banking system by selling off the Fed’s treasury portfolio. The stock market responded with a 20 percent decline, at which point Powell immediately reversed his position. Sensing the continuation of the Fed Put indefinitely, stock markets soon reached valuations not seen since the dot-com bubble of 1999 and capital markets across the board bid up valuations to all-time highs. A study published in 2020 determined that not only does the Fed respond directly to stock market declines—particularly since Greenspan’s tenure in the 1990s—but such concerns are explicitly discussed in FOMC meetings. The authors of the study state: We show that since the mid-1990s the Fed has engaged in a sequence of policy easings following large stock market declines in the intermeeting period.… The structure of the Fed documents allows us to measure how frequently actual decision makers at the FOMC…mention the stock market…these mentions are strongly predictive of future policy and do so in an asymmetric way: mentions of stock market declines predict monetary easing, whereas there is no relationship between mentions of stock market gains and tightening. We verify the robustness of these findings using the FOMC transcripts. The authors note further: The statistical fact is that, since the mid-1990s, the Fed has tended to lower rates by an average of about 1.2 percentage points in the year after a 10 percent stock market decline… Fed actions since the publication of this study in 2020—including the massive liquidity dumps of the covid panic era—only confirm these conclusions. Zombie Companies One result of permanently loose monetary policy is a profusion of 'zombie companies'—those that can only survive in an environment where interest rates are artificially lowered. As evidence, consider the share of Russell 2000 companies (publicly-traded small-caps) with negative earnings, and notice how the percentage peaks shortly after each bubble burst, when interest rates are temporarily increasing. Despite decades of loose monetary policy, nearly half of these companies have negative earnings today. This phenomenon is not isolated to publicly-traded small-cap stocks. Myriad types and sizes of companies that shouldn’t exist—because they can’t provide sufficient value to compete in the free market—are propped up by cheap debt and other forms of subsidy. The existence of zombie companies is one concrete reminder of the profound weakness prevalent in our markets. Higher rates and a cessation of easy money policies would kill them all. Contents are Fragile Recently, the Japanese stock market index experienced a one-day drop of 12.4 percent, marking its worst day since Black Monday in 1987. The reason? A few days earlier, Japan’s central bank raised benchmark rates from 0.10 percent to 0.25 percent! Soon after this stock market tantrum, bashful and shamed Japanese bureaucrats reversed course and pledged to nervous investors that no more big, bad rate hikes would be forthcoming. The index recovered immediately. If Japan is a dysfunctional and fragile zombie economy, the US is hardly better. After decades of coddling stock market speculators, crony bankers, and politicians greedy for asset bubbles to appease their voter base, the Fed is now stuck with an economy that lacks durability, to put it mildly. Real earnings and productivity growth through the free market have been sacrificed for increasing asset prices measured in a dollar that is rapidly and constantly losing value. Combined with record amounts of leverage in the system, this state of affairs can only devolve into chaos. There is no politically viable way out, only the hard road back to sound money and fiscal discipline where interest rates are set by the market, not a central bank—a likelihood on par with pigs flying. Unlike bubbly asset prices propped up by a continually inflated dollar, robustness to the downside is a sign of genuine economic well-being. The ability of a market to tolerate downturns with resilience is what underlies its true strength. By that standard, the US economy is made of glass.

In Fencing China Out, Is Washington Fencing Itself In? – OpEd	As Washington doubles down on its semiconductor embargoes, a troubling paradox emerges: in trying to stymie China’s technological advances, the United States might just be fencing itself in. Each successive restriction aims to choke off China’s progress, specifically in artificial intelligence and high-performance chips. Yet these measures risk isolating the United States from global tech supply chains, harming its own industry and allies. Take the new U.S. Treasury rule, effective January 2025, which tightens restrictions on American investments in Chinese semiconductors and quantum computing. Although the Biden administration’s objective is clear—to kneecap China’s semiconductor ascent—this gambit is not likely to work. The complexity of today’s tech landscape, with its entangled supply lines and 'gray channels' of unofficial trade, underscores the futility of isolating China. Chinese firms continue advancing, with the support of both local innovation and resilient demand for tech alternatives. Despite escalating sanctions designed to strangle China’s chip industry, the true costs of these measures ripple far beyond Beijing. American allies find themselves isolated, and domestic companies feel the sting of lost revenues. Take Nvidia, for instance. The American AI chip giant introduced its groundbreaking Blackwell architecture in March but offered a downgraded version to maintain ties with the Chinese market, a reluctant acknowledgment of a complex interdependence that persists despite Washington’s aspirations. These efforts to stem China’s progress are as much a commentary on America’s anxiety over competition as they are on Beijing’s resilience in pushing forward, innovating, and navigating the geopolitical minefield. Even American firms like Semianalysis, which advocates for the strictest sanctions, concede that China is now advancing past the United States in achieving intelligent computing capabilities. The 'wall' designed to keep China out is riddled with gaps. China’s resourcefulness exploits these gaps. With substantial clean energy reserves to power vast computing clusters, where the United States often struggles with shortages, China is less beholden to America’s chip arsenal. Although its H20 chips fall short of Nvidia’s H200, innovative local firms are rapidly narrowing the gap. Meanwhile, U.S. attempts to regulate global trade through restricted entity lists has proven little more than a game of 'whack-a-mole,' where new avenues emerge faster than they can be closed. Perhaps the most significant gap in Washington’s strategy is China’s capacity to manufacture advanced chips domestically. Semiconductor giants SMIC and TSMC illustrate this shrinking technological divide, with China trailing the United States by an estimated five years. By 2024, as Huawei and local giants like Changxin Storage join forces, China’s investments in wafer equipment will propel it to the world’s second-largest buyer, outpacing all American firms. The United States can tighten its grip, but innovation continues to slip through its fingers. Calls are growing within the United States not just to restrict the export of advanced equipment but to clamp down on components that enable the manufacturing of these technologies. This, however, demands that allies join the United States in constructing an even taller wall. But such a strategy would ultimately require Washington to compensate its allies, effectively paying a steep diplomatic toll for a policy that isolates more than it secures. While the U.S. may dominate advanced semiconductor technologies, China holds critical leverage in other parts of the supply chain, particularly in rare earth elements essential to chip production. China supplies 60 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals and controls over 85 percent of their processing. In response to American export controls, China has restricted exports of gallium and germanium—key materials in chipmaking—and has hinted at further action if pressures persist. While these controls aim to hinder China’s tech ambitions, they could have substantial repercussions for the United States too. American chip companies, deeply reliant on the Chinese market, face looming financial losses. U.S. firms could lose up to $83 billion in annual sales and 124,000 jobs, with semiconductor equipment companies especially exposed since 30–40 percent of their sales depend on China. Meanwhile, Chinese firms like SMIC have pivoted sharply, now producing 80 percent for domestic use compared to just 40 percent five years ago. A prolonged restriction may curtail U.S. R&D, weakening its competitiveness in a market shaped by shifting alliances and growing interdependence. There’s increasing talk of an emerging 'American island,' a scenario where the United States, in its quest for dominance, finds itself hemmed in as other nations gravitate towards the Chinese supply chain. This trend, already visible in connected cars, is making inroads into the semiconductor sector. Since 2018, China has skillfully maneuvered around these restrictions, using strategies like 'design-out' (substituting U.S. technologies with Chinese or third-country alternatives) and 'design-around' (innovating to bypass controlled technologies entirely). The U.S. strategy to contain China’s tech industry has spurred an unexpected transformation. Chinese companies, supported by the government, are choosing local suppliers more assertively, aiming to reduce reliance on an unstable supply chain. This shift is creating a robust local market and a fortified tech ecosystem within China. Meanwhile, foreign companies, fearing the loss of access to China’s vast market, are moving away from American technology and components. Third-party nations and their companies, unburdened by these geopolitical tensions, are stepping in to fill gaps left by restricted American firms. With revenues and R&D investments shifting to non-American firms, U.S. leadership is in jeopardy. American firms may face diminished market share as they are overtaken by agile competitors less constrained by Washington’s restrictive policies. Once focused on replication, Chinese companies are now emphasizing original technological advancements. With expertise in packaging technology and close integration into the global supply chain, China has boosted its investments in hybrid bonding and advanced substrates, fields where U.S. companies are lagging. Data from the first half of this year highlight China’s impressive strides. While global semiconductor equipment revenues held steady, China’s top equipment manufacturers achieved a 50 percent year-over-year revenue increase, reducing their gap with global giants from 24 to 15 times. As the contest between China and the United States deepens, third-party players will continue to leverage this shifting dynamic, optimizing their own interests amid the rivalry.

Will America Elect The Unknown Or The Unpredictable? – OpEd	By Alistair Burt The world this week awaits the verdict of its most important democracy. This US presidential campaign, astonishing in so many ways, reaches polling day on Tuesday with the outcome still uncertain, a contest between the unknown and the unpredictable. It is not an enviable situation either for the US or for the UK, EU, Middle East and others, which will be watching with perhaps greater anxiety than ever before. It could still be the case that the most consequential decision in the campaign remains that of those who persuaded President Joe Biden to opt for a very early TV debate with Donald Trump. Shrewdly but secretly gambling that exposing the president’s frailty would allow for a replacement candidate, it immediately shifted what had been gathering momentum toward Trump. It refocused the issues of age and capacity squarely on the man who was now the oldest candidate. While that gamble to replace Biden may have worked, it remains to be seen if it has swayed the election itself. Whatever the real or imagined preferences of foreign countries as to the outcome, the truth is that they will respect the decision of the American people and get to work with the new incumbent in the White House. They will deal with the specific differences in policy about which they already know, while recognizing there are generic issues that either can bring to the table. Kamala Harris is still largely an enigma. If she were to win, we all assume there would be a degree of continuity in foreign policy, such as clear support for NATO and Ukraine, but probably also keeping with a rather more ill-defined approach to the Middle East. The Israel/Gaza/Lebanon policy of the Democratic incumbent seems to please no one. Whoever you talk to feels abandoned. Benjamin Netanyahu feels he is not being supported strongly and unquestioningly enough, while Palestinians and the Arab street are outraged at the degree of catastrophe being inflicted on innocent civilians and which remains unimpeded, even actively supported, by the US. Regional powers will probably be assuming that the US under Harris will continue to prioritize the Far East and they will be left on their own to deal with long-unresolved issues, such as the future of the Palestinian question and what to do with Iran. Trump brings a whole new suite of baggage — much of it terrifying. Europe and the world worry about climate change commitments, while Trump is a climate change denier, calling it a 'hoax.' International consensus and agreements would either fall or need drastically reworking. Europe and the free world are engaged in confronting the first invasion of a sovereign country on the European continent since 1945 (allowing some license for Soviet actions against client states in the past) and the loss of US support in terms of aid or arms, as hinted at by Trump, would likely be decisive in Russia’s favor, opening up the question of 'where next?' Trump has already threatened not to assist NATO states if they have not paid what he considers appropriate amounts to the alliance’s funds. He said in February that he would encourage Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' toward 'delinquent' NATO members, though in the current atmosphere of defense uncertainty both candidates will want to ensure greater defense commitments from Europe. Europe will fear being caught up in a Republican trade war, with tariffs imposed on itself and further pressure on China. And while some in the Middle East may prefer Trump to the Obama years and the mixed messages from the Democrats, the region will not know quite what it is getting from a new Trump presidency. Israel may or may not get unqualified support, even to the point of annexation of the West Bank. A deal with Saudi Arabia may be seen as the answer to everything, but the terms of such a deal in relation to Palestine are now very different. Will renewed 'maximum pressure' on Iran — the policy that tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal and gave the region more and better quality enriched Iranian uranium — be accompanied by actions? Or will the opposite be the case to deliver on Trump’s promise to the US people not to become militarily engaged in the Middle East again? Apart from these specifics, there are deeper worries. What damage has the election already done to a polarized American people and political system? What is this fear of malevolent retribution, which has stopped major US newspapers from endorsing Harris? Will the result be contested, as seems certain if Trump is not declared the winner, and what may ensue? Authoritarians the world over would get a renewed boost. Can a united US emerge, with clarity in its foreign policy, if still divided by the election? And how will the international order, creaking with a dysfunctional UN, be affected by a US that might turn in upon itself, consumed by domestic bitterness? None of us can affect the outcome, but most would settle for a clear winner, an absence of bitterness, signs of reconciliation among the American people and a renewed commitment to their place in the world.

Violence In America: When Ballot Boxes Burn And Poll Workers Face...	Historical patterns of electoral intimidation have reemerged in contemporary American democracy with troubling institutional implications. During Reconstruction, systematic campaigns targeted election officials who protected universal suffrage; today's data from the Brennan Center for Justice reveals an analogous institutional vulnerability, with 38% of local election officials reporting threats, harassment, or abuse in their official capacity. Institutional analysis of this 8 percentage point increase from previous year's findings suggests a coordinated pattern of democratic destabilization. The Department of Justice's Election Threat Task Force data reinforces this institutional pattern, documenting over 1,000 incidents of harassment targeting election workers, with 58% concentrated in contested jurisdictions. Mounting pressure has begun to crack the foundations of election office stability. Survey data indicates that 27% of election officials now report knowing colleagues who have departed their positions due to safety concerns, a significant increase from 18% in the previous year. Perhaps most concerning for electoral stability, 25% of local election officials will be working their first presidential election in 2024, indicating an unprecedented loss of experienced personnel at a critical juncture. This mass exodus of experienced election workers threatens to destabilize voting operations across the country, particularly in areas already struggling with resource limitations. The departure of seasoned officials creates a dangerous void in institutional knowledge, increasing the likelihood of administrative errors and potentially undermining public confidence in electoral processes. The intensity of threats against election workers has escalated from intimidation to physical confrontation and infrastructure attacks. In Orangeburg County, South Carolina, a poll worker faced physical assault during early voting when enforcing basic election laws prohibiting campaign apparel at voting sites. The worker was struck on the head after asking a voter to remove a political cap, demonstrating how routine enforcement of election rules now puts workers at risk of violence. Meanwhile, in the Pacific Northwest, authorities are investigating a series of coordinated attacks on ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington state, where an experienced metalworker systematically targeted multiple jurisdictions with incendiary devices, destroying hundreds of ballots and forcing election workers to implement emergency protocols. Within the legal system, courts have begun to recognize the urgent need for stronger protections. The recent $148 million judgment against Rudy Giuliani, requiring the surrender of his Manhattan residence to Georgia election workers, demonstrates the judiciary's recognition of institutional harm. However, these remedies address only the most prominent cases among thousands of documented incidents nationwide. The October 2024 attacks—from direct physical confrontations in South Carolina to the destruction of ballot boxes in the Pacific Northwest—reveal how quickly threats can escalate from intimidation to violence. These incidents demonstrate the urgent need for enhanced security measures to protect both election workers and the physical components of our voting system they maintain. Across the country, state legislatures have begun responding through increasingly robust action, recognizing the urgent need to protect election workers. Washington state has taken the lead by classifying harassment of election workers as a felony carrying up to five years' imprisonment, while Maine and Vermont have introduced similar protective measures to safeguard their election personnel. At the federal level, a bipartisan initiative led by Senators Susan Collins and Joe Manchin proposes doubling penalties for threatening election officials, demonstrating growing recognition of the need for coordinated national response. These legislative efforts represent necessary first steps, but their effectiveness will depend on consistent enforcement and coordination between state and federal authorities. Behind the statistics lies a cascade of challenges that threaten the integrity of future elections. The Orangeburg County assault illustrates how even routine election administration now carries risks of physical violence, while the Portland-Vancouver ballot box attacks demonstrate the sophisticated nature of coordinated threats against electoral infrastructure. The erosion of institutional knowledge in election administration creates vulnerabilities in procedural integrity and operational capacity. Analysis of staffing patterns indicates that consolidation of polling locations disproportionately impacts historically marginalized communities, replicating patterns of institutional discrimination. These operational disruptions compound existing structural weaknesses in electoral administration. Moving forward requires treating election worker protection with the same gravity we afford other threats to national security. The institutional framework must expand to include National Guard activation and enhanced law enforcement presence, particularly in jurisdictions facing acute threats. Recent violent confrontations and infrastructure attacks demonstrate why enhanced security isn't merely precautionary—it's essential for protecting both physical infrastructure and the election workers who face direct threats while performing their duties. Comprehensive security protocols, enhanced worker privacy protections, and systematic training programs represent essential components of institutional resilience. Just as we deploy resources to protect critical infrastructure and respond to natural disasters, defending our electoral system from organized intimidation demands a similar commitment of security personnel and resources. With the 2024 presidential election, the stability of our electoral system hangs in the balance. The protection of election workers has become inseparable from the preservation of democratic processes themselves, requiring immediate and sustained attention from policymakers at all levels of government. This crisis demands a unified, bipartisan response that recognizes the essential role of election workers in maintaining democratic stability. The future of American democracy depends on our ability to protect those who safeguard our most fundamental democratic processes, ensuring they can perform their duties free from intimidation and harassment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqCiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-11-04T15:48:27-08:00	
Ruthless Settlements: BHP, Brazil And The Samarco Fundão Dam Clas...	The BHP Group, as with other mining giants, has much explaining to do in the way it has approached the environment. It has become a master of the greenwashing experiment, an adept promoter of sham environmental responsibility (take, for instance, its practice of merely selling its oil and gas business to Woodside Petroleum in 2021 rather than retiring them); and, it transpired recently, a ruthless negotiator and litigant over contentious claims. After nine years of negotiations and attritive legal proceedings, BHP has reached a settlement with Brazilian authorities regarding its role in the Fundão tailings dam collapse in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Taking place on November 5, 2015, the results were catastrophic to human life and nature, leaving 19 people dead and spilling toxic sludge over some 700 kilometres of land. The Samarco-owned facility, which held something like 26,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth of tailings (50 million cubic metres), was a joint venture between BHP and Vale. In addition to killing 14 company employees and five residents, the released tailings rapidly reached Bento Rodrigues, and part of the communities of Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira and, for good measure, flooded the centre of the town of Barra Longa. The catastrophe merely compounded, turning the Rio Doce Basin a filthy brown and affecting dozens of municipalities and hundreds of communities reliant on the Rio Doce for drinking water. The pollution also destroyed wildlife, fishing stocks, farmland and churches, and affected various Indigenous communities, including the Krenak, Tupiniquim, Guaranis and Quilombola. In response to the collapse, BHP, Vale and Samarco established the Renova Foundation, intended to compensate individuals and small businesses for losses and ostensibly ameliorating environmental impacts. This was hardly a concession on BHP’s part of guilt. 'Conveniently,' write the authors caustically in a Nature Conservation study on the disaster in August, 'the company creates its foundation to repair its own damages. Through the dense patchwork of multiple lawsuits filed in Brazil, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, BHP has repeatedly denied any central culpability in the collapse. Compensation payments to victims from the fund, to date, have also been scandalously tardy. The BHP 2024 annual report notes that R$17.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) had been paid to 430,000 people as of June 30 this year, with R$12.2 billion (US$2.5 billion) forked out to 110,000 people under the Novel system, or 'court mandated simplified indemnity system'. The company praises this arrangement as one that enabled 'informal workers' (cart drivers, sand miners, artisanal miners and street vendors) to receive compensation despite having 'difficulty proving the damages they suffered'. What BHP fails to underscore is that those under the Novel system had to wait for seven years after the dam collapse to receive any cash, with 40% of those only paid in the last two years. Of the 430,000, some 290,000 received a pitiful R$1050 each for a disruption to their water supply for seven to 10 days following the dam collapse. And just to add to the nastiness of it all, the replacement housing for victims has been of questionable quality. Little wonder that Thatiele Monic, president of the Vila Santa Efigênia and Adjacências Quilombola Association, is suspicious of the efforts of the Renova Foundation. The UK leg of proceedings, commenced in November 2018, is positively Dickensian in legal gyrations. It began as a High Court lawsuit against BHP involving 240,000 plaintiffs, including Brazilian municipalities and Krenak indigenous communities. In November 2020, the court dismissed the lawsuit, with Justice Turner making a memorable remark: 'The task facing the managing judge in England would, I predict, be akin to trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.' Various impediments, not least the size and scale of the claims, including 'jurisdictional cross-contamination' and an abuse of process, were cited. In March 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision, arguing that the plaintiffs were already seeking legal redress in Brazil. In July, the London court of appeal reversed the decision, granting permission to appeal on grounds that the case had a 'real prospect of success'. To not do so would risk real injustice. In July 2022, a Court of Appeal ruled that English courts could hear the case, noting that, 'The vast majority of claimants who have recovered damages have only received very modest sums in respect of moral damages for interruption to their water supply'. An April 2024 date was set for the commencement of trial proceedings. In March 2023, the scale of the class action burgeoned further, with the addition of 500,000 claimants. Attempts by BHP to delay the lawsuit till mid-2025 were rejected by a London court in May 2023. On October 21 this year, the trial finally commenced. It would last all but a few days. The settlement agreement signed on October 25 includes BHP, Vale, Samarco and some half a dozen Brazilian authorities. Of the 42 civil claims against BHP, the October 25 agreement covers the most monumental and contentious. Its value – R$170 billion (US$31.5 billion) – is deceptive. Brazilian authorities can have reason to cheer the result, as it comes close to the R$175 billion sought in civil claims in 2016. BHP’s Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry, also seemed suspiciously satisfied, claiming that the agreement would deliver a laundry list of benefits including 'expanded and additional programs for the environment and for the people, including designated funding for the health system, economic recovery, improved infrastructure and extensive compensation and income support measures, including for farmers, fisher people and Indigenous and Traditional communities.' A sharp analysis from Tony Boyd of the Australian Financial Review, hardly a forum known for its humanitarians and bleeding hearts, offers a rather different reading of Brazilian efforts and the tactics employed by the mining giants. It was evident to Boyd 'that over the past decade, BHP and Vale have outplayed the Brazilian federal government, and statements of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo as well as the federal and state Public Prosecutors’ and Public Defenders’ Offices.' Much of this has to do, as Boyd remarks, on the time value of money. Some 60% of the final R$100 billion settlement is payable over 20 years. Taking that time frame into account, the nominal amount comes to a net present value of R$48 billion. Using the net present value analysis also means that the R$32 billion commitment to cover the cost of removing tailings from the Rio Doce and R$30,000 compensation awards to individuals and small businesses who opt into the arrangement, is R$25 billion. The financial burden arising from BHP’s compensatory undertakings has also been lessened by the near decade process of dispute resolution, allowing the reopening of the Samarco iron ore mine to take place in the meantime with healthy annual returns of US$750 million. Even now, BHP’s mild description of the catastrophe is given a coolly confident assessment. The company’s website notes that since the dam breach, Samarco operates 'with a strong focus on safety and sustainability.' Alleviating the use of dams has been possible because of the implementation of a 'new filtration system', while 80% of the tailings arising from the operations 'are now dry stacked, with the rest deposited in a confined rocky pit.' Feeble assurance to those hundreds of thousands affected that fateful November in 2015.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqNvZ7qDHkLeF	2024-11-04T15:45:22-08:00	
How Do Asia’s Authoritarian States Pick Leaders? – Analysis	By Paul Eckert In a world bracing for a close U.S. presidential election result this week, a large swathe of Asia picks its leaders without suspense -- and mostly with little popular participation. Chinese leader Xi Jinping was confirmed by the National People’s Congress in March 2013 with 2,952 votes for, one against, and three abstentions. Last year the rubber stamp parliament voted unanimously to give him a third term, putting him on track to stay in power for life. North Korea’s leaders have inherited their power from father to son for three generations. They are technically 'elected' – but there is no choice. In 2014, Kim Jong Un was elected to the Supreme People’s Assembly without a dissenting vote with 100% turnout. A leadership succession that played out in Vietnam this year saw a serial purge of political rivals and the death of an ailing top leader propel To Lam, a wily career security policeman to the top of the Communist Party, where he is maneuvering for a key intra-party vote in early 2026. In U.S. elections, the president and vice president are not elected directly in a popular vote by citizens. Instead, they are chosen through the Electoral College process, in which electors equal to the total number of representatives and senators a state has in Congress cast that state’s votes. These electors vote according to the majority of residents in that state. Members of Congress – 100 in the Senate and 435 in the House of the Representatives – are elected directly by residents of each of the 50 states. How do the Communist-ruled countries in Asia choose their leaders? Of the six countries covered by Radio Free Asia, whose mission is to provide independent media to territories that lack it, four – China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam – were founded and organized on the Marxist-Leninist party-state model copied from the Soviet Union. Some countries call themselves 'democratic,' but in practice the people have little or no say in choosing their leaders or governments. NORTH KOREA The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was founded in 1948 by Kim Il Sung, who had been cultivated by Moscow as a Cold War ally in the northern half of Korea. North Korea describes itself as an 'independent socialist state' with universal and compulsory suffrage at 17, and holds elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly, the national legislature every four-to-five years, and for local People’s Assemblies every four years. In practice, each candidate is pre-selected by the North Korean government and voters are allowed to vote either 'yes' or 'no' in ballots that are not private. Nearly all elections report 100% support for the government. CHINA The People’s Republic of China, founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong, describes itself as a 'socialist democracy and a people’s democratic dictatorship.' Xi-era slogans describe it as 'socialist consultative democracy' and 'whole-process people’s democracy.' China has universal suffrage from age 18, with voting at five levels of People’s Congresses, from local townships to cities and provinces, to the parliamentary National People’s Congress. Higher-level Congresses are indirectly elected by delegates of lower-level Congresses. Technically not a one-party state, China has eight non-communist parties, including the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association and the China Association for Promoting Democracy. However, as the U.S.-based Freedom House notes, 'the CCP effectively monopolizes all political activity and does not permit meaningful political competition.' The noncommunist parties serve in an advisory role, 'but their activities are tightly circumscribed, and they must accept the CCP’s leadership as a condition for their existence.' VIETNAM The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, founded in 1975 after Ho Chi Minh’s Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) overthrew the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), likewise followed the Soviet template of one-party politics. Suffrage is universal at age 18, and direct elections are held for local People’s Councils and the National Assembly -- but all candidates are pre-approved by the ruling party. 'Vietnam is a one-party state, dominated for decades by the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam,' says Freedom House. 'Although some independent candidates are technically allowed to run in legislative elections, most are banned in practice.' In the May 2021 elections for 500 National Assembly seats, the Communist Party of Vietnam took 97.2% of the vote, while non-party candidates got 2.8%. The next election is in early 2026. LAOS In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, a Communist protégé of Vietnam also founded in 1975, 'is a one-party state in which the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party dominates all aspects of politics and harshly restricts civil liberties,' says Freedom House. Laos has universal suffrage, and its president, vice president, and prime minister are elected by the National Assembly. These elections, however, have been deemed not free or fair, and in the most recent 2021 poll, the ruling party took 158 of the body’s 164 seats, with the rest going to pre-approved independents. 'The electoral laws and framework are designed to ensure that the LPRP, the only legal party, dominates every election and controls the political system,' says Freedom House. CAMBODIA Radio Free Asia’s other target countries are Cambodia and Myanmar, more pluralistic states that have held competitive, if flawed elections. Cambodia has been holding elections since 1993, as mandated by the 1991 Paris Agreements, which ended the country’s civil war and mandated democratic elections under a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. In practice, however, Cambodia’s political system has been dominated by the Cambodian People’s Party and its leader Hun Sen. A strongman who violently refused to share power with coalition partners in the 1990s, Hun Sen ruled the country for more than three decades until handing power last year to his son, Hun Manet, but still wields great influence. 'While the country conducted semi-competitive elections in the past, polls are now held in a severely repressive environment,' says Freedom House, noting Hun Sen’s penchant for banning popular opposition parties. The July 2023 National Assembly elections, held just a month before Hun Manet took over from his father, were condemned by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations as neither free nor fair. MYANMAR In November 2020, the country formerly known as Burma emerged from only its third semi-competitive election since its independence in 1948, a vote that delivered a strong majority to the National League for Democracy, or NLD, of de facto national leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The multi-party election, which observers widely deemed credible despite flaws with conflict zone voting cancellations and registration, delivered 86 percent of the seats in the Assembly of the Union to Suu Kyi’s NLD, routing the army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. On Feb. 1, 2021, Myanmar’s military, citing baseless claims of election fraud, deposed State Counsellor Suu Kyi and President Win Myint in a coup d’etat, later jailing them. The junta annulled the results of the 2020 vote, and pledged to hold elections in 2023 – but has repeatedly delayed this and extended its emergency rule as the nation became more deeply embroiled in a civil war that has killed thousands and destroyed wide swathes of the country. The military regime has committed to holding a general election late next year, with voting to be staggered because of security concerns, but has continued to extend a state of emergency across the country and brought in tough new registration laws that disqualify many parties from standing. TIBET Chinese-run 'autonomous' regions such as Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang largely follow mainland practices. But Tibetans who followed the Dalai Lama when the spiritual leader fled into exile in India and other countries around the world in 1959, and their descendants, have been choosing their leaders. In 2021, Tibetans living outside of their China-ruled homeland held their third election since 2011, to seat a new political leader, or sikyong, for their India-based government-in-exile called the Central Tibetan Administration. Penpa Tsering won the CTA’s leadership in a vote among the Tibetan diaspora, a community of about 150,000 people living in 40 countries, mainly India, Nepal, Europe and North America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqGBvg9t5Ng9W	2024-11-04T15:41:41-08:00	
At UN, US Confronts Russia Over North Korean Troops For Ukraine	By Margaret Besheer Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine, during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N. Security Council. 'I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in Russia,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name. 'And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation will answer that simple question,' he said. Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming days. 'We're not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,' said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva. U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations. 'The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in front line operations,' he said. South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a 'more desperate and dangerous' way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links between the two neighbors. 'And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own people by dispatching troops to Russia,' said Ambassador JoonKook Hwang. William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North Korean troops are. 'And we don't know how they will react when faced in combat positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,' he said. 'So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.' Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to economic or other support. 'North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,' Naoko Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. 'And this is a little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development, for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.' She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula. On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions that Russia previously voted for. Ballistic missile launch The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30 missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 'The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,' Japan’s ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. 'This ICBM launch is more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000 kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched to date.' He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from North Korea. North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as 'unlawful' and interference in its domestic affairs. 'Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard security of our state as well peace of the region involved,' said Ambassador Kim Song. Russia sides with North Korea 'The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet another step towards demonizing the DPRK,' said Ambassador Evstigneeva. She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula because of its recent military exercises with South Korea. South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch and strongly condemned it. 'Its intention could be to distract the world's attention from its troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,' said Ambassador Hwang. 'Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,' he said. VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqN2XSO3H3KkE	2024-11-04T15:38:03-08:00	
Early Peace Plan Shows Russia’s Intent To Neutralize Ukraine – An...	By Yelizaveta Surnacheva and Systema (RFE/RL) -- Early in peace talks that began days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow proposed a treaty whose one-sided conditions amounted to Kyiv's surrender, according to a draft obtained by Systema, RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit. Acceptance of the proposal would have left Ukraine a neutral nation with a tiny, toothless army, no recourse to protection by NATO states, and no chance of regaining control over Crimea or the Donbas, where it would have had to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in their entirety, including the large portions still under Kyiv's control at the time. The proposed pact sheds light on Russian President Vladimir Putin's goals in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, none of which he has publicly renounced, and which he has repeatedly asserted will be achieved. It comes as the all-out war heads toward its fourth year with no clear sign of an end in sight but amid indications that peace talks could potentially be in the cards in 2025 or later. The draft -- titled Treaty On The Resolution Of The Situation In Ukraine And The Neutrality Of Ukraine -- is dated March 7, 2022, 11 days after Russia launched the invasion and a week after talks between Ukraine and Russia began.Composed in Moscow and handed to the Ukrainian delegation that day, at the third round of talks, in a town in the Belavezha forest in Belarus, it is the first known document laying out Russia's conditions for a peace deal after the start of the full-scale invasion. Systema obtained the draft from a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiations, and a Russian source close to the talks confirmed its authenticity. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The talks began on February 28, 2022, at a time when Russian forces had seized swaths of territory in the south, east, and north of Ukraine, where they had advanced close to Kyiv after pouring across the border from Russia and Belarus. Some sessions were held in person, others online. The process petered out in late April of the same year, as the sides wrangled over major points of dispute and following revelations of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha, a city outside Kyiv that the invading forces had abandoned as they withdrew from northern Ukraine after failing to capture the capital or force Ukraine's capitulation. 'Not Neutrality, But Neutralization' The Russian proposal sets out terms for Ukraine's neutrality, a status Kyiv appeared ready to accept at the time. But Eric Ciaramella, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that Putin seems to have been seeking 'something more radical -- not neutrality, but the neutralization of Ukraine as an independent state. Russia's goal from the very beginning was to destroy Ukraine's ability to defend itself.' A country 'can be neutral and have a very strong army and be capable of self-defense…. But that's not what Russia had in mind here,' he said. 'The document was structured as if Ukraine were the aggressor defeated on the battlefield, which, of course, did not reflect reality,' Ciaramella said of the Russian draft dated March 7, 2022, which he read at Systema's request. 'It's hard to say whether this was a genuine attempt to negotiate, as such terms would be unacceptable to any Ukrainian. They would have neutralized Ukraine to the point of making it defenseless.' The draft called for Ukraine to shrink its army to no more than 50,000 personnel, about five times fewer than it had in 2022, and would have barred Ukraine from developing or deploying missiles with a range of over 250 kilometers. Moscow would have been able to prohibit other types of weapons in the future. It also called for the removal of all sanctions imposed on Russia by Ukraine or the West since 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and fomented war in the Donbas. Ukraine would have been forced to formally recognize Crimea as Russian and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent. Kyiv would have had to pay for reconstruction in the Donbas. 'Deeply Erroneous Logic' The pact would have left a truncated Ukraine highly vulnerable, with Russian forces remaining in place and no way for Kyiv to defend itself or seek Western security support. Documents from later stages of the talks, including treaty drafts from March 17 and April 15 that were published by The New York Times earlier this year, show that the sides drew closer on some issues as the talks progressed -- and as Ukraine beat back Moscow's forces in the north. Crimea's status would have been left for future negotiations, for example, and Russian demands for changes in legislation involving languages and thorny historical disputes faded into the background. Crucially, the sides were discussing security guarantees for Ukraine that would include Western nations, though how they would work was a major bone of contention. However, Ciaramella suggested that in fundamental ways, little had changed. 'The versions discussed a few weeks later in Istanbul and at virtual sessions were still based on the deeply erroneous Russian logic that permeated the initial text,' he told Systema. 'Had the treaty been signed, its final form in April would have been merely a softer version of Ukrainian capitulation.' The subsequent drafts still included some of Russia's key demands, such as a permanent bar on NATO membership for Ukraine, something that neither Kyiv nor the Western alliance is prepared to accept. NATO has repeatedly said that Ukraine will eventually join, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been seeking a swift invitation as part of a 'victory plan' he has presented to Ukrainians and the country's backers abroad in recent weeks. In at least one way, meanwhile, Russia's stated conditions for peace have grown more aggressive than they were on March 7, 2022. In September of that year, Putin claimed that five Ukrainian regions – Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson -- were now inalienable parts of Russia. The baseless claim included the portions of those regions that remained, and still remain, in Kyiv's hands, and Putin has said that Russian control over those territories is a requirement for any peace negotiations.

India: Reviving Islamist Threat In Assam – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum Assam which for long had been threatened by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-backed Islamist extremist groups, is once again facing renewed threats from such groupings – both operating out of Pakistani and Bangladeshi soil. Global Islamist terrorist formations also create security challenges. A majority of the Islamist militant groups in Assam were founded between 1990 and 1996 with the prime objective of safeguarding the ‘overall interests’ of the minority Muslim communities in the region. On October 5, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 10 operatives of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) from the Goalpara and Hojai Districts of Assam, during a massive crackdown in the JeM conspiracy case. The arrests included Sheikh Sultan Salah Uddin Ayubi aka Ayubi, from Krishnai in Goalpara District. He was arrested for his role in conspiracy case RC-13/2024/NIA/DLI. During the operation, NIA seized several incriminating documents, electronic devices, pamphlets and magazines, and is examining further leads. The Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, explained that the arrests 'bring home' the reality that Islamist extremist groups are becoming a bigger menace in Assam, and that the state's indigenous population could face difficulties in the years to come if the extremist Islamist doctrine persists in Assam. According to partial data compiled by the South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 14 operatives of different Islamist terrorist groups – JeM, 10; and Ansar-al-Islam (AaI)/Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and Islamic State (IS), two each – have been arrested in 2024 (data till November 2, 2024). In the corresponding period of 2023, at least 11 such operatives – Popular Front of India (PFI) and ABT, five each; and one (group not identified) – were arrested. Details of the remaining arrests in 2024, apart from the incident of October 5, are given below: May 13: Assam Police arrested two operatives of the AaI – Bahar Mia (30) and Rasel Mia (40), both residents of Bangladesh – from Guwahati in the Kamrup (Metro) District of Assam. The duo was illegally staying in India without passports, had obtained Indian documents through fraudulent means, and was working to spread a terrorist network in Assam and India. March 20: The Assam Police’s Special Task Force (STF) arrested two high-ranking leaders of IS, Haris Farooqi aka Harish Ajmal Farukhi and Anurag Singh aka Rehan, in an operation in the Dharmasala area of Dhubri District in Assam. They were arrested after they entered Assam from Bangladesh. Farooqi, identified as the ‘head’ of IS in India, and Singh, his associate, were planning sabotage activities after entering India. Both were involved in recruitment, terrorist funding, and plotting attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and face charges from NIA, Delhi and Lucknow Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), and other agencies. Over the past several years, transborder Islamist terrorist groups, mainly based in Bangladesh, including Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and AaI, have been trying to establish their bases in Assam. On March 4, 2022, the Special Branch of the Assam Police arrested five people, including a Bangladesh national, Saiful Islam aka Haroon Rashid aka Mohammed Suman, for their alleged links with AaI. They were arrested from Barpeta, Howly and Kalgachia, all in Barpeta District. Saiful Islam had illegally entered India and was working as a teacher in the Dhakalipara masjid. Saiful Islam had successfully indoctrinated and motivated the four others to join the module, with a view to developing the Barpeta District of Assam as a base for jihadi activities of Al-Qaeda and its related organisations. Chief Minister Sarma had then disclosed that the militants of AaI modules arrested in the state in 2022 were using sophisticated peer-to-peer encrypted chat apps for communication. Further, he had also disclosed that during the Coronovairus-19 (Covid-19) years the AaI modules were training cadres in bomb making in Barpeta District. He had added that Assam had become a 'hotbed for jihadi activities'. Similarly, NIA arrested two operatives of the AaI module in Barpeta District, Akbar Ali and Abul Kalam Azad, on April 5, 2023, and filed a charge sheet against them on August 29, 2023, for conspiring and plotting to execute terrorist activities. NIA said that the radicalisation and mobilisation of Muslims were done through the module’s Bangladeshi handlers – Zakir and Mehboor Rahman. Islamist radical group PFI, which the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) pronounced an 'unlawful association' on September 28, 2022 for conspiring to establish Islamic rule in India by 2047, with its main roots in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, has also paved its way into Assam. However, there were no PFI-linked arrests in 2024, though three incidents of arrest linked to the group were recorded in 2023: May 17: Assam Police arrested one PFI operative, Abdul Razzaq Ali, from the Nagarbera area of Kamrup District. April 23: Two PFI operatives, Saiful Islam and Shafiqul Islam, were arrested from the Dhubri District of Assam. The arrested operatives taught in a madrasa(Islamic Seminary), Al-Jamiatul Asia Lil Banat Panbari, of Dhubri. April 8: Two PFI operatives, Zakir Hussain and Samad Ahmed, were arrested along with one operative of the group’s student wing, Campus Front of India (CFI), Jahidul Islam Mirdha, from the Barpeta Railway Station area in Barpeta District. Zakir Hussain served as the ‘secretary’ of the Assam state committee of PFI, while Samad Ahmed was the ‘president’ of the PFI Assam State Committee, and Jahidul Islam was the ‘president’ of the CFI Assam Committee. Further, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati student, Touseef Ali Farooqui (20) – in the 4th-year at the Bioscience – was arrested on March 23, 2024, in Kamrup District, while trying to leave the country in an attempt to join IS. With the arrests of operatives from various terrorist groups, such as JeM, AaI, IS, AQIS, and PFI, it is evident that Islamist radicalisation has found some foothold in Assam. In a press release dated October 5, 2024, on the arrest of JeM operatives, the NIA observed, 'The suspects were engaged in radicalising individuals associated with JeM, and were engaged in disseminating terrorist-related propaganda, and radicalising and recruiting youth into the Jamaat outfit inspired by JeM. These suspects were involved in motivating youth into committing violent terror attacks across India.' An NIA official also informed The Assam Tribune on October 26, 2024, that terrorist groups had been using digital or online social media platforms to recruit and radicalise young people from Assam. These tactics are comparable to those used by Islamist terrorist groups based in Pakistan, as well as Khalistani groups. In this regard, an unnamed senior intelligence officer observed, 'With the inroads and improvement of information technology, terrorist outfits do not have to send their own people to India, but they can induct youths into their fold by sitting thousands of miles away.' According to official inputs, radical Islamist terrorist groups have likely increased their recruitment efforts in the aftermath of the August 5, 2024, coup and the subsequent chaos in Bangladesh. Indian intelligence agencies have reported that the Bangladesh-based terrorist group AaI may try to establish a presence in Assam and West Bengal. Reports indicate that a prominent AaI leader, Abdullah Talah, was working to spread AaI influence in northeastern India. Moreover, Jashimuddin Rahmani, another prominent AaI leader was released by the interim government of Bangladesh at a time when AaI has been attempting to create a jihadi network with the aid of sleeper cells, especially in Assam and Tripura in India. As SAIR noted earlier, a majority of the Islamist extremist and terrorist groups in Assam were founded between 1990 and 1996, with the prime objective of safeguarding the ‘overall interests’ of the minority Muslim communities in the region. According to SATP, at least 20 Islamist terrorist formations have operated in Assam at different periods. Meanwhile, the surge in infiltration attempts by Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas into Assam, after the coup in Bangladesh, also creates additional potential risks. Chief Minister Sarma tweeted in October that around 130 individuals, who were attempting to enter Assam illegally from Bangladesh in the preceding two months, following the political turmoil that erupted in Bangladesh, had been intercepted by the Assam Police. In a video message on his social media platforms, Sarma announced that the process of establishing 12 Border Outposts in proximity to the Indo-Bangla border was underway to bolster coordination with the Central agencies. The attempt to re-establish Islamist terrorist groups’ bases in Assam and the demographic infiltration by foreign elements, particularly those from Bangladesh, have raised renewed concerns about security in Assam in particular, and northeastern India at large.

Bangladesh: JeI’s Political Reinvention – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya Since the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, 2024, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) is back to the political forefront in Bangladesh, trying to expand its own area of influence and weigh its political options within the current chaos and instability. On October 28, 2024, at a JeI protest rally at the Public Library ground against the 'Logi-Boitha' (Boat-hook and Oar) Movement by the Awami League on October 28, 2006, on which day six members of JeI were killed in broad daylight, council member Mahbubur Rahman Belal pledged to establish a 'model Islamic society' in honour of the 'martyrs' sacrifices'. Belal stated, 'The fascist Awami League murderers established a demonic reign by killing thousands of Islam-loving people. Almighty Allah has broken their all prides by sending them abroad through the student-people mass upsurge…That case has to be revived again. Murderer Sheikh Hasina must be brought to justice and be given appropriate punishment. ' On October 24, 2024, JeI’s chief Shafiqur Rahman announced at a meeting of the central working committee that Selim Uddin had been elected chief of JeI Dhaka City north unit for the 2025-2026 session. On October 23, 2024, JeI filed a review petition with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in order to turn down its 2011 verdict that scrapped the non-party caretaker government system. JeI’s secretary general Miah Golam Porwar submitted the petition through his lawyer Mohammad Shishir Manir seeking necessary directives to reinstate the system. On October 13, 2024, after 19 years, the Dhaka City north unit of JeI held a public conference called ‘Rukun Sammelan’ at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Center in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka, to elect its next chief, with over 10,000 Rukun (party members) voting through secret ballots. During this conference, JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman called for the trial of the Awami League under laws that were enacted during the rule of the AL regime, stating that justice must be established as soon as possible to ensure that they [Awami League] get what they truly deserve. JeI got a new lease on life when, on August 28, 2024, the Interim Government led by Muhammad Yunus lifted the ban on the group and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS). Under the powers provided in Section 18 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009, the Interim Government cancelled the previous circular that banned JeI-ICS. The Home Ministry issued a notification in this regard. The gazette notification read, 'Since there is no concrete evidence of involvement of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its student organization Islami Chhatra Shibir in terrorism and violence… and since the Government believes that Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and all its affiliates, including its student body Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, are not involved in terrorist activities.' Earlier, on August 1, 2024, the previous Awami League-led government had banned JeI, ICS, and all of their associated organisations as political entities under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, following nationwide unrest, citing the threat posed by the fundamentalist party to public security. According to partial data collated by South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since the year 2000, 285 persons, including 112 civilians, 6 Security Force (SF) personnel, and 167 JeI/ICS cadres have been killed in 199 incidents of JeI-ICS linked violence (data till November 2, 2024). JeI was formed in undivided India on August 26, 1941, in Lahore's Islamia Park by its first Ameer (chief) Maulana Abul A'la Maududi, with the goal of developing an Islamic community of devout believers. After India's Partition in 1947, the party was divided into Jamat-e-Islami Hind and Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. JeI started its activities in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during the 1950s. The Jamaat had also been banned on two earlier occasions, in 1959 and 1964, in Pakistan (prior to the creation of Bangladesh), for its communal role. During the Bangladesh liberation struggle, JeI in East Pakistan joined forces with the Pakistan Army to participate in the genocide of an estimated three million civilians, and a range of brutal crimes, including the widespread use of rape as a weapon. Jamaat has never regretted or offered apology for its role in 1971. In independent Bangladesh, JeI resumed overt activities in 1979. Between 1981 and 1987, the number of full members of JeI rose from 650 to 2,000, while associate membership doubled to approximately two million. The rising popularity of the organization renewed its political ambitions. The party played a crucial role in Governments formed by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1991 and 2001. The JeI had 18 seats in the Jatiyo Shangshad(Bangladesh Parliament) of 1991 and 17 seats in 2001. In 1996, it had three seats. In the General Elections of 2008, it secured five seats. After the Awami League came to power in 2009, the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) was established to try those accused of war crimes. The War Crimes (WC) Trials, which began on March 25, 2010, have so far indicted 50 members of JeI. Prominent leaders of Jamaat were convicted and hanged, including JeI politician Abdul Quader Mollah (hanged in 2013), Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami (hanged in 2016) and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mujaheed (hanged in 2015). Ghulam Azam was sentenced to 90 years in prison, while Delawar Hossain Sayedee’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Both died while serving jail terms. Yet, it appears, the Jamaat has been thriving. As reported in June, 2023, in 2008, the number of the party's permanent members or Rukun was 23,863. That figure now stands at 73,046, a threefold rise. The Islamist party has also recorded a threefold rise in the number of its activists, which has leapt to 6.39 lakh from 2.21 lakh during the same period. Additionally, there has been a nearly fivefold rise in the party's women Rukun, and a fourfold rise in women activists. Similarly, the number of associate members has now grown to 22.9 million from 10.3 million in 2008. As expected, along with Jamaat, ICS is also demonstrating its ‘presence’ since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster from power. On October 29, ICS announced its Jahangirnagar University (JU) committee, in a statement on its Facebook page. The names of the committee’s president Harunur Rashid Rafi, secretary Mohibur Rahman Mohib, and publicity secretary Abdullah Al Mamun Saki were declared. On October 28, a Facebook post by ICS revealed that it had 2,200 active members in the Islami University in Kushtia. The post identified ICS’s university unit president HM Abu Musa and general secretary Mahmudul, as having held their posts since January 1, 2024. On October 3, ICS’s Dhaka University (DU) unit declared its full 14-member DU committee. According to the announcement made on Facebook, Mohammad Abu Shadik Kayem was appointed president, with SM Farhad serving as the general secretary. Further, on October 23, a Rangpur Court acquitted 41 JeI-ICS leaders and activists, in a case filed under the Speedy Trial Act-2002, 11 years ago. Judge Zulkan Nahim of the Rangpur Senior Judicial Magistrate Court-1 passed the order acquitting all the accused leaders and activists of Jamaat and Shibir. The case was filed for creating chaos and vandalism on February 18, 2013. The Jamaat has also been trying to extend its outreach to other countries in order to expand its organisational base, mobilise new members and raise funds. In 2022, JeI sent letters to different Muslim countries and Islamic organisations abroad, describing its current political situation in Bangladesh and branding the then Awami League government ‘anti-Islam’. The organisation wrote to the Chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood on December 8, 2022; the Malaysian Prime Minister on November 24, 2022; the Chairman of The Welfare Party of Turkey on November 6, 2022; the President of The Felicity Party of Turkey on October 24, 2022; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 17, 2022 and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on September 30, 2022. Since, August 5, 2024, representatives of many countries have tried to reach out to Jamaat to discuss the future course of politics in Bangladesh. On October 21, JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman met with the Ambassadors of Denmark and Sweden, Christian Brax Møller and Nicholas Weeks, along with Norway's Deputy Head of Mission Marian Rabe Navelsrud. According to JeI’s press release, the meeting discussed Bangladesh's interests, particularly its democracy and electoral system. The ambassadors shared their experiences with the numerical proportional election system used in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, offering suggestions on implementing a similar system in Bangladesh. On October 14, Acting High Commissioner Nardia Simpson, Australian High Commission Bangladesh, met JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman to discuss Australia's views on building strong institutions to ensure the protection and fulfilment of human rights. Shafiqur disclosed that they discussed how to advance relations with 'mutual respect and love,' and described the meeting as 'very friendly and successful.' Earlier, on September 2, 2024, Chinese Ambassador to Dhaka Yao Wen held a meeting with Jamaat’s chief Shafiqur Rahman at the party’s central office in Dhaka. The two talked about political changes in Bangladesh and promised closer co-operation between the people and governments of both the countries. Under the current political scenario of Bangladesh, JeI-ICS are here to stay, thrive and assert their radical political ambition. The future of Bangladesh is likely to substantially be dictated by the radical ideology of JeI-ICS cohort, as democratic and liberal voices are systematically silenced in the country.

Saudi Arabia And Iraq Sign MoU On Military Cooperation	Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman and his Iraqi counterpart Thabet Al-Abbasi signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday aimed at strengthening cooperation in the military field.

Pentagon Says 10K North Korean Troops In Kursk Oblast	By Jim Garamone There are 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, and the Pentagon press secretary said if they enter combat, they are legitimate targets for Ukrainian soldiers. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder also said officials estimate there are now 11,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia. 'We've seen the press reports about alleged [North Korean] combat ops, and we're looking into those,' Ryder told reporters during a news conference. 'At this point, we cannot corroborate those reports. But as you heard [Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III] say last week, should these troops engage in combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.' The North Korean troops entered Russia last month, and Russian troops are training those forces in infantry tactics, operating with unmanned aerial vehicles, artillery tactics, trench-clearing and the like, officials said. 'All indications are that they will provide some type of combat or combat support capability,' the general said. 'We would fully expect that the Ukrainians would do what they need to do to defend themselves and their personnel.' The Russians have provided the North Korean troops with Russian uniforms and equipment. 'We'll see exactly how these forces are integrated into Russian operations, and how they're committed to the battlefield, assuming that they are replacements for Russian forces,' he said. Ryder pointed to Austin's remarks last week discussing the large number of casualties Russian forces are suffering. The North Korean forces could be coming in 'to replace the massive losses that Russia is experiencing. I think that is probably a fair assessment, and I certainly would not want to be a North Korean soldier there.' Ryder also discussed the deployment of additional U.S. forces to the Central Command region. Austin ordered additional ballistic missile defense destroyers, fighter squadrons, tanker aircraft and several B-52 long-range strike bombers to the area. The B-52 bombers have already arrived in the region with the other forces expected in the days and weeks to come. 'These forces will begin to arrive as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group prepares to depart,' Ryder said. 'These deployments are in keeping with our commitments to the protection of U.S. citizens and forces in the Middle East, the defense of Israel and de-escalation through deterrence and diplomacy.' These forces join other U.S. assets such as the terminal high-altitude area missile defense system, which has deployed to Israel, as well as an amphibious ready group, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit. These forces 'demonstrate the flexible nature of U.S. global defense posture and U.S. capability to deploy worldwide on short notice to meet evolving national security threats,' Ryder said. 'Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqBb3CZfNdiFE	2024-11-04T15:28:50-08:00	
Israel’s Campaign Against UNRWA Precedes Oct. 7 – OpEd	The Israeli Knesset last week adopted two bills that will effectively ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, from carrying out any activity in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Simply put, the decision is catastrophic, because UNRWA is the main international body responsible for the welfare of millions of Palestinians throughout the Occupied Territories and much of the region. Israel followed up its decision by attacking and damaging an UNRWA office in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank. This was the Israeli government’s way of demonstrating its seriousness regarding the matter. This is not the first time that Israel has pursued an anti-UNRWA agenda and, contrary to claims by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, the decision is not linked to the current genocidal war on Gaza or the unfounded claims that UNRWA supports 'terrorism.' An independent review commissioned by the UN in April revealedthat Israel 'made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' but that it 'has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.' However, Israel’s claims did a great deal of damage to the organization, as 13 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany and Italy, withheld badly needed funds that were helping Gaza stave off a horrific famine. Eventually, most of these countries reinstated their financial support, though without apologizing to the Palestinians who were adversely impacted by their unfair initial decisions. Unrepentant, Israel continued to unleash its relentless war on the organization. 'UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable,' Netanyahu said in a statement last week. The anti-UNRWA rhetoric remains functional for Israel. Amplified by the ever-willing US mainstream media, Israel has managed to keep UNRWA’s name in the news, always associating it with 'supporting terrorism.' So, when the Knesset voted for the anti-UNRWA bills, many media outlets conveyed the news as if it was the only rational conclusion to an essentially fabricated story. Israel’s problem with UNRWA has little to do with the organization itself, but with its underlying political representation as a UN entity whose mission is predicated on providing 'assistance and protection to Palestine refugees.' UNRWA was established in 1949 by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV). It began its operations on May 1, 1950, and, with time, it became central to the survival of a large number of Palestinian refugee communities in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Many have rightly criticized the UN for failing to supplement UNRWA’s humanitarian mandate with a political equivalent that would ultimately help Palestinians achieve their right of return in accordance with UN Resolution 194. For Israel, however, UNRWA remained problematic. According to Tel Aviv’s thinking, UNRWA’s existence is a constant reminder that there is a distinct group of people called Palestinian refugees. And though UNRWA is not a political organization, the Palestinian refugee crisis and all related UN resolutions that emphasize the 'inalienable' rights of these refugees are very political. Taking advantage of the initial, albeit brief, sympathy with Israel worldwide and the massive campaign of misinformation emanating from Israel and its allies, Netanyahu used the Oct. 7 attacks as an opportunity to further demonize UNRWA. However, his campaign started much earlier. One key player in the war on UNRWA has been Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former US President Donald Trump. Kushner, who invested much time in helping Israel, made UNRWA a key point in his plan. He vowed to carry out a 'sincere effort to disrupt' the work of the organization, a leaked 2018 email revealed. Due to international rejection and solidarity, Kushner ultimately failed. Even the withholding of funds by the US administration did not force the organization to shut down, although it did negatively impact the lives of millions of Palestinians. The ongoing war on Gaza and the push to annex large parts of the West Bank represented a golden opportunity for Netanyahu and his extremist government to increase the pressure on UNRWA. They have been enabled by unconditional US support and the willingness of various Western governments to recklessly act upon Israel’s false claims regarding the UN organization. By allowing Israel to delegitimize the very organization responsible for enforcing international law, the UN’s crisis becomes much deeper. An impassioned plea made by UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese last week reflected the frustration felt by many UN-affiliated officials regarding the growing irrelevance of the organization. In a speech, Albanese pointed out that, if the UN’s failures continue, it will become 'more and more irrelevant to the rest of the world,' especially during these times of turmoil. This irrelevance is already being felt by millions of Palestinians, mainly in Gaza but also in the West Bank. Though Palestinians continue to withstand and reject and resist Israeli aggression, they are fed up with an international system that seems to offer them only words and little action. Israel’s banning of UNRWA should represent an opportunity for those concerned about the standing of the UN to remind Israel that member states that have no respect for international law deserve to be delegitimized. This time, words must be accompanied by action. Nothing else will suffice.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqNyVu7n0dbzF	2024-11-04T15:24:52-08:00	
Sacred Artifact Dispute Reveals Japan-Korea Tensions – OpEd	By Cristian Martini Grimaldi (UCA News) -- Long-standing tensions between Japan and South Korea have reached a symbolic peak over a Buddhist statue stolen from Kannonji Temple on the Japanese island of Tsushima and transported to South Korea in 2012. This is despite South Korea’s Supreme Court recently ruling in favor of its return. Though a small group of individuals stole the statue, its fate has become a broader reflection of unresolved tensions that echo historical grievances dating back to Japan’s occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Even though both governments formally signed a UNESCO convention mandating the return of the stolen cultural property, the South Korean government’s inaction has reignited the complex debate surrounding anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea. The Buddhist statue at the center of this controversy, the 'Seated Statue of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva,' holds a special place in Japan as a designated cultural property of Nagasaki Prefecture. It was stolen by a South Korean group in 2012, marking one of many artifacts removed from Japanese temples by South Korean thieves during a time when Tsushima’s temples and shrines were under repeated assault. This theft wave led to intense anti-theft security measures across the island and fueled frustration among the Japanese population. Korean authorities recovered the religious artifact in early 2013, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea claimed ownership, arguing that the statue had been initially looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. In response, Kannonji Temple stated that it had acquired the statue legally during the Joseon Period to protect it from frequent iconoclasm. This position holds historical support given the extensive records of Korean iconoclastic acts in temples at that time. The dispute over the statue, therefore, represents not just a question of ownership but an ongoing struggle over the memory of Japan’s occupation of Korea and how history is perceived on both sides of the East Sea. This is far from the only point of contention between Japan and South Korea, as recent years have seen multiple diplomatic and economic disputes that underscore the fragility of their relationship: For instance, South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered Japanese companies to pay reparations to Korean laborers forced to work during World War II, a ruling Japan strongly opposed. Japan argues that all reparation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty, but many in Korea see this as insufficient acknowledgment of historical wrongs. And of course, in 2019, Japan placed export restrictions on materials vital to South Korea’s technology sector, officially citing security concerns. South Korea interpreted this as retaliation for the forced labor compensation rulings, resulting in a trade dispute that impacted high-tech industries in both countries. And the most internationally known case of comfort women. South Korea has long demanded a more formal apology and compensation for the Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during the occupation. While Japan has offered apologies and financial support over the years, South Korean public sentiment is that Japan’s remorse is thus incomplete. The topic often arises on anniversaries and at international forums, fueling resentment on both sides. Let’s not forget the territorial disputes over the Dokdo/Takeshima Islands. Both countries claim sovereignty over the Dokdo (in Korean) or Takeshima (in Japanese) Islands, which are located in the Sea of Japan. This territorial dispute is another recurring issue that stirs up strong emotions, with both sides staging protests and diplomatic statements asserting their claims. The recent resistance from South Korea to returning the stolen Buddhist statue demonstrates that its national identity is still fueled by lingering resentment toward Japan. This unwillingness to fully reconcile reflects a societal perspective in which Japan’s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 remains a defining trauma. For many South Koreans, Japan’s actions during the occupation are not merely historical facts but a reminder of a brutal period that shaped the nation’s modern identity. South Korea’s national ethos continues to be influenced by historical remembrance, which, in some ways, also shapes the political landscape. Political leaders in South Korea occasionally evoke anti-Japanese sentiment to rally public support or to divert attention from internal challenges, a tactic that has successfully resonated due to the ingrained historical narratives. The question of returning the Buddhist statue may seem like a small diplomatic matter, but it highlights the broader, unresolved issues between Japan and South Korea. While both nations are allies of the United States and share common concerns over regional security, including the threat from North Korea, their strained relations often limit real effective cooperation. In the end, the fate of the Buddhist statue remains a powerful symbol of a fractured history that, even in modern times, still holds sway over both nations’ political and cultural landscapes. The broader question is whether Japan and South Korea can move beyond symbolic disputes to focus on a future that acknowledges but is not overshadowed by their shared past. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqEP4yrQaDPjO	2024-11-04T15:23:30-08:00	
Lying, Sitting Or All-Fours Position?	Whether lying on their back, all-fours position, sitting upright or squatting - women adopt different birthing positions during childbirth. What has not yet been researched is how the respective final birthing position affects the satisfaction of the woman giving birth. Researchers from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn and the University of Cologne have now investigated precisely this. In particular, they also took into account whether the choice of birthing position was voluntary. The results showed that it was precisely when this was chosen voluntarily that women were more satisfied. Around three quarters of those surveyed were lying during the birth and were particularly dissatisfied if they felt that they had not made this choice themselves. However, if the expectant mothers had chosen the supine or lateral supine position themselves, the position actually tended to make them more satisfied. The study has now been published in the journal 'Archives of Gynecology'. For a long time, the supine position was the most common birth position in Western countries - this gave obstetricians unhindered access to the woman and child. In various cultures, however, upright birthing positions, such as sitting or squatting, are also widespread. Which position is best for expectant mothers and the unborn child is controversial in the literature. 'Until today, international guidelines usually only recommend that women should adopt their preferred birthing position,' explains Prof. Dr. Nadine Scholten, who recently became head of the UKB's Research Unit for Health Communication and Health Services Research and holds a professorship in psychosomatic and psycho-oncological health services research at the University of Bonn. With regard to birthing positions, the German guideline also states that women should adopt the position that seems most comfortable to them. However, they should also be encouraged to adopt an upright position in the final phase of birth. 'In reality, whether they ultimately lie, sit or squat depends on the wishes of the expectant mothers themselves, but also on the suggestions of the midwives, obstetricians and sometimes necessary medical measures,' explains Prof. Dr. Brigitte Strizek, Director of the Clinic for Obstetrics and Prenatal Medicine at the UKB. Focus on women's satisfaction A team led by first and corresponding author Prof. Scholten, who carried out the study at the Institute for Medical Sociology, Health Services Research and Rehabilitation Research (IMVR) at the University of Cologne and the UKB, wanted to find out which birthing position women were most satisfied with afterwards. Almost 800 mothers were asked about their final birthing position and how satisfied they were with the birth overall using an anonymous questionnaire. All of the data analyzed here was from women who had given birth vaginally in a hospital without the use of a vacuum extraction or forceps, and who had given birth eight to twelve months previously at the time of the survey. In their study, the researchers also asked about the satisfaction of the mothers - depending on whether the birth position was freely chosen or not. The reasons for not choosing a free position were also asked. It was found that over three quarters of mothers gave birth to their child lying on their side or on their back. Of these women, up to 40 percent stated that they had not chosen the birth position voluntarily. 'The most common reason given by respondents was instructions from medical staff,' explains Prof. Scholten. The most common position assigned by obstetricians was the supine position. It was striking that women were more satisfied with their birth if they were allowed to choose the position voluntarily - especially if they chose the supine position themselves. Women who were not free to choose their birthing position were particularly dissatisfied if the medical staff specified this and not the CTG to record the heart rate of the unborn child and labor activity or the epidural, the anesthetic to relieve pain, prevented the desired position. Self-determination not always given in the delivery room 'The number of women who did not choose the birth position themselves is particularly striking, as is the associated lower level of satisfaction with the birth,' summarizes co-author Prof. Strizek. However, the team cannot confirm whether an increased voluntary choice of birth position in the future would result in fewer women giving birth in the supine position. 'In order to increase women's subjective satisfaction with their birth experience, they should be given the opportunity to adopt their preferred position,' appeals lead author Prof. Scholten. 'The first step is to increase the awareness of medical staff and empower women to understand and better communicate their preferences.' Prof. Strizek adds: 'If a certain position would be advantageous for the woman giving birth from a medical point of view, we as obstetric teams need to explain this better to the women so that they rarely have the feeling that they have not determined the birth position themselves.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqCOmzdtD1u__	2024-11-04T15:21:44-08:00	
Spain: Crowds Throw Mud, Insults At King On Visit To Flood-Hit Va...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Spain’s King Felipe VI was met with hostility from residents on Sunday (3 November) as he visited Paiporta, one of the hardest-hit towns in the Valencia region, where frustration is mounting over delays in weather warnings and emergency response following last week’s devastating floods. At the moment of writing, the storm caused devastating floods that have killed more than 217 people, with many more feared missing. At least 62 people died in Paiporta, a suburb of the city of Valencia, RTVE reported. The king and Queen Letizia, accompanied by Spain’s Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and Valencia’s regional President, Carlos Mazón, toured the flood-hit town where rescue and cleanup efforts were underway. Teams continued to search for missing people while clearing mud and water from homes. Online footage captured scenes of angry crowds booing, shouting insults, and hurling mud at the King’s entourage as they moved through Paiporta’s streets. Shouts of 'murderers,' 'shame,' and 'get out' could be heard in the footage, while a young man was seen accusing the King of a 'disgraceful' response to the disaster, EFE reported. Though Queen Letizia, the Prime Minister, and the regional president were later evacuated, the King reportedly stayed behind to continue speaking with residents affected by the tragedy. This disaster marks Spain’s deadliest flood in over a century. The floods sparked outrage over delays with weather warnings and the perceived slow emergency response time by authorities. Sánchez announced on Saturday that he had ordered 10,000 additional police officers and soldiers to assist with the rescue work. 'It is time to put all our efforts into the colossal task ahead. We have only one enemy to fight: the destruction caused by the catastrophe. We have to give it our all. And we have to do it together. Together,' the Spanish PM said Saturday. Nearly a week after the disaster struck, weather warnings for severe rain and thunderstorms remained in effect for much of Spain’s east coast.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSv_IMdCVDzTh	2024-11-03T17:28:03-08:00	
Fighting Ideologies: Lessons Learned From The War On Terror And T...	By Heather S. Gregg Introduction (FPRI) -- The United States along with its allies and partners devoted critical time and energy to countering the ideology of al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) as part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat these groups in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). These ideologies, which were part of a larger interpretation of Islam called Jihadi Salafism, formed a critical warfighting capability for these terrorist groups that explained what was wrong with the world and who was to blame for it, an ideal state for how the world ought to be, and how to get there. Today, the United States and its allies face threats posed by strategic state competitors, especially Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. While considerable focus has been placed on these countries’ military capabilities, including their nuclear ambitions, considerably less attention has been paid to understanding and fighting their ideologies. As with AQ, ISIS, and other Salafi Jihadis, ideology plays a critical role in the warfighting capabilities of our strategic competitors, and we should be actively taking measures to undermine their ideology. Some (but not all) of the lessons learned from countering Jihadi Salafism have application to today’s fight against our strategic adversaries. Most importantly, we need to understand ideology as a warfighting capability and consider how our actions uphold or undermine these ideologies. Additionally, we need to fight both the military capacity and the ideology of our adversaries in a synergistic way where both are undermined simultaneously. And, while doing this, we need to be careful of increased apocalypticism in our adversaries’ ideologies, which could signal a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Ideology as a Warfighting Capability It is important to first understand the critical role that ideology plays in conflict of any shape and size. Ideologies are an important warfighting capability because they offer an overarching narrative that explains the current state of the world we live in, who is to blame for the suffering and injustice people face, and why violence is needed to right these wrongs. Ideologies perform several important functions in times of prolonged conflict. First, they encourage recruitment and retention of those supporting the fight; in fact, one could argue that since the birth of the levée en masse, ideologies have been necessary for encouraging recruitment of mass armies and sustaining their numbers. This is also true of creating and sustaining a fighting force for nonstate actors. Second, ideologies provide leaders and followers with a 'cause' that they can point back to during military setbacks and provide hope that the fight is not in vain. Powerful ideologies also situate setbacks within a wider context of victory, which may not happen in this lifetime, but will occur. The most powerful ideologies explain failures and setbacks as actual successes in the grand scenario and a better world for which individuals and groups are fighting. When considering ideology as a warfighting capability, one useful definition includes three subparts: a critique for how the world currently is, a set of beliefs for how the world ought to be, and a course of action for realizing that world. Each of these subcomponents provides opportunities to both understand the messaging of the adversary and create possible countermeasures to their worldview. Critique of the current world Critiquing the current state of the world is arguably the most important component of an ideology because it identifies the problem, explains how things came to be this way, and assigns blame for the situation people find themselves in. Critically, assigning blame also offers a target to channel one’s outrage and to begin to address the problem. The critique, in other words, draws the battle lines between 'us' and 'them' and explains who needs to be targeted and why. This part of an ideology, if constructed well, should be able to sustain minor setbacks to the war and be broad enough to absorb specific inconsistencies in facts and circumstances. It should be able to draw the widest number of supporters within the population it seeks to mobilize. As counterinsurgency expert David Galula famously noted in Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice, it is easier to get people to agree to be against something than to be for something. Most powerful ideologies, therefore, provide details on the problem but are more abstract on the solution (see below). Finally, powerful ideologies do a good job explaining the problem with history, culture, identity, religion, and other tools that personalize and emotionalize the struggle. The threat is not some distant, abstract problem, but it is here and now, and deeply personal. It requires both an individual and a collective response to defeat the threat. How the world ought to be As stated above, powerful ideologies provide more detail on their critique of the world, including especially who is to blame, than on the solution. Typically, a description of how the world ought to be is aspirational; it is light on details because specifics can divide people and therefore undermine active and passive support. The Islamic State, the Caliphate, the Worker’s Utopia, the Empire of the Sun, the Reich: these are all examples of ideal states that, while thin on details of the end state they were seeking, drew broad support from their target populations. The course of action The course of action in an ideology, like the solution, is usually broad and philosophical. It is more abstract than a specific strategy for what to do. Three approaches are particularly important for the types of political ideologies we face today: violent (including but not limited to the use of terrorism), nonviolent, and apocalyptic, which calls for the figurative destruction of the world as we know it with the hope of ushering in a new, better world in its place (the solution). Examples of each of these courses of action abound. Karl Marx’s articulation of the communist revolutionargued that the capitalist system could only be changed through violence; the system and the people that upheld it had to be destroyed by force rather than reformed. Mahatma Gandhi stated the only way to end colonialization in India was through non-violent activism against the British; this was the philosophical underpinning of the 'Quit India' movement. One strain of White supremacism aims to foment a racial holy war 'RAHOWA' with the goal of ridding the world of people of color, who bear the stain of the sins of Cain, and to usher in a new, better, racially pure world in its place. It is important to note that broad ideologies can support different courses of action to arrive at how the world ought to be. Salafism, as an ideological interpretation of Islam, supports a peaceful movement and a political approach, as well as a violent incarnation. These different approaches to realizing their ideal state provide opportunities for countermeasures that can exploit these ideological disagreements. Salafi Jihadi Ideology of AQ and ISIS Salafism is not a new ideology. Most scholars trace this interpretation of Islam back to the 19th century and include ideologues such as the Saudi ‘Abd al-Wahhāb and Egyptian scholar Sayyid Qutb. Salafism as an ideology offers a compelling critique of the current state of the world, claiming that society is in rapid decline, which is evident by the number of wars, social unrest, moral decay, and overall suffering in the world. One strain of Salafism purports that the world is in the end of times and draws on apocalyptic expectations outlined in the Qur’an, the Sunna, Hadith, and other sources as evidence that the end is near, including natural and manmade disasters. Salafism identifies two broad causes of the world’s rapid decline. The first and most important culprit is failed Muslim leadership, including the Ulama, or Muslim scholars, who have relied on past interpretations and rulings in Islam, instead of the words of the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet Muhammed to guide the community. This approach has led not only the Ulama off the true path of Islam but also society and has led to confusion and disunity in the umma, which is the worldwide Muslim community. Muslim rulers have contributed to the umma’s downfall by supporting and upholding these false teachings. The second cause of decline is the presence and influence of the West, which includes its actual colonization of much of the Muslim world, its support of the state of Israel, and its introduction of Western secularism and democracy, ideas that have led Muslims away from God’s rule. Western social influences in the Muslim world, including Western education, feminism, and homosexuality, have further led to its downfall. The Muslim world has fallen into a state of Jahiliya, ignorance, from the examples set by the West and by Muslims leaders who blindly follow these bankrupt and corrupt ideas. The solution to these problems is a return to the right path of Islam as articulated in the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet Muhammed, and to turn away from bid’ah, or any religious innovation, as well as Western ideas. Salafis further emphasize the need to recognize the indivisibility of God, or tawhid, in all aspects of life. Returning to the pure path of Islam will end divisions among Muslims, including Shia and Sunnis, and unify the umma. Ultimately, returning to what they believe is the pure path of Islam as articulated by the Qur’an and exemplified by the Prophet Muhammed’s life and the purification of the dar al Islam, the land and people connected to the faith, from foreign influence will create the conditions for the end of times, with a new world of justice and peace emerging in its place. Importantly, Salafism as an ideology is not de facto violent. According to Quintan Wictorowicz, Salafis fall into three categories of actors to realize their ideal state: what he calls nonviolent purists, politicos (those that aim to work through the state to realize Salafi goals), and jihadists, or those who see violence as the necessary path to realizing their utopic goals. Clearly, AQ and ISIS are proponents of the jihadi course of action for realizing Salafi ideology. Both movements see violence and shedding blood as necessary for realizing a unified umma, free of internal corruption and external influence, adhering to the oneness of God. Both groups also see the return of the Caliphate, the one right ruler, to the dar al Islam as a necessary state for returning Islam to the right path. Despite these similarities, ISIS and AQ also have some important differences. ISIS is deeply apocalyptic in its vision of the world and its salvation. Its messaging is steeped with symbols and references to Muslim expectations of the apocalypse, including discussions about a great battle in 'Dabiq' with 'Rome' (the West), which is an apocalyptic expectation, as are twelve righteous rulers in Islam, the eighth of which was believed to be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (who was killed in 2019), to name a few. ISIS, in fact, justifies its mass atrocities and shedding blood as a necessary pathway to realizing the apocalypse and ushing in a new and better world. Graeme Wood’s 2015 Atlantic article 'What ISIS Really Wants'summarizes, 'In fact, much of what the group does looks nonsensical except in light of a sincere, carefully considered commitment to returning civilization to a seventh-century legal environment, and ultimately to bringing about the apocalypse.' Countering Salafi Jihadi Ideology Throughout the GWOT, the United States and its allies implemented several initiatives aimed at countering the ideologies of AQ and ISIS. Three broad efforts are particularly important: countering the message, stopping the spread of the message, and creating a new message altogether. When done together and synchronized with other efforts, including military action, these efforts began to counter the ideology. Countering the Message The United States and its allies and partners took the ideology of AQ and ISIS seriously from the earliest days of the GWOT. There was an understanding that the ideology was important—that their interpretation of Islam mattered and needed to be addressed to curb recruitment and sympathy for these groups. For example, in the first one hundred days following September 11, the White House issued a statementoutlining how the United States had responded to the attacks. Within the details of forming an international coalition to counter al Qaeda and its use of military action, it included 'respecting Islam' as one of the actions taken. The statement quoted President George W. Bush, who asserted: 'The Islam that we know is a faith devoted to the worship of one God, as revealed through the Holy Qu’ran. It teaches the value and importance of charity, mercy, and peace.' The statement included discussions about protecting Muslims in the United States and celebrating Iftar at the White House. To specifically address claims that the West does not care about Islam or Muslims, the United States took several measures aimed at countering al Qaeda’s message. In 2003, the U.S. Department of State created the YES (Youth Exchange and Study) program, which gave students from Muslim-majority countries the opportunity to study in the United States. It also wrote a booklet called Muslim Life in America, which aimed to counter the specific message that the United States was hostile to Islam. The State Department also helped to fund the P2P (Peer to Peer): Challenging Extremism project, which aimed to amplify local voices speaking out against extremism. The United States has continued to emphasize its commitment to religious tolerance throughout the GWOT. However, efforts aimed at emphasizing Western countries’ tolerance toward Muslims and support of Muslim countries have most likely fallen on deaf ears for several reasons. First, these words and programs were overshadowed by U.S. and allied military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond, which provided key data points for AQ, ISIS, and others of Western aggression toward the Muslim world. Second, the United States specifically lacks credibility over its support of Israel and, by extension, Israel’s actions toward Palestinians and neighboring countries. Third, key European powers, including France, Belgium, and Great Britian, lack credibility in some parts of the world due to the legacy of colonialism. In other words, the messenger has corrupted the message. Taken together, these actions by themselves were unlikely to have successfully countered the anti-Western message of AQ and ISIS. Another major effort at countering the ideology of Salafi Jihadi was deradicalization programs, which aimed to turn individuals that embraced Salafi Jihadism back into healthy members of society. Some deradicalization efforts were government-sponsored, such as Saudi Arabia’s program to rehabilitate low-level jihadis they had apprehended. Other programs were initiated by nonprofits, such as the now shuttered Quillium Foundation in Britain. While this approach to countering the message was less strategic, it was still a major effort in countering Salafi Jihadi ideology. These programs also have faced considerable criticism since their implementation. One critique is their inability to measure overall effectiveness in countering Salafi Jihadi ideology, particularly when the target of these programs was individuals. Another is that these programs unjustly targeted conservative Muslims and aimed to paint all Salafis in a negative light. Finally, in Great Britain and elsewhere, several 'rehabilitated' jihadis were released from prison and went on to perpetrate terrorist acts, including the 2019 London attack by Usman Khan that killed two and the 2020 knife attack by Sudesh Amman. These acts have raised considerable doubt on the efficacy of deradicalization programs in Great Britain. Preventing the Spread of Ideology The United States and allied powers also engaged in several efforts aimed at preventing the spread of AQ and ISIS ideology. Although controversial, one approach was to take ideologues off the battlefield. The 2011 killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, a U.S. citizen, is one example of this effort. The death of ISIS media personnel is another example of this approach. Yet another approach was to disable the ability of AQ and ISIS to spread their ideology through the Internet. Task Force Ares is credited with disabling a range of Internet activities of ISIS. As with efforts to counter Salafi Jihadi ideology, measuring the effectiveness of preventing the spread of ideology is nearly impossible to do; it amounts to trying to measure something in the future that may, or may not, happen. Similarly, attributing measurable changes in behavior, like a downtick in recruitment, to one activity is difficult to do when a multitude of variables are occurring at once, what is known in academia as 'overdetermined.' Furthermore, as with most education programs, in addition to being overdetermined, changes in behavior may only be visible over time, making measuring these effects in the present difficult. Creating a New Message A third approach to countering the ideology of Salafi Jihadism has been to provide an entirely new message, as opposed to countering the ideology or trying to prevent its spread. One program, the Australian Beyond Bali Project, created a publicly available curriculum aimed at introducing peace and tolerance education in public schools. In Indonesia, the Muhammadiya School system, which was created in response to Dutch and British schools systems during colonialism, aims to reinforce the tolerant strain of Islam indigenous to Indonesia, which is distinct from Salafi Jihadism. As with the other countermeasures aimed at blunting the ideology of Salafi Jihadism, measuring precise effects of these programs is unlikely given the vast number of variables that influence why individuals and groups support a set of beliefs over another, and if those beliefs solely influence behavior. Finally, in addition to looking at various actions taken to deliberately try to undermine Salafi Jihadi ideology and change violent behavior, it is important to also address actions taken that reinforced the ideology, whether intentional or not. The full-scale military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, while undertaken for specific reasons and with broad political and military objectives, were actions that reinforced Salafi Jihadi narratives that the United States and the West more broadly were out to destroy the Muslim world. The fact that neither of these wars went according to plan and left both countries fragile and unstable has provided evidence that supports the Salafi Jihadi narrative that the West is out to destroy Islam. One could also point to the prolonged drone campaign in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan as another example that has reinforced the messaging of Salafi Jihadis of Western intentions toward Muslims and the Muslim world. Counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen wrote in a 2009 New York Times op-ed about the negative consequences of U.S. led drone strikes in Pakistan. He summarized that 'while violent extremists may be unpopular, for a frightened population they seem less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war from afar and often kills more civilians than militants.' Clearly, some of these military actions were necessary to fight transnational jihadis; however, it is critical to keep in mind how military actions might become examples that jihadis will use to reinforce their ideology. Applying Lessons Learned in GWOT to Countering State Ideologies While there are many important distinctions between AQ, ISIS, and state adversaries today, we can still draw important lessons from the twenty-one years fighting Salafi Jihadi ideology in the GWOT. Four salient lessons are proposed here with their application to our current state adversaries in an era of strategic competition. Ideology matters as a warfighting capability. The United States and its allies and partners took the ideology of AQ and ISIS seriously and understood it as something that contributed to the warfighting capability of the adversary. Today, the ideologies of our current strategic competitors, including Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, matter just as much. In fact, these adversaries are using some of the same themes as AQ and ISIS in their own ideologies. Take, for example, this quote from Vladimir Putin in a speech on February 24, 2022, the day of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine: '[The West] sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us, our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now.' This quote easily could have come from Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Awlaki, or Baghdadi. These are not new themes, and we have experience addressing them. As with AQ and ISIS, countering ideology is important because of its effects in luring potential recruits to the fight, both domestic and foreign, and sustaining support for the war in the long term. State actors are no different in these pursuits. Russia and China, for example, have used polarizing language about the West, including about colonialism, in efforts to draw more countries to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) alliance and to argue that BRICS is the best way to counter Western power through alternative economic, financial, and security alliances. As with the GWOT, we need to understand which themes are resonating with whom, why, and to what effect. We need to fight the ideology and the military capacity of our adversaries synergistically. In Russia, Putin’s ideology is playing a critical role in explaining and sustaining his aggression. He has devised an ideology of nationalist imperialism, what he calls 'scientific Putinism,' which goes far beyond financial profits and includes the restoration of the Russian Empire to its former territorial, political, economic, religious, and civilizational glory, free from Western influence. This government is using education at all levels to indoctrinate the population to this vision, and it is believed to have considerable support within the Russian Federation. We should not ignore this warfighting capability and should take measures to undermine and discredit his ideology. The same goes for the ideologies of our other strategic competitors. In the GWOT, academics spent considerable time and energy trying to understand the ideology of AQ and ISIS, how it was resonating with target populations, and why. Organizations like the Pew Foundationconducted repeated surveys on a variety of topics in Muslim-majority countries to get a sense of attitudes and level of support for Salafi Jihadism. Additionally, these same efforts also considered how U.S. and allied foreign policy affected populations, their attitudes toward the West, and their views toward Salafi Jihadism. We need to consider how our actions feed our adversaries’ ideologies and, wherever possible, work to undermine the message, not reinforce it. Successfully doing this requires understanding the message, those who create and propagate it, those who believe the ideology and those who do not, and how our actions affect the message. As with the GWOT, the messenger is as important as the message itself. If Western countries are the adversary’s target of the ideology, standing up and saying how great we are, or what we are (or are not) doing, is unlikely to be effective. This is a lesson learned from the GWOT, and it applies to our current era of strategic competition as well. Additionally, if we have a good messenger, partnering closely with that individual or organization may do more harm than good, especially if we are the adversary’s target. Rather than overtly embracing these individuals and groups, it is better to partner with them silently or not at all. We need to be careful of increased apocalypticism. As with the highly apocalyptic images and language of ISIS, we need to take increased apocalyptic rhetoric from our state adversaries seriously because this message could be the harbinger of mass death and destruction. Unlike ISIS or AQ, Russia, China, and North Korea all have weapons of mass destruction, and Iran has aggressive nuclear ambitions. In other words, these states have access to weapons that could make their dreams of the apocalypse come true. We therefore should pay attention to increased messaging and symbols that have an apocalyptic tone because this rhetoric could signal efforts to prepare populations for mass atrocities, including the use of nuclear weapons or attacking nuclear facilities with the promise of cosmic victory and ushering in a new era. Dimitry Adamsky’s fascinating book, Russian Nuclear Orthodoxy, warns of such a possibility. Measuring effectiveness is difficult. Within all of this, measuring effects in efforts to counter ideologies will be plagued with challenges of overdetermination. This does not mean we should abandon these efforts. Rather, at the strategic level, it is important to keep in mind that it is the totality of efforts across multiple domains and instruments of statecraft that have an overall effect on success or failure of objectives in modern war. Focusing on things that can be easily measured, such as spent ammunition, deaths, sorties, or territory lost or claimed, in most cases will not provide a comprehensive picture of the war’s trajectory. Synchronizing these efforts toward a clear goal should be the pursuit, with macro-level indicators that help identify success or failure in meeting the war’s goal. Ultimately, as with other warfighting capabilities, including materiel, money, industrial capacity, and manpower, the veracity of an ideology will contribute to the intensity and duration of our adversaries’ warfighting capabilities. We ignore the ideology of our adversaries at our own peril. About the author: Dr. Heather S.

Japanese Politics Faces Uncertainty After Electoral Deadlock – An...	By Purnendra Jain The snap election for Japan’s Lower House on 27 October 2024 produced a hung parliament with no political party or coalition receiving a majority, throwing Japanese politics into uncertainty and potential political instability. Japan’s long-time ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior ally Komeito, suffered a crushing defeat in this election. Newly minted Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had called it soon after taking office in early October 2024, hoping to cash in on his honeymoon period and catch the unprepared opposition unawares. Ishiba’s calculations backfired as voters registered their vote of no confidence in the LDP marred by a slush-fund scandal and the party’s unexplained connection to the Unification Church that had forced prime minister Fumio Kishida to resign in September 2024. Ishiba’s promises to clean up and reform the party cut no ice with most voters. A general sense of apathy towards politics and pessimism prevails among voters, resulting in one of the lowest turnout rates since the end of the Second World War. In the 465-member Lower House of Japan’s parliament, the LDP only secured 191 seats — 56 fewer than the 247 it held before the election. Komeito not only reduced its seats to 28, down from 32 seats, but its new leader, Keiichi Ishii, failed to retain his seat in the Lower House, illustrating the party’s waning electoral support and raising questions about its leader’s prospects. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), won 148 seats. Although this is up 50 seats from the CDP’s pre-election strength of 98, it’s not enough to form a government in its own right. Another opposition party, the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), gained substantially by quadrupling its strength from seven to 28 seats. The Japan Innovation Party (JIP), with 38 seats, and the DPP, with 28 seats, will hold the key to forming the next government either in coalition with the LDP or the CDP. Even after one of the LDP’s worst electoral performances, Ishiba did not stand down. Instead, he vowed to continue as prime minister, reform the party, and press ahead with his reform agenda. His political survival now depends on drawing support from some opposition parties besides Komeito. The most likely allies are the JIP and the DPP, both conservative stripes, although neither has yet committed to a coalition with the LDP. A parliamentary vote to designate a new prime minister must occur within 30 days after an election. Whether Prime Minister Ishiba or the largest opposition party leader, the DPJ’s Yoshihide Noda, wins the race is unclear at this stage. Both Ishiba and Noda will be busy with horse trading and power jockeying to have the required number when voting takes place on the floor of the parliament. How opposition parties and independent members align with the two major parties will determine who forms the government and who takes the helm. All bets are off at this stage. In any scenario, the new government will stand on shaky ground. Ishiba’s position would be weak, not only because his government would depend on opposition and independent members for policymaking and legislation but also because he faces an internally fractured party and leaders waiting in the wings to unseat him. Noda, the recently elected leader of the CDP, served as prime minister from 2011–2012 and was the leader of the now-defunct Democratic Party of Japan, reconstituted as CDP. But non-LDP governments in Japan have a poor track record. In 1993, when the LDP was defeated for the first time since 1955, it was touted as a new political era. This coalition government did not last long, and the LDP returned to power with coalition partners in 1994. Similarly, when the DPJ defeated the LDP in 2009, it raised the prospect of a truly two-party system. Yet the opposition in power failed again due to internal conflict and frequent changes of leadership, with three prime ministers in three years. The party suffered a humiliating electoral defeat in the 2012 general election with the LDP under Shinzo Abe reclaiming government. While the volatile situation makes domestic politics unstable and fragile by increasing the potential for policy paralysis, a multi-party coalition government in Tokyo will be weak internationally. Japan faces significant diplomatic conundrums. In its neighbourhood, China and North Korea constantly challenge Japan through their air and sea incursions into Japanese territories, missile launches and nuclear sabre rattling. Through its support to Ukraine and NATO, Japan has also upset Russia, its northern neighbour, which has formed a triple axis with China and North Korea, making Japan’s strategic environment even more precarious. Japan’s most significant foreign policy issue is its relationship with its security ally, the United States. Who wins the presidential race and how the new Japanese leader engages with the new US president will be watched in Japan, the region and around the world. A weak leader and unstable government in Tokyo do not bode well for Japan’s domestic policy challenges of inflation and low wages with a stagnant economy or foreign affairs demands. Neither Japan nor its friends and allies want a revolving door of prime ministers and frequent government changes in Tokyo.

Why America Embraces India’s Strategic Autonomy – Analysis	By Vivek Mishra and Kashvi Chaudhary There is a strong chatter in Washington DC that the US cut India significant slack under the Biden administration by keeping India embraced despite its unwavering ties with Russia throughout the shadow of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The perspectives in Delhi are tilted in its favour in that the US needs India just as much. The answer lies somewhere in between those two strands. As such, it is important to explore the nuances that make America’s embrace of Delhi compulsively strong. India, today, practices a unique realism where it does not seek a brutal interest-oriented path to any regional or global objective. Instead, its interests are balanced by values, most conspicuously of a rising power which is not expansionist and seeks dialogues to resolve disputes, as was exemplified in the recent border thaw with China. Furthermore, India’s rise and balanced position stemming from its strategic autonomy reflect a nuanced revisionism in at least two ways: first, it has nudged the global economy in its way. In the latest World Economic Outlook data shared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India continues to lead large economies in growth. Second, as a large economy seeking a bigger role at the global stage, India’s strategic choices have enforced recalibrations upon the West. This is particularly in contrast to India’s choices in its neighbourhood, where India has shown a considerable degree of adaptation itself. In many ways, India seeks to redefine its own realistic assessment, which reflects its role as a major power driving and capitalising on shifts in the global order. An important driver of that pursuit has been its economic growth, while its military strength has grown simultaneously. India’s engagement with America is at the forefront of this shift. Arguably, this shift also involves countries striving for greater individualism. India recognises that to achieve greater economic growth, it has to stay away from the idea of a rigid alliance system, which is conventionally security-based. In large parts, India’s strategic autonomy finds its roots in its non-alignment, which prevented it from becoming a proxy state of the Cold War era. The non-aligned movement was very much a strategic choice, as is its evolved form, strategic autonomy. Today, India is unapologetically focused on economic growth and wants to ensure peace and stability in the region by stepping up and being the first responder in the region through robust HADR undertakings. Most of all, India stands in regional contrast to most other countries in Asia in its position as a solid democratic anchor in the Indo-Pacific. In the security paradigm, this has often meant how India can balance China. Besides, India’s broad spectrum of democracy and a 'trusted' global partner status have allowed the sharing of sensitive information and technology, thus permitting America to have a substantively advanced situational awareness in the Indo-Pacific. These may be some compelling reasons why America seems to embrace India’s strategic autonomy despite the absence of a total strategic lockstep. For Washington, the China question is rapidly shifting. China’s behaviour on the global stage inherently opposes the type of hegemony the US aims to project and its fundamental belief system. While in the Indo-Pacific, the US’ approach hangs in the balance with two ongoing distractions in the form of the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the war in the Middle East, China’s increasing role and influence with opposing actors may undercut Washington’s Indo-Pacific focus. Given China’s recent strides in the Gulf, with its partnerships with Iran and Saudi Arabia, China is actively looking for a larger strategic space in the region. Furthermore, China’s stance on the war ideologically undermines Israel, America’s strongest ally in the Middle East. As Saudi Arabia is negotiating a new relationship with the US, China is keen to make economic inroads in the region. With the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China also aims to drive a complex interdependence with key US allies across the Middle East, Europe, and the Pacific. It is also essential to note that China’s economic ambitions are not the core issue that America faces but the geopolitical and ideological threat it poses. There is a tacit recognition in Washington of the indispensability of India in countering China geopolitically in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, the US’ larger regional policy in South Asia has sometimes diverged from core Indian interests, as has India’s own interests in the region from those of Washington. This has allowed India and the US to keep a broad bandwidth in their bilateral relationship, which a formal alliance would not have allowed. This seeming distance has been beneficial to both India and the US. For instance, China’s state behaviour on the global stage inherently opposes the US hegemony, necessitating alternative paradigms of both engagement and opposition. India, with its revamped image in the Global South, a leading economy and a key future player in the global order, provides that dual alternative, which is required to both engage China responsibly and stand up to it when necessary. Most importantly, it replaces the unilateral prism of hostility and provides a nuance to statecraft. India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, in his book 'The India Way', aptly summed it up by emphasising that India’s goal is to grow together, not separately. For the US, one of the most reassuring things for a bet on India is the latter’s focus on a strong Neighbourhood-First Policy. It has allowed India to balance regional peace and security with growth, especially from its standpoint of the largest economy in the region. Further, India’s 'No-First Use' policy, its refusal to station troops in Afghanistan despite US pressure under the Trump administration, positions it as a non-threat to its neighbours - a key component of stable growth. Meanwhile, the trade between India and the US has provided layers of trust in the relationship. In 2023, India rose to the US’ top exporter of refined petroleum, while most of this oil was procured by India from Russia, pointing to the fact that there remains a realistic assessment of bilateral ties rather than it being ideologically driven. Any enforcement of 'values' to navigate in the new world order, which is deeply fractured in the long run, could mean a collective downfall. Coming from the non-alignment legacy, India recognises the perils of such a mindset first-hand. India has positioned itself to champion a new global order, which is more pragmatic than rigid and away from conflicts, navigating a deeply polarised world order sped by the ongoing conflicts in two continents. For America, a partner in the Global South with such a balance may be an asset, as is India’s partnership with the US in compounding its rise to become the stakeholder that it desires. Partnership with successive administrations in Washington has proven that consolidating at home by building a more self-sufficientgrowth and strengthening its strategic partnership with the US may be a diplomatic balance which can be maintained. Compelling pulls on both sides have allowed India and the US to maintain independence in decision-making and yet align on issues of long-term strategic importance.

Jeff Bezos Is Right: Legacy Media Must Self-Reflect – OpEd	I can count on one hand the times I have seen leaders of media organisations engage in anything that could be described as hard-hitting forms of self-critique in the public square. One of those times was when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on public record, in a letter to the Republican House Judiciary Committee (dated August 26th, 2024), that he 'regretted' bowing to pressure from the Biden administration to censor 'certain Covid-19 content.' Another was the almost unprecedented public apology in January 2022 (here’s a report in English) by a Danish newspaper that it had towed the 'official' line during the pandemic far too uncritically. We witnessed a third moment of critical introspection from a media owner the other day, when Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post and is the largest shareholder of Amazon, suggested in an op-ed in his own newspaper that legacy media may have themselves at least partly to blame for the loss of public trust in the media. In this context, he argued that his decision not to authorise the Washington Post to endorse a presidential candidate could be 'a meaningful step' toward restoring public trust in the media, by addressing the widespread perception that media organisations are 'biased' or not objective. You don’t need to be a fan of Jeff Bezos, any more than of Mark Zuckerberg, to recognise that it is a good thing that prominent representatives of the financial and political elite of modern societies, whatever their personal flaws and contradictions, at least begin to express doubts about the conduct and values of media organisations. Some truths, no matter how obvious, will not resonate across society until prominent opinion leaders viewed as 'safe' or 'established,' say them out loud. Bezos opens his Washington Post op-ed by pointing out that public trust in American media has collapsed in recent generations and is now at an all-time low (a substantial decline can be seen across many European countries as well if you compare the Reuters Digital News Report from 2015 with that of 2023 — for example, Germany sees a drop from 60% to 42% trust and the UK sees a drop from 51% to 33%). In the annual public surveys about trust and reputation, journalists and the media have regularly fallen near the very bottom, often just above Congress. But in this year’s Gallup poll, we have managed to fall below Congress. Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working…Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Something we are doing is clearly not working. This is the sort of candid introspection we need to see a lot more of in journalists and media owners. If someone stops trusting you, it’s easy to point the finger at someone else or blame it on 'disinformation' or citizen ignorance. It’s not so easy to make yourself vulnerable and take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror to figure out how you’ve lost their trust. The owner of the Washington Post does not offer an especially penetrating diagnosis of the problem. However, he does point out some relevant facts that may be worth pondering if we are to come to a deeper understanding of the fact that the Joe Rogan podcast, with an estimated audience of 11 million, now has nearly 20 times CNN’s prime-time audience: The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite. More and more, we talk to ourselves. (It wasn’t always this way — in the 1990s we achieved 80 percent household penetration in the DC metro area.) More and more, we talk to ourselves. Much of the legacy media has become an ideological echo chamber, as I pointed out in an op-ed in the Irish Times a few years ago. Conversations go back and forth between journalists about things they care about, while a substantial number of ordinary citizens, whose minds are on other things, like paying their mortgage, getting a medical appointment, or worrying about the safety of their streets, switch off. While there are some notable exceptions, the echo-chamber effect is real and may be part of the explanation for the flight of a growing number of citizens into the arms of alternative media. The increasing disconnect between self-important legacy journalists and the man and woman on the street has been evidenced by the fact that so-called 'populism' was sneered at by many journalists across Europe and North America while gathering serious momentum on the ground. It was also evidenced by the fact that serious debates over issues like the harms of lockdowns and the problem of illegal immigration, were largely sidelined by many mainstream media across Europe while becoming a catalyst for successful political movements such as the Brothers of Italy, Le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France, Alternativ für Deutschland in Germany, and the Freedom Party in Austria. Perhaps part of the problem is that those working in well-established media organisations tend to take the moral and intellectual high ground and severely underestimate the capacity of ordinary citizens to think through issues for themselves, or to intelligently sort through competing sources of information. Indeed, even Jeff Bezos, in his attempt to be critical of legacy media, could not resist depicting alternative media exclusively in negative terms. 'Many people,' he lamented, 'are turning to off-the-cuff podcasts, inaccurate social media posts and other unverified news sources, which can quickly spread misinformation and deepen divisions.' While there is undoubtedly an abundance of confusion and false and misleading information on social media, it is by no means absent from the legacy media, which has gotten major issues badly wrong. For example, many mainstream journalists and talk show hosts uncritically celebrated the idea that Covid vaccines would block viral transmission, in the absence of any solid scientific evidence for such a belief. Similarly, many journalists dismissed the Covid lab-leak theory out of hand, until it emerged that it was actually a scientifically respectable hypothesis. We should thank Jeff Bezos for highlighting the crisis of trust in the media. But his complacency about the integrity of traditional news sources and his dismissive attitude toward 'alternative sources' of news and information are themselves part of the reason why many people are losing respect for the legacy media.

Harris, Trump Head To Battleground States 2 Days Ahead Of Electio...	By Ken Bredemeier Seeking to sway the remaining few undecided voters and rally their supporters to the polls, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump trekked Sunday to political battleground states two days ahead of Tuesday’s national election for a new White House term starting in January. Harris, the Democratic candidate, headed to Michigan in the upper Midwest, one of seven states where polling shows the contest is exceedingly close and the outcome uncertain. Political math shows that whichever candidate captures four or more of the seven battleground states is likely to become the country’s 47th president. Trump, the Republican candidate looking to become only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms, headed to three other battleground states, staging rallies in smaller cities where he hopes to run up big vote counts in rural areas to offset Harris’ expected large margins in Democratic-dominated cities. Trump started his day in Lititz, Pennsylvania, before heading to Kinston, North Carolina in the afternoon and ending with an evening rally in Macon, Georgia. It was the first day since last Tuesday that the two candidates had not campaigned in the same state. The focus on the battleground states is so pronounced that on Saturday, their planes shared a stretch of tarmac in Charlotte, North Carolina, where both candidates held rallies. Harris attended a Black church service in Detroit, the hub of the U.S. auto industry in Michigan, before heading to stops in Livernois and Pontiac and a rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing in the evening. More than 76 million people have already cast early ballots by mail or at polling stations, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, and early voting extends throughout much of the U.S. on Sunday and Monday. The total is nearly half the 158 million who voted through Election Day in 2020. Both Trump and Harris sought in the closing days of the campaign to portray the other as unfit to govern the country over the next four years. On his Truth Social media platform, Trump told voters, 'Every problem facing us can be solved—but now, the fate of our nation is in your hands. On Tuesday, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala that you’ve had enough, you can’t take anymore, 'Kamala Harris, You’re Fired!' At her rallies, Harris has sought to convince voters that she will cut the cost of living, which polling has shown to be the top concern across the country. She has also characterized Trump as dangerous and erratic and urged Americans to move on from Trump's chaotic approach to politics. 'We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that,' she said in Charlotte on Saturday. Trump has contended that Harris, as the sitting vice president for nearly four years, should be held accountable for rising consumer prices and the tens of thousands of migrants crossing the Mexican border into the United States for the past several years. He has portrayed the migrants as a consequential political threat to the country and their presence damaging financially to state and local governments throughout the U.S. 'The only free aid they are going to get is a free ride back home,' he said at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina on Saturday. Harris made a surprise cameo appearance on NBC’s comedy sketch show 'Saturday Night Live,' where she met up with actor Maya Rudolph, her doppelganger persona on the show. Rudolph told Harris at the end of the skit, 'I'm going to vote for us.' 'Great. Any chance you're registered in Pennsylvania?' Harris asked, reflecting on the importance of the large eastern state to the national outcome. 'Nope, I am not,' Rudolph said. 'Well, it was worth a shot,' Harris replied, before the two delivered the show's signature, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday night!' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung belittled Harris’ appearance on the show, saying, 'Kamala Harris has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity.' Trump hosted the show during his first run for the presidency in 2015. Last-minute polling shows the Harris-Trump race all but tied in the battleground states, within the margin of statistical error. ABC News polling shows Trump winning five of the seven battleground states, but The Washington Post says its aggregation of polls has Harris ahead in four. The New York Times says Trump is ahead in four, Harris two and the race tied in Pennsylvania. The importance of battleground states cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the seven remaining battleground states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops. Polling in the seven states is easily within the margins of statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSjXUzSm7OO-v	2024-11-03T16:25:49-08:00	
There’s No Market Process Independent Of Competition – OpEd	By Michael Njoku Many misconceptions about the nature of the free market system stem from an ignorance of who ultimately benefits from the market process. That the significant number of those who would benefit the most from the operations of the market—consumers—tend to also harbor much of the antagonisms against logically necessary features of the market highlights the unfortunate reality that the majority of people have yet to rightly understand how their best interests could be served by the mechanism of the market. Thus, it is not surprising that, in modern history, records abound of ambitious politicians, statesmen, and planners who have exploited this widespread ignorance in furthering utopian ends by means of eclectic and inherently contradictory policies which rational deliberation could easily expose as illusory. One of the widely criticized features of the market system is the concept of catallactic competition. Unsurprisingly, the notion of free competition within the market society is bound to attract the severest censures, given its incompatibility with the ideological pre-possessions of most people, such as compelled egalitarianism and 'social justice.' This article offers a defense of catallactic competition as an inherent feature of the social order of the division of labor and private ownership of the means of production. Through praxeological reasoning, this will illustrate the hidden effects of potential disruptions of the competitive order. Catallactic Competition vs. Darwinian Competition It is important to first make a clear distinction between competition as understood in the field of catallactics and competition as conceived in the Darwinian sense. Catallactic competition is an aspect of social cooperation, in which acting men consider outperforming fellow participants in serving consumers as a means toward the attainment of his own ends. It is not synonymous with the so-called 'law of the jungle,' or the Darwinian conception of biological struggle for survival. As such, use of combative terms or phrases as 'cut-throat,' 'conquest,' or 'crushing competitors' to describe the state of affairs in the field of catallactics are only misleading and, consequently, distract from serious deliberations on the subject matter. Put simply, catallactic competition precludes the initiation of force amongst market participants. A Series of Competition There cannot be a market independent of the process of competition. Viewing the market as a continuous process, rather than a state of equilibrium, in which there is no action, enables us to better grasp the fact that competition is always ongoing within distinct economic categories—entrepreneurs, capitalists, resource-owners, and consumers—as well as in their integrated functions. The market process is a series of competitive actions among various market participants acting to obtain scarce means which aid in the satisfaction of urgent wants. For instance, entrepreneurs—using economic calculation—embark on their buying factors. They compete based on the limit set by the anticipated prices of the marginal products. Because these resources are scarce and have alternative uses, they attempt to bid them away from other entrepreneurs who similarly evaluate and try to obtain these resources for alternative lines of production. Resource owners—through cooperating in the process—willingly offer up their resources for sale to the highest-bidding entrepreneur. Consumers are also not immune to market competition as the products which they most urgently want are simultaneously desired by other consumers in the market. Submarginal buyers become excluded from obtaining those commodities and they are directed toward more capable buyers. Thus, purchasing and bargaining power become the determining factors in competition of each consumer in the market. The Competitive Order and Monopoly It is often asserted that competition precludes monopoly. But the concept of monopoly is often undefined. Monopoly is a concept with several connotations. On the one hand, there is the connotation which implies absolute control of access to a vital resource, in which a single individual or group of individuals, through the use of force, exclude its employment by other users, whether in service of vested interests or according to arbitrary judgements. This would be the case in absolute dictatorship or a world-embracing socialist state, in which the Führer, production tzar, or some ruling bureaucracy dictates the circumstances of availability of these resources to other users. With regard to this connotation of monopoly, the above assertion can be said to be true. On the other hand, there is the connotation of monopoly which entails control of access to definite quantities of a vital resource of production as a result of original appropriation or voluntary exchange. This could occur through previous entrepreneurial alertness, foresight, and accurate anticipation of the future state of the market. This allegedly leads to subsequent charging of a 'monopoly price' for the resource in question. Before the emergence of the 'monopoly,' every other entrepreneur, in executing their buying function, was free to compete in the acquisition of the resource up to the maximum quantity obtainable for future production, however, they underestimated the potential significance of the resource in relation to future market conditions. It is important to note that this type of monopoly does not preclude free entry into the industry in question, nor does it preclude a market for potential substitutes to the monopoly good, thus, it is compatible with the competitive order. As Mises succinctly puts it in Human Action: 'It would be a serious blunder to deduce from the antithesis between monopoly price and competitive price that the monopoly price is the outgrowth of the absence of competition. There is always catallactic competition in the market.' Furthermore, any attempts to coerce the decisions of this 'monopolist'-entrepreneur into alternative actions, which—judged from his point of view—are dissatisfactory, become potentially disruptive of the competitive order. Disruption of the Competitive Order Given that the free market system is founded on the cooperation and voluntary interactions of individuals acting to satisfy their wants, it logically follows that any instance of coercive action by individuals or groups of individuals aimed at influencing the actions of other individuals become potentially disruptive of the competitive order which defines this system. The most systematic threat to the competitive order is the fallacious economic doctrine which has increasingly gained greater acceptance in virtually every country of the world today, and which has become the basis of policies which are disruptive of the mechanism of social cooperation—interventionism. Interventionism advances the notion of a compatibility between free market capitalism and violent interventions of the state in economic affairs. Interventionism is purportedly a middle-of-the-road economic system between capitalism and socialism, that is, a third economic system of economic organization. However, as Mises succinctly remarks in his book The Middle of the Road Leads to Socialism, Interventionism cannot be considered as an economic system destined to stay. It is a method for the transformation of capitalism into socialism by a series of successive steps. While disregarding the inescapable interdependence of economic phenomena, proponents of the doctrine of interventionism view the economy as a compartmentalized, loosely-coupled system in which specific actions can be tailored towards various 'compartments' of the economy in the hopes of obtaining desired outcomes. However, most policies advanced under interventionism almost always produce outcomes which, judged from the point of view of their initiators, are dissatisfactory. Most specifically, the policies directed towards the suppression of competition end up hurting the consumers whose needs would be better served in an unhampered market. Arguments against competition have been offered based on imperfections of competition that allegedly would cause more woes than if competition were suppressed. But, as Hayek puts it in the book, Individualism and Economic Order, ...the evils which experience has shown to be the regular consequence of a suppression of competition are on a different plane from those which the imperfections of competition may cause. For instance, the use of tariffs to suppress foreign competition in a domestic market usually end up raising the prices of locally-produced commodities, hurting the productivity of labor by shifting production from areas with favorable conditions to unfavorable areas, and encouraging cartelization and entrenched monopoly in the domestic market. The Ultimate Beneficiaries of Free Competition It is in the best interest of consumers—for whom every act of productive activity of the entrepreneur is directed—that the competitive order is preserved, for this would imply the possibility of better want satisfaction by accessing more attractive opportunities in the future. If consumers desire to satisfy various wants through the mechanism of the market, then they must realize that competition is an inherent feature of the market system and cannot be suppressed without hurting both their short- and long-term interests.

Kemi Badenoch And A New Era Of Leadership: Potential Opportunitie...	Kemi Badenoch’s rise to leadership within the Conservative Party signifies a crucial moment in British political dynamics, reflecting a movement towards enhanced diversity in representation while simultaneously reinforcing a steadfast dedication to conservative principles. The trajectory leading to Badenoch's current position, marked by a competitive leadership contest and significant backing from party members, underscores her growing popularity and the heightened expectations that accompany her responsibilities. Badenoch, as the inaugural Black leader of a significant political party in the UK, faces the imperative task of manoeuvrings through a complex terrain marked by ideological rifts, a difficult economic environment, and the necessity to re-establish connections with a voter base that is becoming ever more fragmented. Background and New Leadership Badenoch, born in Wimbledon on 2 January, 1980, has rapidly emerged as a prominent figure in the UK politics. Her political journey commenced with her election to the House of Commons in 2017, where she represented Saffron Walden, subsequently serving North West Essex from 2024. Badenoch swiftly attracted attention for her robust pro-Brexit position, symbolizing a profound alignment with a conception of the Conservative Party that emphasized sovereignty and British identity. Ascending within the political hierarchy during the tenures of Prime Ministers Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, she occupied significant positions, such as Secretary of State for International Trade and Minister for Women and Equalities. Her analytical approach to matters like identity politics and her resignation from Boris Johnson’s administration in opposition to his leadership style solidified her position as a politician willing to confront conventional standards within her party. The announcement of the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election took place on 5 July 2024, when the then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak articulated his decision to step down as leader of the Conservative Party in the wake of the party's loss in the General Election 2024. The leadership contest began on 24 July and reached its conclusion on 31 October, 2024. On 2 November, Kemi Badenoch emerged victorious in the members' ballot, marking a historic milestone as the first Black leader of any major UK political party. She is also the fourth female leader of the Conservative Party and the second consecutive leader of non-White descent within the party's history. Badenoch’s victory in the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election — a contest featuring prominent figures such as Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly, and Priti Patel — underscored her resonance with the party’s right-wing constituency. After a series of votes, she emerged as a leading candidate, securing victory in the final member’s ballot with a decisive margin over Jenrick, thereby garnering substantial grassroots support. This achievement has positioned her uniquely as the first Black woman to helm the Conservative Party, embodying a significant transformation within its ideological framework. Badenoch’s new leadership signifies a calculated shift towards fundamental conservative principles, with the objectives of rejuvenating the Conservative Party and reinstating public confidence. With a focus on fiscal prudence, minimal taxation, and restricted government involvement, she would likely to seek to address pressing economic challenges such as inflation and the rising cost of living. Her position on immigration and British identity highlights an emphasis on national sovereignty, demonstrating her dedication to maintaining a unique UK identity. Badenoch endeavors to challenge the prevailing trends of identity politics by advocating for a cohesive national culture rooted in meritocracy and traditional values, a stance that aligns closely with the sentiments of the party's grassroots constituents. Her vision encompasses the reinstatement of ethical standards within the government, aimed at restoring credibility and reconciling ideological divisions within the party. On the international stage, her objective is to utilize Brexit as a means to enhance the United Kingdom's position in global trade and economic affairs. Badenoch's leadership heralds a prospective transformation, characterized by a blend of traditional conservatism and a responsive approach to the prevailing political landscape. A Challenging Landscape for the New Leader The political and economic environment confronting Badenoch is characterized by complicated challenges. The 2024 general election marked a significant decline for the Conservative Party, as its representation in Parliament plummeted from 372 to 121 seats. This outcome underscores a profound public dissatisfaction with pressing issues, including inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, immigration, and the ethical standards upheld by the government. The prevailing public discontent regarding the party's management of critical issues, alongside a notable increase in support for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats, presents Badenoch with the formidable task of revitalizing the party's core constituency while simultaneously reaching out to a broader electorate. The United Kingdom is currently facing the challenge of lasting inflation, which remains elevated at approximately 6-7% as of late 2023, following a peak of 10.1% in 2022. The current inflationary landscape, exacerbated by elevated energy prices stemming from Eurasian geopolitical and geostrategic tensions/conflicts, have been placing significant pressure on household finances, thereby complicating the prevailing public sentiment. Badenoch’s leadership may be anticipated to respond to the pressing demands for tax relief, the stabilization of energy prices, and the strategic investment in sectors that promote sustainable growth. Her adherence to conservative principles — such as low taxes, free-market policies, and a reduction in state spending — may indeed find favor among her core supporters; however, it poses a significant risk of estranging those voters who prioritize immediate economic relief. Ideological Divide and Internal Dynamics The Conservative Party currently finds itself in a state of significant factionalism, characterized by deep ideological rifts that have been intensified by recent leadership transitions and public controversies. Badenoch’s triumph signifies a notable advancement for the party's populist, right-wing contingent, as evidenced by her opposition to what she describes as 'identity politics' and her contentious perspectives on matters such as maternity pay. The campaign strategically underscored a recommitment to foundational conservative tenets, resonating with party constituents eager to differentiate the party from centrist ideologies. However, this strategy prompts significant apprehensions regarding the party's overall attractiveness in a constituency that has progressively gravitated towards Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Her recent pronouncements in favor of a low-tax, limited-government paradigm, coupled with her criticisms of multiculturalism, indicate a distinct ideological shift that could potentially unify the party's core constituency. Nevertheless, this action carries the potential to estrange moderate leaders and voters who are in pursuit of stability and practical resolutions to the pressing economic and social issues at hand. Her focus on traditional values stands in stark contrast to the Labour Party's vision under Keir Starmer, who has adeptly solidified his support by clearly defining economic priorities. The dynamic interaction between these divergent ideologies is poised to significantly influence public discourse, as both factions strive to garner support in a precarious post-election environment. Vision for the Future and Party Reformation In her inaugural address as leader, Badenoch articulated her vision for reform, underscoring the imperative for the Conservative Party to 'reset our politics' and embrace a new beginning. She emphasized the imperative of restoring public confidence and reaffirming the party’s legitimacy following its recent electoral setback. Badenoch articulates a vision for the party that emphasizes a revival of foundational conservative principles, prioritizing fiscal responsibility, minimal state interference, and a strong stance on immigration policy. The emergence of her leadership may herald a transformative phase of reformation and critical self-examination within the Conservative Party, compelling it to reevaluate its policies and governance strategies in response to formidable challenges ahead. Badenoch, recognized for her forthright perspectives on social matters, may find that her position on cultural conservatism reinforces her backing from the party's right faction. Nonetheless, her efficacy as a leader will ultimately hinge on her capacity to reconcile these principles with the practical demands of a varied and evolving electorate. Conclusion The ascent of Kemi Badenoch to the leadership of the Conservative Party embodies a confluence of potential opportunities and significant impediments. Her rise represents a pivotal moment for the party, likely indicating a transition towards a more clearly articulated conservative agenda. Nevertheless, the challenges posed by economic volatility, the necessity for party unity, and the complexities of ideological fragmentation will require skilful manoeuvrings and strategic insight. As Badenoch readies herself for her inaugural significant engagements in the role of Leader of the Opposition, her capacity to connect with both her party's foundational supporters and the wider electorate will prove essential. The ability of her leadership to reconcile these divisions and restore the Conservative Party's standing in the political arena will significantly impact her legacy and the future course of British politics in the coming years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSinfqArvWKGx	2024-11-03T16:04:01-08:00	
Does The US Really Have Just ‘One President’ During Transitions? ...	America has one president at a time.' In these last few days before the US election, we are frequently reminded of this mantra regarding the transition of power. The Democrats are warning that, if former President Donald Trump wins, he will not abide by the rules and protocols of presidential transitions, just like the last time he was elected in 2016. One of the tenets of the transfer of power in the US is that the president-elect does not undermine the outgoing president by interfering in policymaking in the period before taking office. This is especially true of foreign policy. Past presidents have historically made sure that America has only had one president at a time. Bill Clinton, for example, stressed this point in 1992, when, after his election victory, he urged 'America’s friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one president at a time.' Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did it too, but in 2016 there was an outcry when the newly elected Trump made a few moves that were seen as violations of a tradition tested over time and enshrined in law. In particular, the Logan Act of 1799 forbids American citizens from unauthorized correspondence or negotiations with foreign governments that undermine the government’s position. This law, according to presidential historians, is to protect the powers of the president’s position under the Constitution, especially in dealing with foreign nations. In 2016, Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman introduced the 'One President at a Time Act,' to amend the Logan Act to 'ensure that US foreign policy is conducted only by the sitting president' and to make the law applicable to incoming presidents. Although this resolution did not go anywhere, it is understood that the Logan Act applies to elected presidents just as it applies to American citizens. Many invoked the Logan Act when criticizing President-elect Trump on two moves he made following the election in 2016. The first was his phone call in December 2016 with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen — the first by a US president or president-elect since 1979. The call angered China and raised concerns about whether America was still wedded to the One China policy. The second was his opposition to the Obama administration’s abstention on a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements. President-elect Trump interfered personally and unprecedently through phone calls he made, confirmed by his press secretary, to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which reportedly he spoke about the resolution. Trump was accused of violating one of the principles of American presidential politics. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, during the transitional period, a president-elect 'traditionally engages in limited outreach to foreign leaders.' The center adds that 'it is important for the president-elect and the staff to ensure the government is always speaking in one voice, particularly on matters of national security and foreign policy.' Presidential transition experts and Democrats say that President-elect Trump in 2016 took calls from the leaders of various countries without coordinating with the State Department, which is tasked with organizing these calls and prioritizing and sequencing them to reflect the importance of the countries to America. In 2016, many in Washington were furious when President-elect Trump spoke with Middle Eastern leaders before he spoke with the prime minister of the UK, Washington’s closest ally. Trump’s critics are worried that, this time around, he will not only do the same but he will double down on making foreign policy decisions and commitments without coordinating with the Biden administration, hence undermining it. They find evidence in Trump’s recent positions and statements. This month, the Republican candidate told his supporters that he had spoken with Netanyahu about the situation in the Middle East. News stories reported that he told Netanyahu, when asked for advice on how to respond to Iran’s missile attack on Israel, 'do what you have to do.' Slate magazine considered this, if accurate, 'not only an act of diplomatic recklessness but also, quite possibly, a federal crime.' It referred to the Logan Act. Moreover, in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump vowed to settle the Ukraine war 'before I even become president,' adding he would do it, 'if I win, when I’m president-elect.' Although Trump no doubt used this emphasis to indicate the urgency of the situation in his mind, his opponents saw it as another sign that he will flout the rules. Aaron Miller, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment, said Trump does not need to reach out to anybody, as everybody is instead reaching out to him, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nonetheless, he expressed concern that Trump 'will create expectations and make promises and commitments he is not empowered by law to make.' Miller sees Trump as the 'president norm-breaker,' adding 'it is not a question of the Logan Act or any other act, it is going to happen and there is nothing anyone except Trump can do to stop it.' But it seems Trump is not alone in terms of breaching the rules. Jeffrey Michaels and Andrew Payne, co-authors of 'One President at a Time? The President-elect and Foreign Policy in American History' argue that this tradition 'may by a constitutional reality but it is also a political fiction, more honored in the breach than in the observance.' Miller acknowledged that presidents-elect often interfere in foreign policy, but with the approval of the outgoing administration. He gave, as an example, his participation in the 1988 transition from Secretary of State George Shultz to James Baker, when 'we helped orchestrate a dialogue with the (Palestine Liberation Organization) during November-December that was consistent with the US national interest and with the policies of both administrations.' The divisions in the US over the election and Trump’s positions are extending to every aspect of presidential transitions and power. It is not realistic to expect the upcoming transition to be different if Trump wins. Washington is holding its breath and hoping we do not have a repeat of the 2021 transition. • Dr. Amal Mudallali is a visiting research scholar at Princeton University and former Lebanese ambassador to the UN.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSiM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-03T16:01:50-08:00	
Polarization, Public Sentiment, And Electoral Dynamics: 2024 US P...	I. Introduction The 2024 U.S. presidential election unfolds in an era of unprecedented polarization and heightened public sentiment, posing significant implications for the stability of American democracy. This election’s significance lies in its potential to either deepen ideological divides or catalyze efforts toward democratic cohesion. Polarization, defined by a marked increase in ideological, cultural, and socio-economic divides, has become pervasive within the American electorate, with empirical data illustrating sharp splits along key issues such as healthcare, immigration, and climate change (Pew Research Center, 2023). These divides are not limited to partisan lines but also extend to broader attitudes about democratic norms, including trust in governmental institutions and commitment to electoral integrity. Scholars such as Larry Diamond describe this polarization as 'a fundamental challenge to the integrity of democratic governance in the U.S.' (Diamond, 2022, p. 47), underscoring the stakes of this election for the future of political representation and institutional trust. Some counter that polarization is not a new phenomenon in U.S. politics, contending that historical tensions have been equally contentious (Abramowitz, 2022). However, recent evidence suggests that today’s polarization, coupled with declining trust in institutions, may uniquely threaten democratic resilience (Hetherington & Rudolph, 2015). The primary objectives of this study are to examine the intersection of polarization, public sentiment, and electoral dynamics, and to assess the impact of these factors on democratic governance. Specifically, this research will analyze how polarization influences public sentiment and how voter behavior in turn shapes candidate strategies and electoral outcomes. Additionally, the study seeks to understand the implications of these dynamics on the broader trajectory of American democracy. Recent findings indicate that heightened public sentiment, often fueled by partisan divides, significantly affects political participation, contributing to heightened voter turnout and stronger ideological alignment (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). For instance, high levels of public engagement during the 2016 and 2020 elections exemplify how polarized sentiments can mobilize voters, leading to historically high turnout rates and intense candidate loyalty (McKee, 2021). Guided by key questions, this study examines how polarization shapes voter behavior, how public sentiment influences candidate strategies and media framing, and how the 2024 election may impact American democracy’s future. We hypothesize that high polarization correlates with increased emotional engagement, thereby intensifying both voter turnout and allegiance to ideologically extreme candidates. This hypothesis finds support in literature suggesting that 'negative partisanship'—the opposition to an opposing party rather than support for one’s own—motivates a significant portion of voter behavior (Abramowitz & Webster, 2016). Additionally, we anticipate that media framing may amplify polarized sentiment by fostering 'echo chambers' where voters consume ideologically aligned content, thus influencing campaign strategies and further entrenching political divides (Sunstein, 2017). Finally, the study considers the democratic implications of these dynamics, noting that sustained polarization without institutional redress risks eroding public trust, ultimately threatening democratic cohesion and stability (Levendusky, 2009; McCoy, Rahman & Somer, 2018). By situating the 2024 U.S. election within the context of these political dynamics, this analysis seeks to contribute a nuanced understanding of the election’s implications for American democracy. Through empirical evidence, scholarly insights, and theoretical perspectives, this study critically assesses the interplay of polarization, sentiment, and electoral dynamics, aiming to illuminate pathways that may either mitigate or exacerbate democratic tensions. II. Background and Political Landscape The political landscape leading into the 2024 U.S. presidential election is marked by two major candidates: Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Each represents distinct political platforms that reflect deeper ideological divides in the American electorate. Vice President Harris’s platform centers on progressive policies aimed at expanding healthcare, addressing climate change, and advancing social equity (The White House, 2024). Her vision emphasizes inclusive governance, promising a renewed commitment to civil rights and climate resilience. In contrast, former President Trump’s platform is founded on conservative principles, prioritizing economic deregulation, immigration control, and strengthening American sovereignty (Republican National Committee, 2024). Trump advocates for a return to 'America First' policies, positioning himself as a defender of traditional values and a counterbalance to perceived progressive overreach. This clash of visions is emblematic of the polarized climate characterizing the 2024 race, with each candidate rallying their base around highly distinct ideals that have intensified partisan divides. Historically, polarization has been escalating in American politics, particularly over the past two decades, with notable shifts observed in recent elections (Pew Research Center, 2022). Studies indicate that ideological and partisan divides have increased, evidenced by a growing mistrust between party affiliates and a decline in bipartisan cooperation (Abramowitz, 2022). The 2016 and 2020 elections marked critical points in this trend, as identity-based politics and negative partisanship—where voters are motivated more by opposition to the other party than support for their own—dominated campaign strategies and media narratives (Abramowitz & Webster, 2016). Furthermore, research highlights that such polarization is not limited to political elites but extends to the general public, affecting social dynamics and community relations (Mason, 2018). The trajectory of these trends suggests that the 2024 election is likely to be influenced heavily by deep-rooted partisanship, setting the stage for a potentially contentious political environment. In response to this polarized climate, both campaigns have adopted increasingly targeted and sophisticated electoral strategies. The Harris campaign, for instance, leverages social media and data analytics to reach specific voter demographics, particularly younger and minority groups, focusing on issues such as climate action and social justice that resonate with these populations (Democratic National Committee, 2024). By contrast, Trump’s campaign has employed narrative framing that appeals to his base’s concerns over economic security and cultural values, using platforms like Truth Social and rallies to fortify his message (Republican National Committee, 2024). The use of targeted advertisements and 'echo chambers' within partisan media channels also highlights the role of modern campaign strategies in intensifying voter sentiments and reaffirming ideological divides (Sunstein, 2017). This evolution in campaign tactics underscores how modern electoral strategies are both a product and a driver of the current polarized political environment, further entrenching divisions within the electorate. This background reveals not only the stark ideological divide but also how campaign dynamics have evolved within a politically charged atmosphere. The candidates’ platforms and strategic approaches highlight the extent to which partisan identities have become a central factor in American politics, as each campaign seeks to galvanize its base in ways that reflect and intensify prevailing societal divides. The implications of this evolution for American democracy are profound, as it challenges the prospects for achieving national unity or cross-partisan cooperation. III. Key Factors Influencing the Election The 2024 U.S. presidential election is significantly influenced by a range of factors, most notably economic conditions, swing state dynamics, and the pervasive impact of polarization and misinformation. Firstly, the economic landscape plays a critical role in shaping voter sentiment and behavior. As inflation rates have surged to levels not seen in decades, reaching 8.2% in 2022, public dissatisfaction with the current administration's handling of the economy is palpable (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). This dissatisfaction is reflected in polling data, which indicates that economic concerns have consistently ranked as the top issue for voters, surpassing concerns over social issues and foreign policy (Gallup, 2023). Furthermore, employment rates, while improving, have not kept pace with inflation, leading to heightened anxiety among voters about their financial futures (Smith, 2023). This economic backdrop creates a challenging environment for the incumbent, as historical trends show that poor economic performance typically correlates with unfavorable election outcomes for the ruling party (Cohen & Zeitz, 2022). Additionally, the dynamics of swing states play a pivotal role in determining electoral outcomes. States like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona have emerged as critical battlegrounds due to their diverse demographics and fluctuating political allegiances (Pew Research Center, 2023). The 2020 election demonstrated that these states can shift the balance of power in the Electoral College, underscoring their strategic importance (Smith, 2020). With the electoral college system remaining a central feature of U.S. elections, candidates are likely to focus disproportionately on these swing states to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This focus may result in tailored campaign strategies that address the unique concerns and preferences of voters in these regions, further emphasizing the importance of understanding local demographics and issues. Moreover, the current election cycle is marked by increased polarization and the spread of misinformation, which have significant implications for voter perceptions and trust in the electoral process. The rise of partisan media and social media platforms has created echo chambers, where voters are exposed primarily to information that reinforces their preexisting beliefs (Sunstein, 2017). This polarization not only affects voter behavior but also contributes to a decline in trust in electoral integrity, as many voters express skepticism about the legitimacy of the electoral process (Pew Research Center, 2022). Misinformation campaigns, particularly those targeting specific demographics, exacerbate these issues, leading to confusion and apathy among voters (Fridkin et al., 2023). The interplay of these factors highlights a troubling trend in American democracy, where voter engagement and trust may be significantly undermined by external influences and internal divisions. In conclusion, the interplay of economic conditions, swing state dynamics, and the roles of polarization and misinformation will be crucial in shaping the electoral landscape for the 2024 presidential election. Understanding these factors is essential for analyzing how they may impact voter behavior and the overall democratic process in the United States. IV. Theoretical Frameworks and Predictive Models Understanding the theoretical frameworks and predictive models is essential for analyzing the dynamics of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as they provide insights into voter behavior and electoral outcomes. One prominent predictive framework is Lichtman’s '13 Keys' model, which evaluates the likelihood of a party maintaining the presidency based on thirteen true/false statements about the incumbent party’s performance (Lichtman, 2020). This model posits that if six or more keys are false, the incumbent party is likely to lose, emphasizing the importance of historical patterns in forecasting electoral success. In contrast, Silver’s data-driven model employs advanced statistical methods to analyze polling data and electoral trends, offering a more dynamic and real-time perspective on voter sentiment (Silver, 2023). By comparing these methodologies, it becomes evident that while Lichtman’s model relies on historical precedent, Silver’s approach adapts to the shifting political landscape, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of electoral dynamics. Additionally, theoretical interpretations of voter behavior shed light on the motivations behind electoral choices. Rational choice theory suggests that voters make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the perceived benefits of a candidate's policies against the potential costs (Downs, 1957). This framework can explain why economic conditions significantly influence voter sentiment, as individuals may prioritize candidates promising economic stability and growth. Moreover, cultural backlash theory offers insights into the increasing polarization observed in recent elections, suggesting that voters may react against perceived threats to their cultural values, thereby favoring candidates who resonate with their identity (Inglehart & Norris, 2016). Economic voting theory further elucidates how voters’ evaluations of their financial situation impact their electoral choices, supporting the notion that economic performance is a critical determinant of electoral success (Lewis-Beck & Paldam, 2000). Cultural and social dynamics also play a vital role in shaping voter demographics and their alignment with candidates. Factors such as race, gender, and education level influence voting behavior, with certain demographic groups gravitating toward candidates who address their specific concerns and aspirations (Pew Research Center, 2023). For instance, the increasing prominence of issues related to social justice and climate change among younger voters indicates a shift in priorities that candidates must acknowledge to mobilize this demographic effectively. Furthermore, the intersection of these cultural factors with the candidates’ platforms may create complex electoral alignments, as seen in previous elections where candidates who authentically engaged with these issues gained substantial support from previously disengaged voter bases (Tucker et al., 2022). In summary, the integration of various forecasting models and theoretical frameworks is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. By examining Lichtman’s and Silver’s models alongside voter behavior theories and cultural dynamics, we gain valuable insights into the electoral landscape and the factors that will influence voter choices in the upcoming election. V. Potential Election Scenarios and Outcomes The 2024 U.S. presidential election presents distinct pathways to victory for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, each requiring strategic approaches to secure the necessary electoral votes. For Harris, the key to success may lie in mobilizing a broad coalition that emphasizes issues resonant with younger, urban, and minority voters, while also addressing the concerns of working-class citizens who feel overlooked by mainstream politics (Pew Research Center, 2023). Targeting swing states, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have significant urban populations and labor interests, could be crucial for Harris in solidifying her electoral base. In contrast, Trump’s route to victory likely hinges on maintaining strong support among rural voters and the white working-class demographic, which played a pivotal role in his previous election (Rosenfeld & Riffkin, 2023). By reinforcing his messaging on economic recovery and national security, Trump aims to galvanize these groups while also appealing to disaffected voters in battleground regions. The impact of key demographics and regional variations is paramount in understanding the dynamics of the election. For instance, working-class voters, particularly in the Midwest, have shown fluctuating loyalty, influenced by economic conditions and perceptions of candidates' authenticity (Pew Research Center, 2023). Urban populations tend to lean Democratic, driven by progressive values and diversity, while rural areas exhibit stronger support for conservative candidates, highlighting the geographic polarization in American politics. Additionally, factors such as race and gender will significantly shape voting patterns, with women and minority voters increasingly mobilized around issues of social justice and equity, potentially swaying the election in favor of Harris if she effectively addresses these concerns (Smith, 2024). Predicted electoral outcomes based on current trends indicate a highly competitive race. Polling data suggests a narrow margin between the candidates, reflecting heightened voter engagement and turnout, particularly among younger voters and those in suburban areas (Gallup, 2024). If current trends continue, with Harris capitalizing on demographic shifts and urban support, she could secure a substantial electoral vote count. However, Trump's stronghold on rural America and his ability to maintain loyalty among his base could present significant challenges for Harris, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the electoral landscape. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on each candidate's capacity to adapt their strategies to engage key voter blocs and respond to the evolving political climate. VI. Implications for American Democracy The implications of the 2024 U.S. presidential election for American democracy are multifaceted, particularly concerning the impact on democratic institutions and norms. Should Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump emerge victorious, the election results will likely shape public trust in governance and the resilience of democratic frameworks. For instance, Harris's administration may prioritize restoring faith in institutions by emphasizing transparency and accountability, essential for reinforcing democratic norms (Smith & Jones, 2024). Conversely, if Trump wins, there is a risk of exacerbating distrust in governmental institutions, particularly among those who perceive the electoral process as biased or flawed, which could further polarize the electorate (National Democratic Institute, 2024). The risks associated with electoral misinformation and challenges are critical to consider in this context. Misinformation campaigns, which have proliferated in recent elections, can undermine public confidence in electoral integrity, fostering skepticism toward legitimate processes (Pew Research Center, 2023). Legal challenges are also anticipated, as candidates may contest the election results, which could lead to prolonged disputes and further erode trust in the democratic system (Bennett & Sutherland, 2024). Such scenarios present significant risks for governance and societal cohesion, as public perceptions of legitimacy and fairness hang in the balance. Broader consequences for political polarization and civic engagement are also expected to emerge from the election outcomes. The increasing polarization evident in the current political landscape poses challenges for civic participation and national unity (Fisher & Smith, 2024). If the election intensifies partisan divides, it could lead to decreased voter turnout and disengagement among moderate voices, who may feel alienated by extreme rhetoric (Gallup, 2024). This potential decline in civic engagement highlights the urgent need for initiatives promoting dialogue and collaboration across party lines, fostering a healthier democratic culture that encourages participation from all segments of society. VII. Conclusion In conclusion, the analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential election has highlighted several key findings related to polarization, voter sentiment, and electoral dynamics. It is evident that the current political landscape is marked by significant polarization, which not only influences voter preferences but also shapes the overall electoral process. Voter sentiment is deeply intertwined with economic conditions, social issues, and the pervasive impact of misinformation, leading to varying levels of engagement and trust among different demographic groups. This election serves as a crucial juncture for American democracy, reflecting broader societal divisions and the urgent need for collective discourse. As we reflect on the stakes of the 2024 election, it becomes clear that its outcomes will have profound implications for the future of American democracy. The elected leadership will either reinforce or challenge the existing democratic norms and institutions, influencing public trust and civic engagement. The potential for heightened polarization and discontent underscores the importance of fostering a more inclusive and informed electorate. To strengthen democratic processes in this challenging environment, several recommendations emerge. First, addressing polarization requires fostering open dialogue and encouraging cross-partisan collaboration to bridge divides within the electorate. Second, improving voter education initiatives is essential, ensuring that citizens have access to accurate information about candidates, policies, and the electoral process. Lastly, enhancing the integrity of democratic institutions through transparent practices and robust safeguards against misinformation will be critical in restoring public trust and promoting a resilient democracy. By implementing these strategies, we can work towards a more unified and participatory political landscape that upholds the values of American democracy. References Abramowitz, A. I., & Webster, S.

Strengthening Ties: President Prabowo’s Strategic Visit To The UK...	In November 2024, President Prabowo's visit to the United Kingdom signifies a significant advancement in the Indonesia-UK relationship. This visit underscores the renewed commitment of both nations to their advanced partnership across strategic sectors and strengthens bilateral ties amid shifting global dynamics. Prabowo's agenda includes enhancing collaboration in defence, trade, education, technology, and sustainability. By prioritizing these high-impact areas, he aims to generate long-term economic and security benefits for Indonesia while fostering shared prosperity. This thesis posits the potential for a mutually beneficial relationship, wherein targeted collaboration yields broader regional influence and strategic stability. Given that both countries are influential actors in the Indo-Pacific and European theatres, respectively, a strengthened Indonesia-UK relationship would facilitate coordinated responses to regional challenges, bolster economic resilience, and enhance global security frameworks. President Prabowo's discussions regarding defence collaboration are central to his objectives, particularly as Indonesia seeks to modernize its military capabilities in response to increasing geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The United Kingdom's advanced defence technology and expertise render it an ideal partner for Prabowo's aspirations to enhance Indonesia's national defence infrastructure. Both countries stand to gain from joint training programs, military exchanges, and intelligence-sharing agreements, which would improve interoperability and strategic response capabilities. In addition to these cooperative efforts, the acquisition of British defence technologies would bolster Indonesia’s maritime security and counter-terrorism initiatives, particularly within its contested maritime regions. A strategic defence agreement that encompasses technology transfers, acquisition deals, and expanded military dialogues would signify a deeper commitment to security collaboration. This defence-oriented cooperation aligns with broader UK interests in promoting stability and security in the Indo-Pacific region, thereby contributing to a balanced security environment that addresses regional threats. Trade and economic partnerships between Indonesia and the United Kingdom offer significant transformative potential for both economies. As Indonesia seeks to diversify its export markets and attract foreign investment, the United Kingdom is well-positioned to provide essential access to global markets. A primary focus for Prabowo should be the reduction of trade barriers that impede Indonesian exports, such as palm oil and textiles, while concurrently encouraging British investment in infrastructure, digital technology, and renewable energy within Indonesia. Such a partnership could entail the establishment of frameworks that facilitate joint ventures and promote investment agreements designed to incentivize participation in sustainable and high-growth sectors. Strengthened trade relations would lay a foundation for economic resilience, diversify Indonesia's revenue streams, and enable the United Kingdom to secure a more robust foothold in the rapidly expanding markets of Southeast Asia. Moreover, education represents a critical avenue for collaboration as Indonesia endeavours to enhance its human capital and cultivate a knowledge-based economy. British institutions, known for their high educational standards, could play a pivotal role in advancing Indonesian education through student exchange programs, joint research initiatives, and institutional partnerships. By encouraging British universities to partner with or establish campuses in Indonesia, Prabowo would enhance the skills and competitiveness of the Indonesian workforce. Areas of focus may include vital fields such as artificial intelligence, engineering, and environmental science, enabling Indonesia to address its technological and environmental challenges while simultaneously building expertise in these growing industries. Furthermore, partnerships in technology and innovation underscore the compatibility of Indonesian and UK priorities, as both nations aim to establish themselves as leaders in the digital and cybersecurity landscapes. With the United Kingdom’s advanced technology sector and Indonesia’s burgeoning digital economy, collaborative initiatives in technology development could foster innovation across various domains, including smart cities, artificial intelligence, financial technology, and cybersecurity. The establishment of collaborative research hubs and digital laboratories would yield mutual benefits by combining UK expertise with Indonesia’s expanding technological ecosystem, thereby creating pathways for innovation that benefit both nations. Environmental sustainability and climate change represent domains in which Indonesia and the United Kingdom can identify mutual interests. Both nations confront significant environmental challenges and are committed to attaining global carbon reduction targets. Collaborative initiatives in renewable energy—specifically focusing on solar, wind, and geothermal resources—could enhance sustainable energy utilization and support each country's decarbonization objectives. Indonesia’s resource-abundant landscape positions it advantageously to emerge as a leader in renewable energy, while UK expertise offers a robust foundation for sustainable development. Furthermore, joint efforts in conservation and sustainable tourism in ecologically sensitive areas could bolster biodiversity protection, thereby reinforcing the environmental goals upheld by both nations. Additionally, people-to-people and cultural exchanges would strengthen diplomatic relations, promoting mutual understanding and cultural respect. This foundation is essential for establishing a sustainable bilateral relationship that transcends mere economic or strategic interests. Programs aimed at promoting cultural, artistic, and educational exchanges would enhance interpersonal connections, creating a shared cultural base upon which broader diplomatic initiatives can be constructed. In conclusion, President Prabowo’s visit presents a pivotal opportunity to advance the Indonesia-UK relationship by addressing shared priorities such as economic resilience, defence stability, educational cooperation, and environmental sustainability. The establishment of regular high-level dialogues focused on Indo-Pacific stability would reinforce the strategic significance of this partnership. An Indonesia-UK alliance that encompasses multiple sectors will not only generate economic and strategic benefits for both nations but also serve as a model for inter-regional cooperation in addressing global challenges. By fostering strong foundations in defence, trade, education, technology, and sustainability, Prabowo's visit could enhance bilateral ties contributing to shared security and prosperity on a global scale.

From Dollar Monopoly To BRICS Diversification – OpEd	The pressure toward the diversification of world currency reserves intensified after 2008, escalated following 2022 and is accelerating, as evidenced by the recent BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. In the past 15 years or so, BRICS have rapidly grown into a geoeconomic front of the Global South. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates attended their first summit as member states in Kazan. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join BRICS. Together, the BRICS members encompass nearly a third of the world's land surface and almost half of world population. In September, Turkey officially applied to join the bloc. Numerous countries have expressed interest in joining the BRICS or have already applied membership in Africa (18 countries), East and Southeast Asia (11), Americas (7), Middle East and Central Asia (8), and Europe (4); that is almost 50 nations. Risks of US dollar Much of world trade remains invoiced and settled in U.S. dollars; many banks based outside the United States nonetheless offer dollar-denominated deposits; many non-U.S. corporations borrow in dollars; central banks hold a large share of their reserves in dollar assets; and so on. The assumption is that, a bit like diamond, US dollar is forever. In reality, no dominant reserve currency has had an indefinite life-span. It is precisely the increasing weaponization of the coercive monopoly of the US dollar – the world’s disproportionate dependency on US dollar in trade invoicing and settlement, and the dollar reliance by non-US corporate and financial giants, and dollar’s high share in central banks’ reserves – that increasingly worries not just the Global South, but an increasing number of major economies in the West. The skeptics say that the dollar has been buried many times before. Why should it die this time? But who says it would have to die. The more, the merrier. Most BRICS economies still rely significantly on the US dollar, whereas those that have been sanctioned by the US and/or its allies have significantly reduced their dollar reserves, often opting for gold instead. Weaponization of US dollar When the dollar is weaponized by the US foreign policy in the name of international community but without the broad support of international consensus, it puts trade invoicing and settlement, foreign corporates, financials and central bank reserves at risk. Worse, the weaponization of US dollar and its complicity facilitates the ongoing genocidal atrocities in the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s actions rely on US arms and financing, while turning the rest of the world – even countries that are vehemently protesting such 'wars' of obliteration – into co-conspirators of sorts. The writing is on the wall. Since the creation of the BRICS in July 2009, the value of gold has surged tripling from $953 to almost $2,740 per ounce. It parallels the failure of global recovery and the rise of trade wars since 2017/2018 and the consequent wars and crises. Dollar erosion In historical view, global currency diversification is far from a new idea. John Maynard Keynes sought even more making the case for a supra-national currency bancor (lit. French banque, 'bank gold') in Bretton Woods in 1944. But the idea was torpedoed by the U.S. negotiators, who wanted to replace the UK pound with the dollar as the world’s major reserve currency. Keynes cautioned that the dollar primacy would result in great uncertainty and volatility following the reconstruction and recovery of Western Europe and other major economies. That’s what ensued in 1971, when President Nixon ended unilaterally the convertibility of the dollar to gold. As gold no longer offered a yardstick for value, the perception of value replaced value itself. The consequent price shock reverberated across the world. With the twin oil crises, it was followed by the quadrupling of oil prices, then runaway inflation and stagflation, and eventually record-high US interest rates and massive rearmament drives. In geopolitics, the U.S. leans on major Western economies and Japan, but international economy is a different story. As a net consequence, the dollar monopoly contributed to asset bubbles in the 1980s, early ‘90s, early 2000s and finally in 2008. Amid the Great Recession, China’s central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan revived the idea and urged major Western economies to 'reform the international monetary system.' Then, great pledges were made in Brussels, Washington and Tokyo, but nothing much happened. Obviously, the economic architects of the US administrations seek to promote the advantages of the US dollar at the expense of viable alternatives. That’s very much in their economic and geopolitical interest. Similarly, the British, too, touted the blessings of their sterling pound until 1914. But that primacy ended with the overstretch of the UK economy after 1945. Unfortunately, the United States is in the same trajectory, thanks to record-high debt taking, particularly by the Trump and Biden administrations. Advantages of diversification How are the BRICS contributing to diversification? Thanks to their organizational flexibility, the bloc makes possible unilateral, bilateral and multilateral measures. Analytically, these range from gradual reforms to more unilateral individual measures. The latter, in turn, are driven by the original BRICS founder economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the new aspiring members and the coalition partners who share the basic BRICS vision and are considering membership as well. Hence, the efforts at complementary development institutions and critical infrastructure, including the BRICS New Development Bank (NBD), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Bridge and Road Initiative (BRICS), and the quest for new currency arrangements. The rising number of populous and large emerging economies make possible the kind of 'network effects' and 'positive spillovers' that will be critical to launch the new critical infrastructure for the proposed alternative global financial system. The goal is not to eliminate the dollar, as the BRICS critics claim particularly in the West. In reality, the BRICS have little to do with rogue states seeking to subvert international order. Rather, like asset managers who seek to maintain appropriate diversification in their portfolios, the BRICS’ objective is diversify and recalibrate rather than simple de-dollarization. Global currency arrangements must not reflect just the interests of Americans who account for 4.2 percent of the world population. They must also reflect the aspirations of the multipolar world economy in which global growth prospects are driven by the large emerging economies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSs44Vzs33wq8	2024-11-03T15:55:43-08:00	
What Is China’s United Front And How Does It Operate? – Analysis	By Paul Eckert Evidence is mounting of clandestine Chinese influence operations in the heart of America. Just in the last few months, a former aide to the governor of New York state and her husband were arrested for alleged illicit activities promoting the interests of China; a Chinese democracy activist was arrested and accused of spying for China; and a historian was convicted of being an agent for Beijing. The three separate cases of former Albany functionary Linda Sun, dissident Yuanjun Tang and author Wang Shujun took place in New York alone. And they were not the first cases of alleged Chinese influence operations targeting immigrants from China in the Big Apple. Those cases came to light as a detailed investigation by the Washington Postrevealed that China’s diplomats and pro-Beijing diaspora were behind demonstrations in San Francisco that attacked opponents during President Xi Jinping’s visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit last November. All bear the hallmarks of China’s 'united front' influence operations conducted by government ministries, party operatives and local proxies – but in a veiled manner. 'United front work is a unique blend of influence and interference activities, as well as intelligence operations that the CCP uses to shape its political environment,' said the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in a report published last November. What is the United Front Work Department? Coordinating this overseas influence and interference work is Beijing’s shadowy United Front Work Department, or UFWD, set up in 1942, even before the Communists took over control of China. Headed by Shi Taifeng, a Politburo member, it seeks to promote China’s political interests through an extensive network of organizations and individuals around the world, experts say. It spares no effort trying to push Beijing’s view – and crush dissenting opinions – among people in Taiwan and Hong Kong, ethnic minorities such as Mongolians, Tibetans and Uyghurs as well as among religious groups. How does the UFWD operate? The United Front Work Department is engaged in a mixture of activities, from interfering in the Chinese diaspora and suppressing dissidents to gathering intelligence, encouraging investment in China and facilitating the transfer of technology, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, said in a report. It uses quasi-official organizations and civil society groups based overseas to blur the line between official and private, giving China plausible deniability in many cases, witnesses told the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which advises Congress on China. It funds Confucius Institutes – Chinese-language study centers on university campuses around the world – many of which have been shut down in the United States. It also funds diplomats’ engagement with foreign elites and its police force’s perpetration of 'transnational repression' – clamping down on dissidents or opponents outside China’s borders, the review commission said in a 2023 report based on expert testimony. United front groups often have innocuous sounding names, like the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification or the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. Many appear to be ordinary overseas Chinese community organizations, and are found in business and even in multinational corporations. Lurking behind or within them, though, are government or party agencies – very often China’s powerful intelligence, security and secret police agency. 'United front groups are used – very specifically – to hide the Ministry of State Security,' said Peter Mattis, head of the non-profit Jamestown Foundation. 'This is why I like to think of the United Front Work Department as the tall grass that is sort of deliberately cultivated to hide snakes,' he told RFA. What is the history of China‘s ’united front’ work? Under the Moscow-led Comintern in the 1920s, the Chinese Communist Party adapted Soviet revolutionary Vladimir Lenin’s concept of forming a 'united front' – forging temporary alliances with friends and lesser enemies in order to defeat greater enemies. After Mao Zedong’s Communists took power in 1949, united front work focused internally on co-opting Chinese capitalists and intellectuals, who were brought to heel and persecuted in the 1950s under Mao’s vicious ideological campaigns. Xi Zhongxun, the father of current President Xi Jinping, played a key united front work role with top Tibetan Buddhist figures, trying to influence the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. What role has Xi played? While China denies meddling in the affairs of foreign nations, experts say that under President Xi, China’s overseas influence activities have become more aggressive and technologically sophisticated. In 2017, Xi famously repeated Mao’s description of united front work as a 'magic weapon' for the party’s success. But two years before that, he established a 'leading small group' to coordinate top-level united front work and carried out a major expansion and reorganization of the UFWD. 'We will build a broad united front to forge great unity and solidarity, and we will encourage all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation to dedicate themselves to realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation,' Xi told the 20th Party Congress in 2022. That congress saw Xi’s top ideological theorist, Wang Huning, who ranks fourth in the Politburo, appointed to lead the national-level united front system, the House Select Committee report said. Xi has built up the power and capacity of the UFWD, which controls 11 subordinate government agencies, including the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Administration for Religious Affairs, according to Australia’s ASPI. What are some examples of the UFWD’s efforts in the U.S.? In New York, prosecutors say that Linda Sun and her husband, Christopher Hu, received millions of dollars in cash, event tickets and gourmet salted duck from the UFWD. In exchange, Sun tried to remove references to Taiwan in state communications, and obtained unauthorized letters from the governor’s office to help Chinese officials travel, prosecutors say. In California during Xi’s visit in November, the Washington Post reported, the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles paid for supporters’ hotels and meals and directly interacted with aggressive actors who punched and kicked anti-Xi protesters and attacked them with flagpoles and chemical spray. U.S. stopovers by Taiwan leaders have drawn similar protests. Who are the targets of united front work? Sun and Hu represent a key demographic in the UFWD’s crosshairs: the Chinese diaspora. The activist Tang had access to the overseas Chinese dissident and pro-democracy community and its network of supporters. United front pressure and harassment tactics – including threats against family in China – are deployed against diaspora members of China’s persecuted ethnic and religious minorities: Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and members of the banned Falun Gong movement. Citizens of Taiwan have for decades been pressured by united front efforts to support unification with the Communist-controlled mainland. The recent imposition of draconian national security legislation in Hong Kong has made citizens and exiles who oppose those authoritarian steps in formerly free Chinese territory targets of united front pressure. These targets are not alone and the list is growing, with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand also grappling with Chinese influence campaigns that smack of united front work. 'There’s no clear distinction between domestic and overseas united front work: all bureaus of the UFWD and all areas of united front work involve overseas activities,' the report from Australia’s ASPI said. 'This is because the key distinction underlying the United Front is not between domestic and overseas groups, but between the CCP and everyone else,' it said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington told Radio Free Asia that the United Front’s domestic role is to 'promote cooperation between the (Communist Party) and people who are not members of it.' Outreach to the diaspora 'helps give full play to their role as a bridge linking China with the rest of the world,' the embassy spokesperson’s office said in an e-mailed statement. 'Its work is transparent, above-board and beyond reproach,' it said. 'By making an issue out of China’s United Front work, some people are trying to discredit China’s political system and disrupt normal exchange and cooperation between China and the United States.'

Moldova: Pro-West Sandu Declares Victory In Tight Presidential Ru...	(RFE/RL) -- Pro-Europe incumbent Moldovan President Maia Sandu has declared victory over Russia-friendly challenger Alexandr Stoianoglo, in balloting marred by accusations of of Russian interference and voter fraud. With 98 percent of ballots counted in the November 3 election, the Central Election Commission said Sandu had 54.35 percent of the vote to Stoianoglo’s 45.65 percent, a lead of more than 140,000 votes. 'Moldova, you are victorious!' a jubilant Sandu, who was boosted by votes in the capital, Chisinau, and from diaspora votes, said shortly after midnight. 'Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova! In our choice for a dignified future, no one lost,' she added. Stoianoglo, who has not conceded, had held the early lead, but it continued to narrow as votes were being counted from the large cities, where Sandu has most support. In addition, votes from the diaspora West could favor Sandu as they are reported. The Central Election Commission reported that turnout surpassed 54 percent, stronger than in the first round and also higher than in the 2020 presidential runoff. Sandu won the first round on October 20 with 42 percent of the vote compared to 26 percent for Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor-general who received backing from the pro-Russia Socialist Party of Moldova. In comments to reporters after casting her ballot at a Chisinau polling station, Sandu said she voted 'with Moldova.' 'Thieves want to buy our vote, they want to buy our country, but the power of the people is infinitely greater than any of their malice,' she said. 'The power of Moldova is in each of you, go out to vote with faith and hope. Heads up, Moldovans!' Following the close of most polling stations, Stoianoglo said the large turnout proved that 'Moldova is not just a point on the map with simple spectators, but a country of responsible people.' The vote came amid accusations of Russian meddling in both the presidential race and a referendum on Moldova’s potential further integration with the European Union -- a direction Sandu and her supporters strongly support. The pro-EU side scored a razor-thin victory in the referendum -- the 'yes' vote getting 50.38 percent – but Sandu quickly alleged that 'criminal groups together with foreign forces' tried to 'buy 300,000 votes,' making the final result significantly closer than pre-vote polls had indicated. Surveys also indicated that Sandu would take an easy victory in the first round of the presidential election, but Socialist challenger Stoianoglo surprised with a better-than-expected total, forcing the runoff vote. Sandu's national security adviser posted a statement to X, claiming 'massive interference' by Russia in the runoff vote. 'An effort with high potential to distort the outcome,' Stanislav Secrieru said in his post. He gave no details. Moldova has 3.02 million registered voters, including those in the diaspora. Voters in the West were credited with helping the 'yes' side eke out the narrow victory in the EU referendum and helped Sandu in the runoff election. According to the CEC, foreign voting went to Sandu by a large margin, with the incumbent winning 81 percent to 19 percent over the challenger. Votes in Chisinau also went to Sandu by a 57-43 percent margin. While the position of president is technically a ceremonial position in Moldova, holders of the office often wield considerable political influence. A president may serve for two consecutive four-year terms. Scattered irregularities were reported during the early voting hours on November 3, including incidents of purported photographing of ballots -- which voters in the past have used to prove their choice in potential vote-buying cases. Angelica Caraman, head of the election commission, said that as of 4 p.m., 18 cases of alleged electoral corruption had been officially reported, while police authorities said they had registered at least 126 complaints of electoral violations. Police authorities said in a statement that outside the country, voters were being transported in large groups to two polling stations in Moscow as well as polling stations in the Belarusian capital, Minsk; Baku, Azerbaijan; and Istanbul, Turkey, including by airplane. Moldovan voters in those countries are known to typically support pro-Russian groups. Election authorities called on citizens to report any attempts to transport voters to polling stations in an organized manner. Similar violations were flagged by independent observers from Promo-Lex, a democracy watchdog. There were also reports of apparently fake bomb threats called into polling stations in Moldova and in several countries, including in Britain, Germany, and Romania. Elsewhere outside the country, polling stations for Moldovans in Japan and China were among the first to close. In Tokyo, officials reported Sandu winning by 58-7, while in Beijing, Sandu had 59 votes out of 73 cast. Sandu, 52, is a Harvard graduate and former employee at the World Bank. She became Moldova's first female president with a landslide victory in 2020, running on a strong pro-EU message and vows to fight corruption. But her support may have slipped during her first term amid an economy that was ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic and rising tensions with Russia. As president, Sandu was instrumental in securing Moldova's candidacy for future EU membership, an achievement given extra urgency following Russia's full-scale invasion of bordering Ukraine a few months earlier. Throughout her presidency, Sandu has been criticized by pro-Kremlin political parties who have accused her of stoking conflict with Moscow. Stoianoglo, 57, from Gagauzia -- an autonomous region of Moldova with pro-Russia sentiment -- was Moldova's prosecutor-general between 2019 and 2021. He campaigned on a law-and-order theme, although critics have slammed him for what they say was a failure to address high-level corruption during his time in office. Stoianoglo has claimed he holds no political affiliation and has rejected accusations that he is 'Moscow's man.' His reaction to the war in Ukraine has been ambiguous -- expressing a 'negative attitude' toward the conflict but not directly condemning Russia for the invasion. Although he has often taken anti-EU stances, he is also a Romanian -- and thus EU -- citizen, and his daughter reportedly works at the European Central Bank. After media reports revealed that he possessed a Romanian passport, he argued that he obtained it in 2019 in an 'apolitical context,' without elaborating. Most of Moldova was part of Romania until the end of World War II and many Moldovans also hold Romanian citizenship, which gives them the opportunity to travel freely to the EU and work there. Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries with a sizeable Russian minority and a Moscow-backed separatist region, Transdniester, located on the left bank of the Dniester River.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbShEIIBtQNfNv	2024-11-03T15:48:48-08:00	
Russia-Africa Expo 2024: Evaluating Results And Achievements – In...	After the first and second summits held in Sochi and St. Petersburg, strengthening economic cooperation and deepening Russian-African business relations have taken the central stage which is especially important in the context of global geopolitical changes. Africa is a huge and rapidly developing market that can become a strategic partner for Russia, says Louis Gouend, founder of Hello Africa and founding Executive Director of the African Business Club. In this interview taken by Kester Kenn Klomegah late October, after the first international B2B business forum 'Russia-Africa Expo 2024' Made in Africa, Louis Gouend offered some useful insights into the dynamics why Russia and Africa ultimately have to forge an engagement in business and economic sectors, to expand cooperation in both regions, and further highlighted the existing challenges facing the evolving entrepreneurial initiatives in Russia and Africa. Here are the interview excerpts. Estimate the achievements and results of the historic first Russia-Africa B2B forum 2024 organized under the auspices of RusAfro Club and African Discussion Club (ABC) at the Friendship University (RUDN)? The first international B2B business forum 'Russia-Africa Expo 2024' Made in Africa was a great success, demonstrating wide interest from both Russian and African participants. The forum brought together more than 500 participants representing 15 African diplomatic missions, more than 20 African countries, about 50 business representatives from Africa and more than 150 Russian companies, business associations and investment agencies. These figures show a high degree of involvement and willingness to cooperate. The plenary session allowed Russian and African entrepreneurs to share knowledge about the specifics of the business environment in Africa and Russia, to identify the most promising sectors for investment and trade. This contributes to a better understanding between partners and facilitates the search for mutually beneficial projects. It is especially worth noting the preparation for signing several contracts for the supply of products from Africa to Russia, which is direct evidence of the success of the forum and its real business effectiveness. It is planned to make the forum an annual event and expand its program, which is a good sign for the continuation and deepening of Russian-African business relations. At the exhibition accompanying the forum, participants could get acquainted with African agricultural, cosmetic, souvenir products and tourism opportunities, which also contributed to the strengthening of cultural and business ties. Have the speakers and participating guests critically identified existing challenges, roadblocks and other factors hindering expected levels of bilateral relations in trade and economic cooperation between Russia and Africa? Discussion of challenges and obstacles to bilateral relations: During the forum, key challenges facing Russian-African business relations were identified. One of these challenges is logistics and transportation of goods, which was mentioned in his speech by the chairman of the subcommittee on logistics and supply chains Andrey Severilov. He emphasized the need to optimize the existing infrastructure, which will help make the transportation of goods more efficient and less expensive. Another obstacle is the financial instruments necessary for trade with African countries. Marina Nesterenko presented current financial instruments that can facilitate interaction between entrepreneurs on both sides. Significant points were also identified from the African side. For example, Ngo Towada Marie Caroline from Cameroon spoke about the potential of MADE IN AFRICA products for the Russian market. Such presentations help to identify and initiate discussions on the obstacles facing bilateral trade. After that admirable forum held mid-October 2024, what policy measures would you suggest or recommend, as an experienced expert, to authorities in the Russian Federation? Recommendations for the Russian authorities: 1. Specialized trade zones and investments: The establishment of specialized trade zones for African partners in Russia can significantly simplify logistics and speed up customs clearance processes. It may also be useful to create programs that support joint investment projects in strategically important sectors such as agriculture, logistics and creative industries. 2. Educational programs and consulting support: The development of educational programs aimed at raising awareness among Russian businessmen about the specifics of working in African markets will help to avoid many mistakes and speed up the process of entering new markets. A good example is specialized courses and seminars conducted with the participation of experts from both sides. 3. Diplomatic efforts: Intensifying diplomatic efforts to create a favorable investment climate and provide legal guarantees for Russian and African entrepreneurs will be an important step towards strengthening bilateral relations. The development of bilateral agreements on investment protection and prevention of double taxation will help increase trust and investment. Would these support Russia's relations with Africa, especially during this time of multifaceted collaboration with Asia and Africa as an integral part of Global South? Development of Russia's relations with Africa: Strengthening trade and economic ties with Africa will help diversify Russia's foreign economic partners, which is especially important in the context of global geopolitical changes. Africa is a huge and rapidly developing market that can become a strategic partner for Russia. Africa, as part of the Global South, offers Russia unique opportunities to intensify its foreign economic policy. Given the growth of consumption and economic development in African countries, trade between Russia and Africa has the potential to increase significantly. The Russia-Africa Expo 2024 Forum was an important step in this direction, demonstrating a high level of mutual interest and readiness for further cooperation. The B2B meetings held on the sidelines of the forum allowed for direct contacts between entrepreneurs, which is the basis for further successful cooperation. It is especially valuable that the event found a positive response among the participants, which indicates the need and demand for such platforms for dialogue and cooperation. It is important to continue to develop and deepen these relationships, turning the forum into an annual event.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSj-JSHNZ8ptM	2024-11-03T15:40:31-08:00	
UN Experts Say Houthis Collaborated With Al-Qaeda To Weaken Yemen...	By Saeed Al-Batati Yemen’s Houthi militia has armed Al-Qaeda militants, provided them with a haven, and facilitated attacks on Yemeni government-controlled areas, UN experts said. The Houthis have also made millions of dollars through sea piracy. Disclosing the strange partnership between the Houthis and Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, including Al-Shabaab in Somalia, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen said in their report that the Houthis and Al-Qaeda agreed to put aside their differences and focus on weakening the Yemeni government by transferring weapons, coordinating attacks on Yemeni government forces, cooperating to smuggle weapons into Yemen, sharing intelligence information, and providing haven for the other’s fighters. 'That opportunistic alliance is characterized by cooperation in security and intelligence, offering safe havens for each other’s members, reinforcing their respective strongholds and coordinating efforts to target the Government’s forces,' the report said, adding that the Houthis also released incarcerated Al-Qaeda fighters convicted of terrorism and provided Al-Qaeda with drones and rockets. 'Since the beginning of 2024, the two groups have coordinated operations directly. They agreed that the Houthis would transfer four uncrewed aerial vehicles, as well as thermal rockets and explosive devices, and that the Houthis would provide training to AQAP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) fighters.' Citing deadly drone attacks by Al-Qaeda in Abyan, Yemeni military commanders have lately accused the Houthis of supplying Al-Qaeda with drones and other weapons, as well as sheltering Al-Qaeda militants who stage hit-and-run attacks on government troops. The 537-page report, which covers the period from Sept. 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024, described Hezbollah as 'one of the most important' supporters of the Houthis in Yemen, assisting them in decision-making, field military support through the use and assembly of weapons and fighting techniques, increasing their financial revenues, recruitment and brainwashing techniques, and managing Houthi media propaganda. The Houthis have a variety of revenue sources to support their military efforts, including selling rare and valuable antiques and antiquities abroad, minting coins and printing currencies, imposing levies on telecom companies in areas under their control, confiscating assets of companies, including Yemenia airways revenues, smuggling weapons and banned pesticides, and imposing levies on oil imports to the country. 'The Houthis have been amassing substantial illegal resources through the organized smuggling of various items such as weapons, drugs, telecommunications equipment, prohibited goods such as banned pesticides, non-permissible medicines, and cultural heritage property,' the report said. It added: 'The Panel's investigations revealed that Houthi-appointed authorities collected approximately 994 billion Yemeni rials in the name of customs duties on imports of fuel through ports under their control during the period from April 1, 2022, to June 30, 2024, under the exchange rate prevailing in government-controlled areas.' However, during the Houthi campaign against ships that the Yemeni militia claimed were in support of the Palestinian people, the Houthis have collected approximately $180 million a month from ships to allow them to sail in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden without being attacked, and a high-ranking Houthi leader facilitated the transfer of the money from the shipping agencies to the militia’s coffers. 'The sources estimate the Houthis’ earnings from these illegal safe-transit fees to be about $180 million per month. The Panel has not been able to verify this information independently.' The UN experts also accused the Houthis of recruiting and exploiting Ethiopian migrants — who arrive in the country by the thousands each year — to fight alongside them against the Yemeni government while also facilitating drug trafficking. The Yemeni government, as well as local and international rights groups, have previously said that the Houthis recruited thousands of African migrants to fight the Yemeni government. 'Other sources informed the Panel that the Houthis have also recruited mercenaries from the Tigray and Oromo Ethiopian tribes, at salaries ranging from $80 to $100. The Panel has been unable to verify that information and continues to investigate,' the experts said. The Yemeni government welcomed the findings of the UN report and urged the world to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization and cut off their financial resources. Yemen’s Information Minister Moammar Al-Eryani said in a post on X that the collusion between the Houthis and other terrorist organizations is intended to 'weaken the Yemeni state, destabilizing security and stability in liberated areas,' thereby undermining maritime navigation security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSl62ZFRs2unL	2024-11-03T15:37:24-08:00	
IRGC Deputy Chief Says Iran Planning Retaliatory Operation Agains...	Iran will certainly carry out a retaliatory military operation against the Israeli regime, a deputy commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said. Asked whether an ‘Operation True Promise III’ against the Zionist regime is on the agenda, Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi told reporters at the Sharif University of Tehran on Sunday that the operation will definitely be carried out. 'It is not possible to comment on its details,' the general stated. On October 1, Iran responded to the Israeli assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan by launching as many as 200 ballistic missiles toward the Zionist regime’s military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories. In the early hours of October 26, the Zionist regime attacked a number of military sites in Iran, which resulted in the martyrdom of four servicemen and a civilian. In remarks on October 27, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei emphasized the necessity of disrupting the flawed calculations of the Israeli regime regarding Iran. 'They’re making a miscalculation with respect to Iran… our officials should be the ones to assess and precisely apprehend what needs to be done and do whatever is in the best interests of this country and nation. They (the enemy) must be made to realize who the Iranian people are and what the Iranian youth are like,' the Leader added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSiBMFh7WUnkK	2024-11-03T15:34:43-08:00	
China Restricts Young Tibetan Monks In ‘Prison-Like’ Schools	(UCA News) -- Tibetans have accused the pro-Beijing authorities in the region of housing hundreds of young Tibetan Buddhist monks in prison-like conditions at government-run boarding schools, says a report. The students forcibly transferred from the Kirti Monastery schools in Sichuan province’s Ngaba county are not even permitted to leave the school grounds or meet their parents, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Oct. 31. 'Since being forcibly removed from the monastery, the students have been denied contact with their parents and receive inadequate medical care when ill,' RFA reported, citing an unnamed source. 'When parents request to meet their children, they are given various excuses about needing higher-level approval and ultimately face threats of imprisonment if they persist,' the unnamed source added. The students between the ages of 6-17 are taught exclusively in Mandarin, RFA reported. Some of the students who attempted to escape the school were apprehended and are now being treated 'like criminals' and forbidden from leaving the school grounds. Over 1,000 young Tibetan monks were transferred from the Kirti Monastery to state-administered 'colonial style' boarding schools in July. The authorities closed another school at Lhamo Kirti Monastery in Dzoge county, affecting some 600 students.x The authorities had compelled parents to sign agreements ensuring that their children would be enrolled in government-run schools, where they would undergo state-approved 'patriotic education.' Pro-Beijing authorities in Tibet cite China’s regulations on religious affairs which mandate that the students at monastic schools must be 18 or older, display patriotism, and be compliant with national laws. Tibetan critics of China’s communist-led government allege that these regulations are part of a broader policy to eradicate the use of the Tibetan language, suppress Tibetan culture, and enforce 'patriotic education.' China’s patriotic education policy mandates that the love of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party be incorporated into work and study for all citizens. The Chinese authorities in the region have also intensified surveillance and restrictions on Tibetans in Ngaba county following the school closures. A high-ranking official from China’s United Front Work Department is permanently stationed in Ngaba for several months, overseeing control measures over both the monastery and the local community. The authorities have also unleashed a crackdown on any form of communication with the outside world, RFA reported. In October, the authorities in Dzoge seized the phones of monks and teachers of Lhamo Kirti Monastery, accusing them of sharing the news of school closures. In September, the authorities arrested four Tibetans, including two monks from Kirti Monastery, as well as two laypersons in Ngaba, accusing them of contacting Tibetans outside the region. The Chinese government has claimed that the communication between Tibetans and their family members and friends abroad undermines national unity as a reason for communication restrictions, RFA reported. Tibetans have denounced Beijing’s surveillance, accusing the authorities of violating their human rights and trying to eradicate their religious, linguistic, and cultural identity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSucLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-03T15:32:12-08:00	
Boosting Immune Cell Tolerance May Help Prevent Early Pregnancy L...	Recurrent pregnancy loss can be devastating and exert a major impact on women, their partners, and society more broadly, but currently there are few options for effective therapies. Over several years, there has been mounting evidence that a deficiency in special immune cells called T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which are essential for preparing the uterus for receptive embryo implantation, are a factor in early pregnancy loss. A new study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, details evidence in a pre-clinical animal model that boosting these cells improves the chance of healthy pregnancy. The work raises the prospect of evaluating this intervention in women who are prone to experience early pregnancy loss, a common condition affecting natural conception and women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Lead investigator Sarah A. Robertson, PhD, The Robinson Research Institute and School of Biomedicine, the University of Adelaide, Australia, explains, 'Previous studies have found low numbers of Treg cells in women who experienced early pregnancy loss as well as changes that lead Treg cells to have functional problems that are reminiscent of autoimmune diseases. This can impair the implantation process and suppress development of the early placenta. Therefore, Treg cells provide an attractive target for interventions to improve maternal immune tolerance and protect against pregnancy disorders caused by immune imbalance in at-risk women.' The researchers utilized a mouse model of early pregnancy loss to test a new candidate treatment intervention in which the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is combined with specific antibodies to target Treg cells. Like humans with recurrent pregnancy loss, the mice have an immune defect that arises at conception and results in later fetal loss. The researchers administered the IL-2 antibody complex (called IL-2/JES6-1) in the time between conception and embryo implantation to the miscarriage-prone mice and also in mice that have had healthy pregnancies. They observed significant changes to the number and phenotype of the Treg cells in the uterus, blood, and other tissues in both groups of mice. The expanded pool of Treg cells exhibited features that are characteristic of robust pregnancy tolerance and were effective in preventing generation of detrimental effector T cells that threaten pregnancy success. Importantly, the miscarriage-prone mice showed markedly improved pregnancy outcomes after treatment, and their miscarriage rate was consistently reduced from 30% to 11%, which is within the normal range for mice. Professor Robertson adds, 'The results show that efficacy of the IL-2/JES6-1 treatment might be achieved with lower doses, which will likely be important as we consider how to translate the findings to human application. Another notable observation was that treatment in very early pregnancy, even before the embryos commence implantation, has a profound effect on the progression of the pregnancy with lasting benefit into late gestation. This is consistent with growing evidence pointing to embryo implantation and early placental development being the turning point for pregnancy success.' The study demonstrates the potential of targeting Treg cells and provides pivotal evidence to justify human studies; however, it will be important to undertake clinical trials to assemble evidence of safety and benefit in humans before the treatment can be recommended.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSjMAmASR8tUb	2024-11-03T15:27:44-08:00	
The Changing Climate Could Increase Mobility Of Toxic Metals In S...	The changes scientists expect in the climate could cause the toxic metals naturally occurring in soils to become more mobile, destabilize ecosystems and increasingly enter the human food chain via agriculture. Such scenarios are particularly likely to occur in slightly acidic soils, which make up around two thirds of all soils. These are the conclusion of an experimental study on agricultural soils tested for the metal cadmium, which can cause cancer. The study was headed by assistant professor Marie Muehe from Plant Biogeochemistry at the University of Tübingen and the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ). The results have been published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment. By 2100, global temperatures are predicted to rise by two to four degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. In that time, the current carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is expected to double. Here in Germany, the amount of precipitation could decrease slightly. Marie Muehe says the further effects are hard to predict: 'Climate change and metals each separately place stress on the microorganisms in the soil, collectively referred to as the soil microbiome. We sought to investigate the previously little-known combined effects of these influences,' she says. There are toxic metals in every soil on our planet, says Muehe, but in bound form they are of little significance for soil organisms and plant cultivation. The situation changes when the metals are mobilized. 'In our study, we examined cadmium, the classic example of a toxic metal found in the soil,' she says. Cadmium has a toxic effect on all living organisms because it inhibits physiological processes in the cells. Complex interactions In the experiment, the research team filled columns with agricultural soil provided by various farms. 'We ran these soils through a regular growing season in Germany in the laboratory, but under the assumed climate conditions of the year 2100,' explains the study's lead author Sören Drabesch, also from the University of Tübingen and the UFZ. 'We investigated the changes in the soil and soil microbiome over time.' The research team found that the mobility of the cadmium present in the soil will increase on today’s conditions by around 40 percent in slightly acidic soils in the summer temperatures of future climate conditions. 'It can then be found in higher concentrations in the pore water of the soil and influences the soil microbiome, or the activity pattern of various microorganisms,' says Drabesch. 'Certain microorganisms become more active, utilize more nitrogen and thus further acidify the soil environment.' In some soils, cadmium levels are set to rise to such an extent that the soil microbiome suffers and the ecosystem has to adapt. By contrast, no comparable problems were found in soils that were originally slightly alkaline. Even under changed climatic conditions, the cadmium was not mobilized to any great extent. The study shows how complex the interactions are between the changing climate, the substances in the soil and the soil microbiome, says Muehe. 'Ecosystems, including agricultural ecosystems, could be massively disturbed by increased amounts of mobile cadmium in the future. This could also change the greenhouse gas emissions caused by agriculture and the mobile cadmium could end up in crops which could then be harmful to human health.' These developments must continue to be monitored, the researchers say.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSi4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-11-03T15:23:09-08:00	
Pakistan’s Youth: Opportunities, Challenges, And The Digital Volc...	Pakistan is at a crunch moment in its history, when decisions made today will shape the country's course for future generations. With 170 million young people aged 18 to 30, the country has an extraordinary demographic advantage. This youth bulge, if properly utilised, has the potential to convert Pakistan into a financial superpower. However, the opposite side of this demographic dividend is as scary. There are 25 million youngsters out of school, 60 million on TikTok, and 70 million on Facebook. These figures reflect a technologically savvy youth that lacks access to formal education, crucial skills, and organised direction. With 230 million phones in circulation, Pakistan's youth are firmly entrenched in the digital world, absorbing information. This uncontrolled arena poses significant concerns, including the dissemination of disinformation, digital radicalisation, and societal instability. The question is, what is the government doing to solve this issue? More significantly, how can Pakistan leverage this complicated dilemma into an opportunity? Demographic Dividend or Demographic Disaster? A predominantly young population is both a benefit and a challenge. If educated and employed, this demographic may drive economic growth and social improvement. However, without access to decent education, technical skills, and jobs, these young people may become disillusioned, destitute, and vulnerable to radicalisation. History demonstrates that jobless youth in many nations have led to societal discontent and bloodshed. Pakistan is in danger of suffering the same destiny unless it takes strong action to invest in education, skill development, and digital literacy. According to UNESCO's 2022 study, Pakistan's youth literacy rate is only 72.7%, indicating a need for immediate development if the country is to properly harness its youth bulge. The government must enhance educational opportunities and vocational training programs to guarantee that young people are prepared not only for traditional employment but also for the emerging digital economy. A systematic focus on education, critical thinking, and creativity is required to prepare this generation to prosper in a rapidly changing environment. The Role of Education and Critical Thinking Education is the cornerstone of any thriving nation. However, education in Pakistan must go beyond memorisation and rote learning. It must emphasise critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that will equip young brains to face complicated issues. These skills are necessary not just for personal growth, but also for country prosperity. In the twenty-first century, where technology and global integration are transforming the world at an unprecedented rate, only well-rounded, critical thinkers will prosper. Furthermore, critical thinking is becoming increasingly necessary in the digital age, in which young people are continuously assaulted with information from several sources. Youth are susceptible to manipulation due to their inability to distinguish between legitimate and false information. The proliferation of fake news, conspiracy theories, and extremist ideologies on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube can have serious social and political implications. As a result, educational reforms must incorporate digital literacy and media analysis into curricula, teaching students how to fact-check material, identify credible sources, and assess content objectively. Innovation should also be a top priority, encouraging young Pakistanis to think imaginatively and build their answers to economic, environmental, and security concerns. Security Challenges and Cyber Threats The value of an educated, critical-thinking young population goes beyond economic growth; it is also crucial for national security. Pakistan's importance in fighting terrorism and supporting regional stability has long been acknowledged. However, the nature of security threats is changing, as cyberattacks, misinformation operations, and digital warfare provide new concerns. In 2023, Pakistan had a 17% rise in cyber-attacks over the previous year. In such a scenario, it is critical that the youth—who are profoundly connected to the digital world—be prepared to repel cyber threats and actively participate in public diplomacy to combat disinformation. Educated young may play an important role in national security by inventing new technologies, combating fake news, and defending the country from digital threats. What Should the Government Do? The government cannot afford to remain complacent about these difficulties. To turn Pakistan's youth bulge into a productive force, a comprehensive national approach is required. This includes: Expanding Educational Access: Pakistan must prioritise education investment by expanding the number of schools, enhancing teacher quality, and enrolling out-of-school children. Promoting Digital Literacy: To safeguard young people from the dangers of misinformation, the education system must include media literacy and critical thinking skills. The government might undertake awareness efforts to teach kids how to spot false news and check information sources. Vocational Training and Entrepreneurship: With few job possibilities in the formal sector, the emphasis must move to skill development and entrepreneurship. Government-backed initiatives can provide young people with the resources they need to start small companies, lowering unemployment. Regulating Social Media Platforms: While free expression is crucial, unchecked digital platforms may cause social and political instability. The government must implement balanced laws to control material on social media platforms, ensuring are not used to disseminate hatred, ignorance, or extremist beliefs. Engaging Youth in National Policy-Making: Giving young people a say in national policy decisions may instil a feeling of duty and belonging. Platforms for youngsters to express their concerns and ideas can also assist close the gap between government policy and public expectations. Conclusion Pakistan's youth population has a unique opportunity to shape the future. However, failing to engage in education, skill development, and media literacy risks turning this potential into a burden. With millions of young people using digital platforms, the government must take quick action to lead, control, and educate this generation before the digital volcano bursts. To give young people the resources they need to succeed, the government, educational institutions, civic society, and the commercial sector must work together. If properly exploited, Pakistan's young have the potential to drive economic growth, social advancement, and national stability. However, if allowed uncontrolled, illiterate and misguided young threaten the country's future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcsH4rcofTnjbntg0J9u_75	2024-11-03T15:01:31-08:00	
Countering The Russia–North Korea Alliance Requires A Policy Shif...	By Yeji Chung On 13 October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that North Korea was transferring people to the armed forces in Russia. A few days later, Ukrainian intelligence announced that the first North Korean military units had arrived in the war zone in Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Intelligence estimates suggest North Korea has sent over three million artillery shells to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from 2022–24. Moscow has dispatched high-level officials to Pyongyang to tour weapons factories and assets. Anti-tank systems, rifles, rocket launchers and other assets are likely part of what are now regular container shipments from North Korea to Russia. The countries have reforged bilateral ties on the back of these transactions, marked by a new security pact signed by North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in June 2024. The treaty features a Cold War-era military intervention provision that raises the stakes for security in the Korean peninsula and beyond. But this new pact does not present particularly novel threats for the United States and its allies. Many provisions in the newly signed ‘Treaty on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ reflect activities between the two countries that have been going on for years. This highlights the inadequate and ineffective intervention by the international community, which permitted this dangerous friendship to flourish. The part of the Treaty that has received the most attention is Article 4, which stipulates that both nations must ‘immediately provide military and other assistance by all means available’ if either faces an armed attack or goes to war. North Korea has been supporting Russia since it first attacked Ukraine, first diplomatically at the United Nations and soon after with artillery shells and missiles. Illicit arms transfers that contravene international sanctions were recorded as early as 2022 and included artillery shells and rockets from North Korea. The recent agreement between North Korea and Russia appears to do little more than reinforce the status quo. The alliance has already been built up, with few obstacles and little interference from the United States and its allies, who appear confined to rely on sanctions and financial penalties with increasingly little impact. But obstacles remain for the US–South Korea alliance and effective deterrence. Chief among them is that North Korean issues have not been a primary concern for US President Joe Biden’s administration, and international interest appears to have waned. The 2024 G7 summit in Italy focused on development, Ukraine and the Middle East, but not North Korea, as it has in past years. This inattention gives North Korea and Russia an even freer hand to strengthen their bilateral ties with little scrutiny or pressure. South Korea, for its part, is increasingly questioning the reliability of US security commitments. 76.6 per cent of South Koreans expressed the belief that the country should develop its own nuclear weapons. Former US president Donald Trump, who may return to the White House in November 2024, regularly criticised South Korea as a free rider unworthy of an alliance and engaged in extortionary tactics to try and convince Seoul to pay billions to keep US military bases open. A new administration, led by US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, would continue existing deterrence dialogues, such as the Nuclear Consultation Group and the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group, further strengthening the alliance. But doubts about inaction on Pyongyang will likely persist, even if Harris takes office. During her acceptance speech as the Democratic Party nominee for the US presidential election, Harris said she will not ‘cozy up’ to Kim, reflecting a probable continuity of the Biden administration’s North Korea policy. It is increasingly clear that North Korea’s nuclear program is so advanced that the focus should shift to preventing its use rather than revisiting denuclearisation discussions, but Washington seems unwilling to entertain this prospect. The United States needs to move off its demand of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, and instead focus on ‘[disrupting] the arms tradebetween Russia and North Korea’. To accomplish this, South Korea and the United States have to strengthen alliance coordination on arms trade intelligence between Russia and North Korea. The United States reported that Russia has secured more than 16,500 containers of munitions from North Korea since September 2023, while South Korea cited a lower figure of 13,000 since mid-2022. This discrepancy in container counts points to a lack of seamless intelligence-sharing and monitoring, despite the two allies’ earlier commitment to strengthen security cooperation to counter North Korea. Washington’s strict focus on the irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea highlights a broader issue of misaligned priorities and insufficient coordination. Without this policy shift, the US–South Korea alliance risks another four years of ineffective pressure on Pyongyang as it escalates its nuclear ambitions and forges greater ties with other US adversaries. Sooner or later the United States and South Korea will need to consider concessions to reengage North Korea in negotiations. Seoul must also prepare to adapt its policies and work with new US leadership after the presidential election.

Iraqi Kurdistan’s Parliamentary Elections: Resilience, Challenges...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The Kurdistan Region of Iraq finally held its long-overdue parliamentary elections on October 20, two years past the original due date. Final results announced by the Iraqi electoral commission on October 30 showed that the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) won 39 and 23 seats, respectively, out of the 100-member parliament. A relatively nascent opposition group, the New Generation Movement, won 15 seats, coming third. Islamist groups secured 10 seats, making up 10 percent of the newly elected parliament, in contrast to the Iraqi federal Parliament that is dominated by various Islamist forces. Despite the absence of significant political changes, the elections hold important implications for the Kurdistan Region’s future and broader US policy in the region. Continuity and Renewed Legitimacy The first significant takeaway from the election results is the continued dominance of the KDP and PUK, which have shaped Kurdish politics for over five decades. This duopoly, though frequently criticized for fostering corruption and nepotism, remains largely unshaken due to its entrenched patronage networks and the deep sentimental ties many Kurds have to the parties, rooted in their historical struggle for Kurdish rights. These election results suggest that these two parties will remain central players in Kurdistan’s political landscape for the foreseeable future. Second, despite these enduring dynamics, the elections mark a crucial moment of renewal for the Kurdistan Region’s executive and legislative branches which have been in a lame-duck status for the past couple of years. The Iraqi Federal Supreme Court dissolved the Kurdish Parliament in May 2023, after it exceeded its four-year term. Despite not being a sovereign state, the Kurdistan Region has been an important actor within Iraq and its surrounding region, largely due to the de facto independence it has enjoyed since the end of the First Gulf War in 1991. Moreover, Iraq’s Kurds have played a pivotal role in shaping the country’s political and security dynamics, both before and after the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. If managed effectively, this renewed popular legitimacy could strengthen Kurdistan’s hand in negotiations with Baghdad over revenue-sharing, oil exports, and confronting the threats posed by pro-Iranian factions within Iraq. Third, despite some heated and at times inflammatory rhetoric—particularly from the PUK—the election process unfolded in a mostly peaceful, civic, and well-organized manner. Although the political playing field was uneven, and some smaller opposition groups alleged vote-rigging without presenting concrete evidence, the elections were, by most accounts, largely fair and transparent, setting a new standard for Kurdish elections since 1992. This was further confirmed by congratulatory statements from US and EU diplomatic missions in Iraq, which commended the success of the electoral process. Fourth, these elections took place against a backdrop of increasing regional turbulence and the looming threat of escalation, possibly even all-out war, between Israel and the Iran-led camp. While Iraq officially remains neutral, powerful Iran-backed Shia militias, which wield significant influence over Iraq’s security and political sectors, have been active belligerents on Iran’s side, frequently striking Israeli and US targets since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza. The fact that the Kurdistan Region held elections amid such volatility signals a strong desire for normalcy and stability among Iraqi Kurds, as well as a clear declaration of their intent to remain distanced from escalating regional hostilities. US Policy and the Need for Strategic Engagement Now that the elections are over, the focus shifts to the formation of the new cabinet of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which presents both challenges and opportunities for US engagement. The United States, which has long enjoyed a strong relationship with Kurds, should play a hands-on role in facilitating dialogue between Kurdish parties to ensure a timely and effective government-formation process. Kurdistan’s ability to form a stable government is critical not only for its own governance, but also for broader US strategic interests in Iraq and the Middle East. Some policymakers in Washington might be tempted to see Kurdistan’s internal politics as a secondary concern, particularly in light of the more pressing regional crisis between Israel and Iran. However, the United States should recognize the strategic value of assisting Kurds. This moment in Iraqi Kurdistan should be understood within the broader historical context of US-Kurdish relations and the mutual benefits that have emerged and can continue to grow from this partnership. Although the Kurdistan Region is a non-sovereign, non-state entity, it has maintained a unique relationship with the United States since the 1990s—one that, in some ways, parallels the US-Taiwan relationship, albeit at a smaller scale and with less formal commitment. Since the end of the First Gulf War, Washington has served as the guarantor of Kurdish security in Iraq. In return, Kurds played a crucial role in the removal of Saddam Hussein, were instrumental in the post-2003 political process, and helped develop Iraq’s political and security system. However, since the unsuccessful 2017 Kurdish independence referendum and in the face of sustained attacks by Iran and its Iraqi proxies, there has been growing concern in Kurdistan that the United States is not as committed to the relationship as it once was. This has created space for increased interference from Iran and Turkey, often to Kurdistan’s detriment. By assisting with the government-formation process in Erbil, the United States would signal its renewed commitment to the partnership with Kurds at this juncture and strengthen the autonomous region’s stability without any cost in terms of US resources or lives. From a broader regional perspective, Washington must consider the significant role Iran and its allied groups have played in undermining KRG autonomy in recent years. As Tehran has expanded its political and military influence across Iraqi Kurdistan—especially areas under KDP control—it remains the only region resisting Iranian domination. Notably, these KDP-controlled areas also host two of the four key sites for US military presence in Iraq. Iran and its proxies, through a combination of lawfare, economic/financial pressures, and political maneuvers, have systematically attempted to erode the KRG’s economic foundation and exert control over its internal political dynamics. This interference is perhaps most visible in the Federal Supreme Court’s politicized rulings that targeted Kurdistan’s energy and financial sectors. Additionally, the Court’s redesign of the KRG electoral law have further deepened Kurdistan’s internal tensions, making it difficult for any single party to secure a majority and exacerbating instability. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that while US military presence in Iraq faces growing hostility in many regions, Kurdistan remains a steadfast ally. The United States and Iraq have agreed to withdraw most American forces by 2026, yet Kurdistan’s Harir airfield is expected to remain a key base for US troops beyond that deadline. The strategic importance of Kurdistan becomes even more apparent when considering its role in the US-led campaign to counter the Islamic State, better known as ISIS. For the past couple of decades, Iraqi Kurdistan has played a vital role in countering Sunni jihadism across Iraq and the broader region. It also serves as a crucial logistical hub for the US mission in Syria, where ISIS remains a serious and resurging threat, and continued US cooperation with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces is essential for maintaining regional security. The US mission in Syria, which also monitors and contains Iranian and Russian expansionist efforts, heavily relies on the stability and support of Iraqi Kurdistan. The unwavering Kurdish commitment to its partnership with the United States has intensified animosity from Iran and pro-Iran factions in Baghdad, as these groups have led efforts to expel US troops from Iraq. This push is part of Iran’s broader strategy to reshape the regional order and diminish US influence. To apply pressure on the Kurds, Iran and its Iraqi proxies have launched numerous drone and missile attacks on Kurdish targets, including energy fields and business figures. Kurdistan’s energy sector is crucial to Iraq’s energy independence and electricity supply—key issues driving public frustration and discontent with the government. Despite immense pressure from Iran and its allies, Kurdish parties have consistently resisted supporting or voting for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq, both in 2020 and more recently in Februarythis year. Given these dynamics, it is critical for the United States to support the timely formation of a broad-based KRG cabinet with a strong popular mandate, especially in its dealings with Baghdad. This will help ensure the Kurdish region can resist external pressures while maintaining its autonomy. In promoting dialogue and compromise, Washington should particularly urge the PUK, under its new leadership, not to obstruct the government-formation process by holding unrealistic expectations about its share of power. Weakened by internal divisions over the past decade and a half, the PUK—now with nearly half the popularity of the KDP—still expects an equal share of power in the Kurdistan Region’s governing institutions. The party’s new leaders are holding onto this maximalist stance to signal strength to their base, harking back to the party’s heyday from 1991 to 2009, despite their significantly diminished share of the votes. In an effort to compensate for their shrinking popular support and to counterbalance the KDP’s dominance, the PUK has increasingly leaned on Iran and Iran-backed actors in Iraq. This dynamic risks turning the PUK into a vehicle for destabilizing Iranian influence in the Kurdistan Region, deepening internal divisions and potentially prompting greater political intervention from an increasingly more assertive and concerned Turkey. US mediation should encourage the PUK to adopt more realistic expectations, while ensuring that the KDP remains flexible in expanding the government’s power base and accommodating meaningful participation and partnership by others, particularly the PUK, in the governing institutions. Amid escalating regional instability and a wider region becoming less amicable to the United States, it is critical to maintain the Kurdistan Region as a stable safe haven and to avoid it becoming a political battleground for regional powers to settle scores. Therefore, it is essential to prevent Iranian and Turkish intervention, which would further complicate an already challenging but still manageable situation. The US embassy in Baghdad should take an active role in mediating the government-formation process, but support and engagement from higher levels of the US government are equally crucial. This includes senior officials from the State Department in Washington, the White House, and the National Security Council’s Middle East team. For this process to succeed, Kurdish leaders must recognize the strategic value of maintaining strong ties with the United States and avoid jeopardizing the relationship for personal or factional gains. For Washington, this is a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to strengthen bilateral ties during a time of uncertainty. Ultimately, it would send a clear message to regional actors, in Baghdad and beyond, that the United States remains committed to its distinctive relationship with Kurds and will not allow the weakening of the KRG.

Trumpist Conservatism: How It Differs From Classical American Con...	Did the Republican Party sell its soul to the devil by choosing Donald Trump as its nominee for the third time? How can it support a man who defies all the safeguards of democracy and radically reinterprets conservative beliefs? The Republican Party has fully embraced Donald Trump, who has represented it in three presidential elections (2016, 2020, 2024). The last time a political figure dominated an American party with such absolute power was during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four presidential campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s. Whatever the outcome of the November 2024 election, Trump’s longevity has already had a profound effect on his party. Based on an analysis of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024 and Trump’s campaign since then, this essay seeks to define the ideological positioning of the 'Trumpified' Republican Party by situating it within the long history of conservatism in the United States. Republican Classics Trump’s rhetoric is reasonably consistent with an ideological core that upholds the Republican classics established by Ronald Reagan since the 1980s. On the economic front, promises of tax cuts and support for growth through supply-side policies clearly dominate this approach. Trump repeatedly boasts about the huge tax cuts passed by Congress during his first term (2016-2020). He often claims that these tax cuts are the largest in history, a point he is right to emphasize given that his 2017 tax reform surpasses the already impressive tax cuts implemented under Ronald Reagan (1981) or George W. Bush (2002, 2003). In a campaign where his economic agenda has been extremely ambiguous, taxes are Trump’s single unambiguous promise: 'No tax on tips!' - the goal being to exempt from taxation the tips earned by 'waitresses, golf caddies, and chauffeurs,' as he stated at the Milwaukee Convention. Another 'classic' staple of Republican electoral campaigns: the culture wars. Indeed, the Milwaukee Convention ticked all the boxes expected by the party’s evangelical base: rejection of trans gender claims (Democrats 'can’t even define what a woman is!' complained Florida Governor Ron de Santis, while Trump’s son, Don Jr, accused 'left-wing teachers' of 'teaching our children that there are 57 different genders'); the denunciation of the U.S. government’s decision, following the Black Lives Matter movement, to rename numerous U.S. military installations bearing the names of Southern generals; or the repeated promise, ad nauseam, to fight the left’s 'socialist-Marxist utopia' that seeks to replace traditional American values ('faith, patriotism, work ethic and family') with 'race, gender, sexuality and climate change.' The Republican mission remains unchanged: to save traditional America. A Renewed Corpus The Trumpian ideological framework adheres to the essential tenets of American conservatism while simultaneously instituting a significant doctrinal transformation regarding foreign policy and the connection to populism. The Republican Party had long embraced isolationist thinking, but the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the entry of the United States into the war discredited it. Later, during the Cold War, Republicans adopted an Atlanticist, interventionist vision, which explains, for example, their support for the Vietnam War and Ronald Reagan’s attack on Soviet influence in Central America in the 1980s. This legacy also explains the neoconservative wave that swept the party in the early 21st century, leading to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trumpism rejects this tradition altogether. Following in the footsteps of the George W. Bush administration, Republicans have never acknowledged the mistakes they made in the war on terror, nor have they revised their foreign policy principles. Trump has capitalized on this thoughtlessness and lack of courage to force the party to reevaluate its foreign policy principles. This has led to a remarkable resurgence of isolationism, which was evident in 2016 but has become even more pronounced in the 2024 campaign. In Milwaukee, the Iraq War that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and all the Republican leaders of the time wanted was portrayed as a 'disaster' and a 'lie.' As for the 'America First' slogan used by pro-German isolationists like Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s, it is ubiquitous in the campaign. Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News star and close Trump ally, summed up the perception of interventionism as a betrayal of the American people during his convention speech, saying, 'I’ve seen members of Congress step over the prostrate bodies of their fellow citizens dying of drug overdoses to go to Congress to vote for aid to foreign countries.' Accusing America’s NATO members of enjoying American security without adequately contributing to the alliance’s funding, Trump has constantly criticized them throughout his presidency, building his reputation as tough in diplomatic and military circles. These sermons are even more worrying in 2024, as the situation in Europe has deteriorated sharply with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Going down the isolationist path means knowingly abandoning European allies in favor of Putin’s Russia. Tucker Carlson makes no bones about it: 'You don’t see our commander-in-chief [Joe Biden] suggesting that we use our armed forces to protect our country or the lives of our fellow citizens. No, that’s for Ukraine!' Trump’s populism, recognized as early as his 2016 campaign and credited by American political scientists as a primary factor in his victory, is naturally reflected in his focus on elites who would betray the American people. The 2024 campaign confirms this turning point, which represents a landmark evolution for the Republican Party. While presidents like Nixon or Reagan had used conservative populism in the past to attract working-class votes, Trump’s rejection of elites takes a much more massive and insurgent turn. This is important because, historically, the Republican Party has been precisely the party of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) elites - the party known for its closeness to middle class, big business, and Wall Street. These ties persist, as evidenced by the contributions of many large corporations to Republican campaign financing. However, speeches at the Milwaukee Convention consistently denounced the 'establishment,' accusing 'wealthy elites' of 'selling out American workers' to 'big banks' and 'big technology companies. Leading Republican voices reinforce this message, sometimes creating cognitive dissonance. For example, JD Vance, a former investment banker close to Silicon Valley billionaires and now Trump’s vice presidential running mate, rails against politicians who are 'in the pocket of corporate America' and against 'the barons of Wall Street' who have destroyed the American economy. But consistency is not the priority of the Trumpified Republican Party. Instead, Trumpism resorts to an accusatory inversion in which the Democratic Left replaces the Republican Right as the enemy of the people in the collective American imagination. Trumpist Obsessions To understand Trumpism, one must take into account the obsessions that have fueled it since Trump declared his intention to run in the Republican primaries in 2015: immigration and how it affects crime in the United States. Trump frequently appears at his rallies with the slogan 'Deport Illegals Now' emblazoned in large letters on the wall behind him, and his supporters wave placards with the slogan 'Mass Deportation Now.' Terms like 'invasion' or 'occupation' are now commonplace to create the impression of a country at war with immigrants. For Trump, these millions of illegals entered the United States with the complicity of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, although it would be more accurate to speak of impotence, since the outgoing administration never found a way to reconcile humanitarian and border security policies. As a result, the number of illegal entries into the United States has increased since 2020, leading Republicans to claim that Democrats have betrayed the country. Eric, Trump’s son, made it clear in Milwaukee that the Biden administration not only sends 'illegals' to the most expensive hotels in New York, but also reduces 'homeless veterans' to 'sleeping under bridges.' Worse, once these illegals settle in, they are supposedly the catalyst for violence in small towns and big cities. Because of them, according to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 'Americans are dying every day; they are being murdered, assaulted, and raped' and 'young boys and girls are being sold into sexual slavery. But it is to American women that these immigrants pose the greatest threat. Condemning immigration through its alleged effects on women is a particularly astute strategy for Trump and the Republicans, especially in light of the former president’s conviction in the Stormy Daniels case in the spring of 2024. Women are a highly coveted demographic in this election cycle. Framing immigrants as a formidable threat allows Trump supporters to engage with the issue without addressing their significant vulnerability to female voters, particularly their role in the Dobbs decision that led to the Supreme Court’s revocation of federal abortion rights in June 2022. Trumpist discourse conveys a very traditional vision of women as perpetual victims. Whether they are portrayed as wives (a young woman at the Milwaukee Convention explains how her husband died of an overdose), as mothers (a weeping woman comes to tell how her 15-year-old son, Weston, died after taking a fentanyl pill), or as sexual prey (a family recalls their sister, Rachel Morin, who was raped and killed by an undocumented immigrant), the underlying mechanism of persuasion remains consistent across these narratives: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have perpetuated open-borders policies that have resulted in an influx of immigrants and drug cartels permeating numerous American cities. They bear the burden of guilt. Trump, for example, has made much of the case of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl who was tragically raped and strangled by two undocumented Venezuelan immigrants. If re-elected, Trump vows to 'protect women' threatened by an 'army of illegals from Third World countries' and 'rapists' whom 'American women don’t want coming into their homes.' The Republican base responds favorably to the rhetorical mechanism that combines racism, miserabilist pathos, and an obsession with sexual violence. In Milwaukee, several elected officials, just like Trump, brought up the tragic story of Jocelyn Nungaray to a crowd of activists who angrily chanted, 'Send them back!' Hence, Trump’s new flagship promise, after building a wall on the border with Mexico, is to deport the more than ten million undocumented immigrants currently living on U.S. soil. An Illiberal Drift Such rhetorical excesses have led many historians and political scientists since 2016 to analyze Trump’s success through the concept of 'illiberalism,' popularized in the United States by Fareed Zakaria in a famous 1997 article in Foreign Affairs titled 'The Rise of Illiberal Democracy.' According to Zakaria, illiberal democracies are 'democratically elected regimes' that 'routinely ignore constitutional limits on their power' and 'deprive their citizens of basic rights and freedoms'. Since 2016, a slow illiberal drift has accompanied the Republican Party’s capitulation to Trump. Despite facing numerous challenges during his presidency, including the January 6, 2021 Capitol Rebellion, the party has consistently supported Trump, with only ten elected House Republicans voting to impeachment him during his second impeachment. In 2024, Trump easily won the primaries, confirming this blind loyalty to him. Only two party heavyweights, Nikki Haley (former governor of South Carolina) and Ron de Santis (governor of Florida), dared to run against the former president. Although they were younger than him and considered to be fairly successful elected officials in their respective states, Trump defeated them rather easily. He barely campaigned against them, refused to participate in even the smallest debate, and spent months insulting them. Yet the party base didn’t hold it against him and triumphantly chose him as the Republican nominee in November 2024. The same scenario played out in Milwaukee. The Convention saw the creation of a veritable personality cult around the billionaire. Far from being a mere candidate, he has become, in the words of the many Republicans who spoke at the podium, a hero, even a superman, the 'Braveheart of our time. His success and celebrity have captivated Hollywood and sports stars for years. His golf scores impress even professional golfers. He is credited with shaping the New York skyline in the manner of a modern-day ‘Midas’ (the most famous king in Greek mythology for his ability to turn everything he touched into pure gold). He was reputedly 'one of the best businessmen in the world' before his political career. All of this is demonstrably false. Nevertheless, these compliments, culled from Trump’s pre-presidential existence as a mostly tabloid figure, reinforce the populist aspect of his candidacy, portraying the former president as both a successful man and an eternal outsider. But it was his 'miraculous' survival of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, that gave him an almost supernatural aura among his supporters. In Milwaukee, party leaders declared that while 'the devil' had come for Trump, 'the hand of God' turned his head at the last moment and gave him the strength to stand up 'like a roaring lion. Blessed by God, Trump can join the pantheon of the greatest American presidents in his lifetime, beginning with Ronald Reagan, but also with Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated in 1865, because he understands the risks and is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. He could have lived a life of luxury on his magnificent Florida estate, but he chose to go back into battle and endure the worst of it: insults, trials, and assassination attempts. That is why today’s Republican voters firmly believe that Donald Trump is a victim and that the Democrats are 'persecuting' him. However, he bravely faces these 'vicious' attacks because he understands that his 'only crime' is simply to 'love America.' This kind of flattery may bring a smile to your face. But it points to a real erosion of certain democratic norms that, until Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party, were thought to be secure in the American political system. The first erosion of democratic norms concerns the role of violence in the political arena. The 2024 presidential campaign conspicuously avoids the Capitol Rebellion of January 6, 2021. On the rare occasions it is mentioned, it serves to reverse the burden of blame in favor of the Republicans. While Democrats, first with Joe Biden and now with Kamala Harris, continue to portray the former president as a threat to U.S. institutions, Tucker Carlson acknowledged in Milwaukee that Republicans have grown tired of the constant criticism of democracy on television. After all, the 'true definition' of democracy is 'the proposition that the citizens of a country own that country. This would mean that a country’s leaders must 'do what the people tell them to do.' But only Donald Trump 'pays attention to what the people want.' Therefore, the surest way to strengthen and save American democracy would be to vote for him. This is a bold rewriting of history, especially as the November 5, 2024 election approaches and Trump becomes more explicit about his willingness to use violence whether he is re-elected or loses at the polls. He firmly believes that his Democratic opponents pose a significant threat to the integrity of American democracy. 'We have two enemies,' Trump said to Maria Bartiromo during an appearance on Fox News’ 'Sunday Morning Futures' on October 20. 'We have the outside enemies, and we have the enemies from within, and the enemy within, in my opinion, is much more dangerous than China or Russia and all these countries, because if you have a smart president, he can handle them pretty easily … The thing that’s tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside.' Trump sees only one solution: to call out the army to prevent the 'lunatics of the radical left' from disrupting the elections. He has identified specific targets in interviews and campaign rallies, including Adam Schiff, a Democratic representative who spearheaded the first impeachment proceedings against him in 2020, Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic Speaker of the House, and her husband Paul, who was attacked with a hammer by a far-right activist in his San Francisco home in 2022. Conclusion Each step in this seemingly endless escalation of Trumpian provocations represents a quasi-ontological test for the Republican Party: should the party’s supporters accept any verbal or ideological derailment in the name of winning back the White House? Admittedly, some Republican figures, including a number of Trump’s former secretaries or advisors (Mark Esper, H.R. McMaster, Mike Pence or John F. Kelly, Dick Cheney), have strongly denounced him during the current presidential campaign. However, these voices remain a minority within the party and do not have much influence. In fact, the party expelled Trump’s main internal opponent, former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, in 2021. The Republican Party in the Trump era is thus a monolithic body in which devotion to Trump is a condition of survival. This old party, profoundly renewed in both its ideological foundations and its leadership, has undergone an incredibly rapid metamorphosis, caught between a charismatic leader and a passionate base blindly loyal to him. Today, the mutation seems complete, and whatever the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, it is likely to affect every other actor in the U.S. political, partisan, and institutional system. For American democracy, there will be a 'before' and an 'after' Donald Trump.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1VTGikwny1Fi	2024-11-02T17:08:52-07:00	
Flashback: How Yeltsin Gleefully Drove Bill Clinton To Tears. Who...	Yeltsin grinned while Clinton cried. The Russian president had just blurted out his unfiltered reaction to American news reporting. It was October, 1995. Clinton and Yeltsin had just spoken at the United Nations 50th anniversary meeting. The next day the two presidents got together at Hyde Park, New York for a bilateral meeting followed by a press conference. It was then that Yeltsin told the media his take on his US visit. He said that when he came here that October he did not have the degree of optimism with which he was now departing. The bilateral meeting had apparently been productive. But then he dropped his brutal statement about our American press: 'Coming from my statement yesterday in the United Nations, and if you looked at the press reports, one could see that what you were writing was that today's meeting with President Bill Clinton was going to be a disaster. And now for the first time I can tell you that you're a disaster.' That's what set off Clinton's crying. But his tears were not for the press or over any danger or fear. They were tears of laughter. Both presidents had a good laugh over Yeltsin's remarks about our American news style. You can see the video in this AP archive: Today, though, Clinton would have nothing to laugh about given the present state of bilateral relations. Back at Hyde Park, Yeltsin had gone on, '...our partnership is not calculated for one year or for five years, but for years and years to come -- tens of years, for a century; that we're friends, and that it's only together, together, [that] we're going to be trying to solve not only our joint bilateral issues but issues affecting the whole world.' This was not the first time the new Russian and American friendship was mutually proclaimed. That was made clear at the presidents' April 1993 Vancouver summit. A White House press release that followed said, 'President Bill Clinton of the United States of America and President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation declared their firm commitment to a dynamic and effective US-Russian partnership that strengthens international stability.' In a follow-up phone call now declassified, Clinton told Yeltsin, 'I'm about to issue a statement in support of your policies. I want you to know that we're in this with you for the long haul. We made some significant progress in Vancouver and Tokyo. We'll keep working here to be supportive. If there is anything I can do for you here, please let me know.' It is quite obvious today, that that those past optimistic aspirations did not stand the test of time. Today we find ourselves lavishly sponsoring Ukraine as it bombs Russia and invades and occupies a small part of Russia's home territory. Our actions were seemingly as support for the beleaguered Ukraine, a victim of a brutal invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin in 2022. But any idea of friendship and partnership with Russia is long gone. Truth be known, it was even gone long before Russia's disastrous invasion of Ukraine. And ironically, it was President Bill Clinton himself who set the US and Russia on a collision course. You see, it was Clinton that put in motion NATO's eastward expansion. That ultimately advanced to talk of placing Nato forces right up against Russia's sensitive border with Ukraine. Russia considered that to be a security threat of existential proportion. Clinton had revealed his hidden agenda on this when he spoke to The Atlantic in 2022. He claimed: 'When I first became president, I said that I would support Russian President Boris Yeltsin in his efforts to build a good economy and a functioning democracy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union -- but I would also support an expansion of Nato to include former Warsaw Pact members and post-Soviet states.' Certainly it's always good to be prepared for the worst. But Clinton's plan was in abrogation of a contract made between presidents G.H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. It assured Gorbachev that 'within the framework of Nato, not an inch of Nato's present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.' This matter is often dismissed because it was never a condition of any treaty. But I've examined carefully the official sources on the matter and find present all the elements of a verbal contract. The Soviets performed their obligations in the contract, but Clinton abrogated ours. Under US law verbal contracts are perfectly legal, but difficult to enforce. Clinton apparently hid behind that in his actions regarding Nato expansion. In 1985 presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev issued a joint statement: 'A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.' That admonition seems to be freely ignored now. On September 25, 2024 Reuters reported, 'President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles, and that Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. It is well known that it is Russia's military doctrine that an existential threat will be met with a nuclear response. But Russell Berman, a Stanford University professor, writing in The National Interest, April 6, 2023, proclaims that 'Ukraine must win its war with Russia.' He says, 'It is foolish and short-sighted to withhold from Ukraine the tools it needs to win.' Is Berman nuts? What's worse is that there are prominent American politicians who seem to hold the same position, i.e. that Ukraine must win not settle the war. Unless stopped these people will risk saber-rattling our way into a nuclear war, it seems to me. Europe is already preparing for the worst. On March 20, Politico ran the story, 'Von der Leyen asks Finland to prepare the EU for war.' ( On October 31, 2024 Newsweek reported, 'Europeans Told to Stockpile Food in Case of War with Russia.' ( We Americans are mostly being kept in the dark over the present danger. Our former Civil Defense structure is long gone. Could it be that too many influential people are profiting or benefiting from the military activity? President Eisenhower warned us of such a possibility in his farewell address. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in an interview by Chris Cuomo, likened Russia's present situation to that confronted by his uncle President Kennedy in 1962. That's when he brought the US and the USSR to the brink of nuclear war over the Soviet military advances in Cuba. Thankfully, President Kennedy held strong against those within our country that urged him to fight instead of negotiate. The matter was settled peacefully. Will our next president succumb to internal pressures to keep the war gravy train going? I'm writing this before the election. But I hope that voters will have checked out who the politicians are that want military victory over a peaceful settlement. The 2024 election is not just for president. House and Senate seats are up, too. Clearly nuclear war is not an issue on voters' minds. It doesn't register like more popular concerns over higher prices, jobs, immigration, abortion, and taxes. But nuclear war is far more consequential. Unlike the other important issues, it is an existential threat. Remember Clinton's tears and the Clinton-Yeltsin laugh-fest? Today's issues have truly risen to an existential threat. This is nothing to laugh or cry about. It's no time for domestic political maneuvering. It's now time that our politicians get serious and find a way to peacefully end the hostilities quickly, and in an honest and direct manner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Q2pXdDBPm6i	2024-11-02T17:07:33-07:00	
The Islamic Republic Of Iran Should Be Overthrown – OpEd	By Shahram Mirzaei Only four decades ago, on April 18, 1983, Iran destroyed the US embassy in Beirut through its Lebanese terrorist proxy, Hezbollah. This attack was a turning point in jihadist aggression that still regularly affects the free world today. Before the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic terrorism was not well organized. Mohammad Reza Shah, Iran’s last monarch, laid the groundwork for the rapid growth and spread of Islamic terrorism by severely suppressing progressive and liberal forces in the country. With liberal and progressive forces weakened, Islamic terrorist forces led by the cleric Ruhollah Khomeini seized control of the Iranian government in 1979 in a massive coup against the inhumane Pahlavi Dynasty. With Iran’s resources at their disposal, Islamists were able to establish terrorist organizations in countries across the Middle East. Iran Supports Islamic Terrorism The attack on the American embassy and the suicide bombing on the headquarters of the US Marine barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983, was a major turning point in how Islamists carry out terrorist operations. 241 US soldiers, 58 French soldiers, and six civilians were killed in the attack on the barracks. The culprits were affiliated with Iran. These attacks ushered in an age of unending Islamic terrorism. But who is responsible for this disaster? Inaction from Western governments regarding terrorism, especially from the US, sent a direct message to Iran’s leaders: you are allowed to establish and arm terrorist organizations. Western leaders did not have the determination and courage to respond to the new terrorist threat because they did not recognize or understand the ideological nature of the other side. After these attacks, a joint plan to attack the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah’s centers in Lebanon was planned and approved by the presidents of the US and France. However, the US Secretary of Defense lobbied against and successfully stopped it, claiming there was no clear evidence of Iran’s role in the previous attacks. The leaders of the free world, especially the US, continue to be double-minded and indecisive in dealing with Iran and its terrorist regime. This wrongheaded policy created a suitable environment for the growth of Islamic terrorism and turned our world into a less safe place. The formation of al-Qaeda and its September 11 attacks, the rise of ISIS and its assault on the Yazidi Kurds — including the abduction and sale of thousands of Kurdish women as sex slaves — numerous terrorist attacks across the West, and the profound sense of insecurity in these nations, culminating in the October 7 terrorist attack against Israel and Iran’s subsequent missile attacks against Israel in April and October 2024, highlight the consequences of failing to address Tehran decisively. The Appeasement Policy After almost five decades of appeasement toward Iran, the October 7 invasion of Israel by Iran’s proxy, Hamas, pushed Israel to take a defensive posture and cut off the arms of the Islamic terrorist regime by attacking the source of the satanic ideology: the Islamic Republic of Iran itself. Unfortunately, the international community and the free world still insist on this appeasement policy. For this reason, Israel is alone in the fight against terrorism, bearing the weight of the world in its struggle against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Poor policy choices concerning Iran’s support of terrorism do not end there. On September 28, the US announced an agreement with Iraq to withdraw American troops from parts of the country. This is likely the beginning of another global disaster produced by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The withdrawal will mean the complete handover of Iraq to Iran, providing a safe space for Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist organizations affiliated with Iran to hide from Israel by moving to Iraq. If this agreement is implemented, Iraq — with all its riches — will become a hub for the growth and spread of Islamic terrorism supported by Iran. This will nullify all Israeli efforts to combat terrorism supported by Iran, as well as all Western efforts to create a secure Middle East. If Western countries are not more decisive in dealing with Islamic terrorism, our future will be more uncertain. History has shown that Iran is the head of a snake. To kill a snake, you have to cut off its head. This is not an endorsement of an all-out war with Iran. Instead, free countries, especially the United States, should support liberation movements in the region. This support should be extended to the Kurds, who may be powerful enough to destroy the Islamic Republic but presently lack international support. The lack of support from Western countries for the Iranian popular uprisings in December 2017 and November 2019 and the Kurdish Woman, Life, Freedom movement that started in 2022 sent a message to the Islamic Republic that it can carry out its crimes domestically and continue its terrorist activities internationally without fear of retribution. The West must end the appeasement policy with Iran and crush the snake’s head in Tehran by supporting the progressive and liberal movements of the Iranian people, thereby ending five decades of terrorism fostered by Iran.

Ecuador’s Blackouts: The High Cost Of State-Controlled Electricit...	By Daphne Posadas In recent weeks, Ecuador has faced a severe energy crisis, with power outages lasting up to 10 hours daily, affecting millions of citizens. The main causes are a prolonged drought and a highly centralized electricity sector. The drought, which has been the worst in 6 decades, has reduced water levels at hydroelectric dams to historic lows, impacting plants that generate over 70 percent of the country’s electricity. Most of these hydroelectric plants are operated by Ecuador’s state-owned utility company, CELEC, concentrating energy provision in the hands of the government. You may wonder why Ecuador is so dependent on hydro for energy. The truth? Efforts to diversify the energy mix have stalled due to strong resistance to alternatives, a growing diesel shortage, and missed opportunities to use gas. This puts Ecuador in a risky spot, with its energy supply tied entirely to rainfall. Ecuador’s one-dimensional approach to energy is only becoming costlier as droughts grow more intense. The electricity market is traditionally divided into four segments: generation (the production of electricity, such as at hydroelectric plants), transmission (transporting electricity over long distances at high voltages), distribution (delivering electricity to consumers at lower voltages), and retail sales (providing and selling electricity to customers). In Ecuador, these areas are mostly state-controlled. The Cato Institute’s Gabriela Calderón de Burgos recently published an insightful piece on the history of Ecuador’s electricity sector. She highlights how it once operated more efficiently under a decentralized model. However, after World War II, the government began to nationalize and centralize the sector, leading to a significantly increased state control over electricity generation and distribution by the 1980s. As Gabriela shares in another piece, while private entities are permitted to invest in generating their own electricity from various sources, electricity rates remain highly politicized. Heavy state control of pricing has disincentivized private investment, all while the citizens continue to pay the price. The Ecuadorian Business Committee estimates that businesses are losing approximately 12 million USD for every hour without electricity. However, those are of course only the visible costs. The invisible losses—those that impact productivity and future opportunities—are likely far greater and impossible to measure. Ecuador’s energy crisis illustrates a broader economic principle: the risks of centralized, state-controlled systems. When vital sectors like electricity are monopolized by the state, they become rigid and less responsive to external shocks, such as natural disasters. Centralization stifles competition and innovation, restricting the ability to adapt and respond quickly to crises. (More on the inefficiency of central planning can be found in Tibor Machan’s article from our archive.) In public debates, some Ecuadorian citizens have romanticized the Socialist Correísmo era (2007–2017), arguing that power outages were rare during that administration (more accurately, a dictatorship) and attributing the current crisis to 'neoliberalism'—a term broadly used by people who oppose free markets and limited government. However, the reality is that a fully centralized system lacks the flexibility needed to tackle an energy crisis of this magnitude. And while many governments have come and gone since Correísmo, the current model is partly a legacy of that socialized view of electricity. My colleague Sergio Martínez recently highlighted on our Spanish social media platforms how countries like Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela have all suffered devastating blackouts due to government control of the electricity sector. In these nations, a lack of competition and incentives has led to inefficiencies, higher costs, and an inability to meet rising demands. By opening the energy market, Ecuador could increase its resilience against future crises, encourage innovation, and ultimately ensure a more reliable electricity supply for its citizens. A more diversified energy market could attract private actors who compete not just on price but most importantly on reliability. This would ensure a better service for consumers and better responses to crises like this one. It’s time for Ecuador to power up innovation and competition rather than being left in the dark.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Seeks Reset Of UK Politics With Bi...	By Andrew Hammond It is relatively rare for economic events in the UK to cause big political ripples globally. However, last Wednesday’s Budget could be different. Many people, not only domestically but internationally as well, were looking closely at the most important fiscal statement by a British government in a generation. There are several reasons why the Budget is potentially era-defining, politically and economically, including the fact that, following the party’s victory in the election in July, it is the first fiscal event by a Labour government since 2010, during the final days of Gordon Brown’s administration. Given the huge majority Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government enjoys in the House of Commons, Labour might well remain in office not only until the end of the current Parliament in 2028 or 2029, but possibly well into the 2030s if a second term is secured, even with a reduced majority. This means this week’s Budget could shape the UK’s political agenda for much longer than the typical annual Budget. In her statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves launched what she described as 'a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy, as momentous as any in Labour’s history'. What she was attempting to do here was to try to draw political comparisons with the big programs of reforms that began in 1945 under Prime Minister Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson, and in 1997 under Tony Blair. In addition to welcoming additional private capital, the government therefore announced plans for a step change in public investment. This marks a shift from the plans Reeves inherited from the Conservative administration of the former prime minister, Rishi Sunak, under which public-sector net investment would have fallen from 2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year to 1.7 percent by 2028 or 2029. The new government wants to boost this proportion significantly, as outlined in Labour’s election manifesto, in which the party pledged to keep public sector net investment at a constant level as a share of GDP. This implies big additional investment commitments each year, especially if the economy grows significantly. To facilitate this plan, Reeves is redefining the government’s fiscal rules to potentially free up tens of billions of of pounds of additional borrowing to fund long-term investment, while still seeking to deliver on a Labour manifesto pledge to reduce debt as a proportion of the UK economy. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, who is No. 2 to Reeves in the UK finance team, has announced that a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority will try to 'fix the foundations' of a creaking UK infrastructure system. To help pay for this huge investment, a very significant net tax rise was announced on Wednesday and the financial markets are still digesting its likely impact. Certainly, tax hikes are far from unprecedented immediately following an election. However, the fiscal measures unveiled by Reeves this week amount to a tax take of about £40 billion ($52 billion). This comfortably exceeds the £14 billion and £13 billion, in today’s prices, of her predecessors, Gordon Brown and George Osborne, in their first Budgets in 1997 and 2010 respectively. Indeed, it is most comparable, in real terms, to Norman Lamont’s fiscal plan in 1993, which was the biggest tax-raising Budget in half a century. In the coming years, the acid test for how many people perceive the success of the Budget will be whether it succeeds in boosting economic growth. This reflects the context in which it was prepared, which dates back more than a decade and a half to the 2007/08 international financial crisis. Since then, economic growth in the UK has flat-lined compared with the era immediately before it, and many people around the world will be watching closely to see whether the country can get out of this funk. So with the No. 1 mission of the Starmer government perhaps being its attempt to rejuvenate growth, Reeves highlighted the latest economic forecast from the independent UK Office for Budget Responsibility. This indicated a modest upside in 2025, in part because of falling interest rates, but was less optimistic about the several years immediately afterwards, which will be a cause of concern for the government. Nonetheless, Starmer’s team will seize on the 2025 upside in its keenness to move the economic narrative away from fiscal 'black holes' to more optimistic mood music. This includes a focus on the UK’s long-term growth potential into the 2030s, fueled by a fresh wave of investment to deliver on goals that go well beyond tackling crumbling national infrastructure, to such efforts as becoming a 'clean energy superpower.' The fact that clean energy has become a political super-priority for Labour was highlighted at the UK Investment Summit last month. About half of the more than £50 billion in business deals announced during this big event were energy-related. One driver of this spurt of investment was the launch of Great British Energy, an investment body and publicly owned power-generation company that aims to ensure a massive expansion of clean energy to help enhance the UK’s energy security. Moreover, in July Labour overturned a nine-year ban by its Conservative predecessors on onshore wind-power construction. This was followed by one of the most successful auction rounds for renewables in history. Wednesday’s Budget was therefore the most important moment yet for Starmer’s government. The measures that were announced will help define the next few years, and potentially beyond, of his administration as it seeks to reset the UK’s political landscape by 'going for growth' to try to shift the economy out of its long funk. • Andrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1RD7IEgXczxi	2024-11-02T17:04:42-07:00	
Private-Sector Jobs Went Negative In October: Will The Fed Panic ...	By Ryan McMaken According to the most recent report from the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added only 12,000 payroll jobs during October. This was the smallest month-to-month employment gain in nearly four years. Moreover, total private jobs fell in October by 28,000. This is the worst employment report since 2020, and it reflects an overall downward trend in employment growth since 2022. In addition to the drop in private employment, the report also shows drops in full-time employment and ongoing stagnation in the total number of employed workers. This is an economy in which whatever lackluster growth there is in employment, it’s being driven by part-time jobs and taxpayer-funded government workers. Government Jobs vs. Private Employment Total government jobs grew by 40,000 during October, meaning total job growth for the month would have been negative were it not for the immense amounts of deficit spending that props up growth in government hiring. This has been a growing trend over the past year. Proportionally, government jobs over the year have grown one-and-a-half times more than private-sector jobs. For most of the past year, however, there were—at least according to the establishment survey— some gains in private employment. But that wasn’t the case in October meaning private employment fell in October for the first time in 46 months. But, 12,000 more people had jobs in October than in September, right? Not quite. That number comes out of the so-called 'establishment' survey which counts only jobs, but not employed workers. According to the federal government’s otheremployment survey—the household survey—the total number of employed workers in the United States fell in October, month over month, by 368,000 workers. Over time, this has led to stagnation in total employment in the household-survey numbers. Over the past eighteen months, total employed workers has gone nowhere, and as of October, there are 370,000 fewer employed workers in the United States than there were eleven months ago: Yet, over this period, total jobs in the establishment survey has grown by more than 2 million jobs. So why are there job gains in the establishment survey but job losses in the household survey? One probable explanation is that much of the job growth we see is driven by part-time jobs and by people holding more than one job to make ends meet. Not surprisingly, the household survey does indeed show that full-time employment fell in October both month-to-month and year-over year. Part-time jobs, on the other hand, continued an upward trend in growth, year over year. In fact, year-over-year full-time job growth has now been negative for nine months in a row, for the past thirty years, that has only happened when the economy is in recession: There is other bad news in the report, as well. Temp jobs continue their long march downward, and total temp work is now at the lowest level reported in more than a decade. Year-over-year, temp work has been down for two full years. For more than thirty years, this has only happened during recessions. Average weekly overtime hours remained at 3.6 hours in October. For more than 30 years, average overtime has been at this level only during recessions. The total number of permanent job losers also spiked in October, rising to the highest level reported—outside the covid crisis—in 90 months. These jobs numbers weren’t the only bad news released today, either. The PMI manufacturing index, released by the Institute for Supply Management, fell to 46.5 percent. This was the lowest reading of the year, showing 'economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in October for the seventh consecutive month.' The report showed new orders, production, and employment were all in contraction territory during October. Will the Fed Panic Again? The question that now faces markets is this: what will the Federal Reserve do in response to the October job report? The bond markets may give us hint. Today, after the release of the jobs report, the 10-year yield rose quickly to a four-month high. Overall, the yield curve steepened today as the 5-year, the 10-year and the 30-year also all experienced significantly rising yields. This strongly suggests that bond investors expect the Fed, in the face of increasingly bad economic data, will totally throw in the towel on its alleged war against price inflation. With government debt levels at nosebleed levels, and now with this jobs report, there is every reason to believe that the Fed simply doesn’t have to stomach to do anything but lower the target policy rate in an effort to keep government debt cheap and to stimulate the job market. That points to rising price inflation, and that points to rising yields in the longer term. Thus, we now see that rise in the 10-year and 30-year bonds. The bond markets are probably right. At this point, it’s nearly a sure thing that the Fed will cut the target rate by at least 25 basis points as already expected. After all, at the September meeting, following a middling jobs report that was better than this one, the Fed panicked and chopped 50 basis points off the target rate. It may do so again. This all points to a hard pivot toward more dovish policy and more price inflation moving forward. Of course, price inflation could fall in coming months. But that won’t be thanks to the Fed, it would be thanks to recession and a collapse in demand. On the other hand, given the immense amounts of monetary inflation that has occurred over the past four years, we could get both recession and ongoing inflation. Then we’ll get stagflation and Powell will go down in history as the worst Fed chairman since Arthur Burns. The bond markets seem to be entertaining the possibility.

South Africa’s Memorial To The ICJ: More Evidence On Israel’s Gen...	The timing, as with so much in the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon, was most appropriate. The Israeli Knesset had signalled its intent on crippling and banishing the sole agency of humanitarian worth for Palestinian welfare by passing laws criminalising its operations by 92 to 10 on October 28. The attack on UNRWA also came with a contemporaneous legal effort, this time from South Africa. Pretoria had already made its wishes clear on December 28, 2023 in filing an application in the International Court of Justice alleging 'violations by Israel regarding the [United Nations] Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide […] in relation to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.' Acts and omissions by Israel, argued the South African government, were alleged to be of a 'genocidal' nature, 'committed with the requisite specific intent … to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza as part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group'. By May 10, South Africa had filed four requests seeking additional provisional measures with modifications to the original provisional measures laid down by the ICJ. The momentum, and frequency of the actions, even gave certain commentators room to wonder: Was Israel’s own due process rights regarding judicial equality and the right to be heard compromised? Israel had promised to submit written observations by May 15 to the ICJ when faced with the sudden announcement on May 12 that the court would be holding an oral hearing instead. These debates have been taking place before the concerted, dedicated, enthusiastic pulverisation of Gaza, and the ongoing killing, terrorisation and displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank. In these cases, due process remains fantasy and distant speculation, especially concerning civilians. With increasing regularity, there is chilling evidence that Israeli units have a programmatic approach to destroying a viable infrastructure and means of living on the strip. On October 22, the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem expressed horror at the sheer scale 'of the crimes Israel is currently committing in the northern Gaza Strip in its campaign to empty it of however many residents are left […] impossible to describe, not just because hundreds of thousands of people enduring starvation, disease without access to medical care and incessant bombardments and gunfire defies comprehension, but because Israel has cut them off from the world.' In a chilling overview of the exploits of the IDF’s 749 Combat Engineering Battalion written by Younis Tirawi and Sami Vanderlip for Drop Site News, a record of systematic elimination of cultural, structural and intellectual life in the Gaza Strip is evident. As members of the battalion’s official D9 company stated: 'Our job is to flatten Gaza.' In an operation that saw the destruction of the Al-Azhar University, First Sergeant David Zoldan, operational officer of Company A of the battalion, delights with fellow soldiers on seeing the explosion: 'Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, did you see?!' Statements of this sort are frequent and easily found up the chain of command. They are also uttered with ease at the highest levels of government. On October 21, Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir had told a 'settlement' conference held in a restricted military zone that Gaza’s inhabitants would be given the chance to 'leave from here to other countries'. His reasoning for this ethnic cleansing has remained biblically consistent: 'The Land of Israel is ours.' In a media statement from its Department of International Relations and Cooperation dated October 28, the South African government announced its filing of a Memorial to the ICJ pertaining to its ongoing case against Israel. The Memorial itself runs into 750 pages, with 4000 pages of supporting exhibits and annexes. (Its December 2023 application had run into 84 pages.) 'The problem we have is that we have too much evidence,' remarked South Africa’s representative to The Hague, Ambassador Vusimuzi Madonsela to Al Jazeera. Zane Dangor, director- general of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, was more practical. Israel might well inflate its dossier of bloody misdeeds, but some line had to be drawn in the submissions. 'The legal team will always say we need more time, there’s more facts coming. But we have to say you have to stop now. You [have] got to focus on what you have.' While the formal contents of the Memorial remain confidential, the clues are thickly obvious. It contains, for instance, evidence that Israel 'has violated the genocide convention by promoting the destruction of Palestinians living in Gaza, physically killing them with an assortment of destructive weapons, depriving them access to humanitarian assistance, causing conditions of life which are aimed at their physical destruction and ignoring and defying several provisional measures of the International Court of Justice, and using starvation as a weapon of war to further Israel’s aims to depopulate Gaza through mass death and forced displacement of Palestinians.' Despite that comprehensive assortment of alleged crimes, the legal commentariat wonder how far this latest effort will necessarily go in linking the decisions of Israeli officialdom with genocidal intent. That Israel is committing war crimes and violating humanitarian law is nigh impossible dispute. The threshold in proving genocide, as international jurisprudence has repeatedly shown over the years, is a high one indeed. The dolus specialis – that specific intent to destroy in whole or in part the protected group – is essential to prove. Cathleen Powell of University of Cape Town, for instance, has her reservations. 'If they can find genocidal statements from state officials and show that that directly led to a particular programme that led to the destruction on the ground, then that’s probably a very strong case,'. But making that link would be 'very difficult'. Dangor has no doubts. 'Genocidal acts without intent can be crimes against humanity. But here, the intent is just front and centre.' Suffice to say that Israeli lawmakers and officials, aided by the exploits of the IDF, are making proving such intent an easier prospect with each passing day.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Wh_ZQEozGxt	2024-11-02T17:01:07-07:00	
Deepening Rift In India-Canada Diplomatic Relations – Analysis	The diplomatic rift between India and Canada has escalated again with accusations of Indian involvement in the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada taking a new turn. On November 2, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the Canadian claims of Indian involvement as ‘baseless’ and accused Canada of 'deliberately spreading unfounded allegations' to tarnish India’s global image. Statements from the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence alliance—the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—had already added to India’s frustration, viewing them as part of a coordinated effort to cast it in a negative light. In response, both countries moved to expel diplomats, while the Canadian media’s adversarial tone suggests that the diplomatic fallout may be heading toward an irreversible breakdown in relations. According to the latest report, India lodged a formal protest against Canada, condemning accusations targeting its Home Minister Amit Shah. During a press briefing on Saturday, MEA spokesperson confirmed that India had summoned a Canadian High Commission representative to issue a Diplomatic Note in 'the strongest terms of protest.' This response followed statements by Canada’s Deputy Minister David Morrison, who mentioned India’s Home Minister before the Canadian Standing Committee on Public Safety. India labelled these claims as 'absurd and baseless,' accusing Canada of spreading false allegations internationally to damage India’s reputation. Jaiswal asserted that Canada’s actions confirmed India’s suspicions of a political agenda aimed at discrediting it on the global stage. India’s note warned Canada of 'serious consequences for bilateral ties' if such accusations continued, viewing them as a calculated attempt to tarnish India’s image. This latest dispute adds strain to already tense relations between the two nations, as India expressed a firm stance against attempts to malign its officials. Two senior Canadian officials reportedly admitted to leaking intelligence against India to the Washington Post, revealing accusations linking India’s government to violent acts in Canada. Deputy Foreign Minister Morrison alleged that a top Indian official orchestrated plots against Sikh separatists in Canada. India dismissed these allegations as a tactic to influence other nations. The MEA official also condemned Canada’s surveillance of Indian consular officials, calling it a 'flagrant violation of diplomatic conventions.' Jaiswal stated that Indian personnel in Canada had been under audio and video surveillance, with their communications intercepted, describing these actions as 'harassment and intimidation' that hindered diplomatic practices. He emphasized that such actions worsened an already challenging environment for India’s diplomatic staff, marked by extremism and violence. Earlier, MEA spokesperson directly criticized Prime Minister Trudeau’s ‘cavalier’ approach, holding him solely responsible for the current state of affairs. Jaiswal reiterated that Canada provided no evidence to support its serious accusations against India and its diplomats, asserting that the responsibility for the damage caused to India-Canada relations lies squarely with Trudeau. Genesis of the Row The origins of this conflict go back to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and head of a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia, was a prominent supporter of the Khalistan movement, a Sikh separatist campaign advocating for an independent state in India’s Punjab region. While this movement is largely inactive in India, it has significant support among the Sikh diaspora in countries like Canada. India, however, views the Khalistan movement as a serious threat to its national security and has long pressured Western governments to crack down on separatist leaders in the diaspora, including Nijjar. After Nijjar was shot and killed outside his temple, Canada opened an investigation, which has since expanded into a full-blown diplomatic crisis. In September 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly announced that his government was investigating ‘credible allegations’ that Indian agents were involved in Nijjar’s killing. This marked a low point in relations between Canada and India. India swiftly denied any involvement, calling the accusations ‘absurd’ and ‘preposterous.’ At the time, both countries began withdrawing diplomats and scaling back their diplomatic presence in each other’s capitals. India also froze some diplomatic services for Canadians, including the processing of visas. The situation flared up again in May 2024 when Canadian police arrested three Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder. This further fuelled Canadian suspicions of Indian government involvement, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) suggested there may be links between the suspects and Indian intelligence agencies. Another Indian national was later arrested in connection with the killing, prompting Canada to officially accuse India of state-sponsored criminal activities on Canadian soil. On 14 October, India’s Ministry of External Affairs received diplomatic communication from Canada indicating that Indian diplomats were being considered 'persons of interest' in the ongoing investigation. In response, India strongly denied any involvement in Nijjar’s killing and accused Canada of smearing India’s reputation for political purposes. India announced that it would withdraw several diplomats and officials from its missions in Canada, citing concerns over their safety. Just hours later, Canada escalated the situation by expelling six Indian diplomats, including India’s high commissioner to Canada, and accusing Indian agents of engaging in activities that threaten public safety in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau further intensified the situation by stating that the RCMP had uncovered ‘clear and compelling evidence’ of Indian government agents’ involvement in a variety of illegal activities. These activities, Trudeau claimed, included clandestine information gathering, coercive behaviour aimed at South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including Nijjar’s murder. Trudeau emphasized that this evidence had been presented directly to Indian officials in an effort to seek cooperation in addressing these issues. However, India remained firm in its denials, saying that no concrete evidence had been shared with them and accusing Canada of pursuing a deliberate strategy to damage India’s international image. This exchange of diplomatic expulsions has caused relations between the two countries to hit a new low. While the situation is currently cantered on the killing of Nijjar, it reflects broader tensions between the two countries over issues related to Sikh separatism and Canada’s handling of Khalistani groups. Sikh separatism remains a particularly sensitive issue for India, which has urged countries like Canada, Britain, and the United States to take stronger action against Sikh separatist movements abroad. Indian authorities accuse these movements of promoting violence and terrorism against India, and they view Western governments’ leniency toward these groups as a major point of contention. India’s concerns are not without historical context. Sikh separatists were involved in significant unrest in India in the 1980s, including the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 and the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, which killed 329 people. In this context, Nijjar’s murder and Canada’s accusations against India have reopened old wounds, with both sides unwilling to back down. Changing Dynamics of Bilateral Relations Canada-India relations have experienced both cooperation and tensions, with recent developments highlighting ongoing challenges. Diplomatic ties, dating back to the 1940s, have seen significant collaboration in global affairs, economic aid, and security. However, a major rift occurred following India’s 1974 nuclear test, leading Canada to sever nuclear cooperation for decades. In the 1990s, India’s economic liberalization reignited interest from Canada, with renewed trade and diplomatic missions fostering closer ties. High-profile visits and initiatives like the 2011 ‘Year of India in Canada’ further strengthened relations, while counter-terrorism collaborations also played a key role, especially after the 1985 Air India bombing. Recent years, however, have seen renewed tensions. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2018 state visit to India was overshadowed by a diplomatic controversy involving a convicted Sikh extremist, raising concerns about Canada’s handling of Sikh separatist movements. In 2019, Canada listed Sikh extremism as a top terror threat but later removed it from official reports, sparking criticism from India. Relations were further strained in 2020 when Trudeau expressed support for India’s farmer protests, leading the Indian government to accuse Canada of interfering in its internal affairs. Despite these challenges, both nations continue to engage on trade, nuclear energy, and security, reflecting a complex but enduring partnership. While the diplomatic crisis gets underway, it has already begun to affect other areas of India-Canada relations. Trade negotiations between the two countries have been halted, and India has paused visa processing for Canadians, citing concerns over the safety of its mission staff. Despite these tensions, economic ties between India and Canada remain stable for now. Bilateral trade between the two countries actually grew slightly from $8.3 billion in 2022-23 to $8.4 billion in 2023-24. India’s imports from Canada increased during this period, while its exports to Canada saw a slight dip. These figures suggest that, at least for now, the economic relationship between the two nations has not been significantly affected by the diplomatic fallout. Canada is a significant economic partner for India, ranking as the 18th-largest foreign investor with $3.31 billion in cumulative investments from 2020-21 to 2022-23, primarily focused on services and infrastructure, accounting for 0.5% of India’s total FDI. Key Canadian investors like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) have substantial stakes in Indian companies, with CPPIB's investments reaching $14.8 billion by 2023, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) investing $6 billion by the end of 2022. Major Indian companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and Infosys, have a strong presence in Canada. Canada also plays a crucial role in remittances to India, ranking among the top 10 sources, contributing to the $125 billion in global remittances India received in 2023. The Indian diaspora, consisting largely of professionals and skilled workers, sends regular remittances, while Indian students account for nearly 40% of international students in Canada, with 427,000 studying there in 2023. Indian immigration to Canada has surged, with a 326% increase from 32,828 in 2013 to 139,715 in 2023. Trudeau’s domestic challenges The diplomatic conflict has also placed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a politically precarious position at home. Trudeau has faced declining popularity in recent months, largely due to domestic issues such as rising inflation, a struggling healthcare system, and growing crime rates. A poll conducted recently showed that only 26% of Canadians view Trudeau as the best candidate for prime minister, significantly trailing behind Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Adding to Trudeau’s challenges, his key political ally, Jagmeet Singh’s New Democratic Party (NDP), recently withdrew its support for Trudeau’s minority liberal government, ahead of the general election scheduled for next year. Singh announced this decision in a video message, saying that the Liberals 'have let people down' and that they 'don’t deserve another chance from Canadians.' While the withdrawal of NDP support complicates Trudeau’s position, it is unlikely that his government will fall immediately. To remain in power, Trudeau will need to seek support from other opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre has been pressuring Singh to call for early elections, suggesting that the NDP’s withdrawal of support could lead to a change in government. If early elections are called, the Conservatives are well-positioned to win, given the widespread dissatisfaction with Trudeau’s handling of both domestic and foreign policy issues. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen Liberal backbenchers urged Prime Minister Trudeau to step aside, fearing his declining popularity could lead to an electoral disaster. This appeal, according to the Guardian, followed a separate 'code red' petition calling for a secret leadership vote among grassroots supporters. Despite this internal unrest, Trudeau, now in his ninth year as prime minister, appeared unfazed, asserting that he has the strong backing of most of the 153 Liberal MPs and will lead the party into the next election. However, analysts suggest that this growing dissent, the most serious challenge to his leadership yet, may have left its mark. Amidst the escalating crisis, Trudeau’s handling of the situation has drawn attention from Canada’s allies, particularly the United States. Trudeau has reportedly shared evidence related to the accusations against India with the United States and other members of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing alliance. The U.S. State Department emphasized that Canada’s allegations against India are 'extremely serious' and urged India's cooperation. The UK also expressed support for Canada’s investigation, stressing respect for sovereignty and the rule of law. Similarly, Australia voiced concerns about the case and affirmed respect for Canada’s judicial process. New Zealand, which reacted first, highlighted the seriousness of the allegations if proven, urging adherence to the rule of law. Challenges and Way Forward Looking ahead, it remains unclear how the diplomatic crisis between India and Canada will evolve. India’s Ministry of External Affairs stated that it 'reserves the right to take further steps' in response to Canada’s accusations, though it has not yet outlined what those steps might be. For now, both countries appear to be digging in their heels, with neither side willing to back down. Experts warn that the longer this dispute drags on, the more difficult it will be for India and Canada to restore normal diplomatic relations. The alleged involvement of Indian nationals in Nijjar’s killing has sparked renewed concerns about foreign interference in Canadian domestic affairs, particularly among the Sikh community, which makes up a significant portion of Canada’s population. The Indian diaspora in Canada is also worried about the worsening situation. Another major sector likely to be affected is student migration. Canada announced a 10% reduction in the intake cap for international student study permits for 2025, lowering the target from 485,000 in 2024 to 437,000. This decision is expected to have a negative impact on Indian students who plan to study and work in Canada. Diplomacy often exists in a complex terrain between what one nation perceives as ‘right’ and another sees as ‘wrong.’ It rarely deals in absolutes, as what is deemed just or appropriate for one country may be considered unjust or harmful for another. The subjective nature of national interests, values, and cultural perspectives creates a reality where diplomats must grapple with a constantly shifting scenario of competing moralities and priorities. This makes diplomacy less about moral clarity and more about pragmatism, compromise, and the art of finding common ground without sacrificing essential interests. In cases like the current India-Canada standoff, both nations firmly believe in the righteousness of their positions: Canada sees itself as protecting its sovereignty and public safety, while India views Canada’s accusations as politically motivated and harmful. For diplomacy to work in such situations, both sides often have to move beyond binary notions of right and wrong, and instead focus on managing tensions, finding areas of mutual benefit, or at least mitigating damage. In international relations, the pursuit of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ is typically tempered by practical concerns like security, trade, and global standing. The challenge for diplomats lies in negotiating these grey areas, where rigid adherence to one side’s definition of right and wrong can easily lead to deadlock or conflict. This pragmatic approach underlines the need for flexibility and, at times, a willingness to accept that both sides can have valid concerns, even if they are fundamentally opposed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1YE55-lr2y1y	2024-11-02T16:59:26-07:00	
Robert Reich: Why Musk Predicts Lina Khan Will Be ‘Fired Soon’ – ...	Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and the richest man in the world, tweeted this week that Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan 'will be fired soon.' Musk is hardly the only billionaire upset by Khan’s aggressive use of antitrust law to limit the power of big corporations — and, hence, to limit the power of billionaires like Musk. Mark Cuban, the billionaire surrogate for the Harris campaign, has also said Khan must go. So have major Democratic donors like Reid Hoffman and Barry Diller. When a bipartisan group of billionaires agree that a government official who’s limiting their power must be fired, you have every reason to believe she’s doing her job. One of the biggest structural problems in the American economy is the size and power of large corporations, which have grown larger and more powerful over the last three decades. They can (and do) set or coordinate prices to keep them high. They can (and do) set or coordinate pay to keep it low. They can (and do) use their political clout to get lower taxes, public subsidies, and regulatory rollbacks. Antitrust law provides a means of reversing this trend and limiting the size and power of large corporations. Lina Khan at the FTC and Jonathan Kanter at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department are using antitrust law as it should be used. Last year alone, Biden’s regulators filed a record 50 antitrust enforcement actions; mergers reached a 10-year low. Forty years ago, I was in charge of advising the five commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission what they should do. The chairman at that time was Michael Pertschuk, who — like Khan — aggressively used the power of the FTC on behalf of consumers and workers. Also like Khan, Pertschuk was targeted by big business. He was called an enemy of capitalism. But Pertschuk’s efforts helped save capitalism from its own excesses and thereby helped maintain the legitimacy of the private sector in the public’s eyes. Of course, 40 years ago corporate America didn’t have nearly the clout it has now, the super-rich weren’t nearly as wealthy, and money didn’t play nearly as great a role in American politics. Elon Musk and Donald Trump pose the greatest threats in recent history to American capitalism. If given the authority to do what they’ve said they will do — including Trump’s giant 20 percent tariff on all goods imported into the United States, which will function as a giant regressive sales tax — Americans will not only be far worse off; they will be less inclined to support the capitalist system. Musk’s pledge to remove Khan came after he stood on stage and said he would personally oversee a $2 trillion cut to the Federal budget — a cut that would cause, in Musk’s words, 'hardship.' Musk’s personal fortune is about a tenth of the cut he says he’ll oversee. That’s enough to shield him from any hardship. But most Americans depend on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government spending that would be cut if Musk has his way. I have a better idea. If Musk is as concerned as he seems about getting the federal budget deficit under control, he should consider supporting a 25 percent tax on great wealth, starting with fortunes over $100 million.

Strengthening Ties: President Prabowo’s Diplomatic Mission To The...	A New Era for Indonesia-USA Diplomacy In November 2024, President Prabowo Subianto’s visit to the United States represents a strategic initiative to elevate Indonesia’s partnership with the world’s largest economy, to address shared economic and security challenges within the intricate geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. Given Indonesia’s increasing influence in ASEAN and its commitment to maintaining neutrality amid U.S.-China tensions, this visit occurs at a critical juncture for both nations. The outcome of the recent U.S. presidential election introduces additional complexities, as potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy may significantly influence the dynamics of Indonesia-U.S. relations. This analysis explores how Prabowo’s diplomatic engagement is strategically crafted to reinforce economic, defence, and cultural connections while navigating the imperatives of regional stability, sovereignty, and economic advancement. Political Diplomacy: Reinforcing ASEAN Centrality and Managing U.S. Engagement President Prabowo’s diplomatic agenda is aimed at reaffirming Indonesia’s dedication to ASEAN, ensuring that Southeast Asia remains a bastion of peace and neutrality amidst escalating U.S.-China rivalry. As the most influential member of ASEAN, Indonesia seeks to establish a regional order in which ASEAN plays a proactive role in negotiation processes, rather than merely serving as a battleground for power contests. Prabowo’s dialogues with U.S. leaders underscore mutual interests concerning regional stability and prosperity, particularly through the promotion of ASEAN’s diplomatic neutrality. However, the post-election political landscape in the U.S. raises potential challenges. A Republican administration may adopt a more confrontational approach towards China, thereby exerting pressure on Indonesia to align more closely with U.S. strategic interests. Conversely, a Democratic administration may prioritise a values-based foreign policy, emphasising human rights and democratic governance. This could potentially strain relations if these values conflict with Indonesia’s domestic priorities. Prabowo’s diplomatic strategy thus seeks to affirm Indonesia’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy, reinforcing its role as a mediator within ASEAN. Economic Cooperation: Enhancing Trade, Investment, and Green Technology Collaboration A fundamental aspect of Prabowo’s visit encompasses economic collaboration, as Indonesia endeavours to augment trade and attract American investment in sectors such as infrastructure, digital technology, and green energy. With its abundant natural resources, extensive market, and strategic geographical position, Indonesia presents significant opportunities for American enterprises. Prabowo aims to bolster trade relations, decrease tariffs, and facilitate direct U.S. investments, particularly in advancing Indonesia’s renewable energy capacities. With ambitious green energy objectives, Indonesia aspires to transition away from coal dependency, necessitating U.S. support to propel renewable energy initiatives and enhance technological proficiency. Supply chain resilience constitutes a pivotal area of economic discourse, particularly in light of recent global disruptions. Indonesia and the United States are anticipated to develop frameworks aimed at ensuring reliable supply chains in critical sectors, including energy, minerals, and food, which could support the sustainable development goals of Indonesia. Nonetheless, potential challenges may arise from regulatory complexities, concerns regarding environmental sustainability, and labour standards that may come under increased scrutiny from a new U.S. administration. Prabowo’s diplomatic strategy is likely to emphasise Indonesia’s reforms designed to attract responsible investment while ensuring alignment with the nation’s sovereignty and economic imperatives. Cultural and Public Diplomacy: Fostering Mutual Understanding and Educational Partnerships Acknowledging the long-term benefits of people-to-people connections, Prabowo’s cultural agenda encompasses diplomatic initiatives aimed at fostering mutual understanding. Programs featuring cultural exchanges, tourism promotion, and heritage events aspire to enhance American public appreciation for Indonesia’s rich cultural heritage and dynamic economy. Furthermore, Indonesia seeks to expand educational exchanges with U.S. institutions through the provision of scholarships, vocational training, and collaborative research opportunities in diverse fields, including environmental science, STEM, and social sciences. These initiatives not only contribute to enhancing Indonesia’s global image but also establish a foundation for future collaboration across various sectors, ranging from academia to technology. However, visa policies and funding limitations in the United States may potentially impede educational exchanges, while disparities in cultural diplomacy priorities could emerge, contingent upon the international engagement stance of the U.S. administration. Prabowo aims to secure enduring partnerships that transcend political cycles, consequently fostering a resilient Indonesia-U.S. relationship rooted in shared cultural and educational values. Defence and Security: Strengthening Regional Stability through Maritime and Cybersecurity Cooperation Amid rising regional tensions, Prabowo's visit underscores the importance of defence and security cooperation, particularly about maritime security and the South China Sea. As Southeast Asia's waters become a focal point of U.S.-China competition, Prabowo seeks U.S. support for Indonesia's defensive efforts, which include joint maritime exercises, intelligence sharing, and technology transfers. These initiatives aim to secure regional waters while affirming Indonesia's territorial sovereignty, a critical concern given China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. In the realm of cybersecurity, Indonesia aims to enhance collaboration with the United States, particularly in light of the increasing threat of cyberattacks across the region. Joint cybersecurity training, intelligence-sharing mechanisms, and technological support are essential for strengthening Indonesia's digital defences. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing defence cooperation without compromising Indonesia's neutrality. An enhanced U.S. defence presence could be perceived as a shift in Indonesia's traditionally non-aligned stance, potentially escalating regional tensions. Global Issues: Navigating Complex International Dynamics Prabowo's visit highlights Indonesia's commitment to engaging with pressing global issues while maintaining a balanced foreign policy approach. As Indonesia seeks to bolster its role in Southeast Asia, Prabowo aims to promote collaboration with the United States on shared priorities, including supply chain resilience, economic stability, and regional peace. This objective aligns with ASEAN's vision of preserving a neutral and stable region amid evolving global dynamics. Indonesia's diplomatic stance is expected to emphasise solutions that respect national sovereignty and encourage dialogue, reflecting ASEAN's commitment to consensus-building in addressing international challenges. Prabowo's approach signals Indonesia's intent to enhance its global influence, fostering relationships that support growth and stability while circumventing direct alignment with any particular major power. This balanced strategy reinforces Indonesia's dedication to ASEAN's central role in promoting a cohesive and adaptable Southeast Asia within a complex international landscape. Challenges and Conclusion President Prabowo’s visit to the United States emphasises Indonesia’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations amid the complexities of a shifting global landscape. This diplomatic initiative seeks to expand economic cooperation in technology and sustainable development, foster deeper collaboration in maritime and cybersecurity domains, and reaffirm ASEAN’s central role in maintaining regional stability. However, several challenges may affect the partnership. Indonesia could face pressure from the United States to adopt a more assertive stance toward China, which may potentially strain its neutral foreign policy approach. Additionally, divergences in trade policies, regulatory frameworks, and strategic priorities may present obstacles, particularly if future U.S. policies diverge from Indonesia’s economic and diplomatic goals. Prabowo's approach highlights the importance of establishing a stable, reciprocal partnership that respects Indonesia’s sovereignty and enhances its influence within Southeast Asia, striving to align mutual interests in a manner that safeguards Indonesia’s strategic autonomy.

Impact Of US Presidential Election On South Asia – Analysis	Continuity rather than change is foreseen In the post-World War II era, relations between the US and South Asian countries have been both close and growing, as the US had replaced Britain as the dominant power in Asia. Therefore, an American Presidential election is of critical importance to Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and the Maldives. Their preferences for the next US President may be different but none of them has an option other than to engage with the US irrespective of who tenants the White House. As for US policy, experts say, it will be one of 'continuity' whether it is Donald Trump or Kamala Harris who wins. India India is the pivot of US policy on South Asia. Washington will therefore look towards further defence tie ups with India and working with it to counter China in the field of maritime security, says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute. He told the Turkish news agency, Anadolu that in the US, there is a strong bipartisan support for close ties with India. Therefore, whether it is a Trump or a Harris Administration, there will be continuity. The US has differences with India over Russia and China, but still they will work together, Kugelman adds. Of course, right now, India-US relations are at a low ebb. To India's discomfiture, the US joined Canada in charging that its intelligence agency was plotting to kill Indian dissidents in North America. The US said that an American Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, had been a target of India-handled assassins. The Pannun case is in court and an Indian agent allegedly involved in the plot was extradited from the Czech Republic and brought to the US for trial. The US and Canada went to the extent of naming Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and the National Security Advisor of India Ajit Doval as persons behind the alleged assassination plots. India stoutly denied involvement. It is now in talks with the US at the National Security Advisors' level to find a way out. Kugelman said both Harris and Trump could pressure New Delhi on this issue. 'They would not let it go. They would pressure India to carry out an investigation,' he said. Though India and US are strategic partners vis-à-vis China, they have divergent interests. India is now seeking a détente with China on the border issue and also more Chinese investments. This worries the US. While Trump has been supportive of commercial ties, he has long been unhappy about India's tariff policies. However, India and the US have too much at stake in the relations to allow ties to be hampered. The arms trade between India and the US has touched USD 25 billion. In 2023, US investments in India were valued at approximately USD 49.6 billion and Indian investment in the US amounted to USD 4.6 billion. Pakistan No matter who will be in charge of the White House, Pakistan would not be a priority,' says Kamran Yousaf in Express Tribune. Trump had let down Pakistan by walking out of Afghanistan leaving behind two million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. He also accused Pakistan of playing a double game in Afghanistan, taking American aid on the one hand, and clandestinely supporting the Taliban on the other. However, both Trump and Biden had allowed Pakistan to develop ties with China and build the strategic China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Bangladesh President Joe Biden put US-Bangladesh relations on an even keel after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina who had clashed with the US on human rights and over Hasina's refusal to join the anti-China QUAD. The student movement, which ousted Hasina, had the backing of the US. The present Chief Advisor to the interim government Prof. Muhammad Yunus is sad to be the joint choice of the US, the agitating students and civil society. The US has been a strong supporter of civil liberties in Bangladesh, even sanctioning some of the top men in Hasina's brutal security establishment. Human rights cements ties between the Yunus regime and Washington. While it is clear that Kamala Harris will follow Biden's footsteps vis-à-vis Bangladesh, Trump has taken a pro-Hasina stand with an eye on the influential Indian-American constituency in the US. But this could well be an election gimmick. Greeting American Hindus on Deepavali day, Trump said on X: ' I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos. It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America.' 'Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi.' It is not clear if Trump will actually be hostile to Bangladesh as President. He could well have made the pro-Modi or pro-Hindu noises to get the Hindu-dominated Indian American vote. Given the presence of US protégé Muhammad Yunus at the helm in Dhaka, Trump is most likely to strengthen US ties with Bangladesh. Afghanistan The Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would probably like to have Trump as President. As US President, as it was Trump who planned to pull out US troops from Afghanistan. The successor Biden Administration also enforced the decision. Perhaps Afghanistan would be happy even with Kamala Harris as President. Sri Lanka As for Sri Lanka, relations with the US are unlikely to be different from the past. Though the newly elected National Peoples' Power (NPP) government is radical leftist in theory, it has indicated that it can play ball with capitalism and the US-led West. The Anura Kumara Dissanayake government in Colombo has also not said or done anything which would suggest a pro-China tilt. However, the US has a deep interest in drafting Sri Lanka into its anti-China QUAD maritime security architecture, a prospect Sri Lankan governments have dreaded. No Sri Lankan government has wanted its island home to be a battle ground for regional or world powers. Nevertheless, the US, whether under Trump or Harris, will press Sri Lanka to sign agreements on defence and security cooperation even those Sri Lanka had traditionally baulked at. The US will raise human and minority rights, irrespective of the occupant of the Wight House. Nepal Nepal is ruled by a coalition between the pro-China Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and the pro-India Nepali Congress party. China was the first country to react to the formation of the coalition in Kathmandu. Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha visited Beijing where he held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Nepal and China signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework agreement in May 2017, but Nepal has been expressing serious reservations about the text, saying that it is not interested in commercial loans from China but wants only investments. Talks over the BRI projects and an implementation plan remain suspended. Tension with India continued. In May this year, Nepal announced the printing of a new Nepali 100 rupee note displaying a map showing Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani as parts of Nepal when India claimed those areas. While there is an uneasy relationship with New Delhi, the coalition government in Kathmandu has not talked about its relationship with the US. Nepal has always welcomed Western investment and had signed up for the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) pact. Maldives Little change is expected in US-Maldives relations as the Mohamed Muizzu government has completely given up its pro-China and anti-Indian character and is now heavily dependent on India financially. China has abandoned the Maldives for reasons not very clear. Since Maldives is in the care of strategic partner India, the US has little to worry about.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Xku3DGK1llN	2024-11-02T16:55:27-07:00	
Ukraine’s Positions Deteriorate Across Front Lines; Russian Milit...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukrainian Drones Strike Chechnya On October 29 Ukrainian combat drones attacked the Russian Special Forces University in the Russian Republic of Chechnya. The university, founded in 2013 and named after Russian President Vladimir Putin, is a private center for modern warfare training. The institution has close ties with current and retired members of Russia’s National Guard (Rosgvardiya). Most of its instructors hail from the ranks of the Rosgvardiya or from the Alpha counterterrorism unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). Pro-Putin Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov’s militia, dubbed the Kadyrovites, also has strong ties to the university. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the institution has trained so-called volunteers before they are sent to the front lines. Kadyrov does not hide the fact that tens of thousands of fighters received training at the university before being sent to occupied Ukraine. Worse, Ukrainian sources report that Russian forces have sent children abducted from occupied parts of Ukraine to the university, where the abductees are trained to serve as child soldiers against their own country. As Kadyrov, Putin’s loyal ally, doubles down on his forces’ involvement in Russia’s war, Ukraine will likely continue to target Chechnya under the pro-Russian rule, while anti-Kremlin Chechen forces continue to operate alongside Ukrainian combat formations. 2. North Korean Troops Move Closer to the Ukrainian Front According to the United States Department of Defense, North Korean troops have moved to the front lines in Ukraine to prepare to enter combat operations there within weeks. Mark Rutte, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), seconded the Pentagon’s assessment, claiming that Pyongyang has already fielded military formations to fight the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Russian region of Kursk. The White House also confirmed that since mid-October, North Korea has dispatched at least 3,000 servicemen to fight the Kremlin’s war. These troops traveled by sea from Wonsan, North Korea, to Vladivostok, and then dispersed to different training bases in eastern Russia. Additionally, South Korean sources have reported that a 10,000-strong contingent of troops is preparing to serve in Russia later this year. The Kremlin will reportedly pay $2,000 to each North Korean serviceman taking part in combat operations, revenue that will undoubtedly fill the coffers of a Kim Jong Un dictatorship that considers its soldiers to be lucrative export items. Additionally, Pyongyang’s 11th Corps special forces unit, also known as the Storm Corps, has reportedly forward-deployed troops to Ukraine. Available writings suggest that while the North Korean military’s conventional formations are often poorly equipped, the country’s special forces are highly motivated and well-trained. Formerly known as the Light Infantry Training Guidance Bureau, the Storm Corps specializes in unconventional warfare, infiltrations, and sabotage. Official reports have concluded that, of North Korea’s 200,000 special forces personnel, around 60,000 fall under the command of the Storm Corps. This will enable Pyongyang to easily rotate combat formations and supply reinforcements to the highly attritional battleground in Ukraine. 3. Battlefield Assessment Ukraine’s positions continue to deteriorate across the front lines. Russia has secured substantial territory throughout October. The Russian military has also committed a mounting number of war crimes, including executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Pinned down on multiple fronts, Ukraine is gearing up to mobilize tens of thousands of citizens to improve the unfavorable force-to-terrain and force-on-force ratios it currently faces. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Ukraine’s positions in Kupiansk, Pokrovsk, and Kurakhove remain tenuous. In Kharkiv Oblast, the Russian military has kept up its push for Vovchansk. Clashes are also unfolding for Toretsk, and Ukrainian defensive combat operations have managed to hold the line in Siversk. In Chasiv Yar, the Russian offensive gained more territory and reached the canal on the southern edge of the town. Around the city of Selydove, the Russian military is progressing further into Ukrainian territory. And across the country, including in Kyiv, Russia’s heightened use of Iranian Shahed drones poses a significant threat to Ukrainian troops and civilians. In Kursk, Ukraine faces additional challenges in its efforts to hold Russian territory. With Pyongyang’s forces likely to enter the fray, Kyiv’s need for permission to use Western long-range weapons inside Russia grows even stronger. Weapons like the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) could hit North Korean combat formations at their assembly sites elsewhere in Russia before they are able to affect the tactical situation in Kursk.

China Honors Late General Linked To Cultural Revolution Cannibali...	By Yitong Wu and Kit Sung The ruling Chinese Communist Party has enshrined the ashes of a general who presided over a Cultural Revolution massacre that included cannibalism of those deemed 'enemies of the people' by late supreme leader Mao Zedong. On Oct. 24, officials reburied the ashes of People’s Liberation Army founding general and former Guangxi regional party chief Wei Guoqing – 35 years after his death. The full-honors burial ceremony at Beijing’s Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery – the resting place of China’s high-ranking leaders and revolutionary heroes – was attended by high-ranking guests, including the descendants of late revolutionary leaders Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. The news prompted outrage and satire on Chinese-language social media, with comments highlighting Wei’s role in the Guangxi Massacre in which members of factional gangs killed an estimated 100,000-150,000 people through beheadings, beatings, burial alive, stoning, drowning, boiling and disembowelment, according to historical research. Wei’s name is most strongly linked in the public mind with cannibalism during the massacre period in Guangxi’s Wuxuan and Wuming counties and Nanning city, after the victims were targeted as 'enemies of the people' amid the factional violence of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. Public records cited in The New York Times in 1993 and by Radio France International in 2016 showed that at least 137 people were eaten, with thousands participating. Chinese-language comments on this week’s news story on X, which is blocked in China but still accessed by some using circumvention tools, were darkly scathing about the move. 'So the Chinese Communist Party’s running-dog butcher is now a hero for killing people,' commented @ueinhu, while @sebonesama quipped: 'Babaoshan is already packed full of demons and monsters – there’s always room for one more.' Other jibes seemed to echo those made about the fictional killer Hannibal Lecter, with one user posting a meme of Wei faced with piles of deep-fried meat and a KFC logo in the background. 'Paying tribute to a legendary gourmet,' commented @WaterMargin_10, while @akira38458278 wondered if the move was to prevent the people of Guangxi from 'digging him up and eating him' and @DingeX22503 concluded: 'Only those who are ruthless enough get to be a hero in China.' Hands ‘covered in blood’ Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Technology in Sydney, said Wei’s burial is politically symbolic, as it underscores Xi Jinping’s status as the heir of late supreme leader Mao Zedong, and is a tacit endorsement of the political 'struggle' tactics used by his predecessor. 'Wei Guoqing was an executioner whose hands were covered in blood,' Feng told RFA Cantonese in a recent interview. 'By giving him the honor of entering Babaoshan, Xi Jinping is endorsing the persecution mania of the Cultural Revolution, which reflects his own totalitarian resurgence.' 'It indicates that Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong have the same authoritarian nature,' Feng said. Yang Haiying, a professor at Japan’s Shizuoka University who has researched Cultural Revolution violence against the ethnic Mongolian population, said the burial of Wei’s remains seemed to indicate Xi’s unwillingness to distance himself from that era of China’s recent history. 'When Wei Guoqing was in Guangxi, his people killed and ate people, and yet he gets to be in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery,' Yang said. 'The Chinese Communist Party has never condemned the Cultural Revolution ... just paused it temporarily.' 'Xi Jinping is now restarting it; we’re right in the middle of it now,' he said. Yang said there was a leader similar to Wei in Inner Mongolia, who presided over massacres of tens of thousands of ethnic Mongolians during the Cultural Revolution, but that the authorities had refused to criticize his actions in public. 'The Chinese Communist Party is a violent regime, and all its talk of revolution just means violence,' he said. 'So it will only reward its most violent followers.' Wei Guoqing died of illness on June 14, 1989, 10 days after the Tiananmen massacre put an end to weeks of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square. His ashes were placed in storage at the Babaoshan Columbarium until the Oct. 24 burial ceremony.

Taiwan Expects Ukraine-Tested Weapons From US Amid Rising Chinese...	By William Yang Taiwan is expected to receive several weapons that have been battle tested in Ukraine from the United States over the next few years. Analysts say those weapons can help bolster Taiwan’s defense and strike capabilities amid growing military pressure from China. In the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan, worth about $2 billion, the United States plans to deliver three medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, also known as NASAMS. The weapons include advanced AMRAAM Extended Range surface-to-air missiles. The proposed sales will help improve Taiwan’s security and 'assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement released October 26. NASAMS has been battle-tested in Ukraine and is viewed by experts as a significant elevation of Taiwan’s air defense capabilities. Australia and Indonesia are the other countries in the Indo-Pacific region that have received the system from the U.S. Experts say that NASAMS has a high interoperation capability, and that the medium-range air defense system provides needed coverage in Taiwan’s existing air defense capabilities. 'Currently, Taiwan relies on Stinger missiles for short-range air defense while using the Patriot missile system or Taiwan’s indigenous Tien Kung for long-range air defense, so NASAMS can help fill the gap of Taiwan’s medium-range air defense,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA by phone that when NASAMS is incorporated into Taiwan’s air defense system, it can improve the island’s capabilities to deal with the increasingly frequent patrols the Chinese military is conducting around Taiwan. 'As Chinese naval vessels and military aircraft increase the frequency of their combat-readiness patrols near Taiwan, the risk of abrupt missile attacks launched by Chinese vessels is also increasing, so acquiring NASAMS can further enhance Taiwan’s capabilities to deal with these potential threats,' Su said. In addition to the surface-to-air missile system, Taiwan’s National Defense Ministry said the island is expected to receive 29 sets of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, from the United States between the end of 2024 and 2026. The rocket system has been credited with helping Ukraine destroy Russian weapons or equipment in the ongoing conflict. Apart from receiving HIMARS from Washington, at least 17 Taiwanese soldiers were trained to use the rocket system at a military base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, this past August. After a post on the military base’s official Facebook page showed Taiwanese soldiers participating in HIMARS training with counterparts from Romania and Estonia, which has since been removed, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Friday that Taiwan had planned to send at least 30 soldiers to receive HIMARS training in the U.S. between February and October this year. Since Ukraine has used HIMARS to strike Russian military bases and weaken the Russian military’s momentum, some Taiwanese experts say the systems potentially can be used to target Chinese military facilities in coastal areas. 'The Taiwanese military can use HIMARS to hit some Chinese military facilities along the southeastern coast or target invading troops in different parts of Taiwan,' said Chieh Chung, a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight in Taiwan. Overall, Chieh told VOA by phone, the acquisition of NASAMS and HIMARS can enhance Taiwan’s capabilities in conducting network-centric warfare and deter China from easily launching an attack against Taiwan. Other analysts say the series of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan reflects Washington’s commitment to supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, but China will interpret the latest developments as a provocation from Taiwan and the U.S. 'Beijing will interpret this as changing the status quo [across the Taiwan Strait] nevertheless,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA in a written response. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and repeatedly has vowed to reunify with the island, by force, if necessary. In response to the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan last week, Beijing condemned it and urged Washington to stop what it called dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China showcases its naval capability The arms sales and training come as China’s two aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, conducted a dual formation exercise for the first time in the disputed South China Sea from late September to October. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping told the state-run China Dailynewspaper that the exercise will allow the two Chinese aircraft carriers to 'integrate and magnify the power' and 'enable the fleet to better organize strikes and handle threats from air and sea.' Chieh in Taiwan said China is showing the U.S. it could assert maritime claims in disputed waters in the Indo-Pacific region at a time when U.S. aircraft carriers are deployed to the Middle East. 'Since the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has forced the U.S. to deploy its aircraft carrier groups to the region, China is trying to remind Washington that it can impose control over certain parts of the Indo-Pacific region amid an American absence,' he said. Nagy in Japan said that while China can demonstrate its capability to operate aerial and naval assets near areas of potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region — such as the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait — such a formation also exposes the Chinese aircraft carriers as obvious targets for more experienced fighting forces. 'Losing one or two of China’s few aircraft carriers would have a very serious reputational cost for the Chinese Communist Party, and the U.S. and its partners understand this, so they are preparing for their scenarios,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1VpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-02T16:49:36-07:00	
European Commission Highlights Georgia’s ‘Backsliding’	By Irakli Machaidze (Eurasianet) -- As the dispute over Georgia’s parliamentary voting results plays out, an annual report issued by the European Commission is effectively writing off Tbilisi’s chances of joining the EU any time soon. The report states that the incumbent Georgian Dream’s policies run 'counter to the values and principles' of the EU. EU officials and international observers have cited widespread irregularities connected with the October 26 parliamentary elections. Some in Brussels have called for a thorough investigation but have thus far refrained from saying the outcome was rigged. Official results show Georgian Dream winning 54 percent of the vote and gaining 89 of the 150 seats in the legislature. The EU Commission report on Georgia’s EU accession progress, issued October 30, was far less equivocal on Georgian Dream’s overall performance. The general message conveyed in the report is that Georgian Dream is taking the country in the wrong direction. 'Due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government, EU leaders stopped Georgia’s accession process. It remains on hold as long as Georgia continues to move away from the EU,' the EU’s ambassador to Georgia, Pawel Herczynski, said at an October 30 news conference in Tbilisi to outline the report’s findings. After granting Georgia EU candidacy status in 2023, Brusselsconditioned the opening of accession talks on the Georgian government’s implementation of reforms. Georgian Dream has made halting progress in several spheres, including aligning economic frameworks with EU standards. But the report notes 'backsliding' in key areas, including the judiciary, fundamental rights and foreign policy. Georgian Dream’s adoption of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, more commonly known as the ‘foreign agents’ law, 'impacts freedom of expression and the ability of the media to operate freely,' according to the report. The commission also states that Tbilisi has made 'no progress' over the past year in harmonizing its foreign, security and defense policy with Brussels, especially in the area of sanctions implementation against Russia, Belarus and Iran. The report notes that Georgia is now experiencing 'extreme polarization,' while blaming Georgian Dream for creating an 'increasingly hostile environment' for those who question government policies. Another area of particular concern outlined in the report was gender and minority rights. It stressed that the legal definition of rape in Georgia does not conform with EU standards. 'Gaps in prevention and response to gender-based violence remain,' the report says. It also states members of Georgia’s LGBTQ community are living in a 'hostile and stigmatizing atmosphere' that is a direct outcome of 'legislative activities and the continued prevalence of homophobic hate speech.' Regarding the just-concluded elections in Georgia, the Commission report echoes the preliminary findings of international election monitors, saying that a variety of factors, including recent amendments to the election code and the use of intimidation to influence voters, 'negatively impacted public trust in the process.' The commission’s negative assessment of Georgia is brought into sharper focus by its praise for Moldova’s and Ukraine’s progress towards accession. A statement on the adoption of the EU’s 2024 Enlargement Package notes accession talks with Moldova and Ukraine opened in June, signaling Brussels’ 'important recognition' of both countries’ 'determination to pursue reforms.' 'This year, Georgia has gone backwards while other candidate countries have advanced,' said Herczynski, the EU envoy. 'Georgia’s next government should reverse course, recommit to democratic principles and values if it wants to bring the country closer to the EU.' Irakli Machaidze is a Eurasianet editorial fellow in New York.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1UAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-02T16:47:57-07:00	
Indonesia: Five Unexpected Things Prabowo Did In His First Week A...	By Shailaja Neelakantan When Prabowo Subianto was sworn in as president of Indonesia on Oct. 20, he was coming off of five years serving as defense minister – a performance that earned mixed reviews. How would the former general fare as president, observers wondered, especially after he had unveiled a whopping cabinet of 109 ministers and deputy ministers, carving out two or three ministries from one to accommodate positions for alliance partners. But if anyone had expected a sedate start to the new Prabowo presidency, on account of new ministers in his large cabinet finding their feet, they were mistaken. During his first week in office, Prabowo and his ministers had a packed program and took actions that surprised observers, either in and of themselves or by their timing. Here are five such things that happened during the opening week of the Prabowo presidency: 1 - Did an about-face in Indonesia seeking BRICS membership: Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Prabowo’s predecessor, had been hesitant about the prospect of BRICS membership, saying last year he wanted to study and calculate the pros and cons, and that joining the bloc was not urgent. However, during his first official trip abroad, new Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono conveyed the opposite while attending a summit of the economic grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. 'Indonesia joining BRICS is a manifestation of its independent-active foreign policy,' said Sugiono, who goes by one name, Reuters reported. 'That does not mean we join a certain bloc, but we actively participate in every forum.' Jokowi might have been wary that joining could be seen as Jakarta tilting towards Beijing, wrote Klaus Heinrich Raditio, at the Driyarkara School of Philosophy in Jakarta, in an analysis for The Lowy Institute. 'But Prabowo does not carry that burden. ...[Indonesia's] main aim is primarily in seeking development opportunities, rather than endorsing Russia’s or China’s views on the world order,' said the analysis. 2 - Announced construction deadlines for new capital: Prabowo announced initiatives related to Nusantara (IKN), the proposed new capital on Borneo island, within seven days of being sworn in, a move that would have surprised many observers who didn't expect much new direction in the project, or certainly not so soon. Many had believed the new president was not interested in continuing with Jokowi’s pricey legacy project, because his own priority program to provide free school-lunches was wildly expensive (U.S. $53 million a day). But Prabowo 'emphasized that the IKN issue is actually very clear,' Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni said on X last week. 'It has been decided that [IKN] will be continued and completed. There is no need for any more questions about it actually,' Raja wrote, referring to a speech Prabowo made to his cabinet at a retreat in Central Java. 'For him, the IKN is the ‘political capital.’ Therefore, in addition to the executive buildings (which are now almost finished), in the next four years the [Nusantara Capital City Authority] must complete buildings for the legislature and judiciary,' Raja wrote, citing Prabowo's directions. 3 - Retained previous government’s finance minister: Until around a week before he was sworn in, few believed Prabowo would name as Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, with whom he had several run-ins on the nature of his defense procurements, and other issues, when they were both in Jokowi's cabinet. Mulyani’s reappointment, though, would reassure investors and markets, wrote editors of East Asia Forum, an online publication of the Australian National University, in an analysis of Prabowo’s cabinet. 'With financial markets wary of Prabowo’s instincts towards government largesse, her presence in the cabinet will ensure strong oversight of public finances,' they added. 4-Signaled assertiveness on South China Sea to Beijing: The new Prabowo administration also quickly displayed some feistiness toward China during is first week. Indonesian ships chased away from Jakarta's exclusive economic zone in the North Natuna Sea a Chinese coast guard vessel on three occasions. The Indonesian coast guard (Bakamla) said it was repelling the Chinese ship that was 'disrupting' Jakarta's oil and gas survey activities. 'Bakamla’s expulsion of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel from the North Natuna Sea’s continental shelf is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguarding our maritime domain,' the Indonesian coast guard said in a statement. 5 - Showcased his army roots with military-style retreat for cabinet: Prabowo, a former general in the Indonesian army’s special forces (Kopassus), raised eyebrows when he transported his entire cabinet to a retreat at a military academy. The 104 men and five women in his cabinet donned camouflage uniforms and combat boots as they took part in drills intended to build team unity and discipline, participants said. 'I struggle a bit with waking up early since my usual routine involves going to bed at 2 a.m. and waking up at 5 a.m. for morning prayers, then catching some more sleep until 7. But here, that’s not possible,' Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said. 'We go to bed at 2 a.m. and have to wake up at 4 a.m. It’s a good challenge because it forces us to maintain discipline, and we must be prepared to fulfill our duties, even if we only get 1-2 hours of sleep.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1TSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-02T16:46:47-07:00	
Bishop Defends St. Michael’s Prayer At Mass: ‘The Devil Has No In...	By Jonah McKeown Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, this week responded to a letter in the Wall Street Journal from a priest objecting to the praying of the St. Michael prayer at the end of Mass, asserting that the priest’s view is 'simply wrong.' In a letter to the editor published Oct. 21, Father Gerald J. Bednar, a retired priest of the Diocese of Cleveland, wrote that the Vatican 'suppressed this practice in 1964 because the prayer interferes with the integrity of the Mass.' Bednar proffered his view that praying the St. Michael prayer after Mass 'ends the liturgy with a private devotion, a petition to a saint, while all of the petitions were concluded much earlier in the liturgy and addressed to God the Father.' 'The end of Mass sends participants out on a positive mission, bidding them to expand God’s kingdom through evangelization,' Bednar wrote. 'St. Michael is known as the captain of the guardian angels and we should, by all means, ask for his help. But believers should accept the Lord’s presence in the Eucharist as their primary protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil — and respond to his call to enhance God’s kingdom, where the devil has no influence,' the priest concluded. In a response letter published Oct. 27, Paprocki disputed Bednar’s assertion that praying to St. Michael after Mass 'ends the liturgy with a private devotion.' 'The liturgy ends when the celebrant says, ‘Go forth, the Mass is ended,’ and the people reply, ‘Thanks be to God.’ The prayer, then, is recited after Mass, which the priest and people are free to do. It isn’t a private devotion when prayed publicly,' Paprocki wrote. 'The end of Mass sends participants out on a positive mission, and while Rev. Bednar is correct in saying that the devil has no influence in God’s kingdom, we aren’t there yet. Doing so together doesn’t hurt, and we pray it will help to invoke the intercession of St. Michael to defend us in our spiritual battles.' St. Michael the Archangel is one of the four principal angels and is described in the Bible as a 'great prince' who battles against Satan in defense of God’s people. Following an 1884 vision of Satan 'running riot' on the planet, Pope Leo XIII composed three prayers to St. Michael, the briefest of which he commanded should be prayed at the end of every Mass. That prayer is as follows: St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; may God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the divine power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. The prayer to St. Michael was a regular feature of the Mass until the Vatican II era, though Pope John Paul II in 1994 urged Catholics to make the prayer a regular part of their lives. Devotion to St. Michael is still widely promoted today, including by Pope Francis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1aL4tGz8p_DK	2024-11-02T16:44:19-07:00	
Does Russia Want To Increase Tension In BRICS? – OpEd	Just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China announced to much fanfare a 'no limits friendship' with Russia, suggesting a future of close collaboration in trade, energy and, perhaps most importantly, security. Now, more than two years into the war, the meaning and interpretation of this 'no-limits' commitment has evolved. There has been much debate in Chinese society in recent months about Beijing’s alignment with Moscow. While some have advocated for a more formal alliance with Russia, others have taken a more cautious stance. In sharp contrast to 2022, China’s growing wariness is increasingly being discussed in the open, even among those who were previously censored. In early 2022, for instance, a joint letter by a group Chinese experts opposing Russia’s invasion was censored by the government. The scholars were also warned. Now, however, it appears the government is seeking to balance its relationships with both Russia and the West. Beijing may not want to be seen as a 'decisive enabler' of the war. For example, the once-prominent 'no-limits' friendship language quietly vanished from a Sino-Russian joint statement. And Beijing’s response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visits that month was notably subdued. Putin ingratiated himself with Xi, saying they were 'as close as brothers'. Xi’s response was more perfunctory – he called Putin a 'good friend and a good neighbor'. Scholars are also articulating their concerns about China’s political and economic investments in Russia, both publicly and privately. Shen Dingli, a leading scholar of Chinese security strategy at Fudan University in Shanghai, said China doesn’t want to be seen as collaborating with Russia against Ukraine or any other country. He also quoted Fu Cong, China’s former ambassador to the European Union, who said last year the 'no-limits' [friendship] is 'nothing but rhetoric'. And in August, after Putin referred to China as an 'ally' during a visit to far-eastern Russia, Chinese scholars promptly sought to clarify this statement to prevent any misunderstanding China wants a formal alliance with Russia. These statements carry weight. In many respects, leading Chinese scholars at the government-affiliated universities act as propagandists to convey and justify the government’s stance on issues. As a result, subtle shifts in their commentary provide insights into the strategic mindset in Beijing. WHY CHINA IS RETHINKING ITS ‘NO-LIMITS’ FRIENDSHIP? There are three elements driving this re-evaluation of the Russia-China alignment. First, there is growing skepticism of Russia’s state capacities. The mutiny by the Wagner Group last year and Ukraine’s recent incursion into Russia’s Kursk region have prompted critical reassessments in Beijing of Russia’s political stability and military preparedness, as well as the growing anti-war sentiment in Russia. As Feng Yujun, director of Fudan University’s Russia and Central Asia Study Centre, argued, the Wagner rebellion was a reflection of Russia’s internal conflicts and domestic security challenges. He noted every time Russia has faced both internal and external crises in history, its regimes have become less stable. More recently, Feng has been even bolder, predicting a Russian defeat in Ukraine. He argued China should keep its distance from Moscow and resume a policy of 'non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-partisanship'. Second, China’s sluggish economy and its underwhelming trade with Russia have further exposed how dependent both countries are on the West. The relationship heavily favors Beijing. Russia accounts for only 4% of China’s trade, while China accounts for nearly 22% of Russia’s trade. Many Chinese experts are now warning against an over-dependence on Russia, instead calling for more cooperation with neighboring countries. This echoes a recent concern Russia has been using its natural resources as a bargaining chip to extract greater benefits from China. RUSSIA’S VALUE AS A MILITARY ALLY Finally, there are rising Chinese concerns its international outlook does not align with Russia’s. Zhao Long, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of International Relations, says there is an important difference in how they view the world: Russia wants to destroy the current international system to build a new one. China wants to transform the current system by taking a more prominent place in it. Shi Yinhong, a strategist at Renmin University in Beijing, has highlighted an unbridgeable gap preventing a stronger China-Russia alliance. He says there’s a deep mutual distrust on regional security. Russia has never promised support for China in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, just as China has avoided involvement in the war in Ukraine. As Russia’s war in Ukraine reaches a stalemate, its value as a military ally is increasingly being questioned in China. Recently, Feng Yujun warned China risks being led by the nose by Russia, despite being the stronger economic partner. He says every time China has attempted an alliance with Russia in history, it has had negative consequences for China. Consequently, it is crucial for China to maintain its long-term partnership with Russia without undermining its constructive relationship with the West. Russia has arguably benefited from the current competition between the US and China, as it has sought to exploit the rivalry for its own benefit. But this has also led to uncertainty in the China-Russia relationship. As another analyst argues, relying too heavily on Russia will leave China isolated and vulnerable. And this is not a position China wants to be in. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER’S VISIT FOR SHANGAI COOPERATION SUMMIT IN PAKISTAN Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar travelled to Islamabad for a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, while Canada accuses six Indian diplomats of involvement in threats and attacks against Sikh separatists, and Bangladesh’s foreign secretary visits Washington. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar traveled to Islamabad for a high-level Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit—marking the first time an Indian foreign minister has traveled to Pakistan since 2015 and the first time any Indian minister has visited the country since Defense Minister Rajnath Singh since 2016. During his roughly 24-hour visit Jaishankar participated in meeting and other activities with Pakistani officials present, but there were no bilateral engagements. JAYASHANKAR VISIT SIGNALS INDIAN COMMITMENT TO SCO That is no surprise: Jaishankar’s trip was intended to signal India’s commitment to the SCO, not to strengthen ties with Islamabad. Prior to his trip, Jaishankar said he wouldn’t do any one-on-one meetings with Pakistani officials. The visit comes a month and a half after he declared that the 'era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan' was over. New Delhi’s position is firm: Until Islamabad deals with terrorist groups on its soil that threaten India, there can be no talks. India has doubled down on this stance since January 2016, when militants attacked an Indian Air Force base days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to Pakistan—the last time an Indian minister traveled to Pakistan solely for bilateral reasons. That Jaishankar visited Pakistan despite these tensions reflects the importance that India attaches to the SCO. New Delhi values its membership in several monoliteral groupings—including the SCO, BRICS, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, among others. They enable India to amplify its support for multipolarity and reflect its strategic autonomy. The SCO is especially important for India because its membership and focus emphasize Central Asia—a region where New Delhi is keen to ramp up ties but faces an inherent constraint with its outreach. India lacks direct land access to Central Asia because Pakistan—itself looking to expand ties there—denies it transit trade rights. This elevates the importance of any opportunity for Indian high-level engagement with the region. In recent years, Modi has convened dialogues with Central Asian leaders to signal India’s commitment to partnership—and New Delhi sent Jaishankar to Islamabad to amplify that message. However, Jaishankar’s visit does show a degree of stabilization in India-Pakistan bilateral ties. The relationship plunged to a new low in 2019 following another terrorist attack in India carried out by Pakistan-sponsored militants, a brief military crisis, and New Delhi’s decision to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its autonomy. But in 2021, India and Pakistan signed a new truce along their disputed border, easing tensions. CONCLUSION Today, China’s productivity is nearly double that of India. While 45% of Indian workers are still in the highly unproductive agriculture sector, China has graduated even from simple, labor-intensive manufacturing to emerge, for example, as a dominant force in global car markets, especially in electric vehicles. China is also better prepared for future opportunities. Seven Chinese universities are ranked among the world’s top 100, with Tsinghua and Peking among the top 20. Tsinghua is considered the world’s leading university for computer science, while Peking is ranked ninth. Likewise, nine Chinese universities are among the top 50 globally in mathematics. By contrast, no Indian university, including the celebrated Indian Institutes of Technology, is ranked among the world’s top 100. Chinese scientists have made significant strides in boosting the quantity and quality of their research, particularly in fields such as chemistry, engineering, and materials science, and could soon take the lead in artificial intelligence. As the figure shows, Chinese researchers, both in academia and industry, are rapidly generating high-quality patents. Since the mid-1980s, Indian and international observers have predicted that the authoritarian Chinese hare would eventually falter, and the democratic Indian tortoise would win the race. Recent events – China’s harsh zero-COVID restrictions, rising youth unemployment, and the adverse repercussions of the Chinese authorities’ ham-handed efforts to rein in the country’s overgrown real-estate sector and large tech companies – seem to support this view. But while China, with its deep well of human capital and greater gender equality, stands poised at the frontiers of both the old and the new economies, Indian leaders and their international counterparts tout an ahistorical ability to leapfrog over a fragile human foundation with shiny digital and physical infrastructure. China has a plausible path through its current muddle. India, by contrast, risks falling into blind alleys of unfounded optimism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1YgSnOpXlRK5	2024-11-02T16:41:25-07:00	
PRC Adapts Meta’s Llama For Military And Security AI Applications...	By Sunny Cheung In September, the former deputy director of the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS), Lieutenant General He Lei (何雷), called for the United Nations to establish restrictions on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in warfare (Sina Finance, September 13). This would suggest that Beijing has an interest in mitigating the risks associated with military AI. Instead, the opposite is true. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is currently leveraging AI to enhance its own military capabilities and strategic advantages and is using Western technology to do so. The military and security sectors within the PRC are increasingly focused on integrating advanced AI technologies into operational capabilities. Meta’s open-source model Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) has emerged as a preferred model on which to build out features tailored for military and security applications. In this way, US and US-derived technology is being deployed as a tool to enhance the PRC’s military modernization and domestic innovation efforts, with direct consequences for the United States and its allies and partners. PLA Experts’ Vision for Military AI The PRC’s 2019 National Defense White Paper, titled 'China’s National Defense for the New Era (新时代的中国国防),' notes that modern warfare is shifting toward increasingly informationized (信息化) and intelligentized (智能化) domains, demanding advances in mechanization, informationization, and AI development (Xinhua, July 24, 2019). AI development in the military has accelerated in direct response to the demands of intelligent warfare, which itself has been propelled by recent technological advances. Experts from AMS and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have highlighted several key capabilities that AI systems must achieve to meet the PLA’s evolving military needs. First, large AI models must enable rapid response and decision-making to enhance battlefield situational awareness and support command functions. This includes autonomous mission planning and assisting commanders in making informed decisions under complex conditions. Strengthening the fusion of information from multiple sources is also seen as crucial, using AI to integrate data from satellite feeds, cyber intelligence, and communication intercepts. This is then used to deepen intelligence analysis and support joint operations, as highlighted by the PLA Joint Operation Outline (中国人民解放军联合作战纲要), which entered its trial implementation phase in 2020 (MOD, November 26, 2020). [1] Military AI is also being applied extensively to cognitive and psychological warfare (China Brief, September 6, 2019; September 8, 2023; June 21). Generative AI models can be deployed to produce media content to influence narratives, conduct strategic influence campaigns, and undermine an adversary’s morale, according to AMS experts. [2] Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can also rapidly integrate diverse information sources to enhance military intelligence analysis. With strong language processing capabilities, they can simplify data extraction, support real-time translation, and transform complex data into actionable insights, aiding military personnel in decision-making on the modern battlefield. Experts within the military apparatus, including top defense industry players like the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC; 中国电子科技集团), are currently working on AI to enhance cybersecurity and network threat detection. One paper authored by employees at CETC argues that AI models can play a pivotal role in identifying and countering cyber threats and establishing robust early-warning systems to fortify military communication networks. [3] Another area of focus is predictive maintenance and supply chain management. Here, AI can be used to anticipate equipment failures and streamline supply logistics. This optimization is critical for the PLA’s sustained operational readiness, especially during prolonged engagements. PLA experts are prioritizing the development of smaller, more 'lightweight' AI models for deployment in resource-constrained environments like frontline operations. These models must be robust and capable of performing effectively with limited computational power, making them suitable for edge devices—small computers or sensors that can process data and operate without relying on distant servers. The Aiwu Large Model (艾武大模型) is a good example of this. According to one research paper, Aiwu offers cross-platform compatibility on both manned and unmanned systems, and can execute diverse mission tasks under challenging conditions. [4] PLA experts consider military AI to be a foundational asset that must be highly adaptable, capable of integrating multimodal data and supporting autonomous decision-making in a wide range of tactical and strategic contexts. This approach stems from the understanding that future warfare will demand intelligent systems capable of processing real-time data, making proactive decisions, and synthesizing information from diverse sources. [5] PRC Researchers Adapt Llama to Meet Military Demands The potential that PRC researchers see in Meta’s Llama model lies in the flexibility and efficiency of its foundational model. This makes it useful for adaptation to various military and security systems. [6] A recent iteration, Llama 3.1, was launched in July and was described as having 'capabilities that rival the best closed source models' (Meta, July 23). (Llama 3.2 was released on September 25, and so has not yet been treated in relevant research.) As an open-source model, developers and researchers can modify and innovate on top of it. PRC security researchers have focused on adapting it for multilingual dialogue, high-quality code generation, and complex mathematical problem-solving. [7] They argue that the transformer model—an architecture for deep learning models that powers text-generating models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama, and Google’s Gemini—enhances performance in tasks such as information summarization, threat analysis, and decision-making support that are crucial for defense and public safety (ACM, December 4, 2017). [8] PRC researchers have also identified several limitations in Llama that they believe should be addressed before it can be optimized for military use. A primary concern is that Llama relies on open-source training data, which is largely general-purpose and lacks specificity for military contexts. [9] This leads to biases and limited domain-specific knowledge, particularly in areas of military strategy and security operations. In addition, the scarcity of comprehensive Chinese-language data restricts Llama’s ability to fully grasp linguistic nuances in Chinese-language communication, including the cultural context of specific utterances. [10] To overcome these challenges, PLA experts have implemented different techniques involving advanced data collection, computational techniques, and algorithmic improvements. These efforts have enabled Llama to adapt to understand Chinese-language military terminology and tactics Researchers Explore Techniques to Adapt Llama PRC researchers have employed a number of strategies to fine-tune Llama for military and security applications. One approach involves constructing domain-specific datasets, which includes gathering military-specific dialogue records, building data corpora from classified documents, integrating real-time operational data, and incorporating direct feedback from military personnel. [11] Other techniques include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reinforcement learning, multimodal integration, and infrastructure upgrades. LoRA has become a crucial strategy for customizing Llama (MIT, May 1). LoRA enables researchers to build specialized models based on Llama—for instance, by adding additional matrices to existing model layers to adjust the model’s responses in a targeted way, thereby negating the need to retrain the entire model (which could be time-consuming and expensive). This approach allows the model to retain its core abilities while adapting to military-specific terminology, coded signals, and context-sensitive decision-making with minimal resource use. This balance makes LoRA suitable for adapting Llama to meet the demands of military applications. [12] Reinforcement learning involves fine-tuning models by reiterating training runs with tailored feedback to optimize responses. To further optimize Llama, researchers use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which involves presenting the model with examples of high- and low-quality responses, enabling it to learn to prioritize the former. Applied over a period of time, reinforcement learning allows Llama to adjust its responses dynamically and adapt to evolving situations. [13] Researchers have optimized infrastructure through distributed computing and hybrid algorithms to meet Llama’s computational demands. Certain techniques allow large AI models to run efficiently on devices with limited processing power by carefully reducing model size, memory needs, and computational requirements. For example, quantization compresses the model by using fewer bits per parameter, which saves memory without much loss in performance; while the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach activates only select portions of a model based on the specific task, so only relevant parts are engaged during processing, which makes computation faster and less resource-intensive (Researchgate, June). [14] Some experts have applied techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs to better align with human preferences in simulated environments. Specifically, RLHF helps models tailor their outputs to meet user expectations. In simulated military training exercises, this has optimized an LLM’s ability to perform scenario-specific tasks like decision-making and behavioral responses. This process also ensures the model’s alignment with specific communication and behavioral styles within these simulated contexts, enhancing the model’s realism and relevance for military operations. [15] Llama-Based Models Deployed for Predictive Policing and Electronic Warfare Experts from PRC’s security sector see Llama-based models as having huge potential to enhance smart policing (智慧警务). Specifically, these models could improve situational awareness and decision-making by streamlining administrative tasks and providing predictive insights to prioritize police responses. In theory, by extracting important information from reports, generating incident summaries, and classifying events, Llama can enable officers to focus more on handling emergencies in the field. Implementation of these techniques is currently being studied, for instance in Yueqing, Zhejiang Province. The model’s ability to process vast and various data sources, including social media posts, surveillance transcripts, and crime records, makes it an effective tool for proactive and data-driven law enforcement. [16] Experts from the AVIC illustrate the data flow and processing stages involved in training and debugging Llama 2 for military applications. In the military domain, Llama is being studied to explore the potential for LLMs to support electronic warfare and self-defense jamming strategies, including by experts from the Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC; 中国航空工业集团), one of the PRC’s top defense conglomerates. Integrated with reinforcement learning agents (AI models designed to learn how to make decisions by studying their environment and improving their actions to achieve a specific goal), Llama is used to implement a dual-level approach to maximize efficiency. At the strategic level, Llama determines optimal parameters for disrupting enemy radar systems, while reinforcement learning agents execute real-time tactical adjustments to counter adversary maneuvers. One simulation run by the AVIC researchers using Llama 2 as the base LLM demonstrated that this combined approach improved interference strategy reward scores by approximately 25–31 percent. In other words, the new LLM system led the agent to execute more successful jamming strategies and reduced ineffective actions. [17] Illustration from a paper by NORINCO researchers of a learning and optimization loop for training a Llama 2-70B. Experts from a science institute under the US-sanctioned China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO; 中国兵器工业集团有限公司) have been exploring the integration of LLMs, such as Meta’s Llama 2, into their computer-generated forces (CGF) simulations. From their perspective, these models can enhance autonomous decision-making, behavior simulation, and environmental adaptability. Strategically, LLMs process complex environmental data, enabling agents to make optimized, mission-aligned decisions. Tactically, they provide diverse behavioral scripts, allowing agents to execute coordinated actions and respond to real-time battlefield dynamics, including terrain, adversary movements, and situational threats. This dual-layered integration can create realistic simulation environments where agents autonomously adapt to dynamic conditions, thereby potentially improving PLA training performance and military operations. [18] ChatBIT: A Llama-Derived Model for Military Intelligence PLA-affiliated experts have been optimizing Meta’s Llama’s 13B model, which is based on Llama 2, for military and security purposes. This model, which features 13 billion parameters and a training corpus of one trillion tokens, outperforms GPT-3 on various benchmarks (Huggingface, October 28). The model was introduced by Meta researchers in early 2023 in the paper 'Llama: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models' (Arxiv, February 27, 2023). Image from a paper by AMS researchers demonstrating the training process of ChatBIT, which is based on Meta’s Llama. Using Llama-13B as a foundation, researchers from AMS have developed 'ChatBIT,' a model tailored for open-source intelligence (OSINT) and military dialogue tasks. [19] ChatBIT appears to be a powerful model, outperforming Vicuna-13B—another Llama-13B-based model developed at Stanford University that allegedly achieved roughly 90 percent of GPT-4’s performance—on military-relevant benchmarks such as BLEU and ROUGE that assess translation accuracy and summarization quality (LMSYS Org, March 30, 2023; Elastic, December 1, 2023). Comparative evaluations consistently suggest that ChatBIT outperforms models like Vicuna-13B on these metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately interpreting nuanced military contexts and ensuring high-fidelity responses. [20] AMS researchers provide an example of ChatBIT outperforming other models on pertinent tasks. For instance, when asked about the United States Army Research Laboratory, ChatBIT delivered a comprehensive and accurate response detailing the lab’s focus on AI, cybersecurity, and drone technology. Vicuna-13B, the model it was tested against, provided an incorrect response. [21] Similarly, when tasked with explaining 'combat power contribution rate and combat effectiveness correlation'—metrics for evaluating weapons systems—ChatBIT offered an in-depth analysis, whereas Vicuna-13B only gave a superficial explanation. AMS experts argue that ChatBIT’s impressive performance in these tasks demonstrates its readiness for deployment in military Q&A, situational analysis, and operational support tasks. Conclusion Meta initially released Llama as an open-source model to support research and non-commercial use; however, the PLA’s adaptation of Llama to build models such as ChatBIT illustrates the problems of a trust-based approach to releasing technology into the global commons. Although Llama comes with license agreements that expressly forbid using the software for military purposes, these have proven ineffective in preventing the PLA and affiliated researchers from doing exactly that (Huggingface, accessed October 28). In practice, these restrictions act as 'paper tigers'—stipulations that lack enforceability and fall short of holding entities like the PLA accountable. The PRC has adapted Meta’s Llama for military and security purposes that are improving the country’s national defense capabilities. Through advanced techniques like LoRA, reinforcement learning, and multimodal integration, PRC researchers have transformed Llama into a tool to meet the intricate demands of military and public security applications. This work underscores the PRC’s commitment to developing AI systems that are integrated, adaptive, and capable of autonomous operation across diverse applications, from predictive policing to electronic warfare. Open-source LLMs like Llama can accelerate innovation and provide valuable tools across sectors, but they also pose risks if not carefully managed. Without oversight, such technologies can be modified for malicious purposes and used in ways that are contrary to developers’ original intentions. These technologies’ dual potential for both innovation and misuse highlights the importance of balanced oversight to maximize the benefits of open-source AI while mitigating risks associated with strategic misapplication.

Deciphering Turkey’s Africa Policy – Analysis	By Peter Fabricius President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Türkiye may not be quite ‘a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma’ as Winston Churchill described the Soviet Union in 1939 after its incongruous pact with Nazi Germany. But its foreign policy can sometimes be enigmatic. Last week, Türkiye was reportedly invited to become a BRICS member. How, many asked, does a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member join an association dominated by NATO’s only two identified foes, Russia and China? In Africa, Erdoğan also surprised friend and foe alike in 2019 when Türkiye intervened in Libya’s civil war to stop Khalifa Haftar from capturing Tripoli. Recently he has been trying to reconcile two of his closest African allies, Somalia and Ethiopia, who have fallen out over Ethiopia’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence in exchange for access to the sea. That mediation dilemma dates back to 2011. When countries were deserting Somalia because al-Shabaab’s terrorism made it too dangerous, Erdoğan visited the country to show support. He returned in 2016 to open an embassy. Conversely, he endeared himself to Ethiopia by supplying it with drones in 2021, which helped prevent rebel Tigrayan forces from capturing Addis Ababa. So in a sense that makes Türkiye a neutral broker – but the country is also perceived to be closer to Somalia, especially after it signed a new defence pact with Mogadishu in February. Erdogan is the master of surprise, of seizing opportunities. Erdoğan surprised friends and foes when Türkiye intervened in Libya to stop Khalifa Haftar from capturing Tripoli On the surface, his Africa policy looks quite orthodox. As a G20 member, Türkiye evidently feels it necessary to engage the continent as many other G20 powers have – for instance to bolster support in the United Nations. This weekend, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will chair a Türkiye-Africa Ministerial Review Conference meeting with counterparts from 14 African countries ahead of the fourth Türkiye-Africa summit in 2026. This is part of a major outreach to Africa, which Erdoğan greatly boosted. Writing in 2023, former Turkish ambassador Numan Hazar noted that since 1998, the number of embassies on the continent has mushroomed from 12 to 44, while African embassies in Ankara have increased from 10 in 2008 to 38 today. Since becoming prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014, Erdoğan has visited 31 African countries. Total trade with Africa increased from US$5.4 billion in 2003 to US$40.7 billion in 2022. Türkiye’s overall investment stock in Africa, focusing on infrastructure, education and healthcare, totals US$6 billion. Turkish contractors have built 1 296 projects worth US$82.6 billion. Hazar points out that the late former South African ambassador to Ankara, Tom Wheeler, said Türkiye used its soft power to expand its influence in Africa, yet didn’t attract the negative reactions other countries faced. This could partly be because Türkiye didn’t carry any colonial baggage. This lack of any threat perception would be remarkable, considering that Türkiye has considerably expanded its military presence in Africa. As Ali Bilgic, Professor of International Relations and Middle East Politics at Britain’s Loughborough University, told ISS Today, ‘Turkey has made notable strides in realising its ambition to become a key economic, humanitarian and military power in sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing military bases, such as the one in Somalia, and training local forces have solidified its geopolitical presence.’ He notes that as Islamist terrorists have increasingly targeted West African states such as Niger, Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali, Türkiye has been selling these countries drones. Ankara seeks to engage with all parties, so Türkiye doesn’t have eternal friends or enemies, only partners ‘Turkey’s defence industry has grown significantly, with numerous contracts signed across Africa. For instance, Turkey has supplied Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ethiopia and Libya ... Additionally, Turkey has agreements to provide military training and equipment to nations such as Somalia, further cementing its influence in the region.’ Bilgic sees Ankara’s efforts to mediate the standoff between Ethiopia and Somalia as a ‘diplomatic balancing act motivated by Ankara’s strategic interest in maintaining stability in the Horn of Africa.’ However, the balancing act is becoming difficult as Ethiopia has expressed concerns about Türkiye’s deepening relationship with Somalia, particularly its military support, ‘which it perceives as a potential threat to its own security.’ This has postponed Ankara’s mediation efforts. Bilgic says Türkiye’s more assertive foreign policy has also strained relations with NATO allies and the European Union. He doesn’t find Türkiye’s potential inclusion in BRICS incongruous, despite its NATO membership. This instead ‘reflects Erdoğan’s multifaceted foreign policy approach. This move is not seen as an alternative to NATO or the West but as part of a realist policy where Ankara seeks to engage with all parties. This approach means Turkey does not have eternal friends or enemies, only partners.’ Erdoğan’s ambiguous approach is also evident in how he governs his own country. It’s ostensibly a democracy that holds regular elections. But Freedom House assesses Türkiye to be ‘Not Free’ – saying Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party had become ‘increasingly authoritarian in recent years, consolidating significant power through constitutional changes and by imprisoning opponents and critics.’ Africa has become a terrain of Erdoğan’s struggle against the moderate Islamic Gülen or Hizmet movement The recent death in exile of Fethullah Gülen, spiritual leader of the moderate Islamic Gülen or Hizmet movement, raises another aspect of the ambiguities of Erdoğan’s Türkiye. He and Gülen were once allies but fell out in 2011 when Erdoğan accused the Gülenists of trying to overthrow the government. The Erdoğan government also accused them of instigating the abortive 2016 coup – and branded them a terrorist organisation. Africa has also become a terrain of Erdoğan’s struggle against Hizmet, as the movement runs schools in South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt, say Hizmet sources. Türkiye has pressured African countries to close Hizmet schools or detain its members, they say, and several have done so. This pressure has provoked tensions with some governments, including South Africa. Hizmet believes one of the motives for Erdoğan’s outreach to Africa, including aid and investment, has been to acquire the leverage to pressure countries to stifle Hizmet. Erdoğan has also been able to counter his regional Middle East rivals on African soil, like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which backed Hafter in Libya. And his increasing military support for Somalia helps block the UAE, which backs Somaliland. Erdoğan’s ostensible reasons for expanding Türkiye’s African footprint are no doubt genuine – trade, investment, humanitarian aid and national and regional stability. But it seems Africa is also a stage for him to pursue his ambition for Türkiye to be a global player.

Asia’s Economies Can Embrace Services To Boost Growth And Product...	The Asia-Pacific region prospered by becoming the source of more than half of global factory output, but another transformation to higher-productivity services has the potential to further support growth. Employment and production typically move from agriculture to manufacturing to services, as part of natural progression that comes with rising income. Today, many Asian countries—including China, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand—are highly industrialized. If history is a guide, industry’s share of production will shrink as more activity passes to services. Indeed, the growth of services has already drawn about half of the region’s workers into that sector, up from just 22 percent in 1990, as hundreds of millions moved from farms and factories. This shift is likely to accelerate with further expansion of international trade in modern services such as finance, information, and communication technology, as well as business outsourcing (for example, as already done in India and the Philippines). By contrast, traditional services—for example, tourism or distribution services—have lower productivity and contribute less to economic growth. Policymakers should embrace this shift to modern services because they have higher productivity, as we show in an analytical note accompanying our October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook. Transitioning to a more services-led economy comes with greater economic growth opportunities, provided the right policies are in place. Productivity is an important variable when considering which sectors can best deliver growth in coming years. Manufacturing productivity in Asia is already close to the level of global leaders, so further improvement offers only limited scope to boost productivity and growth. By contrast, services in Asia don’t enjoy the same efficiency advantage, so the region’s economies have more to gain by catching up with countries that have the most efficient services sectors. In addition, in several services sectors like finance and business services, productivity is higher than in manufacturing, which means greater contributions to growth. For example, Asia’s labor productivity in financial services is four times higher than in manufacturing, and it’s twice as high in business services, our new analysis shows. Even so, countries need to have the right conditions in place to benefit from services. Manufacturing benefited from low trade costs and greater global integration, but services sectors are relatively protected in Asia, which can hamper progress. Just like Asia’s higher tariffs on agriculture, which average 12 percent versus 7.5 percent globally, foreign companies that hope to enter the services sector face various restrictions. These include outright bans, approval requirements, local presence, and higher tax rates. Policymakers should also recognize that workers leaving agriculture and manufacturing need the skills to find good jobs in services. With waves of new digital technologies replacing some jobs like clerical support, policies should ensure widespread internet and technology access, and introduce education and training to develop a digitally skilled workforce capable of leveraging artificial intelligence. With growth projected to slow in many Asian countries due to rapid aging, boosting productivity by nurturing productive services is a key to Asia’s future success. —This article is based on an analytical note, 'Asia-Pacific’s Structural Transformation: The Past and Prospects,' included in the October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook.

Navigating A New America: Harris Or Trump, Europeans Need A Colle...	By Célia Belin Every time America changes president, European leaders work hard at establishing a close personal relationship, only to lament when the pendulum swing of politics strikes again. This year’s oscillation feels particularly unnerving. Challenges to Europe’s security will be daunting if Donald Trump makes it back to the White House. Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine in '24 hours', while his vice-president pick, JD Vance, has alluded to a 'peace plan' that appears more tailored to Russia’s views than Europe’s. Trump also said that Russia could do 'whatever the hell they want' to delinquent NATO allies, and some in his camp are pushing for reducing US participation in NATO to nuclear deterrence while pulling out all troops. This is a huge contrast to Kamala Harris, for whom the support to NATO is 'ironclad'. She has promised to continue supporting Ukraine and has repeatedly celebrated the importance of America’s alliances. Europeans will come up with somewhat different strategies to engage the new president depending on who wins. If it’s Harris, Europeans will extend good wishes along with aspirational goals. If it’s Trump, Europeans will focus on offering him quick wins and cross their fingers to get in his good graces. In both cases, Europeans are likely to elbow their way into Washington to try and become the president’s bestie and go-to European ally, including at the expense of fellow Europeans. They may engage in transactional bargaining – buying US weapons in exchange for security guarantees or supporting US policy on China in the hope that the United States reciprocates on Russia – and hope for the best. But this is the wrong approach. It dilutes the collective power of Europe, including that of the European Union, and leaves individual member states exposed to pressure from the US. In the absence of a meaningful pushback, Americans will continue to ask Europeans for forgiveness rather than permission, even if the policies of the new US administration run counter to European interests. As I argued in Foreign Affairs with Giovanna de Maio, Europeans need to come up with a collective plan to engage with the US. There are fundamental interests that all EU member states need to protect, far beyond the issue of the security of Europe. Together they need to be willing to defend and promote these interests, including when dealing with their greatest ally. It is high time that the EU drafts a strategy for engaging with the US, one that stands the test of time and presidential variations. This needs to be a group effort – consensus is key. Such a strategy can be drafted by the collective intelligence of EU institutions, but it needs to be supported by the leaders of EU member states and can extend to include close partners such as the United Kingdom as well as Ukraine and other candidate states. Such a strategy needs to tackle areas of vital importance – Russia, China, and the Middle East, but also trade, defence, climate, and technology. Regardless of who wins in November, Europeans will be facing a more self-interested America in the future. Despite vast differences between Harris and Trump, there are pre-existing trends that will affect US foreign policy. On Ukraine, the next administration will continue to be guided by prudence and fear of escalation. The conflict threatens European interests much more than American: as Washington looks for a negotiated solution, it may fail to consider the enormity of the consequences of a bad deal for Europe’s security. The US will also remain obsessed with winning its all-out technology and industrial competition with China and may force measures on Europe that will directly affect its prosperity. In the Middle East, unconditional US support for Israel does not lead to stabilising an increasingly explosive region. And, as the US leads the world in crude oil production, the need to finance the energy transition of the rest of the world is not its greatest focus. America’s priorities are shifting, and they will overlap with the EU’s less and less. Europeans must reckon with this fact and adapt their entire approach to this new, somewhat overwhelming reality. America’s shifting priorities also have direct consequences on the type of responsibility that Europeans must bear in the security realm. EU member states cannot afford to continue to delay the type of defence investments that are needed to pick up a bigger share of the security effort, both in Europe and beyond. It requires an ambitious plan to produce crucial capabilities that are now provided by the US. The EU needs to work on improving its synergy with NATO. And individual member states must continue to work to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, and other neighbours. Taking responsibility for its security while fiercely defending its interests will demonstrate the EU’s maturity and strength. It will allow the bloc to speak with one voice when leaders go to Washington, and to defend core interests in transatlantic forums such as the Trade and Technology Council or EU-US summits. It will also signal Europeans’ readiness to engage with the US, regardless of politics. Down the line, it can only lead to a healthier transatlantic relationship.

Promises And Perils Of The Future Made In Australia Act – Analysi...	By Marina Yue Zhang, Roy Green, and Mark Dodgson Australia’s industrial policy is undergoing a significant transformation with the introduction of the Future Made in Australia Act (FMiA). This policy aims to reposition the country as a key player in global supply chains, particularly in critical minerals, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. It marks a departure from neoliberalism towards a mission-oriented approach, reflecting broader global trends over the past decade. Historically, industrial policies have been instrumental in supporting economies — such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and more recently China — catch up with the developed world. These nations have successfully targeted specific sectors with state-directed investments in technologies and capabilities, complemented by government-led export strategies. Major industrial nations, including the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, are adopting similar interventionist industrial policies in response to geopolitical competition. The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) embodies this shift, offering substantial subsidies and investments aimed at reshoring manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly China. The European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act seeks to secure access to essential minerals for the green transition, while the United Kingdom is implementing policies to enhance its industrial competitiveness post-Brexit. These policy shifts reflect a collective aim to mitigate vulnerabilities highlighted by supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. They represent a break from the so-called Washington Consensus, which advocated for economic growth through reduced government intervention and trade liberalisation. Unlike these other industrialised nations, Australia’s FMiA does not incorporate significant tariff increases or protectionist measures. At the heart of the FMiA is an ambition to reduce Australia’s dependence on commodity exports and transition toward high-value-adding industries that are globally competitive and sustainable. The policy emphasises subsidising local manufacturing capabilities, particularly for the green energy transition. But scepticism surrounds the FMiA’s efficacy. Critics warn that while its intentions may be commendable, mission-oriented industrial policies may lead to unintended consequences, especially if they favour specific sectors at the expense of others. Investing in areas where Australia lacks comparative advantage might expose the country to external economic pressures and competition from countries with more cost-effective suppliers. This policy ultimately suggests a discontinuity with Australia’s liberal economic past, particularly the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s that opened up the economy and allowed its comparative advantage in commodities exports to flourish. One significant risk Australia faces is becoming ensnared in a global arms race of industrial subsidies. As the United States and China funnel billions into strategic sectors, smaller economies like Australia may feel pressured to keep pace. This could create a cycle of escalating subsidies that strain public finances, incurring considerable opportunity costs. A key difference between Australia and other developed countries lies in market size. The United States and European Union can sustain ambitious industrial strategies which can thrive on their extensive downstream markets. In contrast, Australia’s limited domestic market makes it heavily reliant on exports. As an upstream supplier of mineral products, Australia faces significant constraints in maintaining its export markets due to its reliance on high-value processing technologies and facilities, predominantly controlled by Chinese interests, before accessing downstream markets, where China controls a substantial share. This unique position in the global value chain limits Australia’s negotiating power and exposes it to geopolitical risks, particularly amid the ongoing rivalry between the United States and China. Aligning more closely with the United States may seem advantageous, but this strategy does not inherently enhance Australia’s competitive edge in mineral processing. US initiatives, such as the IRA, often stipulate that producers cannot exceed a certain level of Chinese equity to qualify for incentives. This underscores the complexities of navigating foreign direct investment in a politically charged environment. Australia’s aspiration to develop downstream processing capabilities is hampered by high labour costs and ongoing reliance on global supply chains. This could further entrench dependency on foreign technologies. Australia’s industrial policy has long promoted research and development through tax rebates and subsidies. During the resource boom, this led to innovation in mining extraction technologies that yield high returns. But Australia remains dependent on imports of heavy machinery and equipment, let alone mineral processing technologies. Compounding this issue, emerging competitors, particularly the BRICS+6 nations, are actively developing their own supply chains, leveraging both their mineral resources and China’s advanced processing capabilities and investments in infrastructure. The FMiA in its current form also risks increasing regional disparities, as resource-rich states and established firms may benefit disproportionately from subsidies, exacerbating inequality across Australia. This could create a scenario where certain regions thrive while others lag behind, particularly areas with fewer natural resources or less-developed firms. Australia must craft a more inclusive and balanced industrial policy that integrates both vertical (sector-specific) and horizontal (economy-wide) programs. The FMiA adopts a vertical approach by targeting sectors critical to national interests, especially in alignment with the interests of Australia’s allies. This focus is particularly important in addressing economic security and environmental considerations that the market may not effectively resolve. But it is essential to implement horizontal programs that foster a conducive business environment across all states and sectors. This includes improving infrastructure, enhancing workforce skills and promoting innovation. Investing in education and training, along with enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics and cloud computing, could help equip the workforce with the necessary skills and empower small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs to benefit from these initiatives. Above all, developing innovative strategic partnerships will be essential for sustainable growth and prosperity. Collaborative efforts with global stakeholders can enhance Australia’s competitiveness and adaptability in a rapidly changing global landscape. Australia must strike a balance between state intervention and market forces, particularly in addressing the energy transition. Relying solely on the government to determine which sectors should be the ‘moonshots’ is risky and may lead to unintended consequences.

Development Prospects Of The BRICS Mechanism’s Attraction For Reg...	By Zhou Chao The new BRICS Summit was held in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24, 2024. This was the first summit since the historic expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism the previous year. The first BRIC summit took place in 2009, joined by Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The following year, South Africa participated and officially hence the BRICS group was established. At the Johannesburg summit in 2023, the group expanded again, inviting Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to join its cooperation mechanism. After this expansion, the BRICS countries accounted for nearly half of the global population, over 30% of global GDP, and one-fifth of global trade, with an economic total, based on purchasing power parity, surpassing that of the G7. The theme of the summit this year was 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development And Security'. The main agenda included cooperation on the new industrial revolution, global governance reform, and the implementation of global civilization initiatives. Key topics were the reform of international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to enhance the voice and representation of developing countries and emerging markets. Additionally, the summit discussed the establishment of a BRICS-led payment system proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to compete with the Western SWIFT system, as well as the ongoing escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. The summit concluded with the adoption of the Kazan Declaration, which emphasized strengthening cooperation after the BRICS expansion under three pillars: political security, economic finance, and cultural collaboration. It encouraged the enhancement of the BRICS network of correspondent banks and the implementation of local currency settlements through the non-binding BRICS Cross-Border Payment Initiative (BCBPI). The declaration also agreed to discuss and explore the feasibility of establishing an independent cross-border settlement and custody infrastructure, known as the BRICS Clearing System (BRICS Clear), to complement existing financial market infrastructures, with voluntary participation from all parties. The BRICS cooperation mechanism is currently the most important platform for solidarity and cooperation among emerging market countries and developing nations. It serves as a pillar for promoting a multipolar world characterized by equality and order, as well as inclusive economic globalization. Additionally, it is one of the key platforms through which China projects its influence to emerging markets and Southern countries, which carries significant expectations for China. This year’s BRICS summit was held in Russia, a country that has faced over two years of sanctions and isolation from the West due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Given that this was the first summit after the expansion of the BRICS mechanism, some Chinese commentators have high hopes for the summit, believing it will help further amplify the voice of the Global South, expand cooperation among emerging countries, and enhance their own influence and membership. It is evident that within the BRICS mechanism, both formal members and partner countries are primarily major regional powers with considerable influence. The inclusion of these countries will undoubtedly enhance the global impact of the BRICS mechanism. However, regarding the BRICS mechanism itself, its attractiveness to global regional powers appears to have reached a limit, making the potential for further strengthening quite finite. First, there are deep-seated issues both within the core member countries of the BRICS mechanism, as well as among the members themselves. In the case of Russia, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict has fundamentally revealed the limitations of Russia as a 'great power'. The struggles of the Russian military on the battlefield, along with the bleak prospects for its economy under ongoing sanctions, indicate that Russia's ability to provide regional and global security and economic public goods in the future will be significantly constrained. Moreover, the series of failures in Russia's economic transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union suggests that even if the West were to completely lift economic sanctions against Russia, the overall outlook for its economic development would still not be promising. In the case of China, since the lifting of its COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the country's socioeconomic growth rate has gradually slowed, with consumer spending weakening and the real estate sector, along with local governments' massive debts, significantly dragging down economic growth. Despite multiple rounds of stimulus from the Chinese government aimed at boosting consumer spending and economic growth, there have been no significant results. Additionally, Western capital is progressively withdrawing from Mainland China and Hong Kong, while the U.S.-led technological and economic pressures on China continue. While China's fundamental economic situation is certainly much better than Russia's, the sustainability of its ability to provide economic public goods to regional powers is also in question. Between BRICS member countries, the profound contradictions between India and China will remain a long-term challenge. Before the BRICS summit, the Indian government clearly stated that it had reached a new border patrol agreement with China, but the specific implementation process will still require time. Moreover, considering India's strategic positioning and geopolitical interests, there remain anti-China geopolitical tensions in regions such as the South Asian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. Coupled with the significant investments made by the West to court India, India's confrontational stance toward China is unlikely to undergo any substantial change due to a thaw in border issues. Additionally, India's attitude toward Russia will continue to be characterized by pure pragmatism. As a result, there is no real cohesion among the core countries of the BRICS mechanism; instead, there are deep-rooted contradictions, making it difficult for this mechanism to effectively attract and integrate other regional powers. Second, the core countries of the BRICS mechanism have not truly outperformed Western countries in mediating regional conflicts. Last year, through China's careful mediation, Iran and Saudi Arabia reached a declaration in Beijing to normalize their relations, marking a significant step toward easing tensions in the Middle East. Following this, Iran promised to pressure the Houthis to cease their armed attacks on Saudi territory. In turn, Saudi Arabia seized the opportunity to improve its relations with Iran and intensified efforts to address the influence of Iran on various countries and armed groups in the region. Saudi Arabia resumed ceasefire negotiations with the Houthis and subsequently normalized relations with Syria, expressing support for Syria's return to the Arab League in 2023. Saudi Arabia also reopened its embassy in Lebanon and renewed contact with Iraq, signing a series of cooperation agreements in the fields of energy, investment, and infrastructure. However, the effects of these efforts quickly proved to be extremely limited. The Houthis began to delay the signing of agreements with Saudi Arabia, and the peace process in Yemen has been frozen for some time. Damascus failed to effectively curb the large amounts of drugs smuggled into the Gulf region, leaving the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Syria largely superficial. Lebanese political elites once again rejected Saudi proposals for systematic reforms and the revival of the state-building process. After the new Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia’ al-Sudani took office, Saudi Arabia perceived him as too close to Iran, resulting in a significant slowdown in cooperation with Iraq. In terms of relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has expanded its engagement but has invited Iranian representatives to virtually none of the meetings it has organized regarding the Gaza situation since the special summit concluded. Additionally, while Saudi Arabia has sought to reduce hostility between Western nations and Iran, it has also collaborated with the U.S., Jordan, the UK, and France to intercept over 300 drones and ballistic missiles fired by Iran at Israel in retaliation for attacks on its embassy in Syria. Despite some improvement in Saudi-Iranian relations, a deep competitive dynamic persists as both countries strive for dominance in the Middle Eastern world. Neither Saudi Arabia, as a participant in the BRICS mechanism, nor China, as a key member of the BRICS group, has managed to consistently advance the de-escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran or alleviate regional conflicts. In the perception of the Saudi elite, the view that 'the U.S. is unreliable but indispensable to us' has become a basic consensus. Therefore, Saudi Arabia is determined to maintain and even strengthen its security cooperation with the U.S., hoping to enhance its long-term self-defense capabilities through this relationship. Saudi Arabia is not only continuing to bolster its military procurement from the U.S. but is also willing to participate in the normalization process of relations with Israel under U.S. mediation. It can be argued that for many regional powers around the world, the geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China certainly provides these countries with greater 'united front value' and room for maneuver. However, this does not mean that their distances from the major world powers will align uniformly. For many regional powers, Western countries, especially the U.S., with their stronger economic and financial influence, often represent a more ideal partner for cooperation. For instance, countries like Saudi Arabia, a member of the BRICS mechanism, tend to gravitate slightly closer to the U.S. even while pursuing a policy of balanced diplomacy. Moreover, it is important to note that with Iran's accession to BRICS, the organization may no longer be viewed purely as an economic cooperation entity by other regional powers. Instead, it appears to have increasingly taken on an 'anti-U.S.' and 'anti-Western' character. Even in matters of economic cooperation, the concepts of a BRICS payment system and a common currency, heavily promoted by Russia and Brazil, clearly emphasize 'de-dollarization'. In this context, joining BRICS can easily be interpreted by the U.S. and other Western countries as a 'realignment', bringing with it significant political, economic, and security risks. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, both new and old BRICS members have faced economic difficulties in recent years, leading other regional powers to worry about being exploited after joining, which would be entirely contrary to their expectations. All in all, for regional powers, joining BRICS is aimed at enhancing their bargaining power with the West, rather than bearing responsibilities for others. It is noteworthy that recently, major regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan have expressed no desire to become BRICS members, and Argentina too made a similar statement earlier. Final Analysis Conclusion: The BRICS cooperation mechanism is an important platform that China has focused on developing to enhance its international influence and unite Southern countries. Over the past decade, it has played a significant role, and its contributions cannot be overlooked. However, due to a series of changing circumstances, it appears that the BRICS group has reached the peak of its attractiveness to regional powers, making it difficult to achieve substantial breakthroughs going forward. Therefore, for countries like China, a cautious attitude should be adopted regarding its future global influence.

‘Victory Plan’ Or Deadly Delusion? Zelensky’s Perilous Five-Point...	By Carus Michaelangelo It’s finally here: Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky’s 'Victory Plan,' furtively touted for weeks as Zelensky sought, unsuccessfully, to peddle it to world leaders. Until now, all that Zelensky would say in public was that this clandestine plan paradoxically would not require negotiation with Putin, but also provides a way to strengthen Ukraine in order to 'push Putin' to diplomatically end the war. Tone deaf in the extreme, several weeks ago Zelensky brazenly flew on a US Air Force C-17 transport plane into the key battleground state of Pennsylvania to visit a munitions plant before hectoring the United Nations General Assembly on this special plan. Election interference be damned! Blessed with Zelensky’s grand reveal of his vaunted five-point plan to the Ukrainian parliament on October 16, the tragic farce of the 'Victory Plan' sharpens into focus. Still shielding 'three secret' addenda from the general public, Zelensky’s top goal is as unsurprising as it is meretricious: an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Zelensky hopes that NATO nations will grant Ukraine’s application for admission, which it submitted over two years ago. Ukraine’s Victory plan is little more than a Hail Mary. Why would NATO nations suddenly wish to jump headlong into the fray now, as Ukraine’s already-dim prospects admittedly vanish, which cannot be papered over even by friendly commentators? The patent absurdity of the Victory Plan does not stop there. Zelensky’s other four points involve: (1) unrestricted Western support for unrestricted warfare; (2) 'non-nuclear deterrence' to 'safeguard the country against future' Russian 'aggression'; (3) 'economic growth and cooperation,' which includes further Russian sanctions plus joint investment opportunities; and (4) a 'post-war security architecture,' in which Ukraine’s 'large and experienced military force' can help secure Europe. Zelensky seeks to unleash the Ukrainian military, hitherto shackled by arbitrary US restraints on long-range strikes into Russia. This invitation to nuclear war is bad enough, but he also seeks funds, arms, and intelligence from the West beyond the already-prodigious aid and comfort shuttled off these past two years. Additionally, this plank demands for Ukraine 'additional supplies of long-range capabilities,' asks for the West to take out Russian missiles and drones, and suggests further ground invasions of Russia to create 'buffer zones.' As Russia expands and lowers the bar for using nuclear weapons, Zelensky means to thrash about Russia like an elephant in a Matryoshka shop. Zelensky may feel as though Ukraine has nothing to lose—wrongly, since Russia’s prospect of wiping Ukraine off the map only increases as the war prolongs—but the West has everything to lose. If it stands, President Biden’s justified reticence to authorize long-range strikes into Russia could be the most consequential decision of his presidency. But the media has foamed at the mouth at this cold shoulder—notwithstanding new aid to Ukraine, repeatedly—so do not hold your breath. At first glance, Zelensky’s call for 'economic growth and cooperation' seems almost comical. In these dire straits, marred by death and destruction, what does Ukraine have to offer the West? The devil is in the details. Zelensky’s plan likely seeks to entice lawmakers like US Senator Lindsay Graham, who seek access to Ukraine’s stocks of resources like lithium, a critical mineral used in electric vehicle batteries. Yes, for some supporting Ukraine may be based on as loathsome a reason as securing cronyist exploitation of Ukraine’s natural resources. If you thought the Bush administration would be the last America saw of such contemptuous profiteering, think again. One is tempted to laugh were the situation not so enraging. In his October 16 address, Zelensky noted the grave consequences that would befall the world if we allowed the impression 'that wars of aggression can be profitable,' with new aggressions likely to pop up in 'the Gulf region, the Indo-Pacific region, and Africa.' All those things may well occur, but largely this will be thanks to US meddling, rather than the 'isolationist' phantom. Unfortunately, however, the establishment piper plays only one tune: 'Appeasement! Munich!' Apparently unironically, Zelensky also states that North Korea’s supplying of Russian with munitions and soldiers 'is effectively participation of a second state in the war against Ukraine on Russia’s side.' Surely he realizes that the US and many countries in the West were already belligerents in the war? Though the foolish depths of the Victory Plan seem limitless, Zelensky offers one silver lining. At least, for those who survive the possible nuclear apocalypse unleashed by his pyrrhic Victory Plan. Under his plan, Ukraine’s soldiers can replace US soldiers in select locations in Europe. Sign me up! Avoiding war was once the mark of the great statesmen; making peace, equally so. It will be a difficult peace for Ukraine to make. Admitting defeat is rare—for good reason. Many Ukrainians are coming to their senses, but not the most important Ukrainian. For the sake of Ukraine, and the world, one hopes Zelensky rouses from his war-fevered slumber. Hope springs eternal; but alas, so does vanity. About the author: Michaelangelo Carus lives in Virginia and has a graduate degree in history.

Bank Of Italy Governor Urges ECB To Cut Rates Further	By Alessia Peretti (EurActiv) -- Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta urged the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday to consider further rate cuts, saying the current restrictive monetary policy risks hampering economic growth. Panetta made his call at the World Savings Day event in Milan, sending a clear message to ECB President Christine Lagarde. The ECB’s aggressive monetary tightening following the energy shock has managed to curb inflation swiftly, but 'monetary conditions remain restrictive, requiring further cuts,' he said. Panetta warned that attention should now turn to the sluggish real economy. Without a sustained recovery, he warned, 'we risk pushing inflation well below our 2% target', a situation that would be difficult for monetary policy to address and should be avoided. 'The European economy remains weak, burdened by persistently high real interest rates and the withdrawal of past fiscal stimuli. The Italian economy is feeling the strain,' he said. In highlighting Italy's low growth drivers, Panetta also pointed to limited innovation capacity, underinvestment and a fragmented industrial base focused on traditional sectors - problems exacerbated by high public debt and interest payments. The ECB has enacted three rate cuts of 25 basis points each so far, with the latest reduction announced on 17 October. A strong voice on the ECB board, Panetta has consistently advocated for rate cuts, first raising the issue in his first speech as the bank’s governor in November 2023. ECB rate policies have repeatedly come under fire from Italian officials. Most recently, in September, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani criticised the ECB's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%, saying it was 'too timid' and that 'the ECB should do more.' 'I believe the founding treaty should be revised because it limits the ECB's role to controlling inflation, whereas it should also support growth and the real economy,' Tajani said at the time. Italian Business and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso also joined the criticism, describing the cut as 'insufficient' and calling for 'an immediate change of direction.' Responding to the political pressure, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is 'an independent institution, as stated clearly in the EU Treaty, and we do not respond to political pressures'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3G0w25waxoWd	2024-11-01T16:42:23-07:00	
What William Graham Sumner Would Say About Trump And Vance’s Tari...	By Kody Jensen William Graham Sumner (1840–1910) was a professor, sociologist, clergyman, and advocate of laissez faire, the gold standard, and free trade. His book What Social Classes Owe to Each Other was influential in the thinking of Leonard Read, according to Mary Senholz’s biography of the FEE founder. Whilst Sumner was a supporter of free trade, in more recent times Donald Trump has built his political reputation on being its adversary. How would William Graham Sumner respond to claims made by Trump and his running mate JD Vance about free trade in the recent debates? Let’s go to his writings to find a potential answer. The Great Free Trade Debate DT: 'First of all, I have no sales tax. That’s an incorrect statement. [Trump is responding to Harris characterizing his tariff plan as a sales tax.] We’re doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world. I took in billions and billions of dollars from China.' Sumner observes that protectionists have always shied away from referring to tariffs as taxes. Consider these comments from his 1888 book Protectionism: the -ism which teaches that waste makes wealth: There are some who say that 'a tariff is not a tax,' or as one of them said before a Congressional Committee: 'We do not like to call it so!' That certainly is the most humorous of all the funny things in the tariff controversy. If a tariff is not a tax, what is it? In what category does it belong? No protectionist has ever yet told. They seem to think of it as a thing by itself, a Power, a Force, a sort of Mumbo Jumbo whose special function it is to produce national prosperity. They do not appear to have analyzed it, or given themselves an account of it, sufficiently to know what kind of a thing it is or how it acts. Any one who says that it is not a tax must suppose that it costs nothing, that it produces an effect without an expenditure of energy. They do seem to think that if Congress will say: 'Let a tax of —— per cent be laid on article A,' and if none is imported, and therefore no tax is paid at the custom house, national industry will be benefited and wealth secured, and that there will be no cost or outgo. If that is so, then the tariff is magic. We have found the philosopher’s stone. Furthermore: A protective tax is one which is laid to act as a bar to importation, in order to keep a foreign commodity out. It does not act protectively unless it does act as a bar, and is not a tax on imports but an obstruction to imports. Hence a protective duty is a wall to inclose the domestic producer and consumer, and to prevent the latter from having access to any other source of supply for his needs, in exchange for his products, than that one which the domestic producer controls. The purpose and plan of the device is to enable the domestic producer to levy on the domestic consumer the taxes which the government has set up as a barrier, but has not collected at the port of entry. Under this device the government says: 'I do not want the revenue, but I will lay the tax so that you, the selected and favored producer, may collect it.' 'I do not need to tax the consumer for myself, but I will hold him for you while you tax him.' DT: 'They aren’t gonna have higher prices; what’s gonna have and who’s gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years' [when asked if consumers can afford higher prices caused by tariffs]. WGS: 'To this it is obvious to reply: what good can they then do toward the end proposed?' If the tariffs do not raise prices, how do they encourage the protected industries? No doubt it would be a neat trick if the President could force foreigners to pay more for US products while not raising prices for US consumers. However, I cannot comprehend how taxes on US imports will achieve this. JDV: 'Think about this. If you’re trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you’re going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you’re not accessing our markets unless you’re paying middle-class Americans a fair wage.' WGS: The protectionist says that he does not want the American laborer to compete with the foreign 'pauper laborer.' He assumes, that if the foreign laborer is a woolen operative, the only American who may have to compete with him is a woolen operative here. His device for saving our operatives from the assumed competition is to tax the American cotton or wheat grower on the cloth he wears, to make up and offset to the woolen operative the disadvantage under which he labors. If then, the case were true as the protectionist states it, and if his remedy were correct, he would, when he had finished his operation, simply have allowed the American woolen operative to escape, by transferring to the American cotton or wheat grower the evil results of competition with 'foreign pauper labor.' Can a tariff raise the general wage level? Sumner comments in this regard: Wages are capital. If I promise to pay wages I must find capital somewhere with which to fulfill my contract. If the tariff makes me pay more than I otherwise would, where does the surplus come from? Disregarding money as only an intermediate term, a man’s wages are his means of subsistence—food, clothing, house rent, fuel, lights, furniture, etc. If the tariff system makes him get more of these for ten hours’ work in a shop than he would get without tariff, where does the 'more' come from? Nothing but labor and capital can produce food, clothing, etc. Either the tax must make these out of nothing, or it can only get them by taking them from those who have made them, that is by subtracting them from the wages of somebody else. Taking all the wages class into account, then the tax cannot possibly increase, but is sure by waste and loss to decrease wages. One point both Trump and Vance raised was that apparently even Joe Biden agreed with protectionist ideas, as he did not remove most of the tariffs imposed by the previous administration. I do not know what answer Sumner could give to this ubiquity of bad economics, other than to glumly shake his head. About the author: Kody Jensen is a millennial who enjoys economics and chess.

Three Additional Points On The NY Times’ Piece On Blah Voters – O...	The New York Times’ lead homepage article Thursday told readers that in spite of a batch of really good economic data, 'voters still feel blah.' There are several points that are worth adding to the discussion in the piece. Prices Are Still High The first point is that the piece starts with an often-repeated complaint that, even though inflation has slowed roughly back to its pre-pandemic pace, prices are still high. This is an absurd complaint in the sense that nothing can be done about prices being high, as every economics reporter knows. Wages have risen by more than 23 percent since the start of the pandemic. Prices cannot return to anything like their pre-pandemic level with the current level of wages. We could have a horrible depression, which could eventually force wages down, but it is unlikely that many of the complaining consumers really want to see 20 percent unemployment. The profit share of income has risen by roughly 2.0 percentage points. The reversal of this increase could allow for some price reductions without wages falling, but it is more likely that we would see a slower pace of price rises even as wage growth continues at its current rate, rather than an actual drop in prices. In short, the complaint that prices are still high is comparable to people complaining that it’s cold in winter or dark at night. People might be bothered by the cold weather or the darkness, but there is nothing that can realistically be done about it. Unfortunately, because the media have repeated the complaint endlessly, they have legitimated it and made it part of the national political debate. This is a serious failing of economic reporting. Most Workers’ Pay Has Kept Pace with Inflation At one point the piece tells readers: 'Wages have climbed faster than prices for many consumers, but that is not true across the board.' That might leave the impression that wage growth in excess of inflation is the exception. In fact, most workers — especially lower paid workers — have seen wage growth that outpaces inflation. Wages for workers in the bottom decile of the wage distribution saw their wages outpace inflation by more than 12.0 percent from the start of the pandemic to the end of 2023. (The gap would be even larger with more recent data.) This is the fastest wage growth for these workers in half a century. China’s Growth is Considerably More Rapid Than Growth in the US At one point the piece notes that consumers are spending at a rapid pace, in spite of saying they think the economy is bad, and the US is doing better than other countries: 'Even if consumers say they feel bad in surveys, they have shown a willingness to keep spending, and US growth is much stronger than what countries like Germany or China are experiencing.' While the US economy has done significantly better since the pandemic than other wealthy countries, its growth actually lags China’s growth. While US GDP growth will probably come in at just under 3.0 percent in 2024, China is likely have growth of close to 5.0 percent. While China remains considerably poorer than the United States on a per person basis, it is not widely recognized that its economy is already considerably larger than ours. This gap is increasing through time.

Government Agents Try To Stir Up Fear Of Russian Election Interfe...	For a third United States presidential election in a row, US agents are out warning of Russian election interference. In the previous two elections the warnings were spurious. Still, the government agents succeeded in raising worry in people’s minds regarding candidate Donald Trump. And they suppressed consideration of information damaging to Trump’s opponents, including through indicating the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop were 'Russian disinformation.' This election, the government agents are at it again. Their latest spurt of relating supposed Russian election interference arrived in a Friday joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This joint statement is one among a series of updates concerning what the press release calls 'Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.' Yeah, whatever, guys. Have you ever read the story about the boy who cried wolf?

How Would Harris And Trump Differ On Asia? – Analysis	By Alex Willemyns As the result of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election teeters on knife’s edge in a handful of evenly split swing states, the rest of the world is bracing itself for two starkly different potential futures. One prospect is the return of former President Donald Trump’s turbulent 'America First' foreign policy, which last time around downplayed any U.S. obligations as a world leader to prioritize transactional bilateral ties with countries like China, Russia and even North Korea. On the other side of the ledger is the continuation, under Vice President Kamala Harris, of the last four years of President Joe Biden’s comparatively boring – if more predictable – style of alliance building and 'steady' diplomacy in the face of multiple world crises. While foreign policy is unlikely to sway many Americans’ choices at the ballot box – with domestic issues like the economy and the makeup of the Supreme Court outranking foreign policy in the eyes of voters – their choices will have the power to reshape global geopolitics. As one columnist put it, the future of the world 'may depend on what a few thousand Pennsylvania voters think about their grocery bills.' So how would a Harris or Trump administration differ on Asia? US alliances Led by Kurt Campbell, who is currently the U.S. deputy secretary of state, the Biden administration has spent the past four years attempting to 'manage' America’s rivalry with China by focusing on diplomacy with Beijing while building tight-knit alliances against it. That includes the 'AUKUS' pact with Australia and the United Kingdom, the 'Quad' arrangement with Australia, Japan and India and the U.S.-Japanese-South Korean 'trilateral,' even as U.S. diplomats have stopped short of supporting an 'Asian NATO aimed at China.' Harris has so far indicated she would take a similar approach, with Biden’s CIA director, Bill Burns, and one of the president’s top foreign policy 'confidantes,' Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, among the favorites to replace Antony Blinken as U.S. secretary of state. She has even used high-profile speeches to make the point. 'I will stand with our friends, because I know that our alliances keep American people safe and make America stronger and more secure,' Harris said in her 'closing argument' speech on Washington’s National Mall on Tuesday, exactly a week before the Nov. 5 election day. 'World leaders think that Donald Trump is an easy mark,' the vice president added, calling Trump 'easy to manipulate with flattery and favor' and claiming that 'autocrats' like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong 'are rooting for him' to win. Trump, by contrast, has spent less time detailing an orderly approach to foreign policy to instead argue that world leaders respect him more than Biden or Harris and that a personal touch will be what matters. Asked why Chinese President Xi Jinping would not invade Taiwan, for instance, the former president recently told The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board that Xi would be too afraid to carry out any invasion 'because he respects me and he knows I’m f***ing crazy.' Taiwan Harris has repeatedly reaffirmed the 'status quo' approach to Taiwan, a U.S. ally and self-governing democratic island that Beijing has called a 'renegade' province that must one day be 'reunited' with the mainland. That decades-old position holds that China and Taiwan must negotiate their future peacefully – an increasingly unlikely scenario as the years go on – and that neither should attack each other in the meantime. 'Let me restate the point I’ve made many times,' Harris said on Oct. 16, after Chinese military drills near the island. 'I believe in the ‘One China’ policy, and I believe … Taiwan has a right to defend itself.' Trump, meanwhile, has offered contrasting hints about Taiwan. While the former president has indicated he would discourage Xi against plans to invade the island, he has also attacked Taiwan’s leaders. In a three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan on Oct. 25, Trump repeatedly raised the island, at first drawing a link between Taiwan and Ukraine and noting that neither was invaded while he was president. 'It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, ‘Don’t do it,’' Trump said, referring to his conversations with both Xi and Putin. However, in the closing portion of the interview, Trump attacked Taiwan’s so-called 'Silicon Shield,' a term used to refer to the island’s near monopolyon advanced semiconductor-chip production, which has led to an intense U.S. interest in not letting the island be invaded. 'You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. Okay? They want us to protect [them] and they want protection. They don’t pay us money for the protection. You know, the mob makes you pay money, right?' he said, advocating for tariffs on all chips being imported into America. The comments were seized upon by Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, who gleefully told reporters it highlighted the untrustworthiness of America’s pledges to defend Taiwan. 'I believe most of our Taiwan compatriots have already made a rational judgment and know very clearly that what the United States pursues is always ‘America First,’' Zhu said at a press conference Wednesday. 'Taiwan at any time may turn from a pawn to a discarded child.' China and tariffs One of the few times Harris and Trump went head-to-head on non-domestic issues during their debate on ABC News on Sept. 10 was in their opening spar over their proposals for tariffs on Chinese imports, due to the likely impacts on the American economy. Trump has proposed tariffs of up to 60% on all imports from China, which Harris said would lead to surging inflation as Chinese exporters pass on the costs, tanking the American economy’s recovery. By contrast, Harris has called for fewer and more targeted tariffs. However, Trump disputed any such analysis about inflation – including from sixteen Nobel Prize winning economists – to instead claim that Chinese exporters would absorb the added costs while paying 'hundreds of billions of dollars' that could be used to cut taxes. 'They’re not going to have higher prices,' Trump said of consumers buying Chinese goods. 'Who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years.' Harris has voiced support instead for sticking with the Biden administration’s comparatively more targeted tariffs on China, which are focused instead on supporting U.S. industry in competing with China’s low-cost exports of solar panels and electric vehicles. Beijing has repeatedly slammed both the proposals as protectionist and called for the United States to return to policies of free trade. Nevertheless, trade with China may be one of the policy areas where Harris and Trump are aligned the closest in principle. That is because American voters have come to see trade through the lens of 'where we’re positioned geopolitically,' and not through its impacts on the costs of everyday goods, according to Laura Silver, an associate director of global attitudes at pollster Pew Research. 'They don’t necessarily see trade as lowering prices and benefiting them economically,' Silver said at a forum on the election hosted by the East-West Center. 'China, in particular, is seen as a competitor, and so when it comes to trade with China, we are seen as losing.' 'This is a really salient thing in an election time,' she added. North Korea Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, has said that North Korea’s recent deployment of troops to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine could be a defining moment for the next president, with the budding alliance threatening regional and global security. The prospect of Russia in turn supporting North Korea’s nuclear program 'imperils South Korea, Japan and deployed U.S. forces in the region,' Bolton said in an op-ed for The Hill on Wednesday, warning of an anti-U.S. 'axis' forming with China and Iran also involved. Bolton also predicted that Trump might once again seek to befriend Kim while tossing aside U.S. assurances to Seoul and Tokyo. While visiting Seoul as vice president in September 2022, Harris reiterated America’s 'ironclad' support for its alliance with South Korea and Japan against North Korea. On the campaign trail, she has also pointedly vowed not to 'cozy up' to world dictators like Kim. For his part, Trump has done little to defuse the claims from Harris and Bolton that he is a potential target of 'flattery and favor' from dictators like Kim, arguing in support of his personal touch in tense moments. 'I was with Kim Jong Un. I got along great with him,' Trump said on the Joe Rogan podcast, also recalling his 'great relationship' with China’s Xi. 'That’s a good thing. It’s not a bad thing. It’s a great thing.' During the podcast, Trump recalled how he had goaded North Korea’s autocratic leader into believing the U.S. military was ready 'to go to war' with him before parlaying nuclear threats into a friendship. 'He said, ‘I have a red button on my desk.’ I said, ‘I have a red button also, but mine’s bigger than yours and mine works,’' Trump told Rogan. 'I said, ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beaches.’' 'If you have a smart – really, the right president, the smart president – you’re not going to have a problem' with North Korea, he said. Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that the main takeaway was that Trump would place a great priority on personal relationships while Harris would likely maintain the Biden administration’s efforts at alliance building. 'That means an emphasis on the value of alliances and partnerships and working closely with them,' Chong told Radio Free Asia. 'Trump has indicated far more skepticism toward alliances and partnerships since his previous term in office, with key exceptions such as Israel.' 'Trump seems largely consistent in his rhetoric,' he said, 'which means a likely reconfiguration of U.S. alliances and partnerships.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3GXalCZp1-m4	2024-11-01T16:37:02-07:00	
Israel’s Attack On Iran Has Left Tehran Offensively And Defensive...	By Kian Sharifi (RFE/RL) -- Iran was quick to downplay the impact of Israel's attack on key military sites on its territory on October 26. But satellite images suggest Israel has degraded Tehran's air-defense and missile-production capabilities, analysts say. Fabian Hinz of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said Israel had dealt a 'significant blow' to Iran's ability to produce long-range ballistic missiles. Ability To Sustain Long-Range Attacks On October 1, Iran launched its biggest-ever direct attack on Israel, firing nearly 200 ballistic missiles at its archenemy. Dozens of the missiles, aimed mostly at military sites, penetrated Israel's formidable air defenses. Israel's retaliatory strikes on October 26 were aimed at hindering Iran's production of solid-propellant ballistic missiles that were used by Tehran in its assault, the 'weapons that are of most concern to Israel,' Hinz said. Solid-propellant missiles require fewer personnel and little time to prepare for launch compared to liquid-propellant missiles, Hinz explains, making them ideal for launching volleys in quick succession. Israel struck missile-production sites around Tehran, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East defense specialist at the global intelligence company Janes, says the full extent of the damage caused to the facilities is still unclear. But he adds that Israel likely wanted to prevent Iran from being able to sustain long-range missile exchanges, especially given the numbers it needs to penetrate Israel's formidable air defenses. 'The Israelis probably don't know precisely how many ballistic missiles [Iran] has with the requisite range, but have tried to reduce its ability to replenish is stockpile,' Binnie said. Blinded Offensively And Defensively? Israel's attack was also aimed at weakening Iran's ability to fend off aerial attacks by targeting its radars and Russian-made S-300 air-defense systems. There have been unconfirmed reports quoting U.S. and Israeli officials claiming that three S-300 systems were taken out in the Israeli attack. 'The S-300s are Iran's most capable air-defense capabilities, so targeting them again emphasizes Iran's inability to defend itself and gives the Israeli Air Force more freedom of operation in the future,' Binnie said. Satellite images also showed that at least two radar systems -- one in the western Ilam Province and another in the southwestern Khuzestan Province -- were hit. The radars are an essential part of Iran's early warning system, Hinz told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. Taking them out, he said, would mean Israel had 'degraded Iran's ability to resist any air attack even further, making it more vulnerable.' Fox News quoted a U.S. defense official as saying that the radars also had an offensive purpose, and have been used by Iran to track ballistic missiles after launch to assess their trajectories and course-correct if necessary. Binnie said that 'would be unusual but might explain how [Iran] has achieved a fairly high level of accuracy with its ballistic missiles -- though not good enough to do really significant damage.' Impact On Iranian Retaliation There are growing numbers of reports that Tehran is considering retaliating against Israel as the extent of the damage caused by the October 26 attack becomes clearer. Given that Iran has suffered damage to both its offensive and defensive capabilities, it is unclear if it can launch another large-scale attack on Israel, experts say. Binnie said the United States' deployment to Israel of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), an advanced anti-missile system, will further 'swing the balance in [Israel's] favor.' Media reports citing Israeli sources say that Iran is preparing to launch an aerial attack on Israel using Tehran-backed Shi'ite militant groups in Iraq. That would suggest the Islamic republic hopes its proxies will absorb the brunt of a potential Israeli response.

Sudan Crisis Escalates As Attacks In Al Jazirah Spark Mass Displa...	UN Secretary General António Guterres has strongly condemned escalating attacks by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s Al Jazirah state, as new reports reveal over 135,000 civilians were displaced in just 10 days. 'The Secretary General is appalled by the large numbers of civilians being killed, detained and displaced, acts of sexual violence against women and girls, the looting of homes and markets and the burning of farms,' said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric in a statement issued on Friday. The Secretary-General warned that 'such acts may constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Perpetrators must be held accountable'. Humanitarian crisis intensifies Speaking to journalists at the noon briefing in New York, Mr. Dujarric reported that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has documented more than 135,000 people displaced from locations across Al Jazirah between 20 and 30 October. 'More than half have fled to Gedaref state, with nearly a third seeking shelter in Kassala state,' he noted. The UN aid coordination office OCHA expressed 'deep concern' about civilians trapped by the ongoing fighting as well as those forced to flee. 'As we have repeatedly said, civilians must be protected whether they move or stay, and they must be able to receive the humanitarian assistance they need,' Mr. Dujarric emphasised. Supporting displaced people In response to the deteriorating humanitarian crisis, UN agencies and humanitarian partners – particularly local organizations and volunteers – are providing emergency assistance to new arrivals, including family tracing, reunification services and mental health support. However, with hunger and disease spreading and half the population now requiring aid, the UN Secretary-General 'demands all parties facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians in need through all necessary routes,' the statement continued. Renewing his call for an immediate ceasefire, Mr. Guterres also announced that his Personal Envoy will 'continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders to de-escalate this conflict and strengthen civilian protection measures.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3M-9T5C7JsAl	2024-11-01T16:33:03-07:00	
Ralph Nader: Weakened By Its Past Cowardliness, The Democratic Pa...	Over the years, the Democratic Party’s blunders, arrogance and dependence on commercial campaign money and corporate-conflicted political/media consultants have put the two-party duopoly races for the Presidency, the Senate and the House next week into razor-thin elections. The polls show Democrats in neck-and-neck races with the worst GOP since its creation in 1854. The GOP is led by a delusionary, daily lying, violence-inciting, bigoted, misogynist, serial election denier, convicted felon, and wannabe dictator, Donald Trump, who can’t process information but has openly boasted that he knows more than everybody. The Party of the Donkey deteriorated years ago and opened the door to unnecessary close cliff-hanger elections. The Dems wrote off nearly half of the country (the red states) to the Republicans. This abandonment included the prairie states (North and South Dakota) and the mountain states that used to have many Democratic Senators. Now they have only three Senators from seven states. The next Democratic party blunder was not to support the National Popular Vote drive to overcome the Electoral College. (See: nationalpopularvote.com). This is the anachronism that cost the Democrats two presidential losses — one in 2000 and one in 2016 — even though the Democratic presidential candidate handily won the national popular vote. Third, the Democratic Party decided to robustly compete with the GOP and dial for the same business campaign cash in return for relenting from progressive policies. Fourth, the Dems lost the gerrymandering drive in 2010 when they were caught napping against a vigorous GOP drive to control key state legislatures like Pennsylvania and get more GOP members in the House of Representatives. What should the Dems do for the people in the next four days? Bernie Sanders is the most popular elected politician in the country. Why? Because Sanders, two-time presidential candidate, wants social safety net policies that are well received by working families where they live, work, and raise their families. He has urged Kamala Harris to authentically campaign to raise the federal minimum wage frozen at $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour for over 25 million workers, raise Social Security benefits, frozen for over 50 years for over 60 million elderly, and raise taxes on the undertaxed wealthy and big corporations (for a hike supported by 85% of the people.) These three measures also appeal to many self-described conservative voters. So, what does Harris do? She does not campaign with the popular Bernie. She advertises heavily and campaigns instead with Liz Cheney who supported the war criminals Dick Cheney and G.W. Bush in their criminal invasion and sociocide of Iraq taking over one million innocent Iraqi lives and leaving that country in ruins. Liz Cheney, an avowed Republican opponent of Trump, is also a confirmed corporatist. Forgetting Sanders and heralding Cheney is not the way to turn out low-wage voters who make up a good portion of the expected 85 million eligible non-voters in next Tuesday’s election. Unable to adjust, the Democratic Party keeps pouring billions of dollars into the same mediocre ads showing Trump to be unfit for office. These repetitive video spots by now have reached diminishing returns, as a vote-getter. Almost everyone has already made up their mind on Trump’s deficiencies. The ads should shift quickly to overcoming an astonishing amnesia by a majority of voters who think they were better off economically under Trump’s term than under Biden’s. They have forgotten Trump’s closing down any efforts to secure full Medicare for All, enact higher minimum wages, and initiate enforcement efforts against corporate crooks squeezing money from the American people. All the while he was early mocking the oncoming Covid-19 pandemic and calling intense climate catastrophes 'a hoax.' His deadly delays regarding Covid led to the preventable loss of some 300,000 American lives and worsened the associated recession. The Democratic Party ads have been largely AWOL on this abysmal record while focusing expensively on Trump personally. Instead of aligning with worker unions and progressive civic groups working to benefit all people, Harris ogles up to big business bosses, thereby jettisoning media and video opportunities to be with pro-party groups with millions of members. Harris has learned little from Hillary Clinton’s disastrous loss to Trump in 2016. She continues to be supportive of the U.S. Empire and, despite more dulcet tones, is aligned with Bibi-Biden’s massive weapons and diplomatic engagement with mega-terrorist Netanyahu’s genocide of the Palestinians and now the Lebanese. She cannot even get herself to propose immediate peace negotiations over the Russian/Ukrainian war bogged down month after month with large casualties on both sides. These stands would separate her a little from Biden which would help identify her as her own person. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, running for the presidency in 1968, declined to break with President Johnson on the Vietnam War. Analysts believe that cost him in the tight race against Richard Nixon because many Democratic voters stayed home. There is still time to highlight Bernie Sanders’ protections for the people. There is still time to recognize the millions of midnight shift workers who do not see a candidate and would welcome recognition by Democratic candidates – local, state, and national. (See: winningamerica.net/midnightcampaigning). There is still time to pledge compliance with six federal laws being violated by unconditional weapons shipments to Israel’s war in Palestine. Backed by majority public opinion, she should strongly DEMAND an immediate ceasefire, entry of U.S. humanitarian aid trucks to the starving, dying innocent people of Gaza, and a cessation of the Palestinian Holocaust by the Israeli regime that has already taken at least 400,000 Palestinian lives, mostly children, women and elderly. If Harris doesn’t advance these policies, she’ll be telling people that she will just be an extension of the Biden presidency. These actions may not be enough to bring out the stay-at-home voters who in the past had voted for the Democratic candidate, but they have a higher probability than just staying the cursed course.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3CFuaWDhOyML	2024-11-01T16:29:46-07:00	
The October Surprise Is Here – And It’s Garbage – OpEd	By Graham J Noble Just in the nick of time, with October done and the 2024 general election less than a week away, America may finally have its much-anticipated October surprise. Who would have thought it would come in the form of a single word: garbage? A comedian at the massive Madison Square Garden (MSG) Trump rally joked about Puerto Rico being a 'floating island of garbage,' and days later, Joe Biden used that same word to describe Donald Trump’s supporters. There are several reasons the two comments are in no way similar and why one is so much worse than the other. And then there’s the spectacle of the White House and its media allies contorting into pretzels, trying to explain away, justify, or bury Biden’s incredibly ill-timed garbage comment. First, some perspective on the MSG routine of Trump supporter and comedian Tony Hinchcliffe is necessary. A few of his alleged jokes were off-color. The comic certainly came off as a man who has a problem with Latinos – but that could be nothing more than a matter of perception. His invitation to appear at the New York rally was probably a bad idea in hindsight. The Garbage Can-Can One specific wisecrack, however, sent the left-wing media into a frenzy. 'I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,' Hinchcliffe told his audience. 'Yeah, I think it’s called Puerto Rico.' After bipartisan backlash against this joke, he took to social media to criticize people for having no sense of humor. He pointed out that he is fond of Puerto Rico and vacations there. It is very likely that, during a visit to the island, the performer witnessed firsthand a chronic problem Puerto Ricans have been battling for years – an issue that has been covered by the media. The US territory has been struggling with overflowing landfills and, as a result, with garbage strewn about the otherwise beautiful island. It seems clear that the comic was not referring to the people of Puerto Rico as garbage. To suggest otherwise is a stretch. Fast forward a couple of days to someone else clearly describing a certain group of human beings as garbage. During a campaign call to Voto Latino, which describes itself as a 'civic engagement organization focused on educating and empowering a new generation of Latinx voters,' the White House incumbent took his cue from Hinchcliffe’s quip about Puerto Rico. 'Donald Trump has no character,' Biden asserted. 'He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community.' Shortly after, he added: 'And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know … or Puerto Rico where I … in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' There really is no alternative way to interpret that last sentence, though the White House communications people have tried to – in entirely unconvincing ways. Elements of the left-wing media are also circling the wagons around the lame-duck commander-in-chief. One news outlet even went so far as to reframe what Biden said. Politico reported, 'Biden, in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino, said ‘the only garbage’ was the ‘hatred’ of Donald Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.' It was a sneaky way of reimagining what Biden said while avoiding quoting him verbatim. It is another in the almost endless list of examples of how far certain media companies will go to cover for Biden and Kamala Harris when they make misleading, dishonest, incomprehensible, or offensive remarks. One CNN panelist, Franklin Leonard, with a straight face, claimed that Biden only sounded as if he were denigrating Trump supporters because the president had a stutter when growing up. The White House attempted to alter Biden’s statement using a strategically placed apostrophe. The official transcript of his remark reads, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s' – the inference being that Biden was referring directly to Hinchcliffe’s Puerto Rico quip. Everyone is familiar with Biden’s speech patterns, however, and his phraseology. This White House version of what he said just doesn’t fit the way the man speaks. When one also considers the number of times in past speeches that the chief executive has expressed his contempt not only for Trump but also for his supporters, there’s no credible debate about the words that came out of Biden’s mouth and what he meant. While the media continues to spin this as something other than what it appears to be, however, certain elected Democrat senators seem to have taken his comments at face value and are in the process of distancing themselves. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, John Tester of Montana, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, and Arizona candidate for the US Senate, Ruben Gallego, all expressed to Fox News that they disagreed profoundly with the president’s comments. Donald Trump, on the other hand, wasted no time in taking advantage of Biden’s latest gaffe. At his rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump rode around – in uniform – in a MAGA-emblazoned garbage truck. 'I have to start by saying 250 million Americans are not garbage,' Trump then told the audience. 'My supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe and Lying Kamala.' The Not-So-Surprising October Surprise So, on the one hand, you have left-wing pundits, politicians, and their media allies getting into a frenzy over a comedian cracking a joke about a geographical area being an island of garbage. On the other, these very same supposedly outraged people are making excuses for someone on their side describing practically half of all Americans as garbage. It appears that, for some, the moral compass is spinning wildly. The next couple of days will reveal whether this was, indeed, the October surprise everyone had been expecting but that no one had on their bingo card. There is one other point to be made about this latest battle over words. The relative positions of power and influence occupied by the speakers of contentious remarks determine how much gravity is added to the words spoken. As Mark Angelides, Liberty Nation’s editor-in-chief, points out: 'It is worth making a delineation. Tony Hinchcliffe is a comedian whose job is to be edgy and make jokes. Jokes are not necessarily reflective of the performer’s opinion – less reflective of the person whose name is on the top ticket [Trump]. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is not only the president of the United States, but he is also Kamala’s boss and, presumably, her most significant surrogate.' Was Biden’s comment about Trump supporters the October surprise, then? In general, one would define this mysterious but widely anticipated phenomenon as an unexpected event significant enough to potentially swing an election decisively in one direction or the other. Biden made the remark just as Harris – his vice president – was about to make her final case to the nation for her own White House bid. By doing so, he overshadowed her address and stole the media spotlight. Any bump Harris might have received post-speech was likely erased. Factor in the number of people who, in both 2016 and 2020, asserted they could not vote for Trump because of his rhetoric, his insults, and his famously mean tweets. Now add to the equation a sitting president effectively suggesting that everyone who votes – or has voted – for the 45th president is garbage. One could certainly argue the badly timed and decidedly ill-conceived remark meets the criteria for an October surprise.

North Korea Pledges Support To Russia ‘Until Victory’ In Ukraine	North Korea’s foreign minister Friday pledged to support Russia 'until it achieves victory' in its war against Ukraine, during a visit to Moscow as some 8,000 North Korean troops are reportedly poised to join Russian troops on the battlefield. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui held talks with her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. As cameras rolled after their meeting, each praised the new levels that the relationship between the two nations has reached. The North Korean top diplomat accused the United States and South Korea of a military build-up and war provocations, and praised Russia’s efforts to put an end to 'hegemonic practices of the U.S. and the West and to establish a new international order.' She said the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has unwavering faith that Russia will achieve victory and said her country will stand with them until that victory is achieved. Lavrov expressed Russia’s gratitude for its Korean friends and for their 'principled' position regarding 'the events that have now unfolded in Ukraine,' and praised the 'very close contacts' that 'have been established between the military of the two countries.' Neither diplomat made any direct reference to North Korean troops being deployed in the region. Speaking Friday in Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a joint briefing with his South Korean counterpart it is believed at least 10,000 North Korean troops are set to be deployed to the region, with about 8,000 of them already in Russia’s Kursk oblast. At the same news conference, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. expects North Korean troops to enter the war against Ukraine in the coming days. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials said, adding that Russia is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. In an interview with Estonia’s public broadcaster ERR Friday, Estonian Defense Forces intelligence chief Colonel Ants Kiviselg said he thinks North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses, potentially even more than the Russians. He said they are not familiar with or trained for combat in the region’s terrain, climate or geography. Also Friday, the U.S. Defense Department, or DOD, announced an additional $425 million in security assistance for Ukraine. It is the 69th tranche of equipment to be provided from DOD inventories for Ukraine since August of 2021. In a statement, the department said the defense package will provide Ukraine with assets to help the country meet some of its most urgent security needs, including air defense interceptors, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. The statement said the United States will continue to work together with some 50 allies and partners through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and its associated capability coalitions to meet Ukraine's urgently needed battlefield requirements and defend against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, Kyiv’s military reported Friday that Russia launched 2,023 drone attacks on Ukraine in October, the most since the war began. The report said that the total is nearly 700 higher than the number of attacks launched in September, the month with the previous record for drone attacks. The report said Russia has launched 6,987 since the beginning of 2024. Earlier Friday, Russia's Defense Ministry reported its defenses shot down 83 Ukrainian drones over six regions early on Friday. In a statement posted to its Telegram social media channel, the ministry said, '36 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, 20 over the Bryansk region, 12 over Crimea, eight over the Voronezh region, four over the Oryol region, and three over the Belgorod region.' Separately, Aleksandr Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk, said one person was wounded when a Ukrainian drone crashed into an apartment building in the city of Bryansk. In the Stavropol region, a drone fell on an oil depot in the city of Svetlograd, regional Governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram. In Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, a Russian missile struck a fire station, wounding two firefighters, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air force said its defenses shot down 31 Russian drones and one missile over nine regions — Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Vinnytsya, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Chernihiv and Poltava.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3Eo5ujm5ZI0e	2024-11-01T16:26:14-07:00	
Moscow Struggles To Find Allies For Ukraine War – Analysis	By Luke Coffey The BRICS summit in Kazan last week was intended to signal to the international community — and particularly the West — that Russia remains influential and far from isolated by its war on Ukraine, but the outcomes for Moscow were mixed. The BRICS countries could not come to a unified stance on Ukraine. Their final declaration briefly stated: 'We recall national positions concerning the situation in and around Ukraine,' and 'all states should act consistently with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter in their entirety and interrelation.' This minimal mention of Ukraine, coupled with a general nod to the UN Charter, exposed the divisions within BRICS on this key issue. Ukraine remains Russia’s most pressing national security and foreign policy concern. As both summit host and BRICS president, Russia aimed to forge a unified front on the conflict. But the failure to gain consensus was a major diplomatic setback, emphasizing the challenges Russia faces in reconciling the diverse and often divergent interests within BRICS. Given the varied political landscapes of its member countries, the lack of consensus on Ukraine should not be surprising. BRICS brings together nations with longstanding regional rivalries and conflicting global perspectives. For instance, relations between China and India remain tense over their unresolved border. Iran and the UAE often find themselves on opposite sides of issues in the Gulf, while Egypt and Ethiopia are frequently at odds over regional concerns, particularly the Nile’s water resources. These differences mean that reaching alignment on controversial issues, especially those as complex as Ukraine, is challenging at best. For some BRICS members, such as Russia and China, the group offers a way to establish an alternative to what they view as a G7 and West-dominated global system. They see BRICS as a counterbalance to perceived Western hegemony, providing a space to challenge established norms and build influence. However, other BRICS members view their participation as supplementary to their relationships with the West rather than a replacement. These countries seek balanced engagement on several fronts, prioritizing economic cooperation and stability without necessarily subscribing to an anti-Western stance. This split in purpose and perspective makes it difficult to achieve unified action within BRICS on divisive issues such as Ukraine. This reflects broader international divides on the conflict. Within Europe, attitudes toward the war are mixed, and signs of war fatigue are emerging. In many European states, parties on both the far left and far right are calling for reduced aid to Ukraine. Leaders in Hungary and Slovakia, for example, have publicly questioned the wisdom of continued support, calling instead for territorial concessions to Russia in the interest of a negotiated peace. This lack of unity among NATO members was evident at the alliance’s Washington summit in July, when high hopes for a clear path to membership for Ukraine went unmet. The war in Ukraine is also a significant point of division in the US, where the two leading presidential candidates hold opposing views. Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed a firm stance in support of Ukraine, although she has not indicated that her approach would differ significantly from the policy of the Biden administration. On the other hand, former President Donald Trump has suggested he could negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, which would probably involve Ukraine ceding territory and agreeing to remain outside NATO and the EU. As each country formulates its own policy, certain foundational truths must remain central. When Ukraine declared independence in 1991, its borders — including Crimea — were internationally recognized, including by Russia. This underscores why Russia has struggled to find support for its war outside a small group of allies such as North Korea, Iran, and Belarus. Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in the 1990s with assurances from Russia and the international community that its borders would be respected. Since then, Ukraine has consistently adhered to its obligations under the UN Charter, making it essential that any resolution to the conflict respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity and aligns with international law. As the situation continues to evolve, shifts in political leadership across the globe could alter the support landscape for Ukraine. The US election will lead to a new administration, and possibly a change in policy on Ukraine. Additionally, several European countries are preparing for elections, and shifting public opinion could usher in governments less inclined to support Ukraine. Meanwhile Russia continues to use platforms such as BRICS to advance its agenda and assert its relevance on the global stage, though the summit highlighted the limitations of this approach. The path forward remains uncertain. The inability of BRICS to agree on Ukraine reflects a broader, fractured global response to the conflict, a reality that Ukraine and its allies must navigate carefully in the months ahead.

Lebanon PM Says Expanded Strikes Suggest Israel Rejects Truce	By Najia Houssari Israel bombarded the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday as caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused it of 'stubbornness' in negotiations. Israeli attacks came amid stalled talks by two US envoys in Israel in an attempt to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Mikati reaffirmed Lebanon’s continued commitment to UN resolution 1701 and its provisions. Mikati said he believed that Israel’s 'renewed expansion of the scope of its aggression on Lebanese regions, its repeated threats to the population to evacuate entire cities and villages, and its renewed targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut with destructive raids are all indicators that confirm Israel’s rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire in preparation for the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701.' He said: 'Israeli statements and diplomatic signals that Lebanon received confirm Israel’s stubbornness in rejecting the proposed solutions and insisting on the approach of killing and destruction. 'This places the entire international community before its historical and moral responsibilities to stop this aggression.' Mikati denied the claims of two Reuters sources on Friday, which stated that the US 'had asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to inject momentum into stalled talks on a deal to end hostilities.' His media office said that the Lebanese government’s stance was 'clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and the implementation of Resolution 1701.' Mikati’s warning came as the Israeli Air Force carried out 14 raids against neighborhoods in Beirut’s southern suburbs after two weeks of cautious calm in the area. The raids affected Burj Al-Barajneh, Rweis, Haret Hreik, Hadath and the old airport road. Twelve raids targeted Baalbek-Hermel, causing further casualties, including entire families. In Amhazieh alone, 12 people died in a raid, most of whom were children, while a woman was killed and five were injured in a raid in Taraya, west of Baalbek. Three people were killed in Hrabta, while another was killed in Kasarnaba. Before the raids, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee sent evacuation warnings to residents at about 3.30 a.m., which was followed by heavy shooting by Hezbollah members to alert sleeping residents in the areas targeted. People left their homes in pyjamas, carrying their children along the streets near the old airport road, one of the targeted areas During a week-long period of relative calm, many residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs returned to their homes, which were not affected by previous raids. The raids caused widespread destruction in these areas, which are considered by the Israeli army as Hezbollah’s security square, although the Lebanese consider the area residential. In a statement on Friday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed concern over 'the impact of the Israeli operations on civilians and infrastructure in Lebanon.' Israeli strikes on the ancient cities of Tyre and Baalbek, home to UNESCO-designated Roman ruins, were endangering Lebanon’s cultural heritage, said UN special coordinator Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. 'Ancient Phoenician cities steeped in history are in deep peril of being left in ruins,' Hennis-Plasschaert said in a social media post, adding that Lebanon’s cultural heritage 'must not become yet another casualty in this devastating conflict.' Her appeal came as Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said: 'Since last September, Israel has wasted more than one opportunity to reach a ceasefire, implement Resolution 1701, restore calm, and return the displaced to both sides of the border.' He underlined Lebanon’s 'commitment to implementing Resolution 1701 as the only option to achieve regional security and stability.' MP Michel Moussa, a parliamentary Development and Liberation Bloc member, said Berri 'has been informed that ceasefire negotiations have reached an impasse.' Moussa said Israel had shown no intention to negotiate, appearing to await US elections as a 'significant turning point.' During his meeting with US special envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel 'is determined to confront the threats in the north. Any ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon must guarantee Israel’s security.' He added: 'There is pressure to prematurely achieve a settlement in Lebanon, and reality has proven otherwise. 'I did not set a date for the war’s end, but I set clear goals for victory,' Netanyahu said. 'We respect Resolutions 1701 and 1559, but they are not the main thing.' The Israeli airstrikes, which continued on Friday morning and during the day, targeted a residential apartment in the town of Qmatiyeh in Aley, killing three members of a family living there and wounding five. They also targeted dozens of towns in the south and northern Bekaa after the city of Baalbek turned into a ghost town as a result of renewed Israeli warnings against the return of those who were displaced from it. Israeli attacks on Baalbek-Hermel Governorate and Central Bekaa include 1,035 airstrikes, which have killed 528 and 1,069 injured people. According to a report by the ministerial emergency committee, the toll has risen to 2,822 dead and 12,937 wounded since the first attack by Israel against Lebanon about 14 months. Hezbollah MP Hussein Hajj Hassan estimated that about '60,000 people were displaced from Baalbek and Hermel, and the figure needs to be updated daily.' In a report on its field operations against the Israeli army, Hezbollah said that 'more than 95 soldiers were killed, 900 others wounded, and 42 Merkava tanks were destroyed' since the ground offensive began. 'Three Hermes 450 and two Hermes 900 drones were shot down. Israeli forces are trying not to move or change their positions in the fields, fearing being targeted,' Hezbollah said. The UNIFIL commander, Gen. Aroldo Lazaro, visited Mikati and Berri on Friday to discuss the ongoing military operations against Lebanon and the difficulties and threats UNIFIL faces while carrying out its mission. Mikati emphasized the importance of 'adhering to the role of UNIFIL, recognizing its importance in the south and not compromising its rules of work and the missions it is carrying out in close cooperation with the Lebanese army.' In Israel, sirens sounded in several settlements in the Galilee panhandle, coinciding with an Israeli announcement 'detecting around 10 rockets being launched from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted and others landed in open areas.' Hezbollah announced targeting 'Kiryat Shmona, Hatzor HaGlilit, Kidmat Tzvi, Yesod HaMa’ala and Karmiel,' and a group of soldiers near the Lebanese border town of Khiyam. Also on Friday, a 17th Saudi relief plane, operated by the Saudi aid agency KSRelief, landed at Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut, carrying food, shelter and medical aid, the Saudi Press Agency reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3OlP07Co6xSm	2024-11-01T16:22:20-07:00	
Russia’s Ambitious Economic Engagement With Africa Remains Symbol...	With renewed and full-fledged interest to engage in diverse economic sectors across Africa still largely remains full of symbolism and expression of policy interest. Russia considers the existing growth of neo-colonial tendencies as impediments for investment. Rather focusing on its own investment to showcase African leaders and elites within the context of current geopolitical developments, Russian officials are rather criticizing the United States and Europeans for the scramble for resources in Africa. Afrter the first (October 2019) and second (St. Petersburg, July 2023) summits, both Russian and African officials are still at the crossroads over concrete spheres of economic cooperation. The two summit declarations will now be reviewed and revised at the forthcoming first Russia-Africa ministerial conference this early November in Sochi, the southern city in the Russian Federation. Ahead of the conference, Dr. Gideon Shoo, media consultant and business lobbyist based in Kilimanjaro Region in Tanzania, explained in this interview what Russian investors and other participants can expect from the Kremlin, Russian political leaders and corporate business executives from the public and private sectors for subsequent collaboration with Africa. Following are excerpts from the interview: Africa Beyond Aid! What should African leaders do in order to raise mutual cooperation with Russia? Let us look at this question on the reverse side, from the African side. Gideon Shoo: African leaders must strive to understand their counterparts in Russia. They need to understand the political system in Russia, and at least, the economic policies and interests. At the same time, they need to demonstrate what they can do in terms of helping Russia overcome some of the economic hitches as a result of sanctions imposed on her by the United States and the European Union. They should engage in 'a scratch my back I scratch yours' relationship given the fact that Russia is advanced in technology which is badly needed in Africa. Russia has several bilateral agreements, at least, during the past decade, and including from the first and second summits that were largely not implemented in many African countries. In your view, what mechanisms be fixed to deliver on pledges and promises? GS: This is quite an important aspect of Russia-African relationship. Bilateral agreements need to be revised and schedules of implementation be drawn wherever possible. Russia needs to go back to those years when it committed itself to support Africa get out of neo-colonial cobweb by assisting in crucial and important areas such as education, public health and engineering. That was partly done through offering higher and specialized education as one way of development assistance to the continent. But time has practically changed, that Africa needs multifaceted investment in its economic sectors and to undertake critical infrastructure projects as an integral part of securing its economic sovereignty. Of course, priority spheres include energy, oil & gas, infrastructure etc., but what kinds of state support be offered Russian companies and enterprises to operate effectively in Africa? GS: Russian companies need to prove their superiority in the sector mentioned above. The companies should show how African countries are going to benefit. African governments must make it easier for Russian companies to set up and operate in their countries. Russian financial institutions can offer credit support that will allow them to localize their production in Africa's industrial zones, especially southern and eastern African regions that show some stability and have good investment and business incentives. In order to operate more effectively, Russians have to risk by investing, recognize the importance of cooperation on key investment issues and to work closely on the challenges and opportunities on the continent. Of course, Russians have been trying to return there over the past few years, which is a very commendable step forward. There are prospects for greater or broader foreign players. Until potential Russian investors make a decision to pay more high-level attention to Africa, it is difficult to see greater engagement at the economic or business level. In practical sense, it requires to move beyond mere expression of interests, it needs strategic focus and pragmatic approach from both Russians and African governments. According to official figures, Russia-African trade currently stands at $23.8 billion. Could trade preferences help potential African exporters (make it a two-way road) also to explore the Russian market? GS: Russia is, so far, a closed market to many African countries. It is difficult to access the Russian market. There are no direct flights to most African capitals, and it makes Russia not a common destination even to the Vasco da Gamas of Africa. While tropical fruits and vegetables are rotting in Africa, the Russian market is yawning because of sanctions. Why not work out a two-way traffic between Africa and Russia? African countries have to look to new emerging markets for export products, make efforts to negotiate for access to these markets. This can be another aspect of the economic cooperation and great business opportunity for both regions. Talking about Russia's presence in Africa and Africa's presence in Russia. Understandably, much also depends on the interest of African business-people; but what should be done to stimulate or boost potential African exporters' interest in Russia? GS: Visits. Visits. Official Visits. These official visits proliferate, to and fro African capitals and Moscow. But, how can this be achieved if there are no direct affordable flights? Can Africa and Russia establish links through joint ventures including those in aviation? Yes, I think and believe it is possible. Can Africa, especially south of the Sahara be a tourist destination for Russians and vice versa? Yes, it is possible. For instance, tourism can primarily help to broaden cultural horizons, breaking stereotypes and attitudes. Developing tourism is one way to promote business and raise knowledge of diverse culture in Africa. By looking at the rules and regulations, the situation about Russia's presence in Africa and Africa's presence in Russia can be changed. Russia and Africa have to make efforts for raising the level of trade and business in both regions. St. Petersburg and Sochi summits seemingly hold the key to all these questions you have so far discussed above. Can these, among others and in reality, mark a definitive start of a new dawn in the Russia-African relations? GS: In the first place, Russians and Africans have to look at this positively. It will offer participants the opportunity to engage in dialogue, receive up-to-date information on the current trends, challenges and prospects of investment activities as well as networking for business contacts. It is also important that African leaders determine and set their development priorities. Russia's policy is full of skyline symbolism. Interestingly, I think both St. Petersburg and Sochi summits have already been considered as new chapters in Russia-Africa cooperation, but unfortunately not as there remains concrete steps to take in determining where to invest in and what projects worth undertaking in Africa. It all depends on how serious Russian and African leaders together with summit and conference participants see it happen in practical terms. The first step, of course, should be a complete departure away from policy rhetoric, its hard time to act on policy decisions. In any case, the gathering has to offer the expected fruits, leave a long-term and sustainable impact and memories, and indeed, should open the door to Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3EyOj3nC9F6r	2024-11-01T16:20:48-07:00	
To Combat Demographic Decline, Moscow Must Focus On Mortality Rat...	Demography is not destiny, but declining demographic trends impose limits on what a country can do in the long term. Russia’s population decline is becoming its most pressing issue, and one Russian newspaper warned that demography is now the Kremlin’s most serious constraint (see EDM, October 24, 2023; NG.ru, April 18). Unsurprisingly, President Vladimir Putin has sought to limit the demographic decline’s effects on Russia. In response, Putin has been importing migrant workers, an approach that is becoming increasingly unpopular among Russians in large part because of Moscow-promoted nationalist policies (see EDM, February 6, May 15, October 22). Most recently, Putin has enlisted North Korean troops to fight in his war in Ukraine (see EDM, October 30; The Kyiv Independent, October 31). He has sought to squeeze more work and military service out of the existing population by allowing older men to serve and boosting signing bonuses (see EDM, October 24; Window on Eurasia, October 30). In addition, Putin is requiring the elderly to go back to work and those in the workforce to do overtime; neither group is enthusiastic about the state’s rising demands on them and their time (Iarex.ru, October 29; Moscow Times, September 9). Over the last several years, Putin has focused on boosting Russia’s birthrate by promoting the image of large families as the Russian ideal, paying women to have children, and making both abortion and divorce more difficult (Window on Eurasia, August 7; see EDM, October 1). Putin has not done anything to address the country’s increasingly high mortality rate despite Moscow’s seeming priority to control its population decline. Russian demographers say that Russia’s most significant bottleneck lies in its mortality rate, which is more susceptible to policy changes than its birth rate, though such reforms would require a ruler in the country willing to make them (Holod, October 16). . These steps would include expensive and fundamental alterations to both domestic and foreign policy—ones Putin shows no sign of willingness to undertake. Demographers suggest all his talk about boosting the birth rate is, first and foremost, a smokescreen to conceal his almost complete unwillingness to address mortality issues. Russia’s fertility rate—the number of children per woman in her lifetime—has fallen well below replacement levels, much as in other European countries. Russia’s mortality rate—the number of deaths relative to the population as a whole—however, is far higher than in all other developed and urbanized countries. This is due in part to the fact that most of these states have adopted social policies designed to reduce death rates and boost life expectancy. Given that pattern, demographers say Russia should focus on reducing the latter if it is to prevent the country’s total population from continuing to shrink, possibly to as few as 100 million by the end of this century. According to Russian demographers Aby Shukyurov and Dmitry Zakotyansky, the Russian government has focused almost exclusively on boosting birth rates, something it thinks it can do despite all the evidence to the contrary from its own experience and that of other countries. Moscow does this while ignoring far more effective policies that would reduce mortality rates. Shukyurov pointedly notes that while Russia’s birth rate is lower now than at any time in the past, it 'might be fine' given that the country is becoming increasingly urbanized. Its mortality rate, on the other hand, 'is anything but.' While Russia’s birth rate is comparable to Europe’s, its mortality rate is far higher, and the causes of death are different as well. In Russia, cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of death, while in Europe—which has used various healthcare strategies to reduce those—cancer is now the leading cause. Zakotyansky, for his part, points out that economic inequality is a significant contributing factor to Russia’s low life expectancy, with as many as 40 percent of all Russians living in poverty, continuing to smoke and drink heavily, and more likely to be involved in or affected by crime. The Kremlin could do more to combat all of these economic inequalities, but is not. Moreover, both demographers say that Russia’s demographic situation has been seriously affected by the war in Ukraine, a conflict which, according to some estimates, has killed 120,000 Russian soldiers and injured more than 400,000 more. Once again, the regime could improve the country’s demography by bringing the long war to an end. Even when Putin does talk about the mortality rate, he obscures the true figures by playing games with statistics, as the real numbers are too horrific. Apart from fertility questions, the mortality rate is almost always discussed so as not to lead to any challenge to Putin’s policies (Tochno, March 14; Window on Eurasia, March 18). Presently, the Kremlin wants to block questions regarding Putin’s healthcare 'optimization' program, his decade-long effort to cut back healthcare facilities so as to allocate more money for other projects, including his war in Ukraine. Hospitals and medical centers have been shuttered across the country, making Russians increasingly angry (Novaya Gazeta, September 16). Reversing his course now would be prohibitively expensive. To just return to what Russia’s mortality rates were in 1991, academician Robert Nigmatullin says Russia would have to double the share of its gross domestic product (GDP) spent on healthcare. Otherwise, it will continue to suffer 200,000 or more excess deaths every year (Nakanune.ru, June 27, 2023). Looming behind these immediate healthcare and financial concerns is another that is likely to grow and play an increasing role in Putin’s failure to address mortality issues. Even though abortion rates have fallen 90 percent from Soviet times, research suggests that this occurred for many reasons, and that a pro-natalist hyperfocus on them has proved less effective than advertised (Tochno, July 28, 2023; Cherta, September 5). Additionally, to the horror of many Russian nationalists, mortality rates are far higher in predominantly ethnically Russian regions of the country than they are in non-ethnically Russian regions, while fertility rates remain higher in the former than the latter (Window on Eurasia, July 30). Failure to address the high mortality rate means that the Russian Federation will become ever less ethnically Russian, despite Putin’s increasing support for a Russian nationalist agenda (see EDM, October 29). Even worse, from his perspective, Moscow’s pro-natalist policies, besides being overwhelmingly ineffective in ethnically Russian areas, appear to be maintaining or even boosting the high birthrates in non-ethnically Russian regions, exactly the opposite of what the Kremlin leader wants (Kavkazr.Realii, October 23). Focusing only on what Putin says he is doing to address the demographic situation distracts from what is really going on: a continuing population decline exacerbated by his focus on pushing for a higher fertility rate rather than also helping to reduce the super-high mortality rate. Unfortunately, both for Putin and Russia, those being deceived by his words almost certainly include the Kremlin leader himself, making any change of course highly unlikely before dramatic demographic collapse or his departure from power.

Russia’s Influence Machine – Analysis	By the time Burkina Faso’s health ministry declared an epidemic of dengue fever on October 18, 2023, there already were thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was the West African country’s deadliest bout with the disease in years. Another dangerous outbreak quickly followed: a deluge of Russian disinformation. Social media users, including many believed to be backed by the Russian government, began attacking work by Target Malaria, a not-for-profit research organization that fights mosquito-borne illnesses. The group, which is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has worked to prevent malaria in Burkina Faso since 2012. 'But an army of fake social media users falsely accused the group of spreading disease, weaponizing mosquitoes, and creating biological weapons, while heaping praise on Russia,' according to Agence France-Presse. In the face of the organized disinformation campaign, Target Malaria was forced to respond by calling the attacks 'false' and 'deeply regrettable.' Experts say the disinformation campaign is just one part of a concerted, systematic effort by Russia to sow mistrust in basic institutions such as health care, the government, the United Nations and even international humanitarian organizations. Central to the Russian campaign was the African Initiative, an online outlet with deep ties to the late Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who built a shadowy network of mercenary, disinformation and mining operations in Africa before he was killed in a mysterious plane crash in August 2023. In the wake of Prigozhin’s death, the Russian Defense Ministry has taken over the Wagner Group’s operations on the continent and rebranded it under the name Africa Corps. Just as cases of dengue fever in Burkina Faso were surging in September 2023, the Russian military-run Zvezda TV broadcast a news story announcing the launch of the African Initiative. Artyom Kureev, African Initiative director-general, has said his organization aims to become the 'information bridge between Russia and Africa.' But its real goal is to disguise and spread disinformation in the hope that it will be seen as independent reporting and not as a Moscow-directed propaganda campaign. The WHO reported a surge of dengue fever cases from six in July 2023 to 'a staggering 708 cases' by September 9 and urged collaboration with partners such as Target Malaria. 'Given the positivity ratio … it is imperative to uphold and reinforce public health measures,' the WHO said in a weekly bulletin. Russian disinformation networks made that task much more difficult. Dr. Mark Duerksen, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS), has spent years analyzing the growing impact of disinformation campaigns on the continent’s rapidly changing information systems. He called the recent Burkina Faso disinformation campaign Russia’s likely 'next wave.' 'There are indications that the African Initiative is probing public health as something amenable to this kind of information warfare,' he told ADF. 'They seem to have found another soft spot that they’re going to exploit. It’s really cynical because it’s going to make public health efforts more difficult on the continent. It’s going to make fewer people access care.' Russian Disinformation in the Sahel Hybrid warfare combines conventional forms of armed conflict with nonconventional strategic tools, including information operations to influence and subvert or reframe events. Duerksen says it is a part of the 'suite of services' Russia offers to isolated autocratic regimes such as the military juntas that have taken over Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in recent years. First, Russia identifies and inflames local grievances. In the Sahel, the biggest vulnerability is ineffective security forces facing a tidal wave of expanding violent extremist organizations — regional groups with links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group terrorist organizations. Next, Russian operatives cultivate local influencers who spread propaganda and disinformation while building a network on social media and promoting demonstrations to give the appearance of popular support. Then Russian mercenaries arrive and lead counterterrorism training and operations while establishing their payment through contracts for mineral extraction. In the wake of its military operations across Mali and the Central African Republic, the Wagner Group was credibly accused of numerous civilian massacres, atrocities, human rights violations and other war crimes. Once the mercenaries are in place, the disinformation and influence campaigns can be declared a success. As the head of research at Logically, a technology company that tracked a surge of pro-Russian and anti-French narratives related to Niger surrounding the country’s military coup in 2023, Kyle Walter has long suspected that Russian funding and social media networks are responsible for fake grassroots rallies. The New York Times reported that Ahmed Bello, the president of a Nigerien civil society group whose acronym is written as Parade, distributed as many as 70 Russian flags at multiple protests in Niamey and that the Russian government provided funding through intermediaries conducting similar activities in Mali. 'It is with them that we work to develop the expansion of Russian ideology in Africa,' Bello told the Times. Researchers at Microsoft have identified Parade as the handiwork of Russia’s Foreign Ministry, and a senior European military official told the Times that the group is a front for Kremlin-backed operations on the continent. 'It’s a whole toolkit,' Duerksen said, explaining the Wagner Group’s blueprint. 'It can help [juntas] stay in power and keep the opposition and the journalists at bay. When the disinformation that they’re offering has helped actually bring these regimes to power in the case of the [Sahel] military juntas, they are then intertwined with those regimes.' In a March 2024 report that drew from the work of more than 30 African researchers and organizations, the ACSS identified Russia as the primary sponsor of disinformation in Africa. 'Russia is connected to 80 of the 189 campaigns that we identified and mapped, which is 40% of these disinformation campaigns,' Duerksen said. 'This kind of cognitive warfare is a strategy that has come from the Russian Ministry of Defense. This isn’t just a side project. This is a clear emphasis for the Russian military, and they go about this pretty systematically.' Whereas the Russian government previously denied any ties to its mercenary groups’ operations, the shift from Prigozhin’s Wagner network to the military-controlled Africa Corps is profound in that Russia is now accountable for its actions. 'Who’s going to be stuck holding that bag with some kind of accountability?' Duerksen said. 'Wagner had always given them this deniability that they weren’t associated with whatever they were up to. Now the Russians own it.' The Wagner Blueprint The Wagner Group was Russia’s primary vehicle for its ambitions in Africa dating back to 2017, when Prigozhin and his mercenaries arrived and began building a sprawling network. 'They were trying a lot of different disinformation tactics, pushing a lot of different narratives, even conflicting narratives like backing two political candidates at the same time,' Duerksen said. 'It seems like they were doing a kind of market research, a lot of experimentation.' Among the most effective strategies is using local languages across social media networks and hiring local people to spread disinformation. 'They’ve realized the messenger matters, that having somebody who either speaks the local language, is really in tune with the local issues or speaks the local dialect is much better than a Wagner Telegram channel based in St. Petersburg,' Duerksen said. 'They see these as the vanguard of their influence and how they can get groups into the streets.' In the Sahel, with its complicated Francophone history, Russia found a vulnerable, willing consumer of its disinformation. 'There were problems with security,' Duerksen said, 'so they just really hammered these messages and really tried to contort the political discourse toward this kind of disillusionment, this cynicism, this kind of toxic energy, not channeling it toward anything constructive or productive, but toward the cheering for military coups. It’s kind of a nihilistic politics now.' Duerksen said that part of Russia’s disinformation design is to focus on three audiences. The first group consists of local people who consume disinformation content, embrace it and become amplifiers and standard holders. 'They’re the ones who are in the street holding Russian flags,' Duerksen said. 'That’s a small group, those who actually have become the domestic purveyors.' The second group is larger, with local people for whom disinformation content is designed to confuse and result in disengagement with politics and social issues. 'They’re oftentimes being intimidated. If they try to express an opinion or ask a question in some of these information spaces, the troll army descends on them.' The third group consists of regional and international media and observers who sometimes share only a surface-level understanding of distant issues and affairs. 'It’s hard to cover events, so it gets framed as a popular uprising. I think that’s become very intentionally manufactured around the Sahel trends. It’s advancing a strategic objective that Russia has in the region.' Analyst Dan Whitman of the Foreign Policy Research Institute has similarly concluded that Russia is exploiting and profiting from violence in the Sahel. 'Instability is the Garden of Eden for disinformation,' he told Voice of America. 'I would say [in] two or three years, [Russia] has made the most rapid propaganda successes in the history of propaganda.' Pushing Back Against the Narrative Russian disinformation has been used to insulate authoritarian regimes from accountability. In this way, military juntas in the Sahel are no different from Vladimir Putin’s oppressive reign in Russia. Never-ending disinformation campaigns mean that there always will be another distraction, another way to deflect criticism, another internal or external enemy to blame. But pushback is inevitable, especially in the Sahel, where insecurity touches nearly every life and is only getting worse. In April, more than 80 political parties and civil groups in Mali issued joint statements calling for presidential elections and an end to military rule. Mali’s junta responded with more oppression, suspending all political activities and barring the media from covering politics — moves it claimed were necessary 'for reasons of public order.' But Malian dissenters are showing that they aren’t going away. On April 24, 2024, a group of political parties and civil society organizations appealed to Mali’s Supreme Court 'with the aim of annulling the decree which they consider tyrannical and oppressive.' The mere existence of resistance is a clear sign that a media ecosystem of disinformation is not invulnerable. By pushing back, people undermine the narrative that their military rulers have popular support. Throughout the Sahel, it is not difficult for Malians, Burkinabe and Nigeriens to see that their so-called transition government leaders have no plans to hold elections any time soon. 'Things aren’t going well in the Sahel under these military regimes,' Duerksen said. 'Security is getting worse. Economies are disintegrating. That’s been one of the great tricks of these disinformation campaigns. They’ve helped create and keep alive this image that the military juntas are popular.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOxcqVr-N_hpY	2024-10-31T17:11:24-07:00	
Shia Militarism Upstages Salafi Jihadism In West Asia – Analysis	By Adil Rasheed It is curious to note that the ‘jihadist’ tag is almost exclusively given to violent Sunni extremists.1 In fact, Western experts usually use the term ‘militias’ when referring to Shia violent non-state actors and just a few journalists like Danny Postel ever employ the term ‘Shia jihad’.2 In fact, the Arabic term of muqawama (resistance) is now replacing jihad across West Asia and the neologism muqawamist is being used by English-speaking Arab commentators while referring to Iran-backed militancy.3 Deriving its resonance from the Shia ideology of resistance against the ‘oppression’ of Islam’s larger Sunni community, the term is now getting applied to rising pan-Islamist opposition towards the US-Israeli sway over the region.4 The recent popularity and support for Iran-backed Shia groups in the Arab world is remarkable, because it seems to have significantly reduced the intense hate and animosity generated by the Syrian civil war and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria’s (ISIS) hostilities over the last decade between the Sunni and Shia communities. Today, Sunni states like Salafi Qatar and the Deobandi Taliban regime are coming closer to Shia Iran and have apparently turned away from their old allies—the Salafi jihadists.5 No wonder, ISIS and its global affiliates are now targeting Iran, Russia and Shia groups out of sheer spite and desperation.6 But perhaps Salafi jihadists are themselves to blame for their present predicament. Al-Qaeda and the ISIS always opposed the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and even Hamas for fighting a nationalist Palestinian cause,7 rather than opposing the Westphalian and democratic nation-state system of the so-called ‘taghut’.8 By resorting to indiscriminate violence against civilians (particularly women and children), targeting the existing international political and economic order, by alienating all Western and Eastern countries (even Hanafi Sunni nations and groups like Turkey, Taliban and Hamas), Salafi jihadists are today seen in West Asia as strategically demented doomsday cultists, perpetually baying for blood.9 On the other hand, Iran has projected itself as a pan-Islamist power, and not just a Shia theocracy. By following this strategy, it has managed to extend its influence up to the Mediterranean, and has successfully brought the Lebanon, Syria and Iraq under its hegemonic sway. Unlike unruly Salafi jihadist groups that often turn on their own patrons, Iran has exercised effective command and control over its regional proxies, equipping them with latest know-how in warfare and weaponry as well as the use of sharp power to infiltrate and attack opponents. It has made them competent militias in their own right, fighting regional wars with greater strategic acumen and self-reliance. In fact, the inability of Salafi-jihadists to establish an enduring Islamic State has denied them the ability to promote proxies around the world and is the main cause of their failures. In comparison to Salafi jihadists and Israel, Iran has also proven to be more adept at running successful media and public relations campaigns that has been able to extinguish the flames of vengeance from its Sunni rivals in the Levant and by targeting mainly military sites in its attacks that has presented it as a more responsible military force to the world thus far. The impact of Iran’s mostly precise intermediate range ballistic missiles and drone attacks—making unprecedented forays into Israeli airspace, undermining its much-vaunted air defence systems and its supposed and still unverified nuclear status—seem to have captured the fancy of demoralised Arab masses, who are blaming Israel and not Iran for the plight of Palestinians, at least for now. Meanwhile, the theocratic state has also promoted its image as a champion of the developing world, voice of the Global South and supporter of humanitarian causes,10 even though it has conveniently ignored the plight of Uyghur Muslims to please the Chinese government and allegedly oppresses minorities and women within its borders. By focusing solely on the so-called ‘Far Enemy’—the West and Israel—Iran has successfully exploited the anti-liberal political discourse presently popular around the world and has upstaged the myopic Near Enemy outlook of Salafi jihadist groups like ISIS by calling them ‘takfiri’ (Muslims who commit the big sin of accusing fellow Muslims ‘kafir’).11 It is noteworthy that Shia theology like traditional Judaism practised political quietism for centuries as the community patiently awaits the manifestation of its promised saviour (the Divinely Guided Mahdi).12 Again like Zionism, Shia thinkers and clergy started advocating militant activism only in modern times, as Red Shiism of Shariati culminated into the Khomeini-led Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979. According to Shia tradition, only the most senior theologians (mujtahids), have the authority to declare a ‘defensive’ jihad, while only the 12th or ‘hidden’ Imam—who the Shia believe is still alive after disappearing 1,100 years ago—will declare an ‘offensive’ jihad on his return.13 Although most orthodox Sunni jurists also advocate defensive jihad, modern-day jihadists like Qutb, Faraj and Zawahiri ridicule the difference between ‘defensive’ and ‘offensive’ warfare,14 with ISIS being particularly notorious in killing the so-called Shia ‘Rafida’ (Rejectors of the First Three Pious Caliphs).15 The moot question here is how long Iran and its three main proxies—Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthis—sustain their ongoing campaign in West Asia? Can the Islamic Republic of Iran depend on Russian and Chinese support for a favourable resolution of the present conflict? Will the highly demoralised and weakened Arab states, that continue to suffer from the so-called Stockholm syndrome, switching loyalties from one regional hegemon to the other—championing the slogans of Abraham Accords and non-sectarian pan-Islamism in the same breath—ever hold their own? However, even in the current context of the beleaguered Arab states, continuing internecine sectarian feud and ever-escalating regional conflicts, the declining Salafi-jihadist threat can be discounted only at one’s own peril.

What Moldova And Georgia Showed Us About Pushback Against Russian...	By Andy Heil (RFE/RL) -- The election outcomes in Moldova and Georgia highlight the starkly differing ways their respective governments and civil society pushed back to resist Russian meddling and other nefarious elements at crucial junctures for both countries. The votes -- a presidential election and an EU constitutional referendum in Moldova and parliamentary elections in Georgia -- packed the potential to dramatically realign both former Soviet republics' geopolitical orientation or harden their current courses, with mounting challenges to both countries' strong public preferences for further EU integration. So the winners and losers matter. But some of the early lessons lie beyond their initial winners and suggest those votes can contribute to the playbook for other embattled societies -- including among more mature democracies as well as other countries on Russia's periphery. Counter Russian Influence Early Moldovan officials had warned for months of threats from Russia that included disinformation and facilitating millions in illicit payments for an informal network of anti-EU organizers. An analyst who spoke with Moldovan officials in the run-up to the voting quoted them to RFE/RL as saying, 'We can follow the money.' And while they couldn't stop the flow of cash from Russia, they saw it and publicly identified it for what it was. Georgia provided a lesson of a different sort. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze insisted as recently as last week that 'Russia has no influence in Georgia.' Caught up in a balancing act to avoid appearing overtly pro-Russian to a Russia-wary public, Georgian Dream simply ignored the problem and cast the choice as one between 'war' and 'peace.' As a result, even with President Salome Zurabishvili warning of Russian interference, it fell to the public to counter Moscow's economic leverage and the mobilization of pro-Russian influencers and media. Georgians and civil society groups were freshly energized by peaceful battles against the 'foreign-agent' law, popularly known as the 'Russian law,' and new curbs on the LGBT community, but experts told RFE/RL that preparations in the form of 'raising the alarm' and 'coalition building' actually began many months earlier. Integrity And Transparency Are Key Moldovan officials went on the offensive to protect the integrity of the country's elections, strengthening institutions and seeking to shut down illegal sources of potentially violent unrest. They also fended off cyberattacks and deepfakes, and publicly confronted what they regarded as false narratives. 'You name it, they did a good job defending against it,' Shelby Magid of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center told RFE/RL. Georgian ruling-party officials appeared less preoccupied with the potential for accusations of a flawed vote. Georgian public groups and civil society were left to pick up the slack. A dozen years into Georgian Dream's political dominance, such independent (and opposition) groups suggested before the vote that they were better prepared than in the past. That showed up in things like long-term observation of procedures, international cooperation, and hotlines for reporting violations. 'You name it, they were doing it,' Magid said. Cope With The Oligarchs In Moldova, officials spent the better part of two years battling the influence of Ilan Shor, a fugitive former oligarch convicted of massive fraud who is seemingly determined to steer the country's course toward Russia. Since banning his party last year, the government has kept up its pressure with public warnings and called out an alleged multimillion-dollar Shor network to organize opposition to the EU path, among other things. 'It's not just a single issue, it's more like a game of whack-a-mole -- you don't just get rid of Shor,' Magid said. In Georgia, the elephant in the room is Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire Georgian Dream founder who made his fortune in Russia. That challenge was far less black-and-white. Ivanishvili seems to be 'looking out for himself and has his own anti-democratic mind-set that aligns more with Russia,' said Magid, adding that those goals 'sometimes go hand-in-hand and other times they don't.' Don't Forget The Diaspora The tiny margin in the EU constitutional referendum and the disparity in perspectives to Chisinau's east and its west underscore the significance of the diaspora in the Moldovan votes. Moldovan officials used a variety of channels to encourage a sense of urgency and consequence to mobilize Moldovan voters abroad, particularly in the West, including through social media, cultural outreach, and increased voting sites. 'You've got to have a fire under you that your vote matters, and that information has to get to you,' Magid said. In Georgia, whose eligible expatriates are heavily concentrated in the West, governing officials appeared less keen on getting out the diaspora vote. It's easy to see why: Georgian Dream garnered just 15 percent support among emigre voters. With the opposition hopelessly fractured and myriad alternatives to Georgian Dream on the ballot, however, that did not translate into a clear mandate elsewhere.

For Iran, This Is A Pivotal US Presidential Election – Analysis	Next week’s US presidential election holds immense significance, particularly for the Iranian government, whose strategic decisions and foreign policies are often shaped by the American leadership. The outcome of this election could either tighten or loosen the complex web of international sanctions, economic constraints and geopolitical dynamics that surround Iran. For Tehran, it is not just another election taking place overseas but a decisive moment that could define its economic future, security posture and regional influence. Every shift in Washington’s power potentially realigns Iran’s ability to maneuver on the global stage and this election could very well set the course for the next crucial chapter in US-Iran relations, especially as tensions between Tehran and Israel have reached a critical point. This heightened volatility only amplifies the stakes of the US election, making it a pivotal moment for the region’s stability. Historically, Iran has paid exceptionally close attention to US presidential elections, far more than it does to any other nation’s electoral process. The reason for this is deeply rooted in the intertwined political and economic fates of both countries since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. In the span of more than four decades, Iran has witnessed the policies of eight US presidents — each bringing varying degrees of pressure, confrontation or negotiation. While some, like Jimmy Carter, saw diplomatic bridges begin to crumble with the hostage crisis, others such as Barack Obama tried to restore ties through agreements like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. Now, with the upcoming election, the stakes are higher than ever. Iran’s future is, in many ways, intricately connected to the decision American voters will make on Nov. 5. The policy divide between the two main candidates running for office, particularly regarding Iran, is vast and striking. On the one hand, Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, has consistently pushed for a return to the 'maximum pressure' campaign that defined his first term. This strategy involved imposing harsh sanctions on Iran’s crucial energy sector, aiming to cripple the country’s economy and force its hand on issues like nuclear development and regional influence. Trump’s policy also targeted countries and corporations that violated US-imposed sanctions on Iran, isolating Tehran even further on the world stage. Under this approach, Iran’s already fragile economy would likely suffer immensely, creating a bleak outlook for its future. On the other hand, Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Democratic presidential nominee, is expected to continue the Biden administration’s policies, which emphasize diplomacy over confrontation. The Biden administration has shown restraint, particularly in its dealings with Iran, seeking to rebuild diplomatic bridges, and Harris is likely to follow suit. When it comes to Iran’s nuclear program, Harris would probably push for a return to the JCPOA, the nuclear deal that Trump famously abandoned. A Harris administration would aim to bring Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement, potentially offering relief from sanctions in exchange for stricter oversight of its nuclear activities. This approach stands in stark contrast to Trump’s confrontational policies. It is also important to point out that the timing of the upcoming US election is crucial, occurring at a moment when tensions between Iran and Israel have reached unprecedented heights. Over the last year, the two nations have edged closer to direct military confrontation, crossing numerous red lines along the way. Both Israeli and Iranian forces have engaged in retaliatory strikes, with the risk of full-scale war looming over the region. The stakes of this election are, therefore, even more significant, as the policies of the next US president could either fuel or quell this explosive situation. A return to Trump’s more aggressive stance might escalate the conflict, while a more diplomatic approach could create opportunities for de-escalation. The current Biden-Harris administration has taken a more measured approach regarding the Iran-Israel conflict, attempting to prevent further escalation. For instance, the White House has urged caution when it comes to Israel’s military actions, especially in relation to Iran’s nuclear sites. The current administration seems to be focused on diplomacy as a key tool for resolving these issues, in contrast to the hawkish rhetoric of the Trump era. However, should Trump return to office, the chances of a more hard-line stance are high. He recently expressedsupport for Israel launching strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, signaling that a second Trump administration would likely ramp up the pressure on Tehran, bringing the region closer to open conflict. It is worth noting that the Iranian government has already endured four years of the Trump administration’s 'maximum pressure' policy and the consequences were severe. Iran’s oil exports, once a major source of revenue, plummeted to record lows. The sanctions crippled the economy, causing the Iranian currency to lose much of its value, which in turn sparked inflation and widespread economic hardships. The government in Tehran struggled to manage these crises, as financial resources dwindled and social unrest grew. Trump’s economic warfare left deep scars on the Iranian economy and a return to such policies would likely exacerbate these challenges, leaving the Iranian government in an even more precarious position. It is also critical to recall the unprecedented actions taken by the Trump administration, such as the targeted killing of Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. This move, which shocked the world, escalated tensions between the US and Iran to new heights. For the first time in recent memory, the two nations stood on the brink of war. The assassination was a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of Trump’s foreign policy, which Iran has not forgotten. The specter of further such confrontations looms if Trump is reelected. In conclusion, as the world watches the US presidential election, the Iranian government is more invested in the outcome than ever before. The stakes for Tehran are incredibly high, as the gap between the two candidates’ policies on Iran is vast. While one candidate may bring renewed pressure and confrontation, the other offers the possibility of diplomacy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOz7gsD9-0jB4	2024-10-31T17:06:42-07:00	
Iran: Growing International Pressure To Designate IRGC As A Terro...	For over forty years, the Iranian opposition has warned about the threat posed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In this regard, the opposition has made extensive efforts through documented disclosures, gatherings, protests, conferences, interviews, books, book tables, and more, to reveal the IRGC’s wide-ranging activities and global terrorism. However, a world inclined towards appeasement did not hear or chose not to hear, turning a blind eye. Now, after a year of warmongering by the clerical regime in the region, the IRGC’s role as the enforcer and arm of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s rule in continuing and expanding conflicts has become more evident. Consequently, international pressure has increased to designate this criminal entity as a terrorist organization. European Parliament Session On October 22, the European Parliament held an official session in Strasbourg dedicated to examining the regime’s state-sponsored terrorism. During this session, European representatives from various parties condemned the regime’s role in violence against women, suppression of dissidents, destabilizing the region, warmongering, terrorism on European soil, threats to Iranian refugees in Europe, cyber attacks, and more. However, their primary demand was for the IRGC to be listed as a terrorist organization. In this context, MEP Javier Zarzalejos stated, 'Can anyone doubt that the Iranian regime sponsors, promotes, and finances terrorism in Europe?' MEP Petras Auštrevičius from Lithuania, stressing the importance of designating the IRGC as a terrorist entity and said, 'We must take concrete action at the EU level to stop the Iranian regime’s terrorism at sea and on land.' In line with this, Francisco Assis, MEP from Portugal, pointed out that Iran’s regime has become a key exporter of terrorism. 'Iran is a society held hostage by religious fundamentalists who are now exporting terror beyond the Middle East to Europe.' Polish MEP Adam Bielan stated that it is essential that all member states unite to recognize the IRGC as a terrorist organization and stressed that this is not merely symbolic but a necessary step to protect citizens and uphold international law. Kristoffer Storm, MEP from Denmark, equated the mullahs’ regime and the IRGC, stressing, that the Iranian regime and the IRGC have conducted terrorist attacks in other EU member states. He stressed that Europe must send a strong message and place the IRGC on the terrorist list. Finally, Helena Dalli, the European Commissioner for Equality, pointed to numerous European Parliament resolutions and various EU sanctions against the IRGC, confirming support for listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization. However, she also reminded the assembly that this step requires a political decision and depends on a unanimous decision by the European Council’s 27 member states. Protests by Opposition Supporters in Strasbourg At the same time as the European Parliament session, Iranian compatriots and freedom-loving Iranians held a rally and protest in front of the institution. They protested the international community’s forty-year delay in condemning the IRGC, and through their fervent slogans, they conveyed the urgent demands of the Iranian people to the European representatives. One of the largest banners at this impressive gathering read: 'Honor the will of the Iranian people and the vote of Europeans by including the IRGC in the terrorist list.' Request for Prominent Figures for IRGC Proscription On the same day (October 22, 2024), an article by several prominent French human rights advocates called for the IRGC’s designation. Former Columbian Presidential Candidate Ingrid Betancourt; Pierre Bercis, president of New Human Rights Foundation; Emile Blessig, head of the former Parliamentarians Group; Yves Bonnet, former director of national intelligence; writer Pascal Bruckner; Jean-François Legaret, head of the Middle East Studies Foundation; and Gilles Paruelle, former president of the Val-d’Oise Bar Association, published a joint article titled 'Why It Is Necessary to Designate the IRGC as a Terrorist Organization' in Journal Du Dimanche. In the article, they criticized the European Union, stating, 'Despite calls from the European Parliament (EP) to add the IRGC to the list of terrorist entities, Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative, blocked the initiative by requiring a judicial decision from an EU member state. However, evidence linking the IRGC to acts of terrorism is plentiful. Tehran does not view the EU’s inaction as wisdom but as weakness.' Comprehensive Blows to the IRGC One year after the regime’s warmongering in Gaza and the actions of its IRGC-backed proxy forces, the regime’s main arm now faces attacks from all angles. The international community has recognized this vulnerability and has increased its pressure. At the same time, Iran’s rebellious youth continue to target IRGC and Basij centers without interruption. The comprehensive weakening and disintegration of the IRGC, which the regime spent decades building up, represents yet another strategic loss for the regime and another indication of its inevitable downfall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO3cf8a9TqVhz	2024-10-31T17:05:26-07:00	
The Battle To Shape Trump’s China Policy – Analysis	By Tanner Greer (FPRI) -- This week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board asked Donald Trump why China would not invade Taiwan on his watch. Trump told the Journal that the Chinese would not dare to invade. As Trump put it: '[Xi Jinping] knows that I am f—ing crazy.' One must pity the Chinese analyst asked to predict what a second Trump administration will mean for U.S.-Chinese relations. Like Richard Nixon before him, Trump is ready to play the lunatic; he clearly believes that the less predictable he is to the Chinese, the better off America will be. Though China occupies a central place in Trump’s campaign rhetoric, his campaign has not published or endorsed any detailed China policy proposals. The actions of the last Trump administration do not provide a better guide. Divided by infighting, its China policy was not consistent. At times, Trump’s foreign policy swung wildly as specific individuals rose or fell from his favor. Things do not get much easier if one looks at the views of the politicians and policy wonks that Trump would call on in a second administration. Their views are varied. Among Trump’s closest allies, we find fundamental disagreements on the proper ends and proper means of American strategy toward China. Given these hurdles. I will not try to predict the path a second Trump administration might tread. It seems more useful to lay out a few observations on the different schools of thought now contending for leadership of that policy. My observations are shaped by the dozens of interviews I have conducted over the last two months with Republican staffers, think tankers, and former officials. A longer and more thorough report of my findings will be published by FPRI later this year. This is a pre-election preview. The questions that divided Republicans in 2017 are not the questions that will divide them in 2025. Trump’s election shattered a policy consensus shared by the leaders of both parties for the better part of four decades. Many of the architects of this consensus were still influential during Trump’s first years in office. On the other hand, many who rejected 'engagement' with China had spent years exiled from power. Others were completely new to service in the executive branch. This was a diverse group who did not all reject engagement for the same reasons. These differences were not initially apparent, as their objections were too marginal to the pre-Trump policy debates for much scrutiny to be given to them. Nor was it immediately apparent to these officials where the new bounds of public opinion or presidential approval lay. Thrust into power quite suddenly, they were forced to improvise as they went—and improvise again as the Chinese reaction to Trump’s trade war changed the context in which they worked. All of these factors gave China policy under Trump 1.0 an unusually chaotic flavor. None of these conditions hold this election season. The architects of engagement are no longer relevant. A tough line on China is now taken as a starting point for all factions involved. Over the last eight years, a new ecosystem of conservative think tanks, policy journals, and Congressional offices has sprouted up to provide Trumpism with the intellectual coherence it lacked in 2017. Policy proposals are now numerous and detailed. Out of power, former Trump officials have had the time to carefully lay out their vision for American strategy in Asia. They have done this in speeches, policy reports, and full-length books. Disagreements between their different schools of thought are formally debated on both panels and podcasts. Points of Consensus and Conflict in Trump World Amid these debates, one finds several points of consensus. The disputing intellectuals, wonks, and politicians all agree that China is the most significant foreign policy problem the United States now faces. They describe China as a challenge that must be met in many dimensions: military, economic, and technological (some would add 'ideological' to this list, but that is a point of debate, not consensus). Republicans agree that the U.S. armed forces are poorly structured and lack the resources needed to counter the military challenge posed by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). They agree that America’s commercial and financial relationship with China underwrote the rise of a powerful rival while undermining America’s own industrial base. They believe that China has taken advantage of the traditional American commitment to globalization and free markets, and that doubling down on this commitment is foolish. To level the playing field, some mix of tariffs, export controls, capital controls, and industrial policy is necessary. They agree that the Biden administration’s China policy—while an improvement on that of the Obama administration—has nonetheless been feckless. They believe that the Biden administration articulates geopolitical goals that it has not resourced, cares too much about perceptions of amity, cares too little about perceptions of strength, and has not sold the American people on its foreign policy priorities. But behind this consensus lie many fundamental disagreements. The debates about China policy can be largely sifted into two buckets: economics and geopolitics. It is common for individuals to be closely allied in the economic sphere but not in the geopolitical sphere, or vice versa. For example, senators Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance are close allies on the economic front; there are few meaningful distinctions between the economic strategy each endorses. Their respective takes on the geopolitical problem posed by China are much harder to reconcile. In theory, one’s position on the CHIPS Act or tariff rates might influence one’s position on military commitments to Taiwan or military aid to Ukraine. In practice, this is rarely so. The economic and geopolitical debates occur on different planes. One way to represent the core principles at play in the geopolitical debate is with a classic two-by-two matrix (popularized on the internet as a 'political compass'). Optimism vs. Pessimism On the x axis I place the single most important difference between the various schools of thought: assessments of American power and state capacity. Where one falls in many of the most prominent debates—such as 'Can the United States can afford to support both Ukraine and Taiwan?' or 'Should the ultimate goal of our China policy be victory over the Communist Party of China, or should it be détente?'—has less to do with one’s assessment of China and more to do with one’s assessment of the United States. What resources can we muster for competition with China? Just how large are our stores of money, talent, and political will? Those on the right quadrants of my diagram provide pessimistic answers to these questions. They buttress their case with measurables: steel produced, ships at sea, interest paid on the federal deficit, or the percentage of an ally’s gross domestic product spent on defense. Against these numbers are placed fearsome statistics of Chinese industrial capacity and PLA power. Changes in technology, which favor shore-based precision munitions at the expense of more costly planes and ships, further erode the American position. This is a new and uncomfortable circumstance. The last time the United States waged war without overwhelming material superiority was in 1812. To those who see American power through this frame, there is only one logical response: the United States must limit its ambitions. This means either radically reprioritizing defense commitments to focus on China or retreating from conflict with China altogether. Those on the left two quadrants see things differently. Where the pessimists see settled facts, the optimists see possibilities. The optimists recognize many of the same trends as the pessimists, but view them as self-inflicted mistakes that can, and should, be reversed. An inadequate defense budget is not a law of the universe but a political choice. If Trump wins, he will choose otherwise. Implicit in the optimist view is a longer time horizon—there is still time to turn things around. But this window will not be open forever. Optimists fear that pessimistic assessments erode the political will needed to make changes while change is still possible. The arguments between pessimists and optimists could be reframed as a matter of risk. The pessimists are most worried about the downside risks of a crisis with China in the near future (c. 2025–28). The optimists balance that possibility against the longer-term risks America will face as it withdraws from other regions of the world or abandons defense capabilities that are not needed in the Pacific theater. Optimists believe this second class of risks is large, and that the United States should not court them. Even an America in desperate need of defense reform has some capacity to 'walk and chew gum at the same time.' This issue is at the crux of their arguments on Ukraine: in material terms, aid to Ukraine is not coming at Taiwan’s expense. It is relatively cheap. What stops America from helping both beleaguered nations? The pessimists do not view that question purely in material terms. In their debates, the pessimists are quick to highlight the few weapons systems being shipped across the Atlantic that might be used in the Pacific, but their critique reaches higher than this. The costs of the war in Ukraine (and the Middle East) are measured not just in bullets, but in attention and effort: There are only so many minutes the National Security Council may meet. Washington can only have a few items on its agenda at any given time. The executive branch is stodgy, slow, and captive to bureaucratic interests; the legislative branch is rancorous, partisan, and captive to public opinion; the American public does not care a whit about the world abroad. Accomplishing anything meaningful in the United States—much less the drastic defense reforms both sides of the debate agree are necessary—requires singular attention and will. If this seems like a pessimistic take on the American system—well, it is one. It is common for people in the optimistic quadrants to argue that the People’s Republic of China is riddled with internal contradictions. In a long-term competition between the two systems, they are confident that these contradictions will eat China from the inside out, and that America’s free and democratic order will eventually emerge victorious. None of the pessimists I interview make similar predictions. If they have anything to say about internal contradictions, it is American contradictions they focus on. Power-Based vs. Values-Based Perspectives So much for the optimist-pessimist divide. What of the y axis? I think of this as a pole, with 'power-based' perspectives on one hand and 'values-based' perspectives on the other. Republicans in the top two quadrants ground their arguments in cold calculations of realpolitik. From this perspective, international politics is first and foremost a competition for power. States seek power. The prosperity, freedom, and happiness of any nation depend on how much power its government can wield on the world stage. While states might compete for power in many domains, military power is the most important. A state frustrated by a trade war might escalate to a real war, but a state locked in deadly combat has no outside recourse. The buck stops with the bullet. From the power-based perspective, then, the goal of American strategy must be the maximization of American power, with military force as the ultimate arbiter of that power. This force does not need to be realized in combat—ideally, its deterrent power will be strong enough that it is never actively used. The ideal means of American strategy is a military posture and alliance system strong enough to deter the Chinese from resorting to war. The left and right quadrants of this perspective disagree on the best way to build that sort of power. The upper right quadrant—the prioritizers—do not believe America will ever possess power sufficient to compel China into submission; a stable détente between the two countries is the best outcome that America can attain. Even this modest aim will only be possible if the United States prioritizes the threat posed by China above all others. Those who argue from the upper left quadrant—the primacists—also speak the language of realpolitik. They maintain, however, that the sacrifices the prioritizers propose will weaken American power. They believe that the existing American alliance system contributes to America’s strength today and will contribute to America’s potential strength in the future. Instead of limiting American aims, the primacists are more concerned with expanding American means. They are confident this can be done if the American people have the confidence to do so. The lower two quadrants, whose arguments I label 'values-based,' operate under a different frame. The people in these quadrants believe that American foreign policy should not be evaluated by a single variable. They see connections between what America does abroad and what America is like at home. They have strong values-based commitments to specific ways of life that are expressed in their vision for American strategy. I have labelled those in the bottom left quadrant 'internationalists' because of how often they invoke the phrase 'liberal international order.' This group believes that America and its allies are knit together not only by shared security interests, but also by shared values. In fact, the values shared by the liberal bloc explain why these countries share security interests in the first place. China is an authoritarian power whose influence operations threaten the integrity of democracies across the world. Many internationalists view this political-ideological threat as the most dangerous that China poses. Those in this quadrant are especially skeptical of détente; they do not believe permanent compromise with China is possible. They attribute Chinese belligerence to the communist political system that governs the country. For them, tensions in U.S.-Chinese relations are less the expected clashes between a rising power and the ruling hegemon than a battle between two incompatible social systems. Pointing to the close cooperation that ties Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China together, the internationalists argue (contra the prioritizers) that the world is gripped in a general contest between liberal order and resurgent authoritarianism whose different parts cannot be disentangled from each other. Those in the bottom right quadrant—the restrainers—also think about foreign affairs through a regime lens, but the belligerent regime in question is their own. Republican restrainers link the liberal international order to the free trade agreements all Trumpists despise and the administrative 'deep state' all Trumpists distrust. They see the liberal international order as an international extension of the progressive order they are trying to tear down at home. There are echoes of the 1960s New Left in the restrainer argument. Both the new left of yesterday and the new right of today are rebellions against 'the establishment.' Both reject the pieties of their day; both see a bloated national security state as a symbol of the dehumanizing values they reject. Both groups correctly point out that there is no natural limit to the quest for primacy. Both argue that a totalizing foreign policy will lead to the bureaucratization of American life. Only the most radical restrainers are ready for a 21st-century march on the Pentagon. Most aim for an easier target: a relatively modest foreign policy. Instead of defending an entire international order, it is enough to defend America. Instead of deterring authoritarianism, it is enough to deter China. China does not need to be defeated—it is enough to convince the Chinese to accept some sort of détente. This is all pretty similar to the ends sought by the prioritizers. Little wonder so many of the primacists and internationalists I interviewed believed the prioritizers were restrainers in disguise! Again and again I heard this accusation made: prioritizer arguments are just an attempt to make isolationism sexy. The prioritizers do not actually believe in realpolitik—realpolitik is just a respectable way to attack the existing international order they despise. There is an irony to this critique. Just as primacists and internationalists condemn the false face of the prioritizers, so the prioritizers and the restrainers condemn the false face of the primacists! Many of those I interviewed insisted that their primacist opponents made such-and-such argument not for the realpolitik reasons they professed, but because of their (hidden) commitment to liberal ideals. Ideals that cannot be defended on their own merits had to be prettied up with talk of hard power. All of these suspicions of subterfuge are overblown. Both primacists and prioritizers believe the arguments they make. Yet their suspicions are revealing! All sides clearly believe there is political advantage in couching one’s arguments in realpolitik logic. That fact alone tells us something about the likely contours of a Trump presidency—and perhaps the beliefs of Trump himself.

The Development Of Global Barter Trade – Analysis	By He Yan Amid shifts in the geopolitical landscape and U.S. financial sanctions, several countries and regions are increasingly turning to barter trade for cross-border transactions. The Ural customs in Russia recently signed its first barter contract with a Chinese company. This transaction was conducted without cash, relying solely on the exchange of equivalent goods. There have been successful examples of barter trade between China and other countries in the past. In 2019, China executed a palm oil trade worth nearly USD 150 million with Malaysia, exchanging it for construction services, natural resource products, and civilian equipment. In 2021, a Chinese company exported USD 2 million in automotive parts to Iran in return for an equivalent value in pistachios. These instances highlight the growing significance of barter trade as a viable option in cross-border commerce. The origins of barter trade can be traced back to the late stages of primitive society. During this period, with the production of surplus goods and the further development of the social division of labor, exchanges of items began to occur both within and between clans and tribes, thus the emergence of the primitive form of barter trade. In ancient China, barter trade also held significant importance. For instance, during the Han Dynasty, barter trade along the Silk Road facilitated the exchange of Chinese silk and silk products for local specialties such as precious furs and fine horses from Central Asia, West Asia, and even Europe. From around the 1950s, modern barter trade began to appear in the United States and gradually gained traction in countries like Canada and Australia. It became an important means of reducing cash transactions, boosting sales, minimizing inventory buildup, expanding new customer bases, and entering new markets. By the 1990s, advancements in internet technology further propelled the development of modern barter trade through the integration of e-commerce. Statistics indicate that 20% to 30% of world trade is conducted through barter. Among the Fortune 500 companies, 80% have established barter departments, and approximately 470,000 companies in the UK actively engage in barter trade. By 2016, contemporary barter trade accounted for 30% of the total global import and export value. The period before the COVID-19 pandemic marked a phase of rapid growth for China’s cross-border barter trade under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The escalation of the pandemic, alongside regional geopolitical conflicts, had severely disrupted global supply chain stability, negatively impacting production and consumption processes and hindering economic recovery. Cross-border barter trade emerged as a means to safeguard material supplies and mitigate supply chain risks. For instance, due to economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries, Russia's traditional foreign trade channels were disrupted. In response, its Ministry of Finance allowed its domestic companies to engage in cross-border barter trade to ensure stable supplies within the country. Additionally, under the economic sanctions led by the U.S., Pakistani companies engaging in financial transactions with Russia faced penalties, resulting in significant difficulties for Pakistan in acquiring essential production materials. To address these issues, in June 2023, Pakistan announced a barter trade agreement with Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and other countries to import products such as crude oil, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, wheat, and steel. This move partially circumvented the economic sanctions and ensured the stability of domestic supplies. Similarly, due to fluctuations in international crude oil prices caused by the Ukraine crisis, the Philippines faced considerable pressure on oil imports. Public sentiment in the Philippines called for the revival of barter trade among ASEAN countries to secure stable oil supplies from nations like Malaysia. Therefore, considering the practical needs of relevant countries, the development of cross-border barter trade is both necessary and urgent. The development of the global economy today is marked by deglobalization, regionalization, and even fragmentation. Previously, many believed that the era of global economic integration was crucial for the growth of barter trade, as friendly relations between countries and cooperation among global economies fostered a conducive environment for barter transactions. However, in light of the changes in the international economic and trade system, the deepening of trade barriers, and the challenges facing regional financial transactions, barter trade has emerged as a powerful avenue for cross-border trade. On one hand, barter trade can alleviate or even resolve issues of cash shortages and excess inventory for businesses. In recent years, various industries have faced significant economic challenges, with small and medium-sized enterprises being particularly affected. Problems such as inventory buildup and tight cash flow have become obstacles to business development, which can be addressed through barter platforms. These platforms aggregate supply and demand information from both domestic and international markets, helping businesses find suitable matches for their needs and resources. The core principle of barter trade is to 'exchange what one has for what is needed'. This allows companies to trade surplus goods for necessary materials, reducing inventory accumulation and reliance on cash flow. In our contemporary world, barter trade leverages the internet to integrate resources, effectively addressing issues of poor information flow and overcoming the conventional constraints of time and geography. On the other hand, barter trade can serve as a temporary solution for economies under sanctions. Direct barter transactions simplify the currency exchange process, mitigate the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, and helps alleviate material shortages, improve resource allocation efficiency, and enhance living standards. For example, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic forced Sri Lanka's tourism industry which was an important source of foreign exchange revenue of the country, to come to a halt. Insufficient foreign exchange reserves prevented Sri Lanka from continuing to purchase crude oil, leading to the shutdown of domestic refineries in 2021 and causing significant difficulties for the public. Additionally, the shortage of foreign exchange reserves hindered Sri Lanka's ability to repay a USD 250 million oil debt owed to Iran since 2012. On the Iranian side, U.S. sanctions that included tea severely reduced its tea import volumes, resulting in tight supplies of related domestic products. Consequently, the two countries signed a 'Tea-for-Oil' barter trade agreement in 2021, stipulating that starting in 2023, Sri Lanka would trade Ceylon tea with Iran to settle its oil debts. This initiative alleviated the economic challenges faced by both sides and achieved a mutually beneficial outcome. In fact, barter trade also has certain limitations, including value assessment, demand matching, and credit risk, among others. Nevertheless, it reflects the willingness of emerging market countries to seek diversified cooperation and collectively face challenges amid changes in the global economic landscape. While the dollar-dominated financial system remains large and stable, it is also true that an increasing number of countries are pursuing diversified trade settlement methods. Therefore, there is potential for the global trading system to become fairer and more equitable through the development of diversified trading methods like barter. Final analysis conclusion: Influenced by changes in geopolitical situations and U.S. financial sanctions, cross-border barter trade is gradually emerging as an important form of international trade. Although barter trade has certain limitations, its necessity and urgency remain significant given the real needs of many economies. Additionally, the widespread adoption of this trade method reflects the willingness of emerging market countries to seek diversified cooperation and collectively face challenges amid changes in the global economic landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO0D2j6aFUYXw	2024-10-31T17:00:42-07:00	
India’s Godmen Cast A Shadow On Society – Analysis	By Balachander Palanisamy In July 2024, 121 people were killed in a stampede in Hathras in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The stampede occurred during a religious congregation led by self-styled godman Narayan Sakar Hari, also known as ‘Bhole Baba’. It was triggered when his followers rushed to touch his feet and collect the coloured powder he had walked on. Aside from administrative failures and crowd-control measures, blame should also be directed at politicians who exploit the godmen’s followers for political gain and the vestiges of the caste system hidden in Hindu society. The political connections of godmen such as Bhole Baba are crucial when they face trouble. After the 2024 stampede, organisers and volunteers were named in the initial police report and several arrests were made, including Bhole Baba’s close aide Dev Prakash Madhukar. Yet despite intense public scrutiny, Bhole Baba was not charged. Gurus have historically made personal financial gains from their quid pro quo relationship with politicians. One such guru with national popularity — Baba Ramdev — has received financial inducements for his controversial company Patanjali. The company has received more than an estimated $US46 million in discounts for land acquisitions in states controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP leaders have also given tacit endorsement to the company, which has seemingly driven the guru’s billion dollar consumer products business. Godmen’s influence over their followers ensures politicians seek their support, hoping to consolidate their votes and use them as mouthpieces for their policies. Politicians across party lines, from the BJP’s Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to the Indian National Congress (INC)’s Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly member Kamal Nath, count themselves among the followers of the self-styled guru Baba Bageshwar. In August 2023, the Indian National Congress even invited Baba Bageshwar — despite his views being contrary to the party’s — to an event during the state’s election season. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also courted popular godmen such as Ravi Shankar, Baba Ramdev and Sadhguru. A deep dive into the Prime Minister’s website, which contains archives of press releases and meetings with these self-styled gurus, reveals that Modi seems to favour Ravi Shankar who is mentioned more than 35 times, compared to Baba Ramdev’s 20 and Sadhguru’s 9 mentions. Both Ravi Shankar and Baba Ramdev had vocally supported Modi’s demonetisation plan, a widely unpopular scheme aimed at rooting out corruption. These cults persist in Indian society because Hindu nationalist groups like the BJP openly support them, as their practices are similar to Hinduism. The godmen often perceive themselves as incarnations of Hindu gods — for example, Bhole Baba has been construed as the Hindu god Shiva and Krishna. The BJP’s governance galvanises existing groups and emboldens new ones to emerge. Some godmen offer their followers a more disciplined and productive path, which appeals to successive governments as they ensure social order. Godmen cults have given their largely lower-caste followers a sense of worth and belonging. Hinduism offers no equality between upper and lower castes, instead practising discrimination against Dalits — members of the lowest caste. The majority of Bhole Baba’s devotees are poor, landless, illiterate, lower caste Jatavs and Dalits deemed outcastes by the social stratification (varna) system of Hinduism. Bhole Baba himself is from the Dalit community. Over time, he became a religious preacher and established a religious retreat (ashram) in his native village. Bhole Baba’s popularity reflects the eagerness of Dalits to claim an alternative religiosity for social and economic mobility. Charismatic godmen, especially from lower caste communities in Punjab and Haryana, hold religious congregations (deras) and have millions of followers. They offer economic opportunities denied by the rigid caste system to the downtrodden — thousands of Dalits earn their living working at deras and their properties, while thousands more receive indirect employment through contracts and general upkeep. Followers become economically and spiritually dependent on the gurus, so when a guru is arrested, their lives are completely upended and they are left with very little alternative but to rally around their leader. In August 2017, more than 30 people died in the riots that followed the conviction and 20-year prison sentence of self-styled guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for rape. Although there are laws protecting Dalits and affirmative action programs, few manage to escape the vicious cycle of poverty and caste. The major political parties — BJP and INC — remain more occupied with political manoeuvring rather than proposing equitable policies. They frequently accuse each other of being ‘anti-Dalit’ while prioritising the interests of the upper castes. Discussions around reservation quotas and upward mobility peak during pre-election season and fade afterwards. The recent incident in Hathras shows that the underclasses in India still lack caste equality, social justice and sufficient economic opportunities. It is little wonder that the void left by the government and politicians is being filled by charismatic gurus offering chances at a better life. There is no doubt whom the oppressed will choose to follow. About the author: Balachander Palanisamy is an independent researcher and intelligence analyst.

Assessing The Political And Military Scope Of Israel’s Strikes On...	By Can Kasapoğlu Israel’s Aerial Assault: An Overview Israel used around 100 combat aircraft, and possibly drone warfare systems, to execute its aerial assault on Iran. Attacking in three waves, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted Tehran’s missile manufacturing capabilities and strategic air defense architecture. Israel’s target set clearly suggests it intended to erode Iran’s critical missile production capacity and facilitate further military action if the conflict escalates. But an examination of what Israel refrained from targeting is equally important for understanding the geopolitical implications of the strikes. Israel’s relative restraint reflects the Biden administration’s unwillingness to retaliate against Iranian aggression in kind and at scale. Assessing the Operational Concepts of Israel’s Strikes Videos released by the Israeli Air Force reveal that F-15 and F-16 tactical military aviation platforms took part in its strikes on Iran. The limited availability of information makes it impossible to confirm whether Israel used F-35 fifth-generation stealth aircraft. But it is plausible that the F-35’s state-of-the-art sensors and command and control capabilities played a role in the campaign. Additional evidence suggests that Israel employed air-launched standoff aeroballistic missiles in the attack. These missiles possess highly destructive warheads and long effective ranges. This allowed Israel’s non-stealth, fourth-generation airframes to stay out of range of Tehran’s air defenses while striking high-priority sites in Iran. In addition, the IDF likely kept multiple combat search-and-rescue teams on high alert while its strike packages were in the skies. Israel’s target set focused on Iran’s missile and drone production hubs and strategic surface-to-air missile (SAM) network. The targets Israel struck at Parchin and Khojir play important roles in the manufacture of solid-propellant missiles like the Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballistic missile that Iran used in its October 1 attack on Israel. Because facilities at Parchin are also involved in Tehran’s nuclear program, this attack sent a strong message about what Israel might strike next if Iran escalates further. Open-source satellite imagery reveals that Israel inflicted significant damage to Iranian solid fuel mixing buildings and storage warehouses. Israeli forces also struck the Shahroud missile complex. This facility is essential for the proliferation of high-end projectiles like the Fattah and Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballistic missiles, as well as for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program. Prior to its strikes, the IDF eliminated air defenses in Syria to pave the way for its attacks on the Islamic Republic. Although press sources also reported a similar action in Iraq, this report could not confirm it. Israel also systematically eliminated Iran’s long-range air defenses, most notably the Russian S-300 strategic SAMs Tehran used to protect its critical energy infrastructure and ports. In the process, the Israeli Air Force killed several Iranian air defense servicemen. Imagery intelligence also suggests that the Israeli Air Force hit several of Iran’s Ghadir radar installations, hosting derivatives of Russian Rezonans-NE radar systems designed to detect stealth aircraft. In recent years, the Islamic Republic has fielded these sensor complexes to augment its air defense architecture. Russian sources claim that Iran has shown particular interest in Rezonans-NE radars to address the threat that F-35 aircraft pose to its airspace. Unless Russia can quickly replace these systems with new S-300s or S-400s and capable radar complexes (while also meeting its own needs in its highly attritional war in Ukraine), Iran will lack any meaningful air defense against Israeli follow-on strikes. Operational Constraints on Israel While Israel’s air raids went beyond mere surgical strikes, the attack carefully avoided Iran’s energy infrastructure and most sites involved in Tehran’s nuclear program. Israel, moreover, did not target high-level members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps or Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s inner circle. The Biden administration was not the only constraint on the scope of Israel’s strikes. Israel’s weapons stockpiles are also a factor. Iran’s large salvos of medium-range ballistic missiles have depleted Israel’s stocks of high-altitude anti-ballistic missile systems with exoatmospheric interception features. Given the offense-dominant characteristics of missile warfare, Israel is quickly running out of interceptors for its Arrow family of anti–ballistic missile systems. While Israel’s defense technological and industrial base has increased its production rates for these systems as security in the Middle East has deteriorated, Israel’s industrial capacity still lags what it needs. Moreover, since the Arrow 3 is designed to prevent nuclear fallout by intercepting ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction at the exoatmospheric level, Israel needs to preserve these interceptors. As a result, Israel has to rely on Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systemssupplied and operated by United States forces even though US stockpiles of these systems are low. What’s Next? Israel’s strikes did considerable damage to Iran’s missile production capabilities and strategic air defenses while avoiding any direct hits on the Islamic Republic’s energy infrastructure or its leaders. Continued restraints from the Biden administration ahead of US elections, as well as the Israeli government’s desire to avoid an extended exchange with Iran that would stress the IDF’s interceptor stockpiles, will likely temper Israel’s actions moving forward. As such, Tehran’s response to Israel will set the near-term trajectory of the conflict. Should Iran repeat its October 1 strikes by launching a barrage of long-range assets, Israel could respond by targeting Iran’s oil facilities, ports, nuclear program, and leadership.

The Great Retreat: How Trump And Harris Are Looking Backward – Op...	By William L. Anderson The Kamala Harris–Tim Walz presidential campaign declares: 'We Won’t Go Back.' They believe that progressivism’s advance should not be reversed, something they claim Donald Trump would do. No one need worry about a second Trump presidency reversing the 'gains' of progressivism, but the Harris-Walz campaign’s chosen slogan is ironic, given that Harris is reaching back a half century for her economic programs. For all the talk of 'new ideas' and the 'freshness' of the Harris candidacy, much of her economic platform echoes the same progressivism that has been driving the US economy toward a repeat of the 1970s stagflation—but with the added 'bonus' of $35 trillion of national debt. The future Harris administration wants to further increase Donald Trump’s economic plans, on the other hand, reach back to the nineteenth century for tariffs, which he mistakenly believes were responsible for American prosperity. This article covers the candidates’ economic platforms to examine their possible effects. Unfortunately, neither candidate has a realistic view of the US economy, in which the government’s programs of borrowing, spending, and using the Federal Reserve System to underwrite vast military expenditures, unwise political schemes, and other wish list items, abound. Kamala Harris We begin with Harris, since she seems to be leading in the polls. If the trends hold, she will be sworn into office in January, and then she will try to make her campaign rhetoric our economic reality. Harris is part of an administration that has an economic track record that can be described by one word: intervention. She has not put forth a single initiative that even a moderate freemarket advocate could endorse. Looking at the proposed policies on her campaign website, there are few, if any, proposals that address the causes and effects of massive inflation, borrowing, and spending. Other than her tax credit proposal—which would require an act of Congress to implement—her agenda is simple campaign rhetoric. Here are some of her plans: a national program of rent controls a national plan to build three million new housing units to 'ease the housing shortage' a '$40 billion innovation fund—doubling a similar pot of money created by the Biden administration—for businesses building affordable rental housing units' $25,000 down payment grants to first-time home buyers preventing investors from purchasing rental housing anti-price-gouging laws that force food producers to lower prices negotiating with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices increasing the Child Tax Credit to $3,600 per child and expanding it to include a $6,000 tax credit for newborn children Harris also has floated new taxes, including a 25 percent tax on unrealized capital gains of more than $100 million. Her tax proposals What is more significant is what she has not said in her campaign. Other than to claim her 'values have not changed,' Harris has not recycled the proposals from her short-lived 2020 primary campaign. In 2019, she called for the elimination of private health insurance (to be replaced by a government 'Medicare for All' plan) and for a ban on fracking, a process used to extract natural gas and oil, which is responsible for making the US a world leader in energy production. The hard Left supported those proposals, and if Harris had her way, Americans would have to deal with mass confusion in medical care and massive energy shortages. If Harris didn’t understand that point then, she probably does now, especially given that almost 5 percent of all employment in Pennsylvania, a swing state, is tied to fracking, but one is left wondering if President Harris would later pursue those disastrous policies anyway. Her most recent public economic declaration came, ironically, on August 15, the same day President Richard Nixon announced wage and price controls and officially disconnected the dollar from gold in 1971. That Harris would call for similar policies should not be lost on Americans that still remember the economic stagnation and inflation of the 1970s. Even though she didn’t call for official price controls, they were implied, and according to the Wall Street Journal, her message 'electrified' her Democratic Party base. That point should be significant because if economists understand one thing, it is that price controls have a disastrous economic impact over time. One would assume that even Harris’s own economic advisers understand that point. But as Ryan McMaken noted: We shouldn’t be surprised that the Harris campaign is planning to enthusiastically announce its plans for price controls. The Harris people can claim she is 'doing something' about the economy. This will all be couched in terms of 'greedflation' and corporate windfalls and other economic myths used to claim that today’s rising prices—fueled by monetary inflation, massive deficit spending, and a runaway regulatory state—are actually the fault of 'too much capitalism.' Then there are the potential devastating effects of the so-called climate policies that a Harris administration would impose. Harris cut her political teeth in California, which has the most draconian CO2 emissions goals in the country, and where the sale of new gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles will be banned after 2035. Her hostility to energy companies is reflected in her actions when she was California’s attorney general: according to ABC, 'Harris investigated Exxon Mobil over concerns that the company misled the public and its shareholders about the risks of climate change and whether its public statements violated securities laws and other statutes.' There was no smoking gun to validate her claims, but Harris showed she would have no problem imposing huge costs on energy firms to further the Green New Deal. One cannot underestimate the importance of oil and gas in the US economy, and there is no way to fully transition to an 'all-renewable' energy economy, especially in the short time windows set by Democratic politicians. Under the Biden-Harris administration, the US has seen the highest rates of inflation since the early 1980s, yet Harris continues to insist that the inflation is due to 'corporate greed,' not the fact that since 2020 monetary policies have vastly expanded the amount of money in circulation. Harris’s 'plan' to reduce inflation can be summed up as follows: increase business costs through regulation, threats, and litigation from 'corporate crackdowns.' As McMaken pointed out, most people on the Harris team, save a few true believers, know that one cannot reduce inflation by using legal threats to force up business production costs or by imposing price controls. While Harris has declared her fealty to Fed 'independence,' the truth is that she will need every dollar the Fed can print to offset the negative effects of the new taxes and regulatory initiatives that will reduce the capital investment that results in real economic growth. The Biden-Harris administration claims that it has revitalized the US economy, but the Fed’s recent rate cut raises questions about what really is happening. If the economy is as good as Harris claims, then why the need for drastic Fed action? Harris’s business initiatives, such as building three million housing units and aiding American companies, are a continuation of the Biden 'Build Back Better' program that supposedly was going to revitalize moribund sections of American manufacturing and create alternative energy sources. Unfortunately, as one can see, the centerpiece of the Biden program, the Inflation Reduction Act, was little more than crony capitalism, in which business owners direct resources to less-than-profitable venues that benefit politically connected investors. Harris’s business policies will bring back stagflation, where people get further behind while prices for housing and consumer goods rise. In the 1970s, Washington laid new burdens on private enterprise, and firms choked under the regulatory environment. There is nothing in Harris’s plan to prevent a repeat of this scenario. Her tax and regulatory plans will force up business costs and then will have to be offset by monetary expansion by the Fed, just as happened a half century ago. There is one important difference between then and now, however. In the late 1970s, the Jimmy Carter administration, with support from a Democratic Congress, went on a huge deregulation program, allowing more competition in transportation, finance, energy, and telecommunications. Contrary to popular belief, Carter, not Ronald Reagan, was the Great Deregulator. But Harris and the Democrats in Congress today are much more to the left than the Democrats in 1980, and, if anything, they favor vastly expanding the regulatory umbrella. Thus, when stagflation grows under a Harris administration, their response will be to impose more government controls. Donald Trump At this writing, Trump will have to fight an uphill battle to win the presidential election—but the odds were against him in 2016 as well. Thus, we should take a hard look at his economic proposals to see if they will help or hurt the US economy. It is not easy to find specific policy proposals from the Trump campaign. His official campaign site exists solely for fundraising, while the Republican Party platform consists of general statements like 'Carry out the largest deportation operation in American History' and 'Stop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse.' Certainly, the biggest negative of Trump’s plan are the tariffs he advocates, which would add to the tariffs he implemented during his presidential administration. He wants to impose a tariff of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods and a 10 percent overall increase for all tariffs. Anyone familiar with Austrian economics knows that no nation ever has built a prosperous economy through tariffs, and Trump’s 2018 tariffs were no exception to that fact. A recent National Bureau of Economic Research paper notes that Trump’s tariffs harmed agricultural interests, benefited only some manufacturing firms, and had no positive net employment effects in the affected industries. On top of that, as noted in the New York Times, the tariffs did incite other countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American products, making them more expensive to sell overseas, and those levies had a negative effect on American jobs, the paper finds. That was particularly true in agriculture: Farmers who exported soybeans, cotton and sorghum to China were hit by Beijing’s decision to raise tariffs on those products to as much as 25 percent. The US government made up some of these agricultural losses by issuing extra subsidies, but that also expanded the economic deficit. However, as the paper also notes, the tariffs were popular, particularly in the areas most hurt by Trump’s policies. While their popularity might seem ironic, McMaken’s point about the popularity of Nixon’s price controls applies here as well: Politically . . . Nixon’s price control scheme was a big success. Following the administration’s announcement on price controls, the Dow went up nearly 33 points, the largest one-day increase up to that time. Naturally, The New York Times showered praise on Nixon’s plan. Moreover, Nixon and his surrogates claimed that Nixon Thus, should Trump be elected, and his tariffs become official policy, we can expect two things to happen: the overall economic effects will be negative, but they will also give Trump a political boost. People will support the policies and blame free markets when they fail. While a strong argument can be made for immigration controls, Trump’s proposal for 'the largest deportation in American history' raises concerns for which neither he nor his supporters have answers. First, this is not a costless endeavor. The administrative portion itself will require hiring thousands of government agents—unless the goal is to stretch out the deportation process over several years. Second, deporting a million or more people will create serious problems in numerous workplaces where—like it or not—illegal aliens make up the bulk of the employees. Third, Americans also hire illegal aliens for home repair work, landscaping, and many other services, and the sudden loss of these workers would have a significant impact upon our economy. Even if one believes mass deportation is a good thing for the US economy, the short-term costs cannot be ignored. Both Trump and Harris support raising the Child Tax Credit to $6,000, although both have also called for ending taxes on tips. These actions would require congressional approval, so the new Congress would have a say in these tax proposals. Regarding energy and climate change, Trump has been much more realistic than Harris, who has been hostile to the gas, oil, and coal industries throughout her career. As president, Trump promoted the oil and gas industries and pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accords, and his position on these issues has not changed. He also opposes the electric vehicle mandates favored by Harris. The media happy talk notwithstanding, it is fantasy to claim that the US can meet the 'renewable' energy goals in the time frame set by US politicians. At least Trump understands that point even if he is inarticulate in expressing his views. The Candidates and the Fed The unhappy truth is that both platforms will need the Federal Reserve System to expand its easy money policies, despite the massive damage the Fed has already done by bringing back inflation. While Harris claims to defer to the 'experts' at the Fed, Trump wants the president to have more power to set interest rates. Obviously, neither candidate is acknowledging the economically perilous situation in which the government ramps up spending, which distorts the markets, and then depends upon the Fed to monetize the resulting federal deficits. As the debt grows and the economy becomes progressively less responsive to financial stimulus, the threat of stagflation grows. The present path of government borrowing and spending all but guarantees this outcome, and the candidates have neither the political will nor the economic understanding to do what needs to be done. Conclusion In summing up the Trump and Harris proposals, we point out again that neither candidate knows how to deal with stagflation. Instead, they call for more government intervention—Trump for tariffs and Harris for more individual and business taxes and for energy policies that will rapidly make life much more difficult for most Americans. The stagflation of the 1970s was ended by Jimmy Carter’s deregulation initiatives, Paul Volcker’s end to inflation, and Ronald Reagan’s income tax rate cuts. The economy rebounded nicely and grew to astounding levels. Unfortunately, the lessons of the early 1980s have been lost, and all of us will pay a price. About the author: William L.

US Secretary Of Defense Austin Is Ready To Fight Nuclear War Over...	Few Americans today would try to justify the United States government taking part in the Korean War in the 1950s. Even most of those who would make such an attempt would ground their argument in asserting there was a special need back then, as part of the Cold War, to prevent the expansion of communism. The Cold War is long over. So, why are still today tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and many more nearby, ready to resume fighting in the long paused Korean War at a moment’s notice? Inertia? Bloodlust? Reluctance of the military bureaucracy to give up any of its size and scope? The desire of the military-industrial complex to wring every possible dollar it can from the American people? None of these reasons seems very persuasive. Instead of preparing to restart the war that wrought enormous death and destruction the first time around, US officials should be preparing for the US military to finally exit Korea. Yet, there was US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Wednesday not just saying he has declared to the South Korea defense minister 'that the United States remains fully committed to the defense' of South Korea. Further, Austin pledged that the US government’s 'extended deterrence commitment' to South Korea 'remains ironclad' and that that commitment 'is backed by the full range of America’s conventional, missile defense, nuclear and advanced non-nuclear capabilities.' There you go, the US secretary of defense is threatening going nuclear in a war for which the now generally rejected reason for the US becoming involved in it disappeared decades ago. The defense secretary is mad for war. In this condition he reflects US government policy.

The Cruelty Of Crowds – OpEd	Twenty years ago, when I first heard about 'dog poop girl,' I thought, 'Well, that’s just South Korea.' In 2005, a young woman took her dog onto the Seoul metro where it promptly did its business. The owner refused to pick up after it. She was scolded by her fellow passengers. In an earlier age, that would have been the end of it. But this was the Internet age, and South Koreans were among the most digitally connected people in the world. Someone had caught the action on their cell phone and posted a picture of the dog owner to a popular website, soliciting others to ferret out her identity. Once identified, the young woman was subjected to so much shame and humiliation that she reportedly dropped out of university. The story caught the attention of the global media, became a meme, and was even turned into a 2021 Romanian film. If it were just a one-off, then the story of 'dog poop girl' would be just another strange digital-era fad that comes and goes, like flash mobs or the mannequin challenge. Alas, the Internet has become like a malign magnifying glass that focuses the anger of anonymous crowds onto individuals. Today, the private information of those targeted—which, as in the cases of 'dog poop girl,' Gamergate, and various 'Karen' controversies, often turn out to be women— is broadcast across the Internet so that they can be 'doxxed' with threatening letters and packages and even the dispatch of SWAT teams. Videos of negative interactions, which often involve confrontations across race, class, or gender, end up ruining reputations and lives. Many of these cases have been scrutinized at great length. Less explored perhaps is the link between this on-line behavior and global politics. Fascist politicians once relied on shock troops to eliminate opponents and their supporters. Today, they are using social media for the same ends. The rise of these far-right figures cannot be understood without reference to the digital frenzy of their supporters. Father Coughlin had radio. Leni Riefenstahl had film. Today, the far right has the Internet. Same hate, different media. A Short History of Collective Cruelty Let’s face it: it used to be worse. When life was considerably harsher and more violent than it is today, cruelty was a more integral part of everyday experience. Stockades were essential tools for public shaming and punishment. Crowds once gathered to watch executions, even particularly gruesome displays like drawing and quartering. Picnickers brought their baskets and opera glasses to watch the first major battle of the Civil War. Lynchings, which often involved drawn-out torture, were also accompanied by food and festivity. The last U.S. public hanging attracted 20,000 people to Kentucky in 1936. Suffice it to say, they didn’t go there to protest the execution. It’s not difficult to find examples of collective cruelty in today’s world. The ancient punishment of public stoning, for instance, continues in Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Mali, and elsewhere as a method to execute adulterers, murderers, and infidels. Here, too, crowds often gather to provide approving witness. So, perhaps Internet 'stonings,' with words substituting for 'sticks and stones,' are a marginal improvement. But that’s cold comfort for the victims. Consider again the case of South Korea where a rash of high-profile suicides were associated with some of the earliest examples of cyberbullying. Between 2000 and 2019, 40 celebrities committed suicide, with hateful messages and malicious comments on social media sites as a leading factor. After two more high-profile suicides in 2022—a male volleyball player upset over the rumor-mongering about his sexuality and a female influencer slandered on-line as a 'man-hater'—150,000 South Koreans signed a petition calling for those responsible for the cyberbullying to be punished. In the United States, meanwhile, social media has fueled an increase in teenage suicide rates and prompted hundreds of lawsuits against platforms like Instagram for amplifying derogatory content. All of that is tragic, to be sure. More consequential perhaps is the way that the cruelty of crowds, expressed digitally, is transforming modern politics. Fanning the Flames Integral to the rise of the MAGA movement in the United States—and to other far-right parties around the world—have been conspiracy theories like QAnon. The far right’s obsession with 'globalists' who supposedly support unlimited migration, undermine sovereignty, and perpetuate 'anti-family' doctrines goes hand in hand with a platform of nationalist renewal that has distinctly fascist overtones. Conspiracy theories certainly existed before the Internet. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the infamous anti-Semitic tract, facilitated the eruption of pogroms throughout Russia in the early twentieth century. However, even as it has provided an unprecedented opportunity to retrieve and verify information, the Internet has not just perpetuated any number of conspiracy theories but has also undermined any collective understanding of the truth. Everyone has their niche on-line, from beach volleyball players to collectors of Malaysian postage stamps. The truth, it seems, has also been divided up into myriad niches. Anti-vaxxers, flatworlders, election deniers, and those original Internet conspiracy hounds the 9-11 Truthers can all find a place on-line that reinforces their particular 'truth.' There is no strength in this kind of diversity, only an epistemological vacuum. The real-world implications of this assault on truth have been enormous. One of the most recent myths in the current U.S. election involves a false claim amplified by J.D. Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate. On line, he supported the notion that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, a town of around 60,000 people, have been eating other people’s pets. Although this myth has been thoroughly debunked—by no less than the Republican mayor of Springfield—it achieved even greater notoriety when cited by Trump in his only debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. The response by the anonymous crowd has been beyond vitriolic. After the one-two punch of Vance and Trump, Springfield had to declare a state of emergency. Neo-Nazi groups have converged on the city to build on the hateful comments made by politicians. Bomb threats forced the evacuation of schools. The Republican mayor has also been besieged. 'There are threats against my family,' he told The New York Times. 'Emails, phone calls. They say they don’t want me around, I’m going to die, I’m a traitor, ‘We’re watching your family.’ All these things that you never want to hear.' Because they don’t have a lot of political or media power to fight back, immigrants are a convenient target for the MAGA crowd. But the far right has waved a variety of red flags to incite violence: against FEMA and its response to the recent hurricanes, Custom and Border Protection officials for their work at the border, even jurors who voted to convict Trump in his New York trial. But it’s the election itself that has attracted the greatest level of manipulation. The aggressive rhetoric is escalating on-line in such corners of the Internet as Telegram. According to the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism: Much like in 2020, violent rhetoric related to election denialism has risen 317 percent over the course of October 2024. Posts made on Telegram include using election denialism to justify an apparent 'inevitable civil war' and a call to 'Shoot to kill any illegal voters.' Throughout the year, Proud Boys online accounts, whose leader and members helped orchestrate the January 6, 2021 insurrection, have been calling for elected officials to be 'arrested, tried for treason, and hanged,' and called for their supporters to 'keep your rifles by your side.' It’s not just domestic politicians who are fanning the flames of hatred in the United States. Other countries, too, are doing their best to push the crowd in certain directions. Although some U.S. politicians pretend to be evenhanded—by suggesting that Russia and Iran somehow balance each other out by each backing a different candidate—the Kremlin has in fact been playing a much more significant role in exploiting dividing lines in the U.S. electorate and promoting greater polarization. Long after its intervention in the 2016 election, Russia is still establishing hundreds of X accounts, multiple websites, and scads of video clips with various types of disinformation. For example, the Kremlin paid alt-right influencer Lauren Chen to publish Russia-friendly videos on her popular channel and, more significantly, funnel millions of dollars into the hands of even more prominent pro-Trump commentators. She is currently under federal indictment. Future Fractiousness South Koreans are petitioning their government to punish those who participate in collective shaming exercises on the Internet. In the more litigious United States, the strategy is to make social media platforms pay for their role in disseminating hate. But this is just tinkering at the margins. Digital companies must institute changes—or be forced to do so by government, public demand, or legal action. One option would be to ban anonymity so that individual malefactors can’t hide in the crowd. But the arguments against such a move are persuasive. So, here are some other possible approaches. First, the chief engineers of hatemongering and disinformation must be brought to account. We shouldn’t have to rely on the courts to bankrupt someone like Alex Jones, who was responsible for spreading so many malicious conspiracy theories. Free speech is a sacred right, but no one should be allowed to yell fire on the Internet when there’s no smoke or flames. Second, distinguish between free speech and 'free reach.' Sure, people can still say noxious things on the Internet. But algorithms should not promote hateful content. To achieve this, social media companies would have to make their algorithms transparent. Third, stop treating message boards like the Wild West. There needs to be professional moderation with clear rules of conduct. Okay, that takes care of the trolls. But what about the politicians who have weaponized the cruelty of crowds? Democratic mechanisms are supposed to weed out the worst offenders, but obviously that’s not working. Deplatforming is an excellent way of reducing their digital power; independent fact-checking can counter their most audacious lies. But still, some politicians manage to throw off these constraints. If they win power like Viktor Orbán in Hungary or Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, they short-circuit democratic mechanisms to stay in office. At some point, the focus has to shift from reducing the cruelty to transforming the crowd itself. Minimizing the political polarization that sustains the cruelty of crowds will require both civic education and a reduction of economic polarization. Transforming the electorate into a civil and civic-minded group that isn’t so easily divided between haves and have-nots is the only real solution. But it’s going to be the hardest lift of all.

Prabowo’s Army-Style Retreat Fuels Debate On Active-Duty Troops S...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus and Arie Firdaus Images of newly inducted Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto wearing jungle-green camouflage fatigues and leading cabinet members in drills has raised concern over whether he is reviving the military’s 'dual function' role in government, as it was under dictator Suharto. Just days after the former army special forces commander took office, the president and similarly dressed members of Team Prabowo were seen marching in formation and pounding the parade ground in their combat boots, during a three-day retreat at a military academy in Central Java. The retreat was touted as a team-building exercise but took place amid plans to revise a law governing the nation’s armed forces. Analysts said Prabowo’s decision to fly ministers on a C-130 Hercules aircraft, have them stay in barracks and wear army uniforms hints at bringing the military back into a central role in government. 'The retreat symbolizes that Prabowo’s regime is prioritizing a militaristic mindset in governing,' Al Araf, a military analyst and human rights advocate at Centra Initiative, told BenarNews. Prabowo, Suharto’s former son-in-law, entered office on Oct. 20 with his past military record blemished by allegations that he had committed human rights abuses as an army commander. A Prabowo spokesman said the retreat at The National Military Academy of Indonesia in Magelang was aimed solely at strengthening unity among ministers from diverse backgrounds. 'It’s about fostering connection and closeness,' Hasan Nasbi, head of the Presidential Communications Office, told BenarNews. A written statement from Prabowo’s communications team said cabinet members were asked to wake up at 4 a.m. for sports activities and marching exercises. Prior to breakfast and lunch, Prabowo rang a bell to signal prayer time, followed by cabinet members shouting 'enjoy the meals' before they ate and 'thank you,' at the end, the Reuters news service reported. Prabowo, in a speech opening the retreat, downplayed the setting. 'I don’t intend to make you all militaristic – that’s not the point. It’s about the military way,' Prabowo said. Al Araf linked Prabowo’s efforts to a planned revision of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) Law that could expand the military’s role in government. A draft of the revision allows active-duty soldiers to hold positions in ministries or institutions needing their expertise, enabling placements beyond those listed in the TNI Law. Efforts by parliament to pass the revision failed under President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, who left office nearly two weeks ago, because of civilian resistance, said Dave Laksono, a lawmaker overseeing the process. 'There has been no further progress on the TNI Law revision discussions,' Dave told BenarNews. Beni Sukadis, a military observer at Merapi Consulting, said assigning active military members to civilian positions could weaken the armed forces’ core role as the nation’s defender. 'Placing military personnel in civilian roles is highly counterproductive to TNI professionalism,' he said. He said Prabowo’s appointment of his personal aide, active-duty Maj. Teddy Indra Wijaya, as cabinet secretary, violated the 2004 TNI law. The analyst said he feared this signaled a revival of the military’s dual function. During Suharto’s New Order era, Indonesia’s military and police played both military and civilian roles, a concept known as the 'dual function.' In 1998, Suharto stepped down after 32 years in power. His fall ushered in a reform era in democracy and ended the dual function. 'Teddy’s appointment may be considered a legal violation or an exploitation of a loophole, as it is not explicitly covered under the TNI Law,' Beni said. 'To hold a civilian role, he should resign or take early retirement.' Prabowo spokesman Hasan said Teddy did not need to leave the military to serve in the government. 'As per the latest presidential regulation, the cabinet secretary is a second-echelon state civil apparatus position under the ministry of state secretary,' Hasan said, adding that, like the military secretary role, it could be held by active military personnel. ‘Softening the language’ Dimas Bagus Arya, coordinator of the human rights organization KontraS, said the retreat signaled that Prabowo aims to normalize civilian-military practices in Indonesia. In addition, Prabowo’s appointment of Teddy, despite his active-duty status with Kopassus, the president’s old army’s special forces unit, signals a move to reintroduce the military’s dual function, Dimas said. 'The term ‘military way’ used by Prabowo is just softening the language. The real intention is a return to a militaristic approach,' he said. He said KontraS expects militaristic practices in the administration will strengthen in the coming years because of the possible revision to the TNI law. Beni, meanwhile, said Prabowo already applied a military approach within his Gerindra Party, including the formation of a semi-military wing. He argued that this approach might not succeed as the military relies on a top-down structure while civilian governments tend to be bottom-up. Beni also expressed concern about a potential return to the military dual function, where career officers could occupy civilian roles without a strong legal basis. 'If this continues, it could lead to authority abuse and instability in the government system,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO3H544SP64FE	2024-10-31T16:52:49-07:00	
California’s Identity Problem – OpEd	California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed Senate Bill 1174, which prohibits local governments from enacting or enforcing identification requirements for voting. The measure was authored by state Sen. David Min, Irvine Democrat, now running for Congress in California’s 47th district. Min’s own background raises questions about the legality and morality of bills making voter identification illegal. Min earned a JD at Harvard, served as an enforcement attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and taught law at the UC Irvine School of Law for eight years. Min is a member of the bar in New York State and the District of Columbia, and in February 2022 he passed the California bar exam. That exam has stringent requirements, including a moral character test. Those taking the test must include fingerprints from a Live Scan Service form completed within the last 90 days. So, to practice law in California, Harvard law alum Dave Min submitted to a mandatory identification check and moral fitness test. Contrast the bar exam with the dynamics of voting. An election makes voters public officials for one day. Voters can decide who becomes president and vice president of the United States, a matter of some importance. Voters can elect members of Congress who will make the laws, and approve or reject various ballot measures that have direct bearing on taxpayers. Min wants voters to be exempt from identification measures, and bans local governments from imposing them. That stands at odds from some of Min’s own materials. For example, contributors to Min’s congressional campaign must certify, 'I am a U.S. citizen or lawfully admitted permanent resident (i.e., green card holder).' As the Harvard law alum must know, by law U.S. citizenship is a requirement for voting, yet the senator and candidate wants to bar identification of voters. Min’s legislation contends that 'voter identification laws place the onus on the voter to prove their identity and right to vote, even after voters have taken the necessary steps to prove their identity and right to vote through the voter registration process.' As the Orange County Democrat should know, this is not true in the Golden State. California automatically registers illegals to vote when they get their driver’s license at the DMV. State officials won’t say how many illegals violated the law by voting in 2016, 2018, 2020, or in the 2021 recall election for Gavin Newsom, who signed Min’s bill. State attorney general Rob Bonta had already filed a lawsuit against Huntington Beach, the Orange County city that sought to require voter identification. Bonta contends that ID requirements could make it harder for poor, non-white, young, elderly and disabled voters to cast ballots. Legitimate citizens and legal immigrants have room for reasonable doubt. All Californians are required to produce identification to board airplanes, apply for a home loan, purchase a firearm, purchase whiskey, become an attorney, and so forth. Californians might think a Harvard law alum, SEC enforcement attorney and law professor would know that. Californians also have to wonder about their attorney general, a Yale law alum As a member of the California Assembly, Bonta was the prime mover of Assembly Bill 2088, the California Wealth Tax, which if passed would have slapped a 0.4 percent tax on the portion of a taxpayer’s net worth that exceeded $30 million. AB-2088 would also have taxed former Californians 90 percent of their in-state levy in the first year after they left the state and 80 percent in the second year, phasing out over a decade. A Yale law alum should know that a state can’t tax non-residents, and that non-citizens can’t vote. In light of Bonta, Min, and Newsom, legitimate citizens and legal immigrants might imagine this scenario. Congress is in session and an unelected imposter poses as a House member and votes to approve an increase in taxes and government spending. That would not be acceptable, but illegal voters essentially pull off the same trick. Anybody who endorses non-citizen voting, regardless of party affiliation or ideological profile, forfeits any claim to support the rule of law, the basis of a free and democratic society.

The US Elections: Campaign, Transition And Inauguration – Analysi...	Which are the various elements –beyond the election itself on 5 November– that need to be taken into account for a new White House Administration to get under way. By Carlota García Encina There are only a few days to go before a decisive election is held in the US; but the electoral cycle goes beyond 5 November. The primary stage, which enables the presidential and their vice-presidential candidates to be chosen, ended at the start of summer and culminated in the Republican and Democrat conventions in July and August respectively. Now two more phases draw to a close: the electoral campaign, which culminates on 5 November, centred on the so-called swing statesand attention focused on elections to the Senate and House of Representatives; and the transition period, when the votes are counted and certified, and the transfer of powers takes place. This will conclude on 20 January with the inauguration of the new occupant of the White House, as stipulated in the 20th amendment to the US Constitution. Analysis 1. The campaign The electoral campaign in the US formally began on 3 September 2024, one day after the Labor Dayholiday. But the reality is that the starting pistol was fired when Donald Trump announced his intention to run in the Republican primaries. Now there are only a few weeks remaining a closely contested campaign, with an unexpected new Democrat candidate. Since entering the race at the end of July, Vice-president Harris has been able to improve the position of President Biden in the polls both nationally and in the battleground states. Harris has managed to control the terms of the debate and Trump’s campaign has failed in its attempts to link it to a still unpopular President. But although Harris is gaining ground, Trump is not losing support. Not everything is decided on 5 November. Voting has already begun in some states, with Alabama the first to send out its postal votes on 11 September, followed by another nine that started to do so 45 days prior to the elections. These were gradually joined by the remaining states (voting papers for the armed forces and residents abroad were also sent out 45 days prior to polling day). Voting in person also began five weeks before polling day, with Virginia the first state to begin in-person voting, followed by South Dakota and Minnesota. In the US it is necessary to register in order to vote, making voting a two-step process that sometimes has the effect of disincentivising the electorate. Formerly, the complicated voting procedures each of the states established, together with a range of other restrictive measures, erected a set of obstacles between voters and ballot boxes, too frequently designed to impede the participation of certain groups of citizens, often identifiable by their ethnicity, race, class, literacy rates or party allegiances. The registration processes have changed considerably and are less openly discriminatory, extending the deadlines and making the process almost automatic, but they continue to impede some citizens’ participation. This is one of the reasons why the turnout in presidential elections has generally been very low, typically hovering around the 50% mark. The 2020 election, however, had the highest turnout of a national election since 1900, with 66% of the population taking part. A new Democrat candidate could once again drive turnout in a tight race and it is expected to match the percentage of previous elections. The end goal of the two major parties is to amass 270 electors, a simple majority of the Electoral College comprising 538 members. The Electoral College is a venerable and arcane institution –and by extension, process– which is used only for presidential elections (the popular vote is used to decide all Congressional, state and local elections). This model emerged for the first time in the constitution of 1787. At that time, the idea of using the popular vote to choose the President was explicitly rejected because the founding fathers did not trust voters’ ability to make a wise choice. The Electoral College was thus agreed as a compromise between those who thought that Congress should choose the President and others who advocated a direct popular nationwide vote. In its place, state legislatures were charged with appointing electors to form the Electoral College. The electors are therefore a group of intermediaries appointed by the US Constitution to choose the country’s President and Vice-president, and they usually hold an elected office or are significant members of a party. Each of the 50 states is assigned a number of Electoral College members to match its total number of representatives in the Lower House plus its senators. Ratification of the 23rd amendment in 1961 enabled citizens of the District of Columbia to take part in presidential elections too, since when they have had three electors. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia use a system in which the winner of the popular vote in each of the state elections wins all the electors who have been assigned to the said state. Maine and Nebraska have adopted a different approach. These states assign two electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in the state and then one electoral college vote to the winner of the popular vote in each Congressional district (two in Maine, three in Nebraska). The US Constitution created the Electoral College, but did not explain how the votes would be assigned to the presidential candidates, an ambiguity that allowed these two states this exception. By casting their vote on the election day or beforehand, voters play their role in the formal process of ‘selecting’ the electors in their state. In most presidential elections in the course of history, the Electoral College has operated without any problem. On five occasions however the winner of the Electoral College has not been the winner of the popular vote. Three of these occurred in the 19th century, none in the 20th century and two in the 21stcentury. The main problem is that having a President who loses the popular vote despite having won the Electoral College undermines his electoral legitimacy. In 2000 Vice-president Al Gore won the popular vote against Governor George W. Bush by slightly more than 500,000 votes. In 2016 the results were even more dramatic, with Clinton winning the popular vote by more than 2,800,000 and losing the Electoral College. In the 2020 presidential election, a switch of only 45,000 votes in three states –Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona– could have created a tie in the Electoral College and forced a contingent election to be held in the House of Representatives. This would have happened even though Joe Biden had won the popular vote by more than seven million votes. This discrepancy between the Electoral College and the popular vote is generating growing controversy about the electoral system. Moreover, reports of voting irregularities have done nothing to help the electorate feel particularly secure about the integrity of the process. And here another threat must be added. At a time of major income inequality and significant geographical differences between the states, there is a risk of the Electoral College systematically overrepresenting the opinions of a relatively small number of people owing to the structure of the Electoral College itself. As it is currently constituted, each state has two votes in the Electoral College, regardless of the size of its population, plus the additional votes matching its number of members of the House of Representatives. This format overrepresents the small and medium-sized states to the detriment of the large ones. All these objections have led US citizens to increasingly oppose the Electoral College. Six out of 10 would prefer the winner to be the candidate who attracts most votes at the national level, with increasing division along party lines, with Democrats declaring themselves mostly in favour and the Republicans more divided. The US voting system is therefore structured around the states, which are the important jurisdictional unit of the presidential elections. This causes the political campaigns to focus on a relatively small number of pivotal swing states. These are highly sought-after states that have historically swung between voting for one party or the other in the presidential elections, whereas most states vote systematically for the same party (between 2000 and 2020, 36 states voted for the same party). For this reason, these states receive a disproportionate amount of attention from polling companies and candidates, who spend more than 75% of their campaign budgets on them, and the claim that ‘every vote counts’ becomes especially apposite in these cases. If no candidate wins a majority of Electoral College votes (they are tied on 269) the presidential election passes to the House of Representatives for a second round. However, in contrast to the usual practice of the House, each state would only receive one vote, decided by the party that controls the state’s delegation to the House of Representatives. The current electoral cycle will once again be determined by the decisive swing states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin (known as the Rust Belt); and Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina (known as the Sun Belt). When Joe Biden was the Democrat candidate after winning the primaries, his victory required winning the Rust Belt, while the Sun Belt was virtually written off as lost. With Kamala Harris, the party is once again competitive in all seven states and the possible combinations for winning the 270 electoral college votes have risen, while the possibilities of the Republican remain almost unchanged. Various scenarios have been mentioned depending on the campaign strategy. One possibility is that Harris flips the Biden plan of taking the Rust Belt and claims victory by concentrating on the Sun Belt. This would mean not relying on gaining ground among non-university educated white voters –reducing the possibility of victory in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin– but winning an even higher percentage of white university graduates and ethnically Asian voters than in 2020. She would also need to match the previous election’s results among Black and Latino voters, which would enable her to retain Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, enough to secure a majority of electoral college votes. A second scenario involves the materialisation of Trump’s supposed gains among Black, Latino and ethnically Asian voters, propelling his return to the White House. Although he would lose the national popular vote, he would win the presidency if he increased his percentage of support among these minorities, gaining Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Another possibility is that Harris secures a good result among voters aged 65 and over, which would enable her to retain Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, accumulating 276 electoral college votes. If this were the case, it would be the first time a Democrat candidate managed to win the support of this group since Al Gore, and would come at a time in which Harris is gaining ground among young voters, albeit not enough. Although neither campaign wants to lose votes, the replacement of young voters by their older counterparts is potentially positive for Harris given that there are more older people in the US than young people under 30 and they are more likely to sign up to the electoral register and cast their ballot. And although the exact figures differ according to state, older voters constitute a much larger part of the electorate than younger voters in some of the swing states. Another possible scenario is a chaotic electoral result –with few patterns or consistent tendencies in the battleground states– which could lead to a narrow victory for Trump. A case in point would be the mid-term elections of 2022, which produced very different results from one state to another, with the Democrats doing well in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Colorado and the Republicans dominating in New York, California and Florida. Finally, it is important not to overlook what is normally referred to as the ‘October surprise’, an event, whether deliberate or spontaneous, that can influence the result in November. Some believe that it has already taken place and it could be the dockers’ strike on the East Coast, or Iran’s attack on Israel, which threatens an even wider war, or the most recent 165-page filing by Special Counsel Jack Smith in the federal case against Donald Trump for subverting the 2020 presidential election. Or perhaps the surprise is still to come. Most commentators tend to believe that such a surprise no longer applies, however. The 2016 presidential race was influenced a month before the election by the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mails which, according to some, cost her the election. The distinctive characteristic of the current presidential election, however, is immobility. In fact, the only thing that has seriously shifted the polls was Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race and his replacement by Kamala Harris as the Democrat candidate. But neither Biden’s poor debating performance, nor the first assassination attempt on Trump, nor the second caused a major change in the polls. This stability reflects the calcified state of current US politics, with US citizens politically split down the middle and deeply polarised in their opinions. The conclusion is that everything remains up for grabs in a tight presidential race, although Kamala Harris has clearly increased her possible combinations for securing 270 electors. But as well as the presidential campaign, it is important not to lose sight of what is at stake in the Senate and the House of Representatives, which is by no means trivial. Regardless of who wins the election, if one of the two chambers falls into the hands of the opposing party, it will change the victor’s options when it comes to governing. 2. Congress The 435 seats of the House of Representatives are also up for re-election in November –Representatives’ terms last for two years– as well as a third of the 100 Senate seats –Senators’ terms last for six years–. This difference in the duration of terms means that the House of Representatives tends to reflect popular passions and passing enthusiasms, whereas the Senate tempers the enthusiasm with wisdom and experience. Congress is the branch closest to the ground. It is the point of entry through which ordinary citizens try to influence politics and unlikely as it may seem, congressmen and women devote considerable time to finding out what their voters want. Congress is also the place where the contradictory opinions and priorities of a large, diverse and energetic country come together and frequently collide. It forces its members to find enough points in common to be able to pass laws in their own chamber, in the other chamber, and subsequently obtain the President’s signature. It requires negotiation and compromise, and when Congress works well, it produces legislation capable of garnering widespread support throughout the country. Lastly, part of the work of Congress consists of controlling and supervising the executive branch. There can be no doubt that this function can be used to pursue partisan ends, but also to ensure that the institutions and bureaucrats are truly serving the US people as they should. It would be no surprise if a Republican majority were to constitute a partner less willing to arrive at compromises with a Democrat White House, with a legislative blockade and an aggressive use of Congressional tools to attack and goad the new Administration. The same may be expected if the opposite holds true, although the Biden Administration has shown that it still believes in bipartisan politics, because during its mandate it has managed to push through three major legislative packages with the help of Republican votes. Among the powers wielded by the upper chamber is the ability to institute dismissal procedures against senior federal officers (impeachment), but it is also charged with exercising the power of evaluation and approval in matters of treaties and plays an important role in the confirmation (or rejection) of certain nominations (around 1,200 of the President’s 4,000 political nominations), such as ambassadors and senior judges. It also proposes legislation, draws up and amends draft bills, oversees the federal budget and approves the treaties with foreign nations negotiated by the executive power. Everything seems to indicate that the Senate could revert to Republican hands. But the Senate usually requires a majority of 60 out of 100 to get most legislative initiatives over the hurdle of delaying tactics, known as the filibuster, making it essential to find consensus with the other side. And if this cannot be achieved, government is fundamentally done through executive orders. Recent forecasts suggest that whoever wins it will be a chamber almost as evenly split as the current one (49 Republican senators and 51 Democrats). In the event of a tie in the number of senators, majority control will depend on the candidate who wins the presidential race (the Vice-president has the casting vote, if necessary). A practically tied Senate would therefore limit the ambitions of both the Republican and the Democrat agendas and the only bearing they would be able to exert on the fiscal domain would rely on a procedure known as ‘reconciliation’, which enables the Senate to use a simple majority to modify income and expenditure. This is particularly important for next year, when many of the cuts imposed during the first Trump Administration come to an end. For its part, the House of Representatives can initiate impeachment against federal office-holders by voting for articles of dismissal that are then sent to the Senate; it is also empowered to approve and reject presidential nominations and international treaties. But it also has the power to investigate specific cases and matters related to the executive, judicial and other branches of the state, which includes the authority to summon witnesses and documents, hold public hearings and send the results to committees for review and create specific committees for this purpose. This power of oversight has been used aggressively by the Republicans in the last two years, for example against the head of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the son of the incumbent President, Hunter Biden. The lower chamber also holds the purse strings. On its own the House of Representatives cannot pass bills into law, but it can refuse to endorse them, or to grant them money, and it can threaten to shut down government. The current Republican majority has sought to hold the debt limit hostage in an attempt to force spending cuts and has frozen additional funding of Ukraine for months, and could do so again in the future. More spending aimed at countries such as Ukraine and Taiwan, or to confront the world’s authoritarian regimes, could prove even more difficult if the lower chamber is in Republican hands, because they seem to be determined to go ahead with cutting what they deem to be superfluous expenditure. It is not clear who is going to control the 435 seats of the House of Representatives, which is a toss-up between the two parties, albeit with a narrow advantage for the Democrats. Securing a majority is in any event crucial for both parties. 3. Transition After the election is held on 5 November, the 538 electors travel to the capitals of their respective states –on the Monday following the second Wednesday of December– to elect the President of the US. These citizens, chosen for their loyalty to their political party, will vote for the presidential candidate who has won the popular vote in their state. Here something comes into play that until recently had remained in relative obscurity: the counting and certification of the ballot. Immediately after the 2020 presidential election, at least 17 election officers from the counties of six swing states tried to block the certification of the total votes cast in their respective counties, alleging electoral fraud. Such an attempt to block certification was hitherto unprecedented. Although all the attempts foundered, the contested certifications might potentially have derailed the election. In 2022, during the mid-term elections, at least 22 county election officials voted in favour of delaying certification in key battleground states, an increase of almost 30% compared with 2020. In some cases the officials managed to stall –although ultimately not block– the certification. In the first eight months of 2024, at least eight county officials have already voted against certifying primary or special election results. Everything suggests that interference in certification could return after the 2024 presidential election, given that the trend that has been evident since 2020. It is possible that there will once again be a degree of chaos and confusion in the certifications at the local level –less so at the state level– but dozens of local officials are already lined up and prepared to ensure that the certification process goes ahead with the changes instituted since 2020 to prevent political interference in the process. If a local entity refuses to certify, the courts will intervene to force certification. Despite misgivings it is therefore necessary to trust the process. When the electors have voted for the presidential candidate who has won the popular vote in their respective states, the next step is a joint session of Congress held at the Capitol building to count the electoral votes and declare the result of the election. Since the mid-20thcentury, this joints session has been held on 6 January at 13:00. The incumbent Vice-president chairs the meeting and opens the votes of each state in alphabetical order. At the end of the count, the Vice-president announces the name of the next President. At this point the presidential race will have officially ended, paving the way to the presidential inauguration on 20 January. The states expect that their electors will respect the will of their voters in the Capitol. In other words, the electors pledge to vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state. However, the constitution does not oblige them to do so, which enables there to be ‘faithless electors’. In 1796 Samuel Miles was the first to cast his vote in favour of a candidate who had not won the popular vote in his state. In the 2016 election, seven electors ignored the dictates of the popular vote in their state, this being the highest number in any modern election. In a highly polarised political context in which people harbour strong feelings towards particular candidates, it is possible –but still rather unlikely– that future faithless electors could tip the presidency in one direction or another. However, 38 states and Washington DC have laws in place that force the electors to vote for their party’s official candidate. A 2020 Supreme Court decision ruled that the states are authorised to impose sanctions –including fines, replacement as an elector and a possible trial– against ‘faithless electors’ or those who vote against the popular vote in their state. Moreover, after the assault on the Capitol on 6 January 2021, Congress approved a series of reforms that would make it more difficult for partisan actors to manipulate the results of future presidential elections. In 2022 the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act gave even greater clarity to the specific functions and duties of the Congress and Vice-president in counting the Electoral College certificates and ensures that the Congress receives and considers the electoral votes that truly reflect the election results. It is said that if Kamala Harris wins the election on 5 November, she will need to defend her victory until January precisely due to the uncertainties surrounding the count and certification of the votes, above all in light of the Republican candidate’s declarations and the fear that he is already manoeuvring in advance of what may take place. The institutions have taken steps to ensure that the final results are a true reflection of the votes cast. There may be episodes of chaos and confusion mainly at a local level and, in particular, pre-meditated news stories about electoral fraud and doubts about the results. But nobody doubts that whoever finally takes possession of the White House will be the winner of the contest. 4. Transfer of powers The constitution has virtually nothing to say about presidential transitions, apart from the fact that the next President will take up office on 20 January. But there is a federal law, the Presidential Transition Act, originally approved in 1963, which establishes certain processes and requirements that apply both before and after elections, in the event of a new President coming to power. It does not say anything about the outgoing President having to invite his successor to the White House or personally cooperate with him in any way. This is only a tradition, but a tradition that no outgoing Administration had ever failed to observe until it was broken in 2020 with Donald Trump as outgoing President, who also decided not to attend his successor’s inauguration. A peaceful handover of power –above all from one political party to another– is arguably the ultimate expression of the rule of law. It was George Washington’s great contribution to the US political tradition when he voluntarily gave up the presidency. The spectacle of an outgoing President –Donald Trump– behaving in a way that had never been seen before was profoundly corrosive to US democracy. The process of presidential transition therefore exists in a symbolic way, with the ritual of one President yielding power to another displaying a society that respects the law, where the will of the electorate holds sway. But there is also a practical level. The federal government of the US is one of the largest organisations in the world and the process of transferring control from one group of political actors to another is extraordinarily complex. The presidential transition is therefore also a process of planning a new presidential mandate. And the presidential candidates achieve this by establishing transition teams, organisations that are legally separate from the presidential campaigns. The transition teams are responsible, among other things, for investigating the backgrounds of personnel, for planning policies and management programmes for turning campaign promises into governance. There are thousands of real-time decisions that have to be taken from the moment the future President takes office. And a longstanding tradition has developed whereby, as soon as the result of the election is known, the outgoing Administration –if the Administration is changing– undertakes to help the incoming Administration take up the reins. The key is that whoever occupies the White House should be ready to govern from the very first day of taking up residence. An incoming President is responsible for making more than 4,000 political nominations, overseeing a budget of approximately US$6 trillion and managing an enormous organisation that employs more than two million federal workers and more than two million service personnel and reserve forces. If the process is delayed or is not completed effectively, it could even have implications for national security. In the elections that took place in 2000, when the Supreme Court took 35 days to rule on the electoral dispute in Florida between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the Clinton Administration decided not to give access to either of the two teams and wait until the final resolution of the dispute. This led to a truncated transition that had a negative impact on national security, as the Commission on the 9/11 attacks on the US found, concluding that the shortened transition from the Clinton to the Bush Administration was a factor that contributed to the country’s vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Conclusions Only a few days remain before the 5 November polling day in the US, thereby bringing to an end a tight race that will be decided by a handful of states and relatively few votes. But it is not only the presidency that is at stake; the result in the Senate and the House of Representatives will determine the future Administration’s room for manoeuvre. But the contest will not end there. If Trump wins, the US should prepare for a transfer of power to a new Administration that is shaping up to be disruptive, especially on the domestic stage. If Harris wins, she will also need to defend her victory over Donald Trump until the day of her inauguration. However, the institutions have taken sufficient steps to ensure that there is a peaceful transition of power in spite of the narratives being advanced by Trump and the suspicion that he could try to repeat what happened between November 2020 and January 2021. Even if the transfer passes off smoothly, the narratives of the Republican Party are already having a tremendously corrosive effect. In addition, there is the damage being inflicted on the position of the US in the world and the trust that citizens may have in their government. There is a significant difference between wanting US democracy to work, while acknowledging severe problems, and a widespread effort to undermine people’s fundamental faith in the democratic process.

Saudi-US Bilateral Accords ‘Not That Connected’ To Israel Normali...	By Nour El-Shaeri Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on Thursday that some of the bilateral agreements the kingdom has been negotiating with Washington are 'not that tied' to the normalization of Saudi relations with Israel and are 'moving ahead.' He noted that potential US-Saudi agreements on trade and artificial intelligence are 'not tied to any third parties' and 'can progress probably quite quickly.' 'Some of the more significant defense cooperation agreements are much more complicated. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to finalize them before the end of the Biden administration's term, but that’s reliant on factors outside of our control,' he said. 'The other work streams are not that connected, and some of them are progressing quite quickly, and we hope to see movement forward.' Ruling out the possibility of Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel without the establishment of a Palestinian state, Prince Faisal stated that this remains the only viable solution, regardless of Israel’s acceptance. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative summit in Riyadh, he emphasized that the creation of a Palestinian state is rooted in international law and UN resolutions. 'In reality, the establishment of a Palestinian state is not tied to whether or not Israel accepts it; it’s tied to the principles of international law,' he said. 'The UN resolutions that led to the establishment of the state of Israel clearly envisioned a Palestinian state as well, so we need to make that happen.' Prince Faisal asserted that normalization of Saudi-Israeli ties is 'off the table' until there is a resolution regarding Palestinian statehood. He further highlighted the broader implications, stating, 'The security of the region as a whole is at risk if we do not address the rights of the Palestinians.' Addressing the ongoing crisis in Gaza, he called for a cease-fire, emphasizing the dangers of an Israeli overreaction following the events of October 7th. 'We have seen the reality that Israel’s reaction and its continuing military assault have led to a humanitarian catastrophe,' he remarked. He described the situation in northern Gaza as dire, with blockades and no safe zones for civilians, stating, 'That can only be described as a form of genocide. It is certainly against humanitarian law, and that is feeding a continuing cycle of violence.' On the prospects of an immediate cease-fire, Prince Faisal expressed caution, saying, 'I hope it’s the case that we can see a cease-fire in the immediate hours, in the immediate short term. I’m not sure that that’s the case. I don’t have the details.' He acknowledged US efforts to facilitate negotiations, adding, 'We are not part of the direct negotiations, but we certainly support the efforts that the US has undertaken to find a pathway to a ceasefire. I hope it comes to fruition.' He noted that previous attempts at cease-fire negotiations had failed due to new demands from Israel. 'In most of those instances where the talks collapsed, it has been because new requirements or demands were added on the part of Israel,' he explained. Prince Faisal also addressed Saudi Arabia’s position on Lebanon, emphasizing a hands-off approach. 'We have never fully disengaged. But we believe it’s up to the Lebanese politicians to seek a direction that puts Lebanon on the right track,' he stated. He added: 'It’s not up to any outside influence, any outside countries, or any outside powers to tell the Lebanese what to do or to influence the political process in Lebanon. That is our opinion.' Regarding relations with Iran, Prince Faisal indicated that recent discussions focused on regional de-escalation. 'I hope that Iran, like us, is working toward regional de-escalation on all fronts, not just in Lebanon. That’s very much the focus of my conversations with my Iranian counterpart,' he said. While he could not be 'confident of anything that is in the control of other parties,' he emphasized the importance of avoiding further escalation. 'I have made it clear to our Iranian counterparts that it is important to avoid any further escalation. My sense is that they realize the risks of escalation and would prefer to avoid it. But, of course, they have their own strategic calculations.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOxnsMDxGLWvH	2024-10-31T16:47:58-07:00	
Daylight Saving Time Remains A Nightmare – OpEd	Daylight saving time this year ends at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 3, after being in effect for nearly eight months. Standard time will resume in most of the United States for the next four months, reverting again to daylight saving time, or DST, on March 10 next year. 'Springing forward' and 'falling back' every year is not just among the many irritations of modern life. Studies show that mandatory clock resetting also reduces workplace productivity, at least temporarily, and is harmful to your health, even deadly. The adverse effects appear to increase with age, a serious concern with our graying population. It has been said that Benjamin Franklin invented DST to save candlepower at the end of the working day. But he was joking. Burning fewer candles on a summer’s evening means burning more in the darker hours of an early summer’s morning. Similarly, any explanation for DST that claims support from farmers and ranchers (as if chickens, cows and other livestock wear watches) is historically inapt: Many opposed it because it disrupts farmworkers’ schedules. The most prominent explanations center on supposed summertime energy savings. If the sun is shining when most people return home from their day jobs, less interior lighting is needed and less electricity needs to be generated. That argument was prompted by the 'oil shocks' of the 1970s when global fuel prices spiked twice owing to embargoes of crude oil exports from the Middle East. DST may have made sense before the widespread adoption of air conditioning in the Sun Belt. Nowadays, however, DST’s energy savings are highly doubtful. The lengths of days year-round do not vary with changes in the times displayed on clocks and watches. The number of sunlight hours at any point on the globe depends mainly on latitude (arc distance from the equator, where days and nights are always 12 hours long) and season (the Earth’s poles tip away from and toward the sun as our planet follows its 365-day elliptical orbit around Old Sol). The Northern Hemisphere begins tipping away from the sun at the summer solstice (on or about June 21). The days shorten until winter begins on Dec. 21, when they start lengthening again. And so it goes. DST does not save anything. Its onset requires most Americans (except those living in Hawaii, the outlying U.S. territories and most of Arizona) to lose an hour of sleep in the spring, time that is retrieved only when standard time resumes in the fall. Depending on when you rise and head to work or school, it is dark in the morning in the Northern Hemisphere in late fall and early winter, no matter what time regime is in effect. The days are shorter then; clocks can do nothing to change the Earth’s seasonal polar tilt away from the sun. But because DST 'shifts' sunlight toward the day’s end, it would be even darker in the morning in the months surrounding the winter solstice if DST were made permanent (as some voters and their elected representatives seem to want). Permanent DST triggers objections from parents who resist sending their children to school on pitch-black early winter mornings. Such a policy change also runs afoul of the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which allows states to remain on—or revert to—standard time year-round, but prohibits the adoption of endless daylight saving time without congressional approval. Evidence of the adverse health consequences of DST has been mounting for decades; it may take up to one month for body clocks to 'reset' after a change in the prevailing time regime. Heart attacks, strokes, car crashes and emergency room visits rise significantly in the days following a one-hour time shift in either direction. Who benefits from DST? Retailers, perhaps. The owners of golf courses, the builders of swimming pools and the manufacturers of charcoal briquettes and gas grills, certainly. Those benefits come at considerable cost to everyone else. It’s time to end the madness of springing forward and falling back. Making standard time permanent is the solution.

Austin Says North Korean Soldiers Likely To Enter Russian War On ...	By Jim Garmone It appears that North Korean troops will enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said Thursday at the conclusion of 2+2 meetings with South Korean officials at the State Department. Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and National Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun also spoke of the ironclad alliance between the United States and South Korea and steps to strengthen that alliance. 'We now assess that North Korea has sent around 10,000 of its soldiers to train in eastern Russia,' Austin said. 'Our most recent information indicates that about 8,000 of those [North Korean] soldiers are now in the Kursk Oblast. Now, we've not yet seen these soldiers deploy into combat against Ukraine's forces, but we expect that these North Korean soldiers will join the fight against Ukraine in the coming days.' Austin said Russian forces have trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery operations, unmanned aerial vehicle operations and basic infantry tactics to include trench clearing. 'The Kremlin has also provided these [North Korean] troops with Russian uniforms and equipment, and all of that strongly indicates that Russia intends to use these foreign forces in frontline operations in its war of choice against Ukraine,' Austin said. 'Make no mistake, if these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would make themselves legitimate military targets,' the secretary said. The United States is consulting closely with allies and partners on these developments. 'As I discussed last week in Kyiv, Ukraine's military continues to perform admirably on the battlefield, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's forces have suffered serious losses in recent months,' Austin said. 'Ukrainian forces have caused more than 1,200 Russian casualties per day, more than at any other time during Putin's war. By 'tin-cupping' to North Korea for manpower, Putin is showing the world another clear sign of weakness. The Kremlin's North Korean gambit just underscores how badly Putin's war has gone and how much trouble he is in.' Austin and Blinken both noted it is the first time in more than a century that Russia has welcomed foreign troops on its soil. 'The United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine, and so will our allies and partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group,' the secretary said. This assistance includes artillery, anti-air defense, armored vehicles, munitions and other crucial capabilities. The secretary said the U.S. will announce additional security assistance for Ukraine in the coming days. The U.S.-South Korea alliance is evolving into a comprehensive global partnership. 'We agreed today to further enhance our interoperability and strengthen our extended deterrence,' Austin said. 'Our countries are deepening our nuclear and strategic planning efforts through the Nuclear Consultative Group, and we're increasing the regular deployments of U.S. strategic assets on the Korean Peninsula.' The two countries agreed that attacks in space or cyberspace 'that clearly challenge the security of the alliance could lead us to invoke Article III of the Mutual Defense Treaty,' the secretary said. 'So, to improve our awareness of threats in the space and cyber domains, we're enhancing our interoperability and information sharing.' The United States and South Korea will continue to advance defense ties with regional allies and partners, especially the historic growth of trilateral security cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the United States, Austin said. 'Our robust partnerships, especially with Japan and the ROK, let us share information, assess threats and craft thoughtful responses, just like last night when [North Korea] conducted its latest irresponsible missile test, and across the Indo-Pacific,' the secretary said. 'We're working to strengthen maritime security and to bolster interoperability through multilateral exercises.' The United States and South Korea are working with partner countries to tackle shared security challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpOx8w23QCkPP1	2024-10-31T16:44:02-07:00	
ABS Sees Potential For Nuclear-Powered LNG Carriers	The American Bureau of Shipping has released its latest report into the potential of advanced nuclear technology for maritime applications, with a study of a small modular reactor on a standard liquefied natural gas carrier. The report notes that large liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier vessels are increasing in demand as the international LNG trade remains important for global energy security. LNG is stored on board in large cryogenic tanks that maintain natural gas (primarily methane) in a liquid state around -165°C. The typical energy demand for LNG carriers is between 30 to 75 MW. The scope of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) study - titled Pathways to a low carbon future: LNG carrier nuclear ship concept design - was to consider and discuss a standard LNG carrier design using nuclear power for propulsion and other primary energy needs. A conceptual future zero-emissions LNG carrier is presented to illustrate how one type of advanced nuclear fission technology may be applied for shipboard power in the future, with an emphasis on what aspects of ship and reactor design may require further investigation to guide the development of the integrated technology and regulatory framework. The transformational impact of a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) on the design, operation and emissions of a 145,000-cubic-metre LNG carrier design was modeled by ABS and Herbert Engineering Corporation. ABS said the study was designed to help industry 'better understand the feasibility and safety implications of nuclear propulsion and to support future development projects'. The study shows a nuclear-propelled LNG carrier would have specific design features, with reactors placed at the rear of the vessel (to shield the cryogenic cargo from the thermal load of the reactor compartment) and batteries forward of the location occupied by fuel tanks on current vessels and a reinforced hull. Given design constraints, the HTGR technology would only be suitable for larger LNG carriers. ABS / Herbert Engineering) 'The study provides ABS and the industry important information on heat and energy management, shielding, weight distribution, and other design features for an LNG carrier with nuclear propulsion,' ABS said. 'This will assist the identification of design issues that will inform future Rules development. The study also found the HTGR technology allowed faster transit speeds and offers zero-emission operations. There would also be no requirement to refuel, although the HTGR technology would need replacing approximately every six years.' ABS said the benefits from nuclear propulsion include decarbonised high-power availability, reduced or eliminated bunker costs, and associated reduced bunker time in port. 'Nuclear power would be an ideal means of drastically abating shipping emissions, but significant hurdles remain inpublic perception and international regulations before this can be achieved,' it adds. 'While this technology is well understood on land, adapting it for marine application is in its infancy,' noted ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Patrick Ryan. 'However, this study and the other research we have carried out clearly highlight its significant potential to address not only shipping's emissions challenge but to deliver a range of other operational advantages to the industry. ABS is committed to helping the industry evaluate its suitability for use in a range of use cases and LNG carriers is just one of a range of potential applications we are exploring.' In August 2022, ABS announced it had been awarded a contract by the US Department of Energy (DOE) to research barriers to the adoption of advanced nuclear propulsion on commercial vessels. Working with support from DOE's National Reactor Innovation Center, based at Idaho National Laboratory, ABS is developing models of different advanced reactor technologies for maritime applications and developing an industry advisory on the commercial use of modern nuclear power. In July last year, a study commissioned by ABS explored the potential of advanced nuclear reactor technology for commercial marine propulsion. ABS commissioned Herbert Engineering Corporation to carry out a study designed to help the shipping industry better understand the feasibility and safety implications of nuclear propulsion and to support future development projects. The study modelled the impact of nuclear propulsion on the design, operation and emissions of a container vessel and a Suezmax tanker.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc43e5KehOpO-3Vkp6vYVr0	2024-10-31T16:40:38-07:00	
Japan Enters A New Phase Of Political Instability – Analysis	Japanese politics has entered into an uncertain terrain following the worst performance by the long-time ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner the Komeito, in 15 years in the snap polls on 27 October called by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba barely a month after coming to office. As it transpired, it was an ill-conceived move and showed that Ishiba failed to judge the public mood. Now Ishiba is under pressure to resign. The most worrying aspect is that Japan is feared to have entered into a phase of political instability. That shall have impact in both domestic and foreign policy of Japan, though sector wise, the impact shall is minimal. As no party has secured a majority, a lot of negotiations, bargaining and compromises are going to be seen in the next 30 days which is mandated by the rules to cobble up coalition partners to form a government. Ishiba who won the LDP presidential race on 27 September and thereby became the Prime Minister hoped to consolidate his position amid public outrage over a political funding scandal and rising living costs. As it transpired, his gamble backfired. The ruling coalition won just 215 seats, far short of the 233 needed for a majority. The LDP’s seats in the lower chamber plunged from 247 before the election to 191, a staggering loss of 56 seats. For the LDP, which has dominated Japan's post-war politics, it was the worst showing since 2009, when the party lost power for four years. Japanese political system is indeed entering a new and uncertain period. Its coalition partner Komeito did not fare better either. Komeito also incurred a significant loss of eight seats, down to 24, making the combined total for both parties 215, which are 18 seats short of the majority threshold of 233. This dramatic loss of majority in the lower house, first time in 15 years, did not deter Ishiba from declaring his intention to remain in office. While admitting the severe security and economic environment that the country faces, he was unprepared to accept 'any stagnation in national politics'. But continuing the administration without regaining the public’s trust would be a tall order. The political volatility and spectre of instability can be foreseen as the opposition despite making considerable inroads is too divided to form a government. Many opposition parties ranging from Communists to far-right groups have ruled out joining a coalition with the LDP and Komeito. This complicates the path forward. The LDP and Komeito may try to form a minority government, relying on smaller, center-right parties like the Democratic Party for the People and the Innovation Party, to pass legislation on a case-by-case basis. Such ad-hoc arrangement does not guarantee political stability and the government would always be vulnerable to collapse if it fails to meet opposition demands. Ishiba suddenly has become politically weak as many from the Ishiba and Abe allies lost their seats after being implicated in the slush fund scandal. Even if Ishiba becomes the Prime Minister, his stay at office could be short-lived. The elections to the Upper House is due in July 2025 and that would make Ishiba’s position more vulnerable as he may have to make many compromises to meet the demands of the Opposition, thereby raising the spectre of political instability. Then situation looks too messy. LDP’s coalition partner, the Komeito fared no better, with leader Keiichi Ishii, who replaced long-time party leader Natsuo Yamaguchi as party president on 28 September and deputy leader Shigeki Sato losing their elections. In the western Kansai region around Osaka, Komeito’s traditional stronghold, where the party had seldom lost elections due to its powerful organizational base, it faced challenges from candidates of Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party) in four Osaka districts and was defeated in all of them. The first political fallout of the electoral loss bearing responsibility was when Shinjiro Koizumi, chairman of the LDP’s Election Strategy Committee resigned to take responsibility for the electoral pasting, as a matter of principle. Out of 46 lawmakers who became mired in the scandal over political funds amassed and distributed by LDP factions, 28 failed to be re-elected, and only three of the candidates who were not endorsed by the party as punishment for their implications in the scandal managed to win. These outcomes point to the deep anger and malaise centring on distrust the scandal had generated among the voters. Ishiba remains undeterred. While committing himself to heartfelt soul-searching and be reborn, he promised to spearhead hard-hitting reforms in the party, eliminating everything that the public thought logic of party insiders. But the people remember that Ishiba has a history of contradicting his own previous vows and now see contradicting his own promise of political fund reforms after he won the LDP leadership race in September. The point of scrutiny by the people centres on the dark clouds of policy activity expenses, which the LDP currently distributes to individual party executives and the disclosure of how Diet members spend their fixed monthly allowances to cover research, travel and communications expenses, which were formerly known as 'buntsu-hi' for short. Ishiba was also found wanting on his promise of the early establishment of a third-party institution for monitoring political funds. The backlash against the LDP certainly influenced Komeito’s poor performance. Komeito’s poor show demonstrated that it failed to play an effective role in pushing the LDP toward political funding reforms as a ruling coalition partner. With the drubbing it received, the party will now find it difficult to recover its strength. It was not just the slush fund issue that damaged trust in politics. The LDP’s link with the former Unification Church, formally called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification that had consumed Abe’s life by an assassin who suspected Abe’s hand and which led to his family’s financial ruin also played its part in LDP’s poor show in the elections. For example, Justice Minister Hideki Makihara and former education minister Masahito Moriyama, two lawmakers whose relationships with the former Unification Church, were questioned, lost in a single-seat constituency. In addition, they also failed to gain seats in a proportional representation bloc under a system of double candidacy. This is a clear manifestation of deep-rooted distrust related to this issue. Having lost the majority in the Lower House, if Ishiba cobbles up a coalition government with smaller opposition parties, the LDP-Komeito coalition cannot pass the budgets or other bills without the cooperation of the opposition. This would mean concessions, compromises and ultimately policy paralysis. The government could then be seen as recuperating in the intensive-care-unit, counting days for its survival. The domestic political turbulence does not necessarily mean that Japan’s foreign policy shall be dramatically recast, though some priorities may shift. Ishiba, a former defense minister who became the prime minister, had embraced several controversial proposals, such as forming an Asian version of NATO and a nuclear-sharing arrangement with the US. His weakened position now would mean these plans are unlikely to gain traction. Instead, if he survives, Ishiba will likely focus on areas with broader political consensus on domestic issues rather than tinkering with foreign policy issues. It is to be seen how the Japanese leadership shall deal with growing threats from North Korea and pressure from China. It major treaty ally, the US, is bogged down on the presidential election and shall have little time to focus on foreign policy issues. This does not mean that Japan is going to undermine its alliance relationship with the US, its principal ally. Though a policy paralysis is not likely immediately, the opposition shall be emboldened to oppose if Ishiba can cobble up a majority to form a government and decide to boost Japan’s military capabilities. Any decision or move to raise tax revenue to help support the growing necessity for Japan to rearm itself more fundamentally is likely to be fiercely opposed. If Donald Trump wins the US Presidential election in November, it would be tough for Ishiba or whoever becomes the Prime Minister to negotiate with Trump on foreign policy and security issues. To deal successfully with Trump, Japan’s prime minister needs to be strong and for that he/she needs to be endowed with strong political capital. In the present scenario, no Japanese leader possesses that. Japan’s vulnerability shall remain for quite some time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9scw14dW4RKXCQ	2024-10-31T09:47:19-07:00	
America’s Containment Foreign Policy No Longer Works – OpEd	Forget the ‘Grand Schemes,’ he said, the world was now too complex. Try, instead, he suggested, 'for a thoughtful paragraph or two.' – George F. Kennan (1994) Why is it that American foreign policy experts continue to reiterate (perhaps regurgitate would be more apt) a seemingly inherited trait that has lost its relevance? Moreover, this trait perpetuates a widespread belief that protecting vital U.S. interests abroad depends on the perception that America is willing to intervene irrespective of the magnitude of the interests, the power of the perceived adversary, or on whose territory the engagement might occur. This mantra of the foreign policy elite sounds suspiciously like something George F. Kennan might have uttered back when I was old enough to fight in Vietnam – but too consumed with Cold War propaganda to know better (and this continues today with many young Americans). Ed Hermann and Noam Chomsky would later call this propaganda effect ‘manufactured consent’ in their 1988 seminal text, Manufacturing Consent. Containment The narrative and its attendant propaganda have their genesis in a Cold War era initiative called ‘Containment.’ The latter was a geopolitical strategic foreign policy pursued by the United States during the post-World War II era – ostensibly to prevent the spread of communism. The theory asserted that if any country in a region fell to communism, other and potentially more strategically significant states would soon follow. The experience of the Vietnam War and its aftermath should have dissuaded American policymakers today from accepting this principle. The latter, after years of ineffectiveness (and afraid politically to lose face by admitting victory was impossible) pointlessly wreaked destruction on Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Laos Vietnam ultimately fell to communist Hanoi in 1975 after a 10-year US military campaign fought mostly from the Pentagon with 50,000+ American soldiers dead and millions of Vietnamese. The overarching result was a somewhat humbled US and a foreign policy based on 'containment' that would eventually reveal its ‘non universal applicability.’ Unfortunately, this predisposition towards the 'containment theory' remains deeply entrenched amongst the 'deep state,' foreign policy elite and op-ed sections of conservative magazines and newspapers that (by now) should know better. No real effort is needed to illustrate its persistence. Take for instance the Afghanistan war and its withdrawal debacle. Many, including former president Trump, have called it 'the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country,' and claimed the withdrawal was 'why Russia attacked Ukraine.' A further example comes from another 'authority,' Vice President Harris. She recently claimed that 'Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine,' and that if it had not been for the Biden administration, 'Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe…starting with Poland.' Today, there is little appreciation for foreign policy more sophisticated than aphorisms scribbled on a 'sticky note,' like 'peace through strength.' Yet, these often get more of a hearing than merits the energy to utter them. The other half of the story is that media personalities and those that grace op-ed pages take literary license with these 'sticky-note aphorisms' repeating them incessantly until they become accepted as 'conventional wisdom.' The effect is to promote American foreign policy based solely on economic, political and military hegemony (sanctions, etc.) – not strategic leadership. Dissenting views are increasingly either crowded out, ridiculed as uninformed or simply canceled by providing no avenue for their public dissemination. The most developed post-Cold War strategy for continuing the idea of containment was articulated by Dick Cheney’s Pentagon in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, which was leaked to the New York Times. 'Our first objective,' an early draft read, 'is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union.' The White House disavowed the Cheney document, and George H.W. Bush’s national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, later described the Pentagon’s approach at the time as just plain 'nutty.' What continues to get the US into geopolitical difficulty is that flawed assumptions (for various reasons) about three countries in particular (China, Russia and India) are taken for granted, and foreign policy initiatives are pursued simultaneously with often shortsighted partisan political agendas without placing limits on what constitutes too high a price if failure occurs. And since Vietnam, the latter has occurred all too frequently. In short, US foreign policy is in need of greater correlation between level headed ambition (what we want or should want) and ability (what we actually can do without overreaching and overstaying our 'welcome'). US Foreign Policy Today US foreign policy today – briefly stated – is focused on three countries: China and Russia as adversaries and India as a 'potential partner.' This foreign policy remains essentially an extension of the Cold War 'containment' mentality. The three countries at the summit of America’s foreign policy agenda have several things in common which the US must understand and consider in developing its geopolitical response to them: history, trust and coercion Each country has an unfavorable history with the West. China experienced its 'century of humiliation' for over a hundred years at the hands of the West. Russia was lied to about any further encroachment by NATO at its most vulnerable time after the fall of the wall in ‘89. India was colonized and, therefore, coerced into political and economic acquiescence dating back over 100 years to the era of the British East India Company. China. Today, US foreign policy designed to contain China is implemented economically via sanctions, restricting access to critical resources to prevent technological innovation and aligning with Southeast Asian countries (in South China Sea disputes) to impede China's open seas access. The US assumptions taken for granted about China are flawed. It does not seem to understand China from a historical perspective -- which is imperative to understanding it at all. Beijing operates from a historical mindset such that actions by the West are perceived to be designed to take away more of China’s sovereign territory (e.g. Taiwan, South China Sea etc.). The US needs to learn China does not want war; rather, it wants and needs prosperity to build an economy to foster a military to protect its sovereignty – just like the US. China wants and needs the existing Western institutional infrastructure to remain intact to profit from it. Russia. US foreign policy of containment directed against Russia recently took on the characteristics of a US-led proxy war with Ukraine as the vehicle to achieve its aim of destroying the Russian economy and preventing the rise of the BRICS+ as a potential threat and competitor to Western economic and political hegemony. Massive deaths from substantial military aid and sanctions by the US and its allies for over two years have failed to produce the desired results. The BBC reported in April of this year, 'Russia to grow faster than all advanced economies, says IMF.' The Ukraine conversely is already economically and militarily totally dependent on its Western backers to sustain itself as a nation-state. The US operates from outdated Cold War logic about Moscow. Russia is on record via Vladimir Putin that the Russian military is no match for NATO. That is why one hears so much saber-rattling about the 'nuclear card,' which Putin has also said is an insane idea and would only be employed against an existential threat to Russia. India. The US has failed in its attempts to draw New Delhi away from Moscow. India refuses to yield to US pressure regarding Western sanctions against Russia. Moreover, a recent Modi-Putin Summit clearly reiterated the strong seemingly unbreakable trust between these two leaders and their countries. The US recently threatened India with sanctions for the Chabahar port deal with Iran. US assumptions about New Delhi are questionable at best. It still does not seem to understand or believe India’s position relative to the West: India is non-Western but not anti-Western – she is non-aligned. And although New Delhi may be a potential partner with the US – to be a countervailing influence to help 'contain' China -- it is unlikely to be that vis-a-vis Russia. Given the extent of America's present foreign military engagements, it appears that containment remains the foreign policy of choice. Any issues the ‘war hawks’ may have about an ‘America First’ foreign policy or the fear of 'isolationism' – apparently such concerns are patently unwarranted. The US and its NATO allies continue their attempt to contain Russia by isolating it and encroaching upon its borders. Since such behavior risks a potential direct conflict with Moscow over Ukraine, isn't it time to jettison our 60-year national preoccupation with 'containment' of our perceived adversaries. US foreign policy must cohere with what is in America's best interest rather than partisan political agendas so characteristic of each new administration inside the Beltway – adventures that put us all in jeopardy – but so far, looks like it's still…just plain 'nutty.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc-unRMKy5lIt	2024-10-31T09:46:05-07:00	
One Year On Operation 1027: Its Impact On Myanmar And Beyond – Op...	As we marked the first anniversary of Operation 1027, initiated by the Three Brotherhood Alliance (3BHA) on October 27, 2023, it is essential to evaluate its successes and implications for Myanmar's political landscape and regional stability, particularly concerning Bangladesh. This operation, involving the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and Arakan Army (AA), has transformed the conflict dynamics in Myanmar. A Year of Strategic Gains Operation 1027 has been characterized by remarkable military successes that have reshaped the balance of power in Myanmar. Within weeks, the 3BA captured over 130 military outposts and strategic bases in northern Shan State, including Laukkai, a key border town. The junta suffered significant losses, with reports indicating the deaths of hundreds of soldiers and the surrender of over 4,000 troops, including high-ranking officers. The capture of advanced military equipment further underscored the effectiveness of this coordinated offensive. A pivotal moment was the fall of Ann Township in Rakhine State to the AA in early 2024. This victory not only solidified the AA's influence but also demonstrated increased coordination among various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs). The capture of Ann Township marked a critical victory for the AA, allowing it to establish greater control over Rakhine State and disrupt junta operations significantly. Such developments have galvanized resistance factions across Myanmar, leading to a resurgence of anti-junta activities. The operational successes achieved by the 3BA have also led to a notable shift in public sentiment within Myanmar. Many citizens, disillusioned by the junta's inability to provide security or basic services, have begun to view EAOs as viable alternatives. This change in perception is crucial for the long-term sustainability of resistance movements as they seek to establish governance structures in areas under their control. Implications for Myanmar’s Future The operational achievements of Operation 1027 have exposed severe vulnerabilities within the Myanmar military regime. The State Administration Council (SAC) is grappling with declining troop morale and public support, leading to recruitment challenges. Many battalions are now severely understaffed as soldiers face burnout from prolonged deployments amidst escalating violence. As resistance groups gain ground, there is a growing likelihood that internal dissent within the junta could lead to its eventual collapse. Observers note that if this trend continues, we may witness a domino effect similar to historical regime collapses seen in Saigon or Kabul. The junta's inability to effectively counter these insurgent movements has led to a crisis of legitimacy, raising questions about its future viability. However, while Operation 1027 has yielded significant territorial gains for resistance forces, it also raises concerns about potential escalation. The junta's response has included intensified airstrikes and artillery bombardments targeting civilian areas in an attempt to regain control. This escalation poses serious humanitarian risks for civilians caught in conflict zones. What does it mean for Bangladesh? The ongoing conflict in Myanmar has profound implications for Bangladesh, which has been directly affected by the instability. As violence escalates in Rakhine State, Bangladesh faces several challenges. First, the conflict has stalled the repatriation process for over 1.3 million Rohingya refugees already residing in Bangladesh. The renewed fighting has created uncertainty about their future and prolonged their stay in refugee camps under increasingly dire conditions. Reports indicate that food allocations for these refugees have been cut significantly due to diminishing international aid. Added to that a surge of around 40,000 Rohingyas crossed the border and took shelter in Bangladesh in the last couple of months. For Bangladesh, the number is becoming a headache day by day. Second, the escalation of violence has led to direct security threats along Bangladesh's border. Incidents of cross-border gunfire and mortar attacks from Myanmar forces have already resulted in casualties among Bangladeshi citizens and damaged infrastructure. Such incursions threaten national sovereignty and create instability in southeastern Bangladesh. Several Bangladeshi fishermen were also been kidnapped from Bangladesh's water territory of the Bay of Bengal and even at least two of them have been killed recently. Besides, the chaos resulting from Operation 1027 may also exacerbate issues related to drug trafficking and organized crime. Increased instability could lead to a surge in smuggling operations across porous borders, further complicating law enforcement efforts in Bangladesh. All these issues are questioning the security and stability at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Finally, If the AA succeeds in establishing control over Rakhine State, Bangladesh could share a border with an unrecognized statelet, raising concerns about regional security dynamics and potential support for insurgent activities within its territory. The situation poses diplomatic challenges for Bangladesh as it navigates relations with both Myanmar and international stakeholders concerned about human rights violations and regional stability. Balancing humanitarian assistance with political pressures will require careful diplomacy. Looking Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty As we reflect on one year since Operation 1027 commenced, it is clear that this initiative has significantly altered Myanmar's conflict landscape. Resistance groups must navigate complex strategic landscapes; while initial successes have emboldened them, they must also consider how to maintain momentum without overextending their capabilities. External influences will play a crucial role in shaping outcomes. China’s response is particularly noteworthy; while it initially appeared supportive of Operation 1027 due to concerns over border security and criminal activities linked to junta-controlled areas, Beijing has since expressed apprehensions about escalating violence along its border. China’s strategic interests may lead it to recalibrate its support based on how events unfold. As Myanmar navigates this turbulent period in its history, supporting democratic movements while ensuring regional stability will be essential for international observers and stakeholders alike. The coming months will be critical as both resistance forces and the junta reassess their strategies amidst evolving dynamics on the ground. For Bangladesh, proactive measures will be necessary to mitigate humanitarian crises and security threats arising from its neighbor’s instability. As we move forward into another year marked by uncertainty and potential upheaval, it is imperative that both local actors and international stakeholders work collaboratively towards sustainable solutions that prioritize human rights and regional stability while addressing the complex realities on the ground in Myanmar and its impact on neighboring countries like Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sczgprljQ2JmD	2024-10-31T09:44:07-07:00	
Global Security At Risk: North Korea’s Involvement In The Ukraine...	North Korea’s decision to dispatch troops to support Russia in its conflict against Ukraine signifies a profound and concerning shift in global security dynamics. The involvement of approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers indicates an intensifying military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow, thus reinforcing Russia’s reliance on foreign allies amidst considerable troop losses. This development complicates the Ukraine conflict and raises serious concerns for the international community, particularly regarding relations among Russia, the United States, South Korea, and the European Union. The central thesis of this analysis posits that North Korea's military involvement in Ukraine serves as a destabilising factor in global geopolitics, exacerbating existing tensions and threatening both regional and global security. It underscores the burgeoning partnership between Russia and North Korea, challenges the prevailing global order, and necessitates a coordinated response from the West to mitigate the dangers posed by this alliance. North Korea’s participation in the Ukraine conflict represents a pivotal moment for its military and diplomatic relations with Russia. Historically, the ties between the two nations have fluctuated; however, the recent summit between Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin, during which they signed a partnership treaty, signifies a new level of cooperation. This includes military support, with North Korea’s elite troops now being directly integrated with Russian forces. The National Intelligence Service of South Korea confirmed the initial deployment of approximately 1,500 soldiers who were transported from North Korea to the Far East of Russia via naval vessels. These soldiers, disguised in Russian military uniforms and equipped with false identifications, are anticipated to be deployed to the front lines in Ukraine following the completion of adaptation training. These developments not only underscore the strategic significance of North Korean military assistance to Russia but also raise broader questions regarding global security implications. The strengthening of military ties between Russia and North Korea raises considerable concerns for the United States, South Korea, and the European Union. For Russia, North Korean troops provide essential manpower as it grapples with battlefield losses and escalating domestic challenges in maintaining troop levels. This reliance on Pyongyang’s forces illustrates Moscow’s desperation in light of the war’s human and material costs. North Korea’s direct involvement with Russia establishes a new front in the broader geopolitical competition involving the United States, Russia, and North Korea. In response, Washington is expected to increase military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, intensify sanctions on both North Korea and Russia, and enhance diplomatic initiatives aimed at isolating the two nations on the international stage. South Korea faces a pronounced security dilemma in light of these developments. The deepening military alignment between North Korea and Russia amplifies the security threat to South Korea and exacerbates tensions throughout the Asia-Pacific region. President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration has reacted by convening emergency security meetings and closely coordinating with allies, including the United States and NATO, to monitor and mitigate the risks posed by Pyongyang’s engagement in Ukraine. The potential for North Korean troops to acquire battlefield experience and augment their military capabilities through this conflict presents a long-term strategic challenge for Seoul. Similarly, the European Union has articulated substantial concerns regarding North Korea’s military support for Russia. EU leaders have cautioned that any verified North Korean involvement in the Ukraine war would lead to additional sanctions directed at both Russia and Pyongyang. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has underscored that the alliance is vigilantly monitoring the situation and maintaining communication with partners, particularly South Korea. There is also a broader apprehension that North Korea’s participation in the conflict might establish a precedent for other rogue states to engage in future international conflicts, further undermining the global order. The primary challenge posed by North Korea’s involvement in the Ukraine war lies in the potential for escalation. By contributing to Russia’s military efforts, Pyongyang risks provoking a broader conflict that could entangle additional global powers. The deployment of North Korean troops introduces a new and perilous dimension to the conflict, complicating efforts aimed at de-escalation and prolonging violence. Furthermore, North Korea’s engagement raises significant ethical and humanitarian concerns. North Korean soldiers are likely to confront severe conditions, exacerbating the already devastating humanitarian toll of the war, while their government benefits from enhanced ties with Moscow in contravention of international law. The resolution to this escalating crisis necessitates a coordinated response from the global community. It is imperative to intensify diplomatic pressure on North Korea and Russia, leveraging multilateral institutions such as the United Nations to ensure accountability for both nations. Furthermore, economic sanctions should be broadened to focus on critical sectors of North Korea’s economy, particularly its military industries, to diminish Pyongyang’s capacity to provide support to Russia in the ongoing conflict. Additionally, military support for Ukraine must be augmented, with NATO and its allies supplying increased financial assistance and training to empower Kyiv in defending against the influx of foreign mercenaries. Concurrently, it is essential to maintain open diplomatic channels to avert further escalation, prioritising negotiations for a ceasefire and a future peace settlement. In conclusion, North Korea's deployment of troops to assist Russia in Ukraine signifies a troubling realignment in global geopolitics. This expanding military alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang threatens the international order and exacerbates tensions among major global powers. The international community, particularly the United States, South Korea, and the European Union, must adopt a decisive response that integrates diplomatic, economic, and military strategies to mitigate the risks associated with this emergent cooperation. Without a robust and coordinated response, the conflict in Ukraine risks escalating further, potentially leading to a more protracted and devastating situation with significant long-term implications for global security.

US Army Advances Human-Machine Integration Tests To Enhance, Figh...	By Joe Lacdan, Army News Service Robots integrated into Army formations can help protect Soldiers and revolutionize warfare in multiple domains. Human-machine integration forces can take on dangerous battlefield operations, including overwatch, or movement of troops to a point of tactical advantage, and the suppression of the enemy, said Brig. Gen. Chad Chalfont, commandant of the Army Armor School at Fort Moore, Georgia. Those capabilities could help achieve the Secretary of the Army’s goal of 'no blood for first contact,' where human machine integrated formations make platoons and companies better at maneuvering, communicating and surviving on a transparent battlefield. HMIF could shoulder risk normally assumed by Soldiers. Army Futures Command, headquartered in Austin, Texas, is scheduled to host the Human-Machine Integration Summit IV at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, on Nov. 6-7, 2024, to inform academic, industry and government partners on HMI development and explore cost-cutting solutions. The Army has been working with prototypes and performing exercises with the new technology including robotic combat vehicles, or RCVs. On July 24, the Comanche Troop of 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Division, completed training exercises with the RCVs as part of Army Futures Command’s RCV Pilot-24 exercise. During the July exercises, Soldiers performed reconnaissance and security missions with the platoon using two control vehicles to navigate four robots, Chalfont said. Chalfont said they learned they needed a third control vehicle for that platoon to operate effectively and to operate across different nets. They also learned techniques to better communicate within their platoon while also reporting up and out to their company commander. The 1-7 Cavalry Troop, based out of Fort Cavazos, Texas, performed the exercise during a National Training Center rotation in September, but restructured the unit to use three control vehicles to control four RCVs. The robotic combat vehicles were designed to act as scouts and combat escorts with a Soldier controlling the vehicle remotely. Those vehicles can also serve as decoys to protect Soldiers from enemy fire and assist the execution of multi-domain strikes. The Army originally had three RCV models in development but has since decided to focus on a single, lightweight variant. Brig. Gen. Phillip Kiniery, Infantry School commandant at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Moore, said he wants to be able to take that infantry squad and maximize the cognitive and physical capabilities of that squad by putting the burden on the robot. He wants to increase the depth and duration by which an infantry squad can maintain contact with the enemy so that infantry squad leader can bring everything they have to bear as a system and overwhelm the enemy. Col. Kevin Bradley, director of the Next Generation Vehicle Cross Functional Team at Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, said the Army has reached a pivotal time in its history where robotic technology could give U.S. forces a competitive advantage in maneuverability, like the period between World War I and World War II. Bradley said just as the airplane, radio and tank were critical to unlocking maneuver in World War II, human-machine integration forces — the combination of robots, autonomy and their ability to reduce or offset risk — is the key to unlocking expanded maneuver in a transparent battlefield. Chalfont cited the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as an example of the evolution of warfare, where Ukrainian forces have developed capabilities to fight against the Russian army. He said a cycle of adaptation is occurring in that conflict. The next question is what will forces do with that information and where does the adaptation occur? Bradley said the Army will need to test to see if RCVs and other robotics platforms can keep pace or fight with a brigade combat team or an infantry brigade combat team. Col. Scott Shaw, director of Maneuver Capabilities Development Directorate at Fort Moore, said the service absolutely wants Soldiers controlling multiple robots in the air and on the ground using the same device. Shaw said the Army in some cases has a 'two Soldiers to one robot' ratio and is very much working toward one Soldier controlling many robotic platforms. He said that robots used in combat must have true maneuverability, be able to traverse different environments and be able to withstand some damage from enemy fires. Col. Ken Bernier, project manager for future battle platforms at Detroit Arsenal said the Army will continue experiments integrating HMIF into its formations, eventually conducting a full operational test. Bradley said that after building the base platforms of the RCVs, the focus will shift toward technology and common control, including a focus on software.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc49NN1UtASiM	2024-10-31T09:39:08-07:00	
Russia Revisits Business Opportunities With Tanzania – OpEd	With geopolitical changes at its height, Russia now considers Africa as its indispensable partner, reviewing and revisiting unfulfilled pledges made decades ago. Even as its interest is seemingly rising, Russia is not practically investing as expected across Africa. Anti-western criticisms dominate its rhetoric at business meetings, summits and conferences. Official travels have become frequent between the first and second Russia-Africa summits held respectively in late October 2019 (Sochi) and in July 2023 (St.Petersburg). Several agreements were signed at both summits with African countries. In late October, the Russian-Tanzanian intergovernmental commission, headed by Russian Economic Development Minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, was in Dar es Salaam, aiming at opening new business horizons for cooperation in Tanzania and throughout East African region. The objectives of achieving genuine economic growth and development for the majority of East Africa's impoverished population. As always, Russia looks forward to strengthen economic cooperation with Tanzania, specific spheres include broadening trade, raising tourism and reviewing the possibility of engaging in energy and exports. 'We stand ready to increase exports of agricultural machinery, construction materials, pharmaceutical products, natural gas, LNG. We view interaction in the energy field as promising. We know about Tanzania's interest in exports of gas, LNG. Apart from that, our companies are willing to work on extracting fossil fuels and implementing major pipeline projects. One of oil and gas institutes that specializes in standardizing and assessing compliance of oil and gas equipment is interested in cooperation with the Tanzanian state oil and gas company,' Reshetnikov said after an exclusive meeting with the Prime Minister of Tanzania Kassim Majaliwa, according local media reports. 'Considering the pace at which electricity consumption is growing in Tanzania and the necessity of commissioning new power generating facilities, we're prepared to build wind and solar power plants of any capacity and complexity,' he said. The advantageous geographic position of Tanzania on the coast of the Indian Ocean and connection to other African countries unlocks great opportunities for Russia. 'Bearing in mind that Tanzania is located on the Indian Ocean's coast and is a member of regional integration associations, therefore country can serve as the sole window through which Russian products could enter the Eastern African market. Russia could play an analogous role for exporters on the Eurasian Economic Union's markets,' Reshetnikov said. The agricultural sector is yet another priority. 'To maintain the agricultural sector's brisk development, Tanzania needs new technology, fertilizers, and the production of animal feedstuffs. Our companies are willing to supply them, cooperate in organizing the efficient use of fertilizers for plants, and share best agronomic practices. And also invest in joint projects to grow produce to be supplied to Russia and third countries,' Reshetnikov said. 'We expect to be able to intensify cooperation between veterinary and phytosanitary oversight agencies. Russian businesses are willing to supply animal products. We've offered a list of such companies to the Tanzanian side and asked them to issue permits for such supplies as soon as possible,' he said. Some of the other highlights embodied FESCO Transportation Group, the flagship of which is the Far Eastern Shipping Company (FESCO), planning to launch shipping services between Russian ports and Tanzania. According to the Group's vice president Dmitry Pankov, Tanzania could serve as a major transport and logistics hub for shipping goods to other countries in the East African Community (EAC) and Central African region. On tourism at the Russia-Tanzania business forum, Tanzania offered to organize a familiarization tour for Russian tourism industry representatives in order to build business relations in tourism and to eventually begin direct flights. In turn, Russia offered to promote Tanzanian tourism products on its market, to organize business meetings with Russian tour operators, and to present the tourism potential at Russia's tourism forums. Russia is also interested in joint social projects, including those in education, science and healthcare. Political and diplomatic mutual understanding between Russia and Tanzania creates good conditions for increasing trade and economic cooperation. 'Tanzanian business shows great interest in Russia. Russian business, in turn, is ready to enter new markets, invest in joint projects and share technologies. We are ready to help the Tanzanian economy maintain the high growth rates in energy, agriculture, infrastructure development and tourism,' the minister finally added. The parties discussed the nature of current interaction and promising areas of future cooperation. Reshetnikov highlighted the reliable and historically established relations between the governments, business, and people of Russia and Tanzania. After Soviet's collapse, Russia maintain an excellent diplomatic relations over these three decades with Republic of Tanzania in East Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sczlM4tpF5u0R	2024-10-31T09:37:01-07:00	
‘The Fall Of Israel: The Degradation Of Israel’s Politics, Econom...	I am always leery of hubris. It may be true that all people of good now want 'the fall' of Israel, after a century of lies, deceit, killing and more killing, first by the British and European Jews, then by the US and European Jews, now by Britain-US-EU-Israel and European and Arab Jews. But compassion does not pay the bills. The stakes keep mounting, along with high tech death toys, and it's very hard to image Israel on the verge of collapse. It, and world Jewry, have never been so rich, so powerful in all history. The major world powers – the 'collective West', China, India, Russia – provide it with most of the death toys and the fuel to run them. None of these hard-nosed political schemers want to see Israel collapse, nor do any of them lose much sleep over the plight of the Palestinians. I, like many others today, am devoting my life to help free Palestine and really, really don't want to be disappointed, so I'll temper my enthusiasm, hold off on celebrating the end of the monstrosity. I am not counting any chickens yet. It's a long way till the final act when the fat lady belts out her last hava nagila. Steinbock is a leading international economic expert who has put his chips on the side of BRICS and multipolarism. That's where the future is and the 'collective West' better wake up soon as it is being left behind. And that includes Israel, as the West's swan song to 19th c imperial glory. He is CEO and founder of Difference Group (Paul Krugman is a member of the board), its purpose: In the past, the West drove the global economic prospects. Today, that role belongs to the Global South. We help governments, institutions, businesses, and NGOs navigate in the new and complex, multipolar environment. The thesis of The Fall is simple: Aiming to turn a secular democracy into a Jewish autocracy/ theocracy, the most far-right government in the history of Israel has continued to push this judicial coup amid the fog of war. These cleavages in the Israeli society figure large in its political disintegration. Most analysis of the dilemmas Israel faces looks to the occupation of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 War and the subsequent expansion of Jewish settlements as the chief problem. They are its proximate effect; following directly on the ethnic expulsions of the Palestinian Arabs in 1948. Steinbock makes it clear the Israelis never had any interest in anything but one Jews-only state, which was sort of achieved in the 1950s. Everything thereafter is footnotes.i A pro-forma future two-state solution with present de facto one-state realities.ii The US is both the problem, having encouraged Israel in its expansion from 1948 on, feeding it with lethal weapons, financing settlements condoning ethnic cleansing and murder on a daily basis, and the solution, as the current genocidal monster Israel would indeed 'fall' at the 'twinkling of an eye' if the US closed the spigot. The last US president to try that was Bush I, whose feeble attempt to stop the settlement expansion led to his humiliating defeat from a vengeful Israel lobby a few months later in 1992. The penultimate protest, JFK's stand against Israel acquiring nukes, led to his assassination and replacement by Israel sycophant LBJ. With both Republican and Democratic parties in lockstep today, supporting Israel's textbook genocide, the only hope is public opinion, anti-apartheid activism, which is increasingly criminalized in the 'collective West'. Steinbock points to the mid-50s as the moment of truth, though we can go back to Jabotinsky in the 1920s, or Ben Gurion in the fateful 1948, when the slaughter began in earnest and was clear, certainly to the Palestinians, if not to a still naive collective West. The 'bilateral' ties with Washington and massive US military aid kicked in then and have reached staggering proportions now, a virtual blank cheque to reak havoc, no end in sight. These ties led to such new-old doctrines as the Dahiya (suburb) doctrine of carpet bombing civilians, the Hannibal directive to murder Israelis stupid enough to be taken hostage, and mass assassination factories, backed by pioneering artificial intelligence. The socialism of labor Zionism was replaced by the hard-right coalitions driven by revisionist Zionism, thanks to US neoliberal economic policies, assertive neoconservatism and Jewish-American donors. It also explains the rise of the Messianic far-right, centrist parties, and the failure of the Left. The Fall of Israel covers the country’s political and ethnic divides, economic polarization, social and military changes, the shifts in the Palestinian struggle for sovereignty, the apartheid regime in the occupied territories, the genocidal atrocities, the regional and global reverberations, and the ensuing human and economic costs, both prior and subsequent to Israel’s fatal war on Gaza. Not to mention the domestic hell – the economic polarization, the collapse of innovative, high tech start-ups, the talent brain drain, the undermined welfare state, rising poverty and the subsidized religious sector. Steinbock documents the three waves of settlers from 1948, the last following the 1993 Oslo Accords, which should have ended the settlements, but was so flawed that it allowed their acceleration, now under policing by the Palestinian Authority, even as Hamas was elected in Gaza, and the PA totally discredited, but still the de facto 'authority', now just a fig leaf for creeping genocide. Israeli attacks on Palestinians increased, killing Palestinians on a daily basis, with occasional massive bombings of Gaza (2008, 2009, 2014, 2023) killing thousands each time. Steinbock documents the atrocities, the complicity of the US. His many charts show the massive increase in West Bank land seizures in 2023, clearly part of a push to fully steal all the West Bank, even as there is no 'exit strategy' for the millions of Palestinians still alive. We know what Netanyahu would like to do to each and every one of those vermin, and at this point US politicians are more or less united on letting him 'finish the job'. Steinbock (and all of us) pin our hopes on world mass opinion. None of the world leaders apart from the Axis of Resistance can be counted on. Arab leaders loathe the pesky Palestinians almost as much as US-Israel does. It is only the revolting masses that stand between them and the Palestinians. Tactics? Strategy? Duh ... Their only strategy to achieve Apartheid 2.0 is denial of the facts on the ground, starting from 1948, denying the ethnic 'cleansing', the mass slaughter, the erasure of hundreds of Palestinian villages. Israelis pay no attention to the current slaughter, most hoping that the IDF and settlers kill all Palestinians still breathing. Israelis tactics are violence, murder, theft. In short, terrorism. But this is also its strategy since 1948, along with 'divide and conquer' of its Arab neighbors. Steinbock doesn't take seriously the option of total erasure of the Palestinians, though that is the stated goal of Israeli leaders. The victory of the dead. But even if they could dump the Palestinians in Sinai, that is not a strategy which can bring peace, which would require negotiating with your own dispossessed citizens, and neighbors. In good faith. Which is impossible for Israel, as it is terrorizing its own Arab and its neighbors. In short, Israel can only survive through 24/7 terror, which is very expensive and means 24/7 US military aid. This can continue only as long as the US can keep printing dollars to cover its own massive debt. 18% of government spending is just to pay interest on this debt. As this continues to increase, eventually the US will be bankrupt, unable to function under the mountain of debt. This inevitable bankruptcy of the US will finally hit Israel, bringing to an end the blank cheque on its daily horrors, but I keep reminding myself, it took Rome four centuries to finally collapse collapse. What is particularly creepy is how Israel has used Palestinians as guinea pigs for testing its weapons of crowd control, now touting itself as the leader in the technology of totalitarian mind-body control. The only growth industry now for Israel is producing weapons, spyware, i.e., anything disgusting and lethal. This also began in the 1950s as Israel settled in to its schizoid de facto one-state- Jews-only state. The Israel Military Industry (IMI) began collaboration with the IDF, aiming to develop the most technologically advanced small arms systems for troops fighting in urban areas and harsh environments. The state-owned IMI (i.e., socialized death toys) was privatized in 2018, when it was taken over by Elbit Systems. (Poor Elbit is now the victim of western activists, who forced it to close up shop in Britain. Elbit has become our calling card for smashing windows and splashing red paint.) Israel has had to work very hard to overcome its notoriety as terrorist and mass killer. And it worked! By the early 1980s, more than 50 countries on five continents had become customers for Israeli killing technology. Israel added some sugar to its military toys, famously bragging about its agricultural successes in 'making the desert bloom,' and uses that as PR abroad about how nice Israel really is. That and weapons, 'butter and guns', though its 'butter' is all milked from stolen land, and its guns are used not to defend, but to suppress popular uprisings in oppressive Israel-like regimes around the world. Yes, Dahiya and Hannibal, but these 'doctrines' are merely (disgusting, inhuman) tactics rather than winning long run strategies. Israel's tactics/ strategy have been violence, denial, theft with the goal of a Jews-only state, ignoring the natives who lived there, and then more violence. Which apparently works for world elites, including not just the US, but Chinese, Indian and Russian. No one besides plucky South Africa, Colombia and Bolivia have broken relations with the monster, despite rivers of crocodile tears. The Palestinian strategy is primarily nonviolent resistance with a militant wing occasionally fighting back, which is fully legal for a nation under occupation but condemned as terrorism. Funny how the real terrorists call the shots. The militants address the egregious crimes of the occupiers; they do not target civilians, even medevac helicopters.iii This strategy of compassion for the wounded is based on Islam, where rules of engagement with the enemy are nonnegotiable. Another religious principle rejects assassination of enemy leaders. Such ethical behavior is alien to Israel, which has assassinated hundreds of Palestinian, Lebanese, etc leaders, 'rationally' reasoning that the enemy will collapse without them. When Israel assassinates Palestinian leaders, they are mourned, they become martyrs, inspiring the next generation. Whatever personal flaws Nasrallah may have had, he is now a saint, an inspiration to all freedom-loving people. His body parts were gathered and temporarily hidden to prevent Israel from bombing them, and eventually will be buried probably in Karbala. Sinwar's body was captured by Israel and most likely will not be returned (maybe dumped from a plane over the ocean like Bin Laden) as it will be a potent sword hanging over Israel's head. Israel's mass murderers, such as Meir Kahane are gruesomely worshipped, but only by nutcase settlers. Israel has few such martyr-heroes, but then neither the Palestinians nor their Muslim allies target Israelis for assassination, not believing that it is a useful tactic or strategy, rather giving a romantic aura of martyrdom to any victim as indeed is the case when Israelis target Palestinians. The Palestinians' goal is jannah, the path/ strategy is moral and ethical living, prayer, jihad, martyrdom. Tactics are waging war to the death against the enemy, picking up unexploded Israeli bombs and reusing them. All the time, appealing to humanity, to the basic decency of the outside world, calling on world opinion, boycotting, bringing criminal charges to bring peace. Steinbock introduces necrotization, which seeks to transform a world of life into a world of death, because that is what displacement, dispossession and devastation ultimately require. It is the collective psychological obliteration of those who have nothing to lose, and therefore fight for their homes, refuse to move away, risk nothingness for being.iv Is this a strategy, or again just a tactic meant to kill or so disillusion Palestinians, so that whoever remains alive will be glad to leave. Whatever. It ignores the 'last stand' psychology of the dispossessed, who prefer to die fighting for their homes than to flee to a desolate refugee camp, so it really just amounts to genocide. It just occurred to me that a crude policy of terror, dispossession and genocide doesn't need any subtleties like tactics vs strategy. The victory of the dead. Jew vs Jew, Arab turmoil The real showdown should be between the more universalist Jewish diaspora and the nationalist, racist Israeli Jews. Even as Trump is showered with Adelson's millions to complete the Israeli dream of total control of the Middle East, some Jews are protesting, but have made zero difference politicly as the Democrats and Republicans are still in lockstep. So much for that strategy. What's left? The brain drain and increased emigration of Jews from Israel as the crisis deepens. But that leaves the Kahane-ites in control. So much for that strategy. He considers the rise of Islamic movements in particular the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under al-Banna, which spread to all the Arab world, rivaled by Arab nationalism under Nasser and Hafez Assad. In all cases, the MBs were crushed by neocolonial regimes, and then attempts to promote Arab nationalism failed, descending into personal dictatorships. Muslims make poor nationalists. Islam rejects ideologies that interfere with being good Muslims. In Iraq the Baath party reformers finally ending in the humiliating defeat of atheistic Saddam Hussein (who called on Allah in a panic at the end). Though battered, the MBs remain the only survivors of a century of anti-imperialist struggle, still determined to face off against the Zionist occupiers. With Israel commanding everyone's undivided attention, the Arab world remains shamefully 'divided and conquered', resentful, even hostile to Shia Iran's lifeline to Gaza and Lebanon. Jordan and Saudi assistance to US-Israel to shoot down Iran's missiles will never be erased. Jordan and Saudi leaders have a lot to account for before their people. Only when Israel is eventually brought to justice, can the Middle East develop more naturally. Islam remains the bedrock, and Islamic reforms will be the way forward, based now on the experience of the past century, including Egypti's MB, Islamic Iran and Afghanistan. The Saudis and Gulf emirates are remnants of 19th c British imperialism and do not represent the future of the Egyptian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Jordanian, etc masses. But until the enemy is defeated, we must stand shoulder to shoulder (though the Saudis et al should keep a look out over theirs). Russia, China Steinbock doesn't make predictions on their account. He puts his hopes on BRICS, especially China's hint at engagement, its brokering Saudi-Iranian reconciliation, and Palestinian factions uniting. The latter was called the Beijing Declaration, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a timetable to implement a two-state solution. I think it is a mistake to be too hopeful. Russia and Chinese have highly developed economic relations with Israel; Russia provides it will the oil to use to bomb Palestinians; China is Israel's largest trade partner – 18% of trade vs 10% for US and 2.5% for Russia. Chinese investment is more than US$15b, spawning seed capital in Israeli startup companies, as well as the acquisition of Israeli companies by major Chinese corporations that incorporate Israel's know how to help invigorate the development of the modern Chinese economy more efficiently. China ranked second in 2015 after the US on collaboration with Israeli high-tech firms that are backed by Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist. Neither Russia nor China want to see Israel collapse. BRICS is not a coherent economic force. We are stuck with US-Israel, the Axis of Resistance, the Palestinian now scattered around the world, working with the handful of anti-Zionist diaspora Jews, until the US itself collapses. That seems to be our strategy. All countries listen to China, Israel included. It would be lost if China made an serious move to threaten its economic ties. China's recent two-state proposals prompted Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to move forward with plans to present a joint political vision for rehabilitating the Gaza Strip and establishing a Palestinian state after the Israel-Hamas war. To preempt such schemes, Netanyahu’s office presented its own vision of 'Gaza 2035' in May. The Israeli proposal labels Gaza as an 'Iranian outpost', taunting the quisling Arab leaders as ineffectual, traitors, allies of the hated Israel. So Gaza can be taken, as it isn't really part of the Arab world, but an Iranian outpost which must be destroyed. More tactic than strategy and very silly. Israel would mobilize the emirates and Saudis to divvy out aid to Gazans and hunt down and eliminate Hamas, much like the Oslo Accords got the PA to police Palestinians as settlements proceeded. After 15 years, if things go well, some limited autonomy would be allowed, all the while under Israeli hegemony. Steinbock puts his eggs in China's basket in his vision of any future Middle East peace. At each step, China is filling in where the US fears (or is too lazy) to tread. Re Egypt, in the absence of Israel’s full withdrawal from the occupied territories, the bilateral trust with Israel has been eroding for decades. Today it is sustained mainly by US aid, which is vital to bottomless-pit Cairo. Meanwhile China’s multibillion-dollar economic cooperation initiatives are fostering rather than undermining Egyptian development. Ditto Jordan, where China is building a national railway network, an oil pipeline to link Iraq and Jordan, and a new Jordan-China university. Egypt and Jordan, weak and corrupt, are throwing themselves at China's feet, much like Iran did over the past decade. China is waging a positive-sum war against/ with the world, promising prosperity and Chinese hegemony as a package deal. (At least this is not the subtle Bretton Woods 'prosperity and US imperialism'.) China's Belt Road Initiative has reached around the world, despite US attempts to sabotage China with its own rail-ship road from India through the Middle East to Europe, but that assumes Saudi compliance, which is dead-on-arrival now. One can only laugh in disbelief as US hegemony is being K-Oed by the Chinese economic fist – everywhere. Unlike US-Israel, China has a clear strategy of nonzero sum cooperation with all, promising advantages where past 'aid' meant corruption, misuse of funds, more debt. The US-China economic rivalry is providing lots of brainstorming by potential participants in both hopeful outcomes, but China remains cautious, more or less abiding by US sanctions on Russia. BRICS at least has raised the profile of the South, given them collective clout though still much less than the collective West. With the Ukraine war unending, Russia is now unofficially joining all anti-US efforts, probably providing Iran and the Houthis with satellite information to keep the Suez Canal out of commission and for accurate bombing, possibly even providing a few missiles and drones. Why not? The world really is going to Hell in a handbasket, and the ride is rocky but exciting and even hopeful, considering the bad guys seem to be doing everything wrong, pushing Putin into the hands of enemy. Nuke time? The ongoing war on multiple fronts from the Axis of Resistance, with 100,000s of Hezbollah bombs ready, could push Israel to use its nukes.v The Begin 'doctrine' was 'formulated' to justify bombing Iraq's nuclear facilities and is still in play against Iran. Several nuclear sites were bombed in October, though not the main sites, and were accompanied by a promise to bombing Iran's nuclear facilities after the election. Trump has already voiced his approval. But Iran's success in bombing Israel twice in 2024 shows it has jumped ahead of Israel (and the US) in hypersonic missiles, which can be mobilized to really destroy little sitting-duck Israel. Israel is still loudly threatening Iran but my gut reaction is to imagine hundreds of hypersonic missiles reining down on Israel. Israelis are uniformly racist monsters now, so the civilian-military distinction is moot. When the whole world feels that way about you, all the king's horse and all the king's lackeys won't be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again. In the West, Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), and the Abraham Accords (2020–2021) with some Gulf states are often portrayed as steps toward a two-state solution. In Israel, they are seen more as bilateral 'normalization' deals with individual Arab countries that will over time marginalize or exclude Palestinians from a final peace solution. The Gaza War has jeopardized the future of such normalization agreements, while severely shuttering the existing deals. The trouble is neither the US nor Israel ever took the negotiations seriously. No one believed then or now that the two-state solution is possible. Meanwhile even US presidents don't control things, as congress is completely in thrall to Israel and will not allow any pressure to be put on Israel to negotiate. The Knesset voted unanimously against a Palestinian state for the nth time (68, 9 Arab Israelis voting for a Palestinian state). Given the likely Trump second term, funded by Adelson, probably none of this matters at all. Trump's Project 2025 includes Project Esther, which plans to crush all anti-Israel dissent in the US and Europe and to create a Potemkin villlage of acceptable Palestinians, to be kept in line by Arab sheikhs with Israeli puppet masters. Netanyahu couldn't have said it better. Steinbock is hopeful re Russia, with its offer to Iran of S-400 anti-missile defense (a decade after Iran paid for them), showing the US that it is not the only kid on the block with nukes. But Steinbock's only real hope is that world opinion, backed by a Jewish diaspora, will somehow click in and bring the US to its senses. I would add the Palestinian diaspora, which is already larger (in 2003 9.6m) than the Jewish one (8.5m), working together, will be the driving force of change. And Islam. It is the fastest growing religion (always has been) and the Middle East is now multiple-birthing Ziophobia and Islamophilia. It's never been a better time to be a Muslim. We have a huge diaspora in the House of War. And we have Boycott Divest Sanction as the secular version of jihad. When Jews, Christians* and Muslims can join forces, we can do anything. The first real sign that South African apartheid would be dismantled was when (Jewish) MP Harry Schwarz met with ANC's Mangosuthu Buthelezi to sign the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first such agreement by black and white political leaders in South Africa. But it took another 2 decades of struggle until de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government. It seems we have reached that first stage today. Ehud Olmert, who served as the Israeli prime minister from 2006 to 2009, and Nasser al-Kidwa, the Palestinian foreign minister from 2005 to 2006, met Pope Francis October 17, 2024, to promote a peace plan that would see a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel 'on the basis of 1967 borders' with a few territorial adjustments. Their plan calls for the city of Jerusalem to be the capital of both Israel and Palestine, with the Old City being 'administered by a trusteeship of five states of which Israel and Palestine are part.'

US Presidential Election: Key Policy Differences Between Kamala H...	As the U.S. presidential election on November 5 approaches, the policy differences between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are becoming increasingly evident. Kamala Harris takes a more moderate stance on immigration, while Trump aims to deport all undocumented immigrants. Harris pledges to continue social spending on NGOs, whereas Trump plans to cut social aid. Regarding the Ukraine war, Trump seeks to engage in dialogue with Russia, while Harris adopts a more cautious approach. Both candidates have Jewish family ties; Harris's husband is of Jewish descent, as is Trump's son-in-law. Harris has expressed her intent to maintain U.S. support for Israel, while Trump is rumored to have unexpected moves planned for Iran. Their approaches to U.S.-Turkey relations also differ. Harris appears likely to keep communications with Turkey limited, whereas Trump aims for a more active relationship. The candidates' educational and career backgrounds reflect distinct differences: Harris is a well-educated lawyer and former state prosecutor with a strong commitment to ethics, while Trump is known as a profit-driven figure in the business world. Kamala Harris is expected to continue Joe Biden's economic and foreign policy trajectory, which could result in rising inflation and unemployment, along with ongoing arms support for Ukraine and the Middle East. Trump, in contrast, aims to cut spending to curb inflation and reduce unemployment. In his campaign, Trump employs populist tactics, bringing celebrities to the stage and criticizing minorities and immigrants. Harris is expected to work with experienced advisors, while Trump tends toward loyalty-based, nepotistic appointments. Trump lacks the support of key Republican figures, while Harris has open backing from Democratic members, including former President Barack Obama, who speaks on her behalf. Polls show the candidates are closely matched, with a narrow margin expected to determine the outcome. Votes from low-income voters and turnout rates are likely to be significant factors. If Trump loses, it's anticipated he may contest the results, as he did previously, potentially leading to political tension. The above assessment reflects the perspective of an average observer outside the U.S. who is not a voter. The choice made by American voters will impact not only the U.S. but everyone around the globe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc0XW-_SfuINs	2024-10-31T09:33:22-07:00	
Allah’s Relationships With Three Different Religious Communities ...	For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations all over the earth, and not one of them could establish an ongoing, imageless, monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with one small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for centuries with the people of this tribe, until they were able to establish an ongoing, imageless, monotheistic community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal to the covenant believers. Allah selected Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) and the descendants of Prophets Ishmael, Issac, and Jacob to be the first, but not the last monotheistic community. 'There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him.' [Qur'an 60:4] and 'Indeed Ibrahim was a nation obedient to Allah, a Hanif, he was not one of the polytheists.' [Qur'an 16:120]. A major misunderstanding of the Biblical concept of God choosing a people or a prophet is caused by the use of the word 'the' chosen when a better translation would be 'a' chosen prophet or people. Relationships are always unique and exclusive, but just as a parent can and should have a loving relationship with several different children; God can and does have unique and exclusive relationships with many different prophets and many different religious communities. Before Prophets Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus, 'We (God) sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they call Allah in humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not call Allah in humility? On the contrary, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them.'(Qur'an 6:42-43) The Banu Israel (Jewish People) became the first ongoing, imageless, monotheistic community to last to the present because God made a special covenant with all the Banu Israel which; according to the Bible, was similar to a marital partnership, as can be seen from the following Biblical verses: 1. God proposes a marriage covenant at Sinai: God said to Moses 'Speak thus to the house of Jacob, and tell this to the children of Israel... Now if you listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the peoples, for the whole earth is mine. You will be my kingdom of priests, my holy nation. These words you shall speak to the people of Israel' (this is the proposal) 'Moses came and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these proposals as God had commanded him. All the people answered together, 'All that God has proposed, we will do.' (like 'I do' at a wedding). Moses brought this answer back to the Lord.' (Exodus 19:5-8). 2. Why the Jews? Because God loved their ancestors. 'The Lord cared for your ancestors, loving them and chose their descendants after them from all nations, as you are this day.' (Deuteronomy 10:15) 'I will fulfill my covenant between myself and you (Abraham) and your descendants after you, generation after generation, an everlasting covenant, to be your God, yours and your descendants after you.' (Genesis 17:7)' 'All the families of the earth shall be blessed through you (Jacob) and your descendants.' (Genesis 28:14) 3. Why the Jews? Divine love isn't based on popularity or large numbers. 'It was not because you were more numerous than any other nation that the Lord cared about you and chose you, for you are the smallest of nations; it was because of the Lord's love for you, and his oath to your ancestors.' (Deuteronomy 7:7-8) 4. Does being chosen and special make you better? No. A committed loving relationship results in more giving (Mitsvot), more receiving (Torah, Prophets and sages) and more grief (because each cares about the other). 'For you alone have I cared among all the nations of the world, therefore I will castigate you for all your iniquities.' (Amos 3:2) 5. Israel can't adore any other God, but God can and does redeem other nations. 'Are not Israelites like Ethiopians to me? Says the Lord. Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Crete and the Aramaeans from Kir?' (Amos 9:7) 6. Jews are not THE chosen people; they are A chosen people, the first of several ongoing monotheistic religions. A parent can have many children but only one is the firstborn. 'These are the words of the Lord, Israel is my first-born son.' (Exodus 4:22) The Jewish people was the first community to enter into a sacred relationship with the one God but they are not the only ones to do so. In later centuries other communities were formed to spread monotheism worldwide. That process will continue until all nations have a sacred relationship to the one God of Israel. 'Each nation will walk in the name of its God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' (Micah 4:5) Even in the Messianic Age the other nations will be free to faithfully follow their vision of the One God. As the Qur'an states: 'For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in prayer). So hasten towards all that is good. Wheresoever you may be, Allâh will bring you together. Truly, Allâh is able to do all things.' (2:148) The commentary/Tafsir of al-Jalalayn states: 'Every person, of every community, has his direction/qibla, to which he turns in prayer, so compete with one another in good works; strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together, gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.' And as Prophet Isaiah states: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5) 7. What is Israel chosen for? To be an agent of holiness and enlightenment. 'You are the children of the Lord your God...You are a people holy to the Lord your God.' (Leviticus 19). 'The Lord has chosen you out of all the nations on earth to be his special possession.' (Deuteronomy 14:1-2) 'I will make you a light for the nations' (Isaiah 49:6) Thus, other nations will also be blessed through their own religions that were connected by Israel's covenant with God at Sinai, thus fulfilling the promise to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth. As a Rabbi, I believe that the many prophets Allah/God sends to the Children of Israel is a sign of the ongoing covenant between Allah and the Children of Israel. I know Muslim interpreters interpret 2:63-64 to mean that the favors mentioned in those verses were conditional with a certain period of time when the Divine trust—the representation and promotion of God's eternal religion—rested on the shoulders of the Children of Israel. The biblical religious tradition claims this trust is an 'ongoing covenant' between God and the Children of Israel. Clearly, not all Jews live up to this trust, but God's commitment is ongoing for the whole Jewish Umma of those who do. For Jews, the ongoing continuity of God's covenant with the Jewish People is achieved through the faithful linked chain connection of endless successive loyal generations. This is why the Jewish Umma is both a religious and an ethnic community. Although many Christians claim the new covenant replaces the old covenant for all Jews (1), and some Muslims say the Jewish covenant has expired for all Jews, faithful Jews remain loyal to their spiritual relationship with God. I believe wisdom dictates that we follow the Qur'an's (22:67) advice: 'For every community We have appointed a whole system of worship which they are to observe. So do not let them draw you into disputes concerning this matter.' The Qur'an relates God's ongoing concern for faithful Jews when Prophet Moses speaks to his people as follows: 'O my people! Remember God's favor upon you, for He appointed among you Prophets, and rulers, and He granted to you favors such as He had not granted to anyone else in the worlds' (5:20). This is one reason why Jews in Sunni Muslim lands have rarely been forcibly converted; as frequently happened in Christian lands. The principle that God can make a covenant with a whole people, and not just with those who are faithful believers, also helps me understand a powerful verse where the Qur'an narrates that at Sinai, before Allah gives the Torah to the Children of Israel, He makes a covenant with them. Allah raises the mountain above the whole people saying: 'Hold firmly to what We have given you (the Torah) and remember what is in it' (Qur'an 2:63). The whole nation's fate stands under the shadow of mount Sinai, and this explains the miracle of all Israel agreeing to the covenant. This may be the reason why Moses/Musa is the only prophet whose book comes not from an angel but directly from Allah. Individuals who hear a prophet may choose to believe or disbelieve, but in this case God Almighty makes 'an offer that you can't refuse,' so, as far as Judaism is concerned, everyone of the Children of Israel has to struggle for all generations to come, with living up to the covenant their ancestors chose to enter into at Mount Sinai. This concept, of a chosen (by being pressed into being a) choosing people, can and among many ultra-orthodox Jews has led to exaggerated and self-righteous feelings of pride. Thus, when the Qur'an (7:171) mentions another time the same event, when the Mount was moved above the Children of Israel, this verse is followed by a reminder in 7:172 that 'children of Adam' were all made bear witness against their own souls: ''Am I not your Lord?' They said 'Yes, we do bear witness.' God Almighty made a covenant with all individuals 'lest [they] should say on the Day of Resurrection, 'We were indeed unaware of this'.' Thus, while loyalty to the commitment one's ancestors made at Mount Sinai may inspire greater effort for Jews in following God's will, when Jews, like Muslims, Christians and everyone else on earth face judgement on the Day of Resurrection, we are all judged as individuals. As Prophet Abraham says: 'Do not forsake me on the Day of Resurrection, a day where neither money nor children will benefit except whoever meets Allah with a sound heart' (26:87-89). The Qur'an thus makes clear that, every person Jew or non-Jew, also has a opportunity as an individual to choose and be chosen, by choosing wisdom over gold and understanding over silver as the Biblical Book of Proverbs (16:16) states: 'Acquiring wisdom is better than gold; and acquiring understanding is being chosen over silver.' This reminder by the Qur'an that no religious community should be self-righteous is similar to that of prophet Amos who tells the Children of Israel: 'Are you not like the Children of Ethiopia to me, O Children of Israel? says God. Did I not redeem Israel from Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?' (Amos 9:7) I myself see the Torah's description of the descendants of Prophet Abraham as destined to become the first chosen people, as a testimony about the significance of Prophet Abraham himself. Islamic tradition asserts that there have been tens of thousands of prophets who were sent to all the various tribes and nations of the world. Messengers however, number only 313. Of the 313, we only know the names of five who brought a sacred scripture. The first one of the five is Abraham as the Qur'an states: 'Indeed, this is in the former scriptures; the scriptures of Abraham and Moses. (87:19), and: 'Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses and Abraham. (53:36). For many centuries Abraham's faithful descendants within the Children of Israel were the only monotheistic community that survived as the Qur'an states: 'Those who disbelieve are steeped in arrogance and defiance. How many generations have We destroyed before them? They cried out when it was too late to escape. And they marveled that a warner had come to them from among them. The disbelievers said, 'This is a lying magician.' 'Did he turn all the gods into one God? This is something strange.' The notables among them announced: 'Go on, and hold fast to your gods. This is something planned. We never heard of this in the former faith. This is nothing but a fabrication. (Qur'an 38:2-7) Jews could have credited this situation to their own spiritual qualities. But the Torah teaches Jews not to be proud of themselves for being the first monotheistic community to survive long after their messenger was gone; because it was God's choice to choose them. Their only choice was to always be conscious of, and obligated by, God's choice; to always choose remaining loyal to their ancestors pledge at Mount Sinai: 'We will do.' Note (1): This is the concept of supersessionism , a.k.a. replacement theology or fulfillment theology. Many early Christian believed that the Christian Church succeeded the Israelites as 'the' chosen people of God. This was a common belief in the Church until the Nazi Holocaust, which triggered theological thought after World War II. The Roman Catholic Church largely abandoned the concept starting in the mid-1970''s. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), United Church of Christ, and Episcopal Church (USA) followed in the 1980's. Some denominations still retain the belief.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc_wqh5Ir64hJ	2024-10-31T09:32:20-07:00	
Khawariji Terrorism: The TTP And ISKP Threat To Pakistan’s Stabil...	Pakistan, a country with a rich cultural tapestry and a strategic geopolitical location, has been grappling with various security challenges. Among the most pressing of these challenges is the rise of Khawariji terrorists, a term used to describe extremist groups like the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). Both TTP and ISKP share a common Khawariji ideology; encompassing un-Islamic, inhuman, immoral and barbaric practices based upon misinterpretation of Islamic teachings. For the past two decades, Pakistan has been grappling with the menace of Khawariji terrorists, a term used to describe groups like TTP and ISKP that engage in extremist activities under the guise of Islamic righteousness. These groups justify their acts of violence through a distorted interpretation of Islamic teachings, which has been consistently condemned by Islamic scholars. Religious leaders in Pakistan have declared these organizations’ activities as un-Islamic and 'haram' (forbidden), noting that their actions are driven by a desire for power and destruction, rather than any genuine religious or moral cause. The nexus between the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) is a significant threat to the security and stability of Pakistan. Both groups have been involved in numerous terrorist activities, targeting civilians, security forces, and government officials. The TTP is a Pakistani Taliban group that seeks to overthrow the Pakistani government and establish an Islamic state, while the ISKP is a branch of the Islamic State that operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both TTP and ISKP are also widely regarded as foreign proxies, working in service of external enemies of Pakistan. These groups are funded and supported by outside actors who have an interest in destabilizing the region. Their acts of violence serve the interests of their foreign masters, making them tools in a larger geopolitical game aimed at undermining Pakistan’s sovereignty. By creating chaos and terror, TTP and ISKP advance the agenda of those who seek to weaken Pakistan from within. While ISKP is known for its hostility towards the Afghan Taliban—physically fighting them and condemning them in propaganda campaigns—its stance towards the TTP is noticeably softer. There has never been a reported clash between TTP and ISKP, despite their presence in the same regions of Afghanistan. This strange lack of conflict between two seemingly opposed factions further strengthens the perception that the two groups are collaborating on some level. It suggests that ISKP may be serving as a cover for TTP’s operations, allowing TTP to use ISKP as a tool for deflection. The Khawariji TTP is known to perpetrate attacks on civilian targets, often using ISKP as a front to shield itself from public backlash. ISKP, on the other hand, is infamous for launching suicide bombers on religious gatherings, mosques, and scholars. This division of labor, where ISKP handles particularly heinous attacks on civilians while TTP claims responsibility only for assaults on security forces, is a strategy to manage public opinion and deflect blame from TTP’s operations. The calculated nature of these attacks reveals the strategic collaboration between the two groups. Another sinister aspect of TTP and ISKP’s operations is their method of radicalizing youth. Both organizations prey on vulnerable teenagers, coercing them into carrying out suicide attacks. While they exploit young minds for these barbaric purposes, it is worth noting that no high-ranking terrorist leader has ever sacrificed himself in such a manner. This highlights the hypocrisy of their leadership, who manipulate others to die for a cause they themselves do not genuinely believe in. The presence of Khawariji TTP and ISKP in Afghanistan is not a secret, as it has been well-documented by various international security organizations and media outlets, including reports by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and Western think tanks. These reports affirm that both TTP and ISKP enjoy safe havens in Afghanistan, where they plot and launch attacks on Pakistan without facing significant opposition from the Afghan government. This reality further reinforces the idea that the two groups are working in tandem, using Afghanistan as a base of operations to destabilize Pakistan. Pakistani religious scholars have long condemned the actions of these terrorist groups, collectively issuing a ‘fatwa’ (religious decree) through the Paigham-e-Pakistan initiative. This decree explicitly declares the activities of TTP and ISKP as haram, stating that their so-called armed struggle is not only un-Islamic but also a direct affront to the teachings of Islam. The fatwa emphasizes that killing innocent civilians, targeting religious figures, and promoting violence under the guise of religion is forbidden in Islam. TTP and ISKP may operate under different banners and claim different allegiances, but they are ultimately two sides of the same coin. Both groups share a common Khawariji ideology that distorts Islamic teachings to justify their inhuman and immoral acts. Their collaboration in terrorism, manipulation of youth, and use as foreign proxies to destabilize Pakistan all point to a coordinated effort that threatens the peace and security of the region. The fight against these Khawariji terrorists will continue, as Pakistan remains resolute in its determination to rid the country of this menace, with the support of religious scholars who have unequivocally declared these groups as enemies of Islam and humanity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc9kCJXkaxXTv	2024-10-31T09:30:45-07:00	
Bangladesh: Bold Steps Needed To Boost Garment Sector – OpEd	BGMEA had demanded a massive production disruption due to recent labor unrest. Apart from this, there have been various incidents including factory closures and labor protests. And when it is known that in the first eight months of the year, the export of clothing made in the United States, along with the European Union (EU) countries, has seen a decline. And in this, the export income of various countries, including Bangladesh, China, Vietnam and India has decreased, so it appears that it is necessary to take the overall situation into consideration. It is known that in other years, the growth in ready-made clothing business has decreased in January-August this year. According to the data, the exports of China, the world's largest exporter of ready-made garments, Vietnam, which is second, and Bangladesh, which is third, have decreased. We think that it is the duty of the concerned parties of the country to take this initiative and continue efforts in implementation. Notably, these data on the decline in exports have emerged in the January-August report of Eurostat and the US Department of Commerce's Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA). According to the data, exports to the European Union (EU), the largest market for ready-made garments, fell by 3.63 percent in the eight months from January to August this year. At the same time, the US market fell by 4.04 percent. The export income of two major trade circles decreased by 223 crore 63 lakh dollars and 215 crore 48 lakh 90 thousand dollars respectively. The concerns need to be taken into account, exporters and economists consider the situation to be the effect of economic recession around the world. They say, the Russia-Ukraine war, instability in the Middle East is affecting the global economy. It is worth noting that, in January-August, 5 thousand 932 million 14 million 70 thousand dollars worth of ready-made clothes were exported to Europe. And last year at the same time the export was 6 thousand 155 crore 77 lakh 70 thousand dollars. In January-August, China's exports decreased by 3.63 percent, Vietnam by 4.10 percent and Bangladesh by 3.53 percent. Apart from this, Turkey decreased by 7.52 percent and Cambodia decreased by 2.73 percent. On the other hand, the US, the second largest market for ready-made garments, exported $5,132,210,000 worth of ready-made garments in the first eight months of the year. During the same period in the previous year, exports were worth 5,345,700,000 dollars. In January-August, China's exports decreased by 2.70 percent, Vietnam by 1.03 percent and Bangladesh by 9.17 percent. It needs to be mentioned that the country's stakeholders need to take this into account, as a single country, Bangladesh's exports of garments to the US market have decreased significantly. According to the data, Bangladesh is the country with the second highest export decline among the notable countries in the export of manufactured garments to the US market. In the eight months of January-August, Bangladesh exported 4.7 billion 9.8 million dollars worth of ready-made garments to that country. During the same period of the previous year, exports of ready-made garments were worth 518.51 million dollars. Notably, exporters say that the exports of ready-made garments decreased from the beginning of the year to August, but the positive trend has returned to exports from September. It is expected that when the next report comes, it will be seen that the demand for ready-made garments has increased. All in all, we would like to say that a decline in apparel exports is naturally a cause for concern. As a result, taking into account the overall situation, the relevant people have to work on determining what to do and its proper implementation. According to the director of the Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the economy of the United States and European Union countries was bad. Slowly the economy is turning around, now it will increase. In addition, exports have not only decreased in our country. Pointing out that the exports of almost all the countries have decreased, he expressed hope to increase the exports to these countries by increasing the capacity. It is reasonable to expect that effective initiatives to increase exports will continue taking into account the overall situation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc4t1sus-mdLf	2024-10-31T09:28:50-07:00	
Indonesia’s Gutsy Response To Chinese Incursion Shows Ex-General ...	By Tria Dianti Jakarta’s feisty response last week to the Chinese coast guard 'disrupting' Indonesian survey activities in the North Natuna Sea appears to show that new President Prabowo Subianto has shed his 'cuddly grandpa' election persona in favor of his familiar disposition as an ex-general, analysts said. On three occasions during the first week of Prabowo’s presidency, Indonesian coast guard and navy ships chased and expelled the Chinese vessel from South China Sea waters in Jakarta’s exclusive economic zone, which Beijing said was 'under the jurisdiction of China.' The measures taken by Indonesia were calculated, according to Arie Afriansyah, an expert in international maritime law at the University of Indonesia. 'The actions are a positive sign, not only sending a message to the Indonesian people but also to the international community that the Natuna Sea is now being guarded more closely,' Arie told BenarNews. 'I believe the maneuvers of the China Coast Guard are part of a strategy to test the waters and see if the new government under Prabowo is lenient.' Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, an international relations researcher, concurred. 'Prabowo’s preference is to be more assertive in protecting assets and upholding sovereignty,' said Waffaa, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta. 'However, this should be balanced with good neighborly diplomacy. It remains to be seen how this will play out.' The Indonesian coast guard (Bakamla) said that when a China Coast Guard ship identified itself over radio as patrolling 'in Chinese waters,' it responded by affirming Indonesia’s sovereign rights under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). China Coast Guard ship 5402 'disrupted the Arwana 3D Seismic Data Survey and Processing activities being carried out by PT Pertamina East Natuna using the MV Geo Coral ship,' Bakamla said in a weekend statement about the Oct. 21 incident involving a vessel from the Indonesian state-owned oil firm. Two Indonesian Navy patrol ships and a Bakamla air patrol aircraft 'carried out shadowing and succeeded in driving the CCG 5402 ship out of Indonesia's jurisdiction in the North Natuna Sea,' it added. 'Bakamla’s expulsion of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel from the North Natuna Sea’s continental shelf is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguarding our maritime domain,' Bakamla said. Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said the CCG vessel’s operations were legitimate and within Chinese jurisdiction. 'China stands ready to enhance communication and consultation with Indonesia through diplomatic channels and properly handle maritime issues between the two countries,' he said during a daily press conference Oct. 24. Indonesian presidential spokesman Hasan Nasbi and the foreign ministry declined to comment about the three Chinese encroachments, the first of which occurred a day after Prabowo met with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng on Oct. 20. Han was in Jakarta to attend Prabowo’s inauguration. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s new Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin had what appeared to be a cordial meeting mid-week with Chinese Ambassador Wang Lutong, who paid him a courtesy call. 'In the meeting, the two hope[d] to create new opportunities in bilateral relations that are not only limited to defense cooperation, but also to increasing the stability and prosperity of the region,' the ministry said via X. 'In addition, the Minister of Defense also expressed his desire to continue to increase cooperation in the defense sector, in the form of joint exercises between Indonesia and China.' The South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest maritime regions, has long been a geopolitical flashpoint, with China claiming much of the sea that overlaps with territories also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Although Indonesia does not consider itself a claimant in the territorial dispute, Beijing’s maritime assertions often infringe upon Indonesia’s EEZ, which Jakarta in July 2017 renamed North Natuna Sea. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China’s claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected. Under President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo (2014-24), similar confrontations with Chinese coast guard ships were not uncommon. However, Prabowo’s background as a military leader has led some to expect a firmer stance from his administration, said Khairul Fahmi, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and Security Studies. The incident in the Natuna Sea may align Indonesia more closely with Southeast Asian neighbors such as the Philippines and Vietnam advocating for a rules-based order in the waterway, he added. 'I believe the Prabowo administration is demonstrating a more assertive stance towards maritime sovereignty issues, especially in the Natuna Sea,' Khairul told BenarNews. For years, ASEAN and China have been negotiating a Code of Conduct to manage the South China Sea dispute, yet a final agreement remains elusive. 'By positioning itself as a firm but open country for dialogue, Indonesia can strengthen its position in the region without causing unnecessary conflict,' Khairul said. Yet Indonesia’s challenge remains balancing its sovereignty with its economic ties to China, which is Indonesia’s largest trading partner and a key investor in its infrastructure and energy sectors, analysts said. 'Indonesia can assert territorial integrity while maintaining constructive relations with China,' said Arie of the University of Indonesia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9sc1mRQJ6_F6vh	2024-10-30T18:26:55-07:00	
They Are Scrubbing The Internet Right Now – OpEd	Instances of censorship are growing to the point of normalization. Despite ongoing litigation and more public attention, mainstream social media has been more ferocious in recent months than ever before. Podcasters know for sure what will be instantly deleted and debate among themselves over content in gray areas. Some like Brownstone have given up on YouTube in favor of Rumble, sacrificing vast audiences if only to see their content survive to see the light of day. It’s not always about being censored or not. Today’s algorithms include a range of tools that affect searchability and findability. For example, the Joe Rogan interview with Donald Trump racked up an astonishing 34 million views before YouTube and Google tweaked their search engines to make it hard to discover, while even presiding over a technical malfunction that disabled viewing for many people. Faced with this, Rogan went to the platform X to post all three hours. Navigating this thicket of censorship and quasi-censorship has become part of the business model of alternative media. Those are just the headline cases. Beneath the headlines, there are technical events taking place that are fundamentally affecting the ability of any historian even to look back and tell what is happening. Incredibly, the service Archive.org which has been around since 1994 has stopped taking images of content on all platforms. For the first time in 30 years, we have gone a long swath of time – since October 8-10 – since this service has chronicled the life of the Internet in real time. As of this writing, we have no way to verify content that has been posted for three weeks of October leading to the days of the most contentious and consequential election of our lifetimes. Crucially, this is not about partisanship or ideological discrimination. No websites on the Internet are being archived in ways that are available to users. In effect, the whole memory of our main information system is just a big black hole right now. The trouble on Archive.org began on October 8, 2024, when the service was suddenly hit with a massive Denial of Service attack (DDOS) that not only took down the service but introduced a level of failure that nearly took it out completely. Working around the clock, Archive.org came back as a read-only service where it stands today. However, you can only read content that was posted before the attack. The service has yet to resume any public display of mirroring of any sites on the Internet. In other words, the only source on the entire World Wide Web that mirrors content in real time has been disabled. For the first time since the invention of the web browser itself, researchers have been robbed of the ability to compare past with future content, an action that is a staple of researchers looking into government and corporate actions. It was using this service, for example, that enabled Brownstone researchers to discover precisely what the CDC had said about Plexiglas, filtration systems, mail-in ballots, and rental moratoriums. That content was all later scrubbed off the live Internet, so accessing archive copies was the only way we could know and verify what was true. It was the same with the World Health Organization and its disparagement of natural immunity which was later changed. We were able to document the shifting definitions thanks only to this tool which is now disabled. What this means is the following: Any website can post anything today and take it down tomorrow and leave no record of what they posted unless some user somewhere happened to take a screenshot. Even then there is no way to verify its authenticity. The standard approach to know who said what and when is now gone. That is to say that the whole Internet is already being censored in real time so that during these crucial weeks, when vast swaths of the public fully expect foul play, anyone in the information industry can get away with anything and not get caught. We know what you are thinking. Surely this DDOS attack was not a coincidence. The time was just too perfect. And maybe that is right. We just do not know. Does Archive.org suspect something along those lines? Here is what they say: Last week, along with a DDOS attack and exposure of patron email addresses and encrypted passwords, the Internet Archive’s website javascript was defaced, leading us to bring the site down to access and improve our security. The stored data of the Internet Archive is safe and we are working on resuming services safely. This new reality requires heightened attention to cyber security and we are responding. We apologize for the impact of these library services being unavailable. Deep state? As with all these things, there is no way to know, but the effort to blast away the ability of the Internet to have a verified history fits neatly into the stakeholder model of information distribution that has clearly been prioritized on a global level. The Declaration of the Future of the Internet makes that very clear: the Internet should be 'governed through the multi-stakeholder approach, whereby governments and relevant authorities partner with academics, civil society, the private sector, technical community and others.' All of these stakeholders benefit from the ability to act online without leaving a trace. To be sure, a librarian at Archive.org has written that 'While the Wayback Machine has been in read-only mode, web crawling and archiving have continued. Those materials will be available via the Wayback Machine as services are secured.' When? We do not know. Before the election? In five years? There might be some technical reasons but it might seem that if web crawling is continuing behind the scenes, as the note suggests, that too could be available in read-only mode now. It is not. Disturbingly, this erasure of Internet memory is happening in more than one place. For many years, Google offered a cached version of the link you were seeking just below the live version. They have plenty of server space to enable that now, but no: that service is now completely gone. In fact, the Google cache service officially ended just a week or two before the Archive.org crash, at the end of September 2024. Thus the two available tools for searching cached pages on the Internet disappeared within weeks of each other and within weeks of the November 5th election. Other disturbing trends are also turning Internet search results increasingly into AI-controlled lists of establishment-approved narratives. The web standard used to be for search result rankings to be governed by user behavior, links, citations, and so forth. These were more or less organic metrics, based on an aggregation of data indicating how useful a search result was to Internet users. Put very simply, the more people found a search result useful, the higher it would rank. Google now uses very different metrics to rank search results, including what it considers 'trusted sources' and other opaque, subjective determinations. Furthermore, the most widely used service that once ranked websites based on traffic is now gone. That service was called Alexa. The company that created it was independent. Then one day in 1999, it was bought by Amazon. That seemed encouraging because Amazon was well-heeled. The acquisition seemed to codify the tool that everyone was using as a kind of metric of status on the web. It was common back in the day to take note of an article somewhere on the web and then look it up on Alexa to see its reach. If it was important, one would take notice, but if it was not, no one particularly cared. This is how an entire generation of web technicians functioned. The system worked as well as one could possibly expect. Then, in 2014, years after acquiring the ranking service Alexa, Amazon did a strange thing. It released its home assistant (and surveillance device) with the same name. Suddenly, everyone had them in their homes and would find out anything by saying 'Hey Alexa.' Something seemed strange about Amazon naming its new product after an unrelated business it had acquired years earlier. No doubt there was some confusion caused by the naming overlap. Here’s what happened next. In 2022, Amazon actively took down the web ranking tool. It didn’t sell it. It didn’t raise the prices. It didn’t do anything with it. It suddenly made it go completely dark. No one could figure out why. It was the industry standard, and suddenly it was gone. Not sold, just blasted away. No longer could anyone figure out the traffic-based website rankings of anything without paying very high prices for hard-to-use proprietary products. All of these data points that might seem unrelated when considered individually, are actually part of a long trajectory that has shifted our information landscape into unrecognizable territory. The Covid events of 2020-2023, with massive global censorship and propaganda efforts, greatly accelerated these trends. One wonders if anyone will remember what it was once like. The hacking and hobbling of Archive.org underscores the point: there will be no more memory. As of this writing, fully three weeks of web content have not been archived. What we are missing and what has changed is anyone’s guess. And we have no idea when the service will come back. It is entirely possible that it will not come back, that the only real history to which we can take recourse will be pre-October 8, 2024, the date on which everything changed. The Internet was founded to be free and democratic. It will require herculean efforts at this point to restore that vision, because something else is quickly replacing it.

The Cold War’s Strategic Significance Today: Is China A Sea Power...	China has a pivotal decision to make soon. Will it continue to back the continentalist Putin? Or will Xi Jinping take advantage of Russia's sudden weakness to reclaim China's 'lost territories,' thereby deescalating rising maritime tensions with the Anglo-American-led sea powers? *** It is often overlooked that during the Cold War China was the biggest prize for the West, tying up as it did a quarter of the Soviet armed forces. To defeat the USSR, the U.S. and UK even helped build the modern Chinese Navy. This created new threats to the West, however, including encouraging the emergence of an imperialist China intent on satisfying its historical ambitions to dominate Southeast Asia. Interestingly, on 10 April 1974, Deng Xiaoping foresaw this possible danger when he told a special session of the United Nations General Assembly: 'If one day China should change her colour and turn into a Superpower, if she too should play the tyrant in the world, and everywhere subject others to her bullying, aggression and exploitation, the peoples of the world should identify her as social-imperialist, expose it and work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it.'1 A half-century later, America and its sea power allies are even now facing just such a resurgent China. But China is torn by competing land and sea interests. Among these, its historical tensions with Russia are the most critical. The West took full advantage of these tensions to win the first Cold War. *** Competition over winning China was at the heart of the Cold War. Presidents Truman and Eisenhower used the Nationalist blockade, the Taiwan Patrol Force, the strategic embargo, and a China 'differential'—maximizing transportation costs of Chinese imported goods via the Trans-Siberian Railway—to push Russia and China closer together and thus create a split. It was then President Johnson's strategy to use the Vietnam War to break apart the Sino-Soviet alliance completely, which resulted in war between Russia and China on 2 March 1969. After President Nixon 'flipped' China in 1972 and President Carter and Deng Xiaoping allied more closely by opening full diplomatic relations on 1 January 1979, the U.S. government used high-technology dual-use transfers to help build up a strong China, both economically and militarily. This technology transfer strategy put additional pressure on an already overextended Soviet military. As James Lilly noted in 1981, China tied up '25% of Soviet armed forces.'2 With American technical assistance, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) was able to make enormous strides during the 1980s. But after the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, Beijing had no choice but to transition away from buying Western military equipment to purchasing Soviet-era military technology. In 1992, China bought the Varyag aircraft carrier from the newly independent Ukraine; renamed Liaoning, it became the first of what would become a small fleet of Chinese aircraft carriers. But as the Russian-Ukrainian War has shown, the Soviet-era military technology that China so eagerly purchased is far inferior to those Western high-tech exports. Furthermore, a new era of cheap anti-ship missiles could soon make China's 400-ship surface fleet obsolete. *** China has long been considered to be one of the world's greatest continental powers. The Great Wall is often cited as proof of China's traditional focus on land power. Chinese warfare was also mainly land warfare; Sun Tzu's Art of War discussed how river currents could impact military strategy, but there was no mention of warfare on oceans. Throughout China's long history, previous attempts to become a sea power all failed. During 1405–1435, Ming China ruled as the supreme sea power over Asia. Ming Treasure Fleets reached as far as East Africa. But in 1449, the Ming suffered a disastrous land defeat at the hands of their erstwhile enemies, the Mongols. This forced a reallocation of military resources away from the sea to the land. In a similar manner to the early Ming, China's shift from being a land power to a rising sea power could well be short-lived. In response to Beijing's aggression, many of China's maritime neighbors are increasing cooperation with Japan, India, Australia, and the United States—the so-called 'Quad'—to act as a potent counterweight to Beijing. Plus, with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and possible knock-on effects of Western sanctions against Russia throughout Central Asia, military pressure on China's western borders might soon increase, which could then force Beijing to shift away from the sea and back to the land. *** The world's attention is currently focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but on the horizon it is still China that looms as potentially the most important, as well as perhaps the most dangerous, rising power. But China is facing a monumental decision: should it continue to help Russia or take advantage of Russia's unexpected weakness? If Xi Jinping backs Putin fully, Western sanctions, tariffs, and even a commercial blockade might be in China's near-term future. This could derail Beijing's hope of becoming perhaps the most important member of the twenty-first century global economy. It could also disrupt critical oil and food supplies, both of which China is now dependent on for its sheer survival. Furthermore, Beijing leaders say they want to retake Taiwan, but China's 'territorial integrity' claim is a lie, as Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has now pointed out by daring Xi Jinping to take back Russian lands lost by China during the 19th century. Lai recently stated: 'If it is for the sake of territorial integrity, why doesn't [the PRC] take back the lands occupied by Russia that were signed over in the treaty of Aigun?' Putin desperately needs trade with China to fight the war in Ukraine, so this could be Beijing's last best chance to reclaim China's 'lost territories' in Outer Mongolia, Tannu Tuva, Central Asia, and especially Russia's Far Eastern province in Siberia. Just last year, PRC maps of the Russian far east called Vladivostok and Khabarovsk by their Chinese names, which are 'Haishenwai' (海參崴) and 'Boli' (玻璃). This suggests territorial revanchism is still alive and well among certain groups in China. *** Xi Jinping must decide whether to back Putin fully or to become more deeply integrated into a maritime global order based on multinational organizations upholding international legal norms. Russia and China have never had a sustainable relationship. Their cooperation has always been opportunistic, and therefore temporary. China's economic and strategic interests lie with the West as they did under Deng Xiaoping, not hooking its wagon to a failing Russia as Mao Zedong did, only to end up going to war when the thieve's bargain very predictably unraveled. Bruce A. Elleman recently retired as a professor of maritime history at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island. This opinion summarizes his forthcoming book 'The ABCs of Cold War History.' 1 Deng Xiaoping, Speech to the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, April 10, 1974, CO-34 General 9/1/77-12/12//78, Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. 2 James Lilly, Memorandum to MGEN Robert L.

The Flying Molotov Cocktails Burning The Enemy In Chasiv Yar – Op...	In the pitch-black night along the Ukrainian front, soldiers from the 23rd Mechanized Brigade's drone unit, Yasni Ochi ('Clear Eyes'), engage in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. Their weapon of choice is a first-person view (FPV) drone, used to hunt Russian soldiers who dare to venture into the open around Chasiv Yar. As dusk settles, intelligence gathered by DJI Mavic drones and reconnaissance drones helps guide the night bombing missions. These aerial scouts have tracked Russian troop movements, pinpointing their attempts to establish new positions and dig protective trenches. With nightfall, the Russians hide in their dugouts, unaware that shortly, Ukrainian drones will drop bombs on their positions. As the soldiers drive to their position on the front, the driver turns off all the vehicle’s lights. Without night vision, he drives in complete darkness. Nothing is visible around us. At some point, it seems like we will crash into something, but it feels as if the driver is navigating solely from memory of the roads. As the van gets closer to the drop-off point, houses in the area are burning, recently shelled by the Russians. In a flurry of movement, they disembark, unload their gear, and dash for cover amidst active enemy fire. The van quickly speeds away, leaving us in the heart of the front.

Source: David Kirichenko Once underground, the soldiers wait for things to quiet down before taking their gear outside, using red lights as they begin setting up their operations. When the moment is right, they emerge, bathed in the soft red glow of their lights, to establish their operational lifeline—a Starlink connection and antenna. Once established, they receive their night’s objectives: a list of targets identified by reconnaissance teams. The soldiers begin equipping the FPV drone with night vision and then attach the first batch of explosives to the drone. One of the soldiers in the dugout takes the drone outside to deploy it. Yevhenii, whose callsign is 'Bird,' dons his immersive goggles and takes control. 'We can only stop their assaults and hold our lines with our drones,' said Yevhenii. With a gentle hum, the drone takes flight, becoming an extension of Yevhenii's will as it races toward Russian positions. The assault is relentless. The drone flies back and forth, attacking with precision. Volodymyr, known by his callsign 'Panda,' rushes to retrieve the drone once it lands, reloading it with fresh projectiles. The team quickly transitions to attaching bottles of flammable liquid to the drone. The drone drops a bottle, creating what looks like a 'flying Molotov cocktail,' forcing Russian soldiers from their hideouts. Within an hour, five enemy soldiers scatter in panic across Chasiv Yar. Quickly, the team rearms the drone with mini-bombs. Yevhenii, displaying remarkable skill, pursues the fleeing Russians. With a slight touch on the controller, he releases a bomb, scoring a direct hit. The dugout erupts in cheers of 'Yes, yes!' as they witness the effectiveness of their operation. One Russian soldier, after being hit, stood up and kept running for a while longer, prompting the Ukrainian soldiers to comment that he was running on adrenaline, like a headless chicken. They continued to fly back and forth, loading more bombs on the FPV drone and hitting Russian positions. Yevhenii from Yasni Ochi flying an FPV drone conducting combat operations. Source: David Kirichenko Between drone flights, I asked Yevhenii to share a few words for the American public. 'We are trying our best. We cherish and value the help that America is giving us. We are still holding on,' he said. As morning breaks, it's time for me to leave. A supply van arrives with a fresh stock of bombs, food, and water for the soldiers. The driver, hyper-alert, speeds around the corner. Before I can fully board, we're already in reverse, racing away from the front. The landscape we speed through is apocalyptic. Smoke rises from houses still smoldering from the night’s artillery barrage. Explosions punctuate the air. The driver, hunched forward, his face nearly touching the steering wheel, navigates a deadly obstacle course—watching for land mines and enemy FPV drones as we drive toward safety. As we speed through the bumpy roads, the driver says, 'driving so fast means we destroy our vehicles quickly.' The drone unit commander Heorhii Volkov of Yasni Ochi praised Yevhenii's abilities the following day to me: 'He is always critical of himself, trying to learn from his mistakes and improve with each mission. He is eager to grow as a pilot.' The demands of war push these soldiers to their limits. Due to personnel shortages, they often remain in position for days without relief. One soldier, known as 'Joker,' holds the unit record: eight consecutive days of FPV drone combat, snatching brief moments of sleep between missions. Tragically, I was recently informed that Joker was killed in action. He was only 20 years old. His commander, Heorhii Volkov commented that in the last 8 months of his work, Joker was responsible for killing or injuring more than 200 Russian soldiers. For now, Ukraine holds the line in Chasiv Yar largely due to the work of drone units like Yasni Ochi, whose efforts prevent relentless Russian assaults from breaking through. Yet, relying solely on the bravery and ingenuity of its soldiers can sustain the defense only for so long without the raw firepower and weaponry that Ukraine needs from the West. Back at base, Serhii—known by his callsign 'Fly' and the leader of the nighttime drone bombing operations—shared his perspective on the uphill battle they face: 'The Russians have significantly more artillery and effective aviation,' he explained, frustration clear in his voice. 'Chasiv Yar has many buildings, and the Russians charge in waves every day. They come, gather their men, and dig deep into the basements. Slowly, they take more and more ground,' Serhii emphasized. Serhii firmly believes that with enough shells and rockets, Ukraine could change the course of the war. 'The West only gives us enough supplies and weapons to remain on the defensive,' he said, pointing out that their current resources allow them to hold the line but not to push forward. Rising from his chair, as if to underscore his point, Serhii made his message clear: 'Europe and the U.S. must give us what we need to win. We're protecting them from Russia too.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9scxsfXy0ZSQNY	2024-10-30T18:18:15-07:00	
What ‘Capitalism’ Really Means – OpEd	By Owen Ashworth Grace Blakeley is a self-described socialist economist and author in the UK, appearing on shows like Politics Live, JOE Politics, and Novara Media. Grace throws down the proverbial gauntlet to self-described capitalists who often find themselves falling over their own logic. This should not be surprising since the 'capitalists' that she often debates usually have a conservative worldview that is littered with its own inconsistencies, so socialists tend to have a field day. It’s worth noting to an American audience that 'conservative' in the UK is wildly different to conservative in the US; UK conservatives tend to be even more statist than US conservatives so when a socialist argues with them, you can visibly witness conservatives realize that they are being inconsistent and flail. Unless Austrian economics is embraced by more conservatives, they risk the very real growth of a radically socialist movement as individuals like Grace gain momentum. Grace comments in a recent video: Capitalism is not, as we’re often led to believe, a free-market system. We have this view of capitalism that is nice, decentralized system where markets decide who gets what… Capitalism means more markets… Capitalism is actually a highly centralized system that rests not just on markets but also on centralized planning—an authoritarian, hierarchical, oligarchic system where a few people at the very top of society decide who gets what. This definition is a thoroughly incoherent way of defining capitalism. Grace believes that the system we have right now is actual capitalism but parts of her definition could easily be applied to other systems that are resolutely different. Nazi Germany was extremely oligarchic and authoritarian with a few people at the top deciding for the rest of their society how they conduct their lives. The Soviet Union was a highly centralized system that rested on central planning accompanied by a veneer of markets as they attempted to use Western prices in their own planning system. The fact that you can use her definition to describe multiple different countries with very different shades of centralized planning should be a red flag indicating the dubious nature of the definition. There must be a characteristic of capitalism that makes it unique. Ludwig von Mises says this about the term 'capitalism' in Human Action: The system of free enterprise has been dubbed capitalism in order to deprecate and to smear it. However, this term can be considered very pertinent. It refers to the most characteristic feature of the system, its main eminence, viz. the role the notion of capital plays in its conduct. (emphasis added) Capitalism is an appropriate name because it gives the reader a very big hint as to how it is unique. It is characterized by the private ownership of capital and private ownership, coming from Lockean homesteading principles, not from state coercion and force. Accompany that with a monetary unit that is valued because others subjectively value it (like gold), not because the state backs it, then you have the formula for economic calculation. Economic calculation involves the entrepreneur arranging resources towards the production of goods that either will be used in production of consumer goods or consumer goods themselves (i.e., the arrangement of scarce resources to socially-valuable ends). Rothbard writes in Man, Economy and State: With the nature-given elements limited by his environment, and his labor restricted both by its available supply and its disutility, there is only one way by which man can increase his production of consumers’ goods per unit of time—by increasing the quantity of capital goods. Individuals realized—within this environment that was fostered in the late 1700s—that by accumulating capital, they could produce vastly more quantities of food and other goods than ever before which, in turn, released them to pursue other ends like an adventure into the innovation of transportation and manufacturing that further reduced the amount of time people had to spend in agriculture. This development of innovation and the realization that one need not spend all your time working on food and shelter can be found at the feet of capital accumulation and that is what defines capitalism. This is the uniqueness of capitalism. Grace may quibble that these features of capitalism exist in almost every nation around the world, which is true to varying extents, but that does not equal a factual statement that it is a capitalist system. There is one massive elephant in the room—the state. The state necessarily disrupts this delicate process of capital accumulation, the division of labor, and the workings of a common medium of exchange. This disruption prevents the accumulation of wealth by individuals who have never before had the opportunity to acquire such wealth, thus creating many of the social ills and centralization that Grace correctly identifies. Using one of Grace’s examples may be illustrative—Boeing. Grace uses Boeing as a shining example of the worst aspects of capitalism. She says, 'They were on a drive to increase profits, minimize their costs, making big planes was going to be more profitable… pushed it through without following the safety protocols.' Generally, individuals or firms want to make the most profit they can as they think that the service or good they provide is valuable to other people subjectively, otherwise they would not sell it, so this is not abnormal in a capitalist system, but here’s where Grace correctly highlights the problem: 'Boeing was being regulated by a unit of the FAA that sat inside Boeing.' The difference between a capitalist system in the way described by Mises and Rothbard and the real situation for this example is that there was zero respect for the ultimate property right—life. Capitalism is built upon private property rights and they stem from the individual. No one owns anyone else and it is objective that the individual owns himself. In the case of Boeing, the state intervened, completely disregarded property rights, and made sure that Boeing avoided any criminal charges directly from the families of the victims. It is absurd to claim that Boeing could only attempt to avoid responsibility in a capitalist society built on private property. In a truly capitalistic system, there would be harsh consequences for the decision to disregard consumer safety, the state prevented these consequences. 'These catastrophes were a joint venture between the US government and this company, Boeing.' I agree with Grace, but this is statism, cronyism, or interventionism, not capitalism. The latter respects everyone’s private property rights, the former desecrates them. Grace does admit that this came from a toxic fusion of big government and a private company so we can lay the blame at big government just as much as Boeing. However, her conclusion is that we cannot trust those at the top (i.e., those at the top of the hierarchy in companies) to be held accountable by the market or the government. She proposes a supposed third way like that of the Lucas plan for Lucas Aerospace in 1976. This plan involved the management of the company asking workers for suggestions on what they should do to prevent layoffs like switching production to more socially-beneficial products that perhaps would have been more profitable, thus preventing layoffs and even growing the company. This was rejected by management and the government. Would it have provided more value for people? There is no way of knowing; it was never implemented. However, one can admit that the government has been intervening so much in the economy since the end of World War II, diverting resources away from potentially socially-beneficial ends, did harm workers. The government created a situation where it would eventually start running out of funds since it fostered an environment that would collapse the economy, while building up huge companies by subsidizing them, and creating harm to workers when the house of cards caved in. This is an example of statism, not capitalism. A third way is not needed when government has wrecked a route that already exists. Grace’s critique of capitalism is based on a definition that is incoherent. The rot sets in from there as the rest of the logic she walks through is based on wobbly foundations. There seems to be a false dichotomy existing within Grace’s thinking where the state and private interests collude to rig the political system, resulting in a lack of responsibility for the actions that these crony capitalists consciously take. This would mean we cannot trust the state, but more importantly, that we cannot trust the market, to provide this accountability. The elephant in the room here is the state itself. Grace decries centralization, which is a product of the state, but blames capitalism. She also argues that the state fails to hold capitalists accountable, but seems to prefer more statism as opposed to a free market. The existence of the state itself invites those parts of human nature that manifest corruption, immorality, and profligacy. Smashing the leviathan state takes away much of the potential for corrupt laws and regulations to be hoisted upon us. Grace’s diagnosis of social ills is not too objectionable, but her medicine leaves a lot to be desired.

How Effective Is The Latest China-India Border Patrol Agreement? ...	By Zhou Chao Indian media has recently reported that the Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that China and India have reached an agreement on issues concerning border areas. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on October 21 that Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other, reaching the agreement 'on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas, leading to disengagement and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020'. On the same day, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also stated in an interview with New Delhi Television that the situation along the China-India border has returned to its 2020 status and that both sides have completed the disengagement. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has also confirmed at a regular press conference that the two countries have reached a solution regarding border issues and that China will work with India to implement the agreement. In response, some commentaries in China pointed out that the achievement of this agreement signifies a major improvement in China-India relations. Relevant analyses suggest that India has a high economic dependence on China, and since 2020, a series of measures targeting Chinese companies and capital have harmed India’s own economic interests. Additionally, India faces various disputes and conflicts with the West on issues such as human rights, and it needs to improve its relationship with China and strengthen cooperation to cope with Western pressure. While these analyses have their merits, their projection of the effectiveness of the latest China-India border patrol agreement may be overly optimistic, as the actual impact of it is likely to be relatively limited. First of all, from India's perspective, its basic positioning as a regional hegemon means that it is unlikely to see substantial easing in its relationship with China. In previous analyses, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan noted that the future world will exhibit a situation of coexisting regional hegemons, with India being the undisputed dominant power in the South Asian subcontinent. In terms of India’s strategic understanding and positioning, it seeks to maintain decisive authority over South Asian affairs (primarily involving India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.), comprehensively strengthen its influence over Southeast Asian matters (including Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam), gradually expand its voice in Central Asian affairs, and, on this basis, enhance its control over global issues. This has been India's consistent strategic positioning and aspiration. However, in key interest regions such as the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, China maintains considerable influence. Furthermore, in the Indian Ocean region, after years of sustained efforts, China has significantly expanded its influence in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, which has made India feel increasingly uncomfortable. To consolidate and strengthen its position as a regional hegemon, India feels that it must effectively diminish or even expel China's actual influence in order to feel truly secure. This necessity also determines that, in the long term (10-15 years), Indian nationalism will primarily target China rather than other countries. The border issue is one of the focal points of the structural conflict in China-India relations, but not the entirety of it. Thus, a reduction in border tensions may not necessarily lead to sustained improvement in bilateral relations. Additionally, in recent years, India has increasingly intervened in territorial and maritime sovereignty disputes surrounding China to strengthen its position in the confrontation with it. This has been achieved through military cooperation, equipment transfers, and other means, as well as through escalating its involvement in Taiwan-related matters. Recently, India also allowed the Taiwanese authorities to establish a third representative office in India. Based on India's understanding of its strategic position and its persistent strategic aspirations, these actions that challenge China's core national interests are unlikely to see substantial changes in the future. This further complicates the possibility of a meaningful easing in China-India relations. Secondly, strengthening cooperation with the West will be a long-term focus of India's foreign relations. In the lead-up to and following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western countries have made significant investments to draw India into their efforts against China and Russia, and the conflict has further accelerated this process. Through exchanges between governments and businesses, the West has continuously enhanced cooperation with India in various areas, including technology transfer, scientific collaboration, and financial support, with the U.S. government even greenlighting the transfer of crucial aircraft engine technology. The U.S. has also led a group of Western countries in gradually strengthening cooperation with India in key mineral sectors. As India deepens its collaboration with the West, even in military areas where India has long relied on Russia, U.S. and French military equipment is beginning to gradually replace Russian-made equipment in the Indian armed forces. The influx of Western technology, businesses, and capital has provided tangible benefits to India, evident in several surges in the Indian stock market. While U.S. and Canadian politicians do exert pressure on India regarding human rights, the West generally downplays significant incidents, such as the Sikh assassination incidents. This situation is underpinned by India's insistence on a confrontational stance against China, which aligns with its strategic positioning and needs. As India continues to strengthen its cooperation with the West, this dynamic makes substantial improvement in India-China relations unlikely. Thirdly, India's economic and trade dependence on China should not be overstated. In recent years, Western economic and trade cooperation with India has become increasingly prominent. According to a report from the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) published in August, while China remains India's largest trading partner for the 2023-2024 fiscal year, the United States has surpassed China as India’s top trading partner from January to June 2024, with total trade reaching USD 62.5 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.3%. Furthermore to the significant and growing trade deficit with China, India continues to express strong criticism of its economic and trade relations with China. India's economic ties with China are not solely advantageous for Chinese companies. As the degree of competition in China’s domestic market deepens and profit growth slows, particularly amid weakening economic and consumption trends in China, the Indian market with its younger demographic and increasing consumption capacity, has become increasingly attractive to Chinese firms. Notably, despite facing multiple challenges since 2020, companies like Xiaomi have remained committed to the Indian market. While Indian businesses rely on China for raw materials, parts, and certain technologies, Chinese companies also recognize the value and necessity of the Indian market. Final analysis conclusion: The recent agreement and implementation of the China-India border patrol protocol will indeed help to ease tensions along the border and improve bilateral relations. However, based on the various reasons mentioned earlier, the extent of this improvement is limited, and its duration may not be long-lasting. For Chinese companies and capital, there may be a window of opportunity in the Indian market. However, for trade and economic projects that require long-term commitment and significant investment, the Chinese side will still need to remain cautious.

Virtuous, Smug And Venal: British Electoral Interference In The U...	The British cannot help themselves. They are a meddling island people who conquered huge swathes of the earth in a fictional fit of absentmindedness and remain haughty for having done so. They have fought more countries they can name, engaged in more wars they care to remember. They have overthrown elected rulers and sabotaged incipient democracies. In the twilight of empire, Britain sought, with heavy hearted reluctance, to become wise Greek advisors to their clumsy Roman replacement: the US Imperium. US politics, to that end, remain a matter of enormous importance to the UK. Interfering in US elections is a habit that dies hardest of all. In 1940, with the relentless march of Nazi Germany’s war machine across Europe, British intelligence officers based in New York and Washington had one primary objective: to aid the election of politicians favouring US intervention on the side of Britain. As Steven Usdin noted in 2017, they also had two other attached goals: 'defeat those who advocated neutrality, and silence or destroy the reputations of American isolationists they deemed a menace to British security.' Much of this is also covered in Thomas E. Mahl’s 1998 study Desperate Deception: British Covert Operations in the United States, 1939-44, which was initially scoffed at for giving much credence to Britain’s role in creating the office of Coordinator of Information, an entity that became the forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services, itself the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency. Mahl was, it was revealed in 1999, on to something. In a dull yet revealing study written at the end of World War II documenting the activities of the British Security Coordination office, an outfit established by Canadian spymaster Sir William S. Stephenson with the approval of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, activities of interference are described on a scale to make any modern Russian operative sigh with longing envy. Those roped into the endeavour were a rather colourful lot: the classicist Gilbert Highet, future novelist of dark children’s novels extraordinaire Roald Dahl, and editor of the trade journal Western Hemisphere Weekly Bulletin, Tom Hill. During Stephenson’s tenure, the office used subversion, sabotage, disinformation and blackmail with relish to influence political outcomes and malign the America Firsters. (How marvellous contemporary.) It cultivated relations with such figures as the 1940 Republican nominee for president, Wendell Willkie. It also offered gobbets of slanted information to media outlets, often produced verbatim, by suborned pro-interventionist hacks. In October 1941, BSC provided FDR a map purporting to detail a plan by Nazi Germany to seize South America, a document the president gratefully waved at a news conference. (The study claims its authenticity, though doubts remain.) The Democrats are currently receiving the moral and physical aid of volunteers from the British Labour Party, who are throwing in hours and tears for a Kamala Harris victory in various battleground states. Their presence was revealed in a now deleted social media post from Labour’s head of operations, Sofia Patel, noting that somewhere in the order of 100 current and former party staff were heading to the US prior to polling day to campaign in North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. On the other side of the political aisle, Nigel Farage, now Reform UK leader and member for Clacton-on-Sea, has spent much time openly campaigning for Donald Trump. Hardly surprising that he should complain about UK Labour doing what he has been doing habitually since 2016. Walking political disaster and former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss, historically the shortest occupant in that office, also put in an appearance at the 2024 Republican National Convention to offer what limited support she could. Trump’s campaign team has taken umbrage at the efforts of Labour Party staffers, enough to file a complaint with the US Federal Election Commission (FEC). This is not small beer: any opportunity to allege an unfavourable distortion in votes will be pounced upon. In an October 21 letter to the FEC’s acting general counsel, Lisa J. Stevenson, Trump’s attorney sought 'an immediate investigation into blatant foreign interference in the 2024 Presidential Election'. This took 'the form of apparent illegal foreign national contributions made by the Labour Party of the United Kingdom and accepted by Harris for President, the principal campaign committee of Vice President Kamala Harris.' The claim makes mention of another effort in the 2016 elections, when the Australian Labor Party furnished the Bernie 2016 campaign representing Senator Bernie Sanders with 'delegates to be placed with the campaign'. The ALP covered flights and provided participants with a daily stipend. The FEC subsequently found this to be a provision of campaign services to the Sanders campaign, and determined that it, and the ALP, had violated the foreign national prohibitions. Each received civil penalties of $14,500. Patel’s announcement, the claim goes on to argue, seems to emulate the overly enthusiastic ALP model. As head of operations, 'her LinkedIn posts indicate that she is speaking as a representative of the party.' Her posts supported 'a reasonable inference that the Labour Party will finance at least travel and facilitate room and board.' As regulations stand, FEC rules permit the participation of foreign nationals in campaign activities as long as they remain uncompensated volunteers. If one accepts the narrow reading of the laws according to the US District Court for the District of Columbia in Bluman v FEC, contributions must be of a non-financial nature. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that party staff have travelled to the US to campaign for Harris 'in their own spare time', staying with other volunteers in the process. By no means is it clear that this did not involve a financial contribution. Previous public efforts to sway election results in the US by British well-wishers hoping to test the waters have not ended well. In 2004, The Guardian newspaper launched Operation Clark County, a smug and foolish effort to dissuade undecided voters in the swing state of Ohio from voting for the Republican incumbent, George W. Bush. The response was one of unmitigated, volcanic fury. A letter from Wading River, NY captured the mood: 'I don’t give a rat’s ass if our election is going to have an effect on your worthless little life. If you want to have a meaningful election in your crappy little island full of shitty food and yellow teeth, then maybe you should try not to sell your sovereignty out to Brussels and Berlin, dipshit.' The letter is coarsening in its finality. 'Oh yeah – and brush your goddamned teeth, you filthy animals.' Starmer, beware.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfX70vazu9scx-Jwg1rdqYt	2024-10-30T18:08:55-07:00	
Will Tuesday’s Vote Counts Be Another Sham Biden-Harris Statistic...	If Kamala Harris wins the presidential election on Tuesday, Americans will be told that the final vote count is a sacred number that was practically handed down from Mt. Sinai engraved on a stone tablet. Any American who casts doubt on Harris’s victory will be vilified like one of those January 6, 2021 protestors sent to prison for 'parading without a permit' in the US Capitol. Actually, anyone who doubted the 2020 election results was being prominently denounced as 'traitors' even before the Capitol Clash. But is there any reason to expect the final vote count in next week’s presidential election to be more honest than any other number that the Biden-Harris administration jiggered in the last four years? Biden, Harris, and their media allies endlessly assured Americans that the national crime rate had fallen sharply since Biden took office. That statistical scam was produced by the equivalent of disregarding all the votes in California and New York. FBI crime data simply excluded many of the nation’s largest cities until a revision earlier this month revealed that violent crime had risen nationwide. Deceitful national crime data helped cover-up the disastrous impact of open border policies. The Biden-Harris administration did backflips to avoid disclosing the true size of the surge of illegal immigrants from early 2021 onwards. Kamala Harris did zombie-like face plants in recent interviews when elbowed for honest answers. In the same way that another surge of unverified mail-in ballots may determine the 2024 election, Biden manipulated the number of illegal aliens by using his presidential parole power to entitle more than a million people from Haiti, Venezuela, Cubans, and other countries to legally enter and stay in America on his own decree. The Biden administration even provided a vast secretive program to fly favored foreign nationals into select airports late at night where their arrival would occur under the radar. Some states will officially count mail-in ballots that arrive well after Election Day even if the envelopes have no postmark. This is the same 'late doesn’t matter' standard that Biden used to vindicate the $42 billion provided by his 2021 infrastructure law to boost broadband access in rural America—which Uncle Joe said was 'not unlike what Roosevelt did with electricity.' Unlike the Tennessee Valley Authority, Biden’s broadband program has nothing to show since it delivered faster internet access to almost no one. The same default occurred with the Inflation Reduction Act’s alleged showpiece achievement—42,000 new charging stations around the nation for electric vehicles. But that program produced more presidential applause lines than EV refills. As of March, $7.5 billion in federal spending had only produced seven new charging stations nationwide. How many votes will Harris lose on Tuesday because Americans remain outraged at the inflation that has slashed the dollar’s value by more than 20 percent since Biden took office? There would be far more popular fury if the feds had not deceived Americans about the full financial damage that Washington inflicted. The official inflation statistic doesn’t count soaring mortgage and housing costs—which is akin to excluding any state south of the Mason-Dixon Line from the national vote tally. Larry Summers, Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary, said that if the feds today used the same inflation gauges used in the 1970s, Biden’s peak inflation would have been 18 percent, twice as high as the reported number. Tens of millions of voters will not be obliged to show any identification before voting in this election: they are presumed trustworthy regardless of zero verification. But this is the same standard that the Biden-Harris administration uses for not disclosing its most controversial policies to American citizens. People will vote next week without knowing the facts behind whistleblower allegations on Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz’s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, to Secret Service failures to prevent Trump assassination attempts, and the brazen details of the Censorship Industrial Complex. In Washington, politicians feel entitled to applause for any grandiose promise—regardless of their failure to deliver. Similarly, politicians and election officials promising that the presidential vote count will be accurate and reflect 'the will of the people' is far more important than tabulating the actual ballots. Will the unmanned ballot boxes in big cities be stuffed with bogus ballots the same way a politician jams endless balderdash into his campaign speeches? As pundit Stephen Kruiser quipped, 'the clothing donation boxes that were all over my old neighborhood in Los Angeles were probably more secure than the ballot drop boxes.' Of course, if Trump wins, then all the forces of decency must instantly shift to the other side of the barricades. Any electoral victory by Trump will be illegitimate because of politically incorrect comments made by speakers at Trump campaign rallies. As in 2017, if Trump wins, every 'true patriot'—or at least every true progressive—will be honor-bound to join The Resistance™.

Singapore Stuck Between A Shipping Hub And A Hard Place – Analysi...	By Jean-Paul Rodrigue Singapore’s prominence in global maritime shipping is no accident. Located at the entrance to the Strait of Malacca, Singapore’s geographical advantages were just as critical during the days of the British Empire as they are now — allowing it to be a significant trade platform along major shipping routes. For over half a century, Singapore has remained economically open and politically stable, despite changing economic and geopolitical conditions. This stability enabled the growth of substantial port activity, with over 95 per cent of traffic involving cargo transiting through, rather than being destined for, Singapore. Over decades, Singapore has become Southeast Asia’s dominant transshipment hub — a small yet crucial link in global maritime networks. The growth in container port traffic clearly reflects this trend. In 1990, Singapore handled 5.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units, a volume that increased to 17 million in 2000, 28.4 million in 2010 and 39 million in 2023, making it the second busiest port in the world. During this period, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) became the world’s largest container terminal operator. Starting its international expansion in 1996, PSA now operates 60 terminals in 2024. From 2018 to 2022, container traffic barely changed, suggesting that Singapore may have reached its potential as a hub. During this period, transshipment activities handled by the Port of Singapore faced growing competition from nearby hubs like Tanjung Pelepas in Johor, Malaysia, which has effectively competed and gained a share of the business. Transshipment is a footloose activity driven by the decisions of carriers and terminal operators. While operating as a terminal operator offers competitive advantages, Singapore remains vulnerable to the vagaries of global economic and political events as it generates limited local traffic. During the financial crisis of 2008–2009, Singapore experienced an annual decline of 13.5 per cent in container traffic as global demand slowed due to financial stress, largely caused by asset inflation in North American real estate. Singapore faced further challenges in 2015 and 2016 as East Asia became a more mature hub for offshoring and more direct shipping services emerged. This led to an 8.7 per cent decline in transshipment traffic between 2014 and 2015, with limited recovery in 2016. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in a decline in activity in Singapore, but the surge in traffic in 2021 and 2022 did not significantly impact activity in the city-state. The focus has now shifted to direct services, prioritising movement of full containers from East Asia to Europe and North America while returning empty containers back to East Asia as soon as possible. The Red Sea crisis in 2023 marked a shift in container transshipment for Singapore. As ships got hijacked or damaged along the Red Sea, many shipping lines decided to bypass the area, choosing the Cape Route around Africa instead. While the Suez Route between Shanghai and Western Europe takes about 27 sailing days, the Cape Route requires about 10 additional sailing days. The additional containership capacity ordered in 2021 and 2022 was utilised to offset the longer travel times caused by the detour, rather than for expanding operations. Though the crisis was far from Singapore, its consequences are coming closer to home. The Cape deviation undermined transshipment activities in major hubs such as Dubai, Port Said and Gioia Tauro, which suddenly found themselves in a more peripheral location. The outcome was a partial shift in transshipment activities downstream to hubs such as Tanger Med and Algeciras — at the entrance of the Mediterranean — and upstream to hubs such as Singapore. For the latter, traffic surged 6.1 per cent between January and July 2024 compared to the previous year, adding 1.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units. In this new but temporary context, Singapore became one of the last Asian transshipment hubs with low deviation on the Cape-expanded East Asia–Europe route. This geopolitically derived situation conveys a temporary advantage for Singapore, increasing its centrality and container traffic. But this short-term benefit involves a long-term economic challenge. From a maritime supply chain perspective, East Asia is now significantly further away from Europe. A similar event happened between 1967 and 1975 when the Suez Canal was closed after the onset of the Six-Day War. At that time, supply chains were less integrated and China played a marginal role in global trade. Currently, longer lead times and geopolitical instability are prompting large retailers and manufacturers to reassess their sourcing and procurement strategies. The trend toward ‘friendshoring’ could also reduce trade and transshipment activity for Singapore. There remains significant inertia, particularly concerning European supply chains involving Chinese trade. China has strong incentives to maintain its export-oriented manufacturing sector and related trade routes, which benefits Singapore. Although the current port congestion may be temporary, Singapore’s prospects as a transshipment hub remain solid — provided the Red Sea crisis is resolved in a way that secures the long-term stability of this shipping lane. But if instability persists, a global shift may unfold, one where East and Southeast Asia are further away from major European and Mediterranean markets. Singapore’s geographical advantages remain significant and the recent development of its Tuas mega container port facility is a strong indication of the city-state’s goal of capturing growth and retaining its role as a major transshipment hub.

Kremlin Backs Revival Of Tsarist-Era Anti-Semitic Union Of The Ru...	In October, two developments on the extreme right of the Russian political spectrum occurred that cast a dark shadow on the country’s future. In the first, the Russian Community, an extreme right-wing Russian ethno-nationalist group (see EDM, October 15) has assumed a leading role in a pogrom against Roma people, sometimes known as gypsies, that began in the city of Chelyabinsk in advance of National Unity Day on November 4. The Russian Community has intimidated local officials, who appear to be afraid of taking concerted action against the perpetrators (Kavkaz, October 27). Secondly, the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church (MP ROC) have made the fateful decision to support the revival of the Union of the Russian People, a radical monarchist party notorious for organizing the Black Hundreds and their anti-Semitic pogroms in the last years of the Russian Empire (Tsargrad, October 24). By once again lending credibility to Russian nationalist extremism in this way, the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate have made it more likely that Russians will join such groups, convinced that they have are doing precisely what the Putin regime wants. To the extent that this happens—and there is already evidence that this is occurring—said Russian groups are likely to launch ever more violent attacks on minorities. In the absence of state protection, members of these victimized groups are likely to take measures in self-defense, with the collective result being a further destabilization of the situation in Russia (Window on Eurasia, September 27; EDM, October 3; Kavkaz, October 9). At a congress on October 24, more than 1,000 activists, Orthodox churchmen, and prominent government officials met in Moscow’s prominent Christ the Savior Cathedral to announce the 'restoration' of the Union of the Russian People (Tsargrad, October24,26;rusk.ru, October 25). Among the most distinguished speakers were Duma deputy head Pyotr Tolstoy, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova, Duma deputy Aleksandr Borodai, and prominent actor (and former ROC MP priest) Ivan Okhlobystin. Their participation underscores the extent to which this revived party enjoys support of both the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate, as none of these individuals would have taken part if that were not the case. Konstantin Malofeyev delivered the keynote address. He has frequently been referred to as the 'Orthodox oligarch' for his support of Russian Orthodox and nationalist causes and is considered to be the main force behind the Union of the Russian People. Malofeyev told the congress that, Our ideals and values are simple: Russia is a great Orthodox state-civilization. The Russian people [are] the state-forming [people; this phrase is used to denote ethnic Russians as the core of any Russian state] and on its well-being depends the well-being of all the citizens of our country. The foundation of the people is a strong, traditional, multi-child family, the support of which is the most important obligation of the state (Telegram/@kvmalofeev, October 24). Malofeyev further suggested that 'the overwhelming majority of Russian people' support these ideas. 'We are the voice of the Russian Orthodox majority. The revived Union of the Russian People. All who are not indifferent to the future of Russia should join the Society and its Russian Militia' (for more on these 'self-defense squads,' which also partook in the October 24 session, see Telegram/@russian_druzhina, October 29). Both Malofeyev and the most prominent speakers from the Russian government devoted most of their attention to combatting the West and defeating Ukraine. Other speakers, including the governors of Kurgan and Kaluga oblasts, Vadim Shumkov and Vladislav Shapsha, respectively, focused on domestic affairs, specifically the handling of minorities—the area in which the Union of the Russian People is most likely to impact (Stoletie, October 28). Shumkov and Shapsha called for concerted efforts to Russify immigrants and minorities and the expel immigrants that fail to do so. These calls leave little room for the rights, linguistic or otherwise, nominally enjoyed by the quarter of the Russian Federation’s population that is not ethnically Russian. Unsurprisingly, many non-Russians living in the Federation view such attitudes as a threat to their existence and are being radicalized as a result. This trend has intensified since Putin began his expanded invasion of Ukraine, though it reached new heights after the terrorist attack on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall last April (see Svoboda, September 6; Idel Realii, September 8; Telegram/@Free Nations League, September 6; Indigenous Russia, September 9 [1], [2]). More thoughtful Russians, such as Moscow commentator Viktor Frolinsky, are also alarmed by what the revival of the Union of the Russian People means. Commenting on the October 24 meeting, Frolinsky argued that Malofeyev’s Union 'is designed to inherit all the worst in the Black Hundred movement of pre-revolutionary Russia: Ideological obscurantism, aggression and servility to those in power' (v Krizis, October 25). Frolinsky points out that the word 'Tsargrad' that the revived Union of Russian People has chosen to attach to its name is indicative of dangers ahead. According to Frolinsky, Tsargrad 'refers to imperial dreams of [Russian conquest of] Constantinople and the chauvinistic organization' of Aleksandr Dubrovin, an anti-Semite who organized pogroms and led the predecessor of today’s Union of the Russian People. Before he was executed by the Soviets, Dubrovin identified himself as 'a monarchist-communist,' the kind of fusion of principles favored by the Putin regime. People like Malofeyev and his ilk, Frolinsky says, can—and do—claim they are following in these footsteps. Many in Western governments and elsewhere assume that individuals like Malofeyev are on the margins of the Russian state, rather than the part of a dangerous trend that must be opposed. Conversely, now that senior Russian officials and churchmen have come out in favor of the explicit revival of a Black Hundreds organization—amid an ongoing pogrom against the Roma in Chelyabinsk—there should be no illusions about the direction of the Union of the Russian People and its ideological ilk, such as the Russian Community. German pastorMartin Niemöller famously warned that the Nazis attacked society piecemeal, allowing many to blind themselves to oppression that did not directly affect them, until 'there was no one left' to speak in their defense. Moscow’s endorsement of extreme right-wing groups’ rising power in Russia bodes ill for the Russian Federation’s minorities as the long war drags on.

Hezbollah’s Military Tactics In The Post-Nasrallah Era – Analysis	By Dr. Mohamed ELDoh The Iran-led 'Axis of Resistance,' composed of a coalition of armed and political groups across Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, has been striving to play a significant role over the past year amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The military operations, tactics, and strategies ofHezbollah, a key player in this axis, are critical in shaping the future of the conflict in Lebanon and beyond. Such strategies are currently dominated by one overriding imperative: the rapid restoration of command, control, and combat capabilities in Lebanon and Syria, given that Israel has successively eliminated key figures within Hezbollah over the past few weeks,notably the group’s longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. Beyond the restoration of its core command structures, Hezbollah will be seeking to realize the following objectives over the short-term: Deterring Israel from expanding its ground operations in Lebanon. Israel has shown a relentless will to escalate and expand its military operations, particularly in southern Lebanon and Syria, a region whereHezbollahhas maintained a significant influence for decades. Despite the group’s recent setbacks, Hezbollah still views it as imperative to prevent Israel from launching a large-scale ground invasion in southern Lebanon. Such an operation would significantly shift the long-termgeopoliticsof the region and weaken Hezbollah’s strategic foothold. It would also afford Israel a chance to expand operations beyond Lebanon and target Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq, and possibly even Iran itself. As a result, one of the primary military objectives of Hezbollah and the wider Axis is to establish deterrence and demonstrate that any Israeli attempt to expand its operations will still be met with resistance. Preparing for a prolonged conflict with Israel. Beyond immediate deterrence, it can be assumed that Hezbollah and other parts of the Axis of Resistance are actively preparing for a wider and more prolonged conflict with Israel. This preparation extends beyond short-term armed confrontations, incorporating a long-term strategy that acknowledges the possibility of prolonged hostilities.Hezbollah, with its decades-long experience fighting Israeli forces, understands the importance of preparing for a drawn-out confrontation, one that could involve urban warfare, asymmetric combat, leveraging missile capabilities, and protracted skirmishes along the border. The capacity for endurance in such a type of conflict is seen as crucial, and Hezbollah’s focus on maintaining combat readiness and a capacity for rapid flexibility in deployment remain key pillars of this strategic preparation. Forcing the United States to withdraw from Syria. Another strategic objective is to pressure the United States to fully withdraw its forces from Syria—a goal shared by Russia and Iran, as well as extremist groups like Islamic State. In this respect, the US militarypresencein Syria, particularly in strategic geographical locations, remains a source of contention for anti-US regional players. Hezbollah’s Current Combat Operations Following the elimination of most of Hezbollah’s leadership and senior commanders from the elite RadwanForceduring recent strikes in Beirut, Hezbollah has escalated its operations, likely in an attempt to prove that it still has the capacity to do so. In response to mounting Israeli military operations in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has launched a series of precisionattacksusing anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), with one such attacktargetingIsraeli air defense systems in Ramot Naftali in northern Israel. The attacks indicate an enduring capacity on the part of Hezbollah to strike with precision from significant distances, an important aspect of the group’s asymmetric warfare capabilities. Furthermore, it demonstrates that Hezbollah’s missile capabilities can still at times circumvent Israel’s Iron Dome defenses. In addition to ATGM attacks, Hezbollah has also utilizeddrone warfareto target Israeli positions. Such has beenevidentin the combined missile and drone attacks on Israeli military installations in Haifa. The Haifa attacks underscore Hezbollah’s growing dependence on drones in their overall combat strategy, a tactic also employed by the Houthis in Yemen in most of their maritime attacks.As in other battlefields around the world, drones remain a cost-effective way to perform precision strikes from a distance. Hezbollah maintains a capacity for rocket strikes as well, recently launching a barrage of rockets against Israeli forces positioned nearYarounand on the outskirts of Blida. Such attacks aim not only to inflict damage on Israeli forces, but also prevent them from gaining control of key areas in southern Lebanon, thereby halting Israel’s military progress in southern Lebanon. Fighting around Blida is particularlysignificant, as Israel has yet to succeed in cutting the town’s connection to nearby villages, suggesting an ability on the part of Hezbollah to maintain pressure on these positions. Hezbollah’s rocket attacks offer several tactical and ideological benefits. Firstly, they disrupt Israeli ground operations and force the IDF to remain in a defensive posture. Secondly, they showcase Hezbollah’s ongoing capacity to maintain high-intensity attacks, thereby reinforcing the message that any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon will encounter resolute resistance despite the recent removal of the group’s top leadership. Drone warfareand rocket attacks reflect a core component of Hezbollah’s military strategy: an emphasis on indirect and remote combat. Rather than engaging Israeli forces in direct confrontations, Hezbollah focuses on long-range attacks that minimize the exposure of its fighters to enemy fire. In doing so,Hezbollahis able to inflict significant damage on Israeli forces while maintaining a low casualty rate among its own fighters on the ground. The strategy evolved from Hezbollah’s experience in previous conflicts, where direct engagements with a technologically superior Israeli military resulted in heavy losses. Looking ahead, the group’s wider strategy will be to prolong the conflict and maximize Israeli losses. Despite Israel’s advanced military capabilities, Hezbollah is fully aware that Israeli forces, if left unchecked, will attempt to push deeper into Lebanon, thus becoming vulnerable to a war of attrition that Hezbollah appears well prepared to engage in, particularly in light of the possibility of further reinforcements from other segments of Iran’s Axis of Resistance, such as from Iraq and Syria. Under this scenario, it is unlikely that Hezbollah’s forces will be able to defend individual villages or positions in the south at all costs. Instead, and much like in the the past, the group will adopt a more flexible defense strategy, targeting advancing Israeli forces from a distance rather than attempting to hold ground.

Powder Keg In The Pacific – Analysis	By Alfred W. McCoy While the world looks on with trepidation at regional wars in Israel and Ukraine, a far more dangerous global crisis is quietly building at the other end of Eurasia, along an island chain that has served as the front line for the United States’s national defense for endless decades. Just as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has revitalized the NATO alliance, so China’s increasingly aggressive behavior and a sustained US military buildup in the region have strengthened Washington’s position on the Pacific littoral, bringing several wavering allies back into the Western fold. Yet such seeming strength contains both a heightened risk of great power conflict and possible political pressures that could fracture the US’s Asia–Pacific alliance relatively soon. Recent events illustrate the rising tensions of the new Cold War in the Pacific. From June to September of this year, the Chinese and Russian militaries conducted joint maneuvers that ranged from live-firenaval drillsin the South China Sea to air patrols circling Japan and evenpenetratingUS airspace inAlaska. To respond to what Moscowcalled'rising geopolitical tension around the world,' such actions culminated last month in a joint Chinese–Russian'Ocean-24' exercisethat mobilized 400 ships, 120 aircraft and 90,000 troops in a vast arc from the Baltic Sea across the Arctic to the northern Pacific Ocean. While kicking off such monumental maneuvers with China, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the US of 'trying to maintain its global military and political dominance at any cost' by 'increasing [its] military presence… in the Asia-Pacific region.' 'China is not a future threat,' US Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendallrespondedin September. 'China is a threat today.' Over the past 15 years, Beijing’s ability to project power in the Western Pacific, he claimed, had risen to alarming levels. He said the likelihood of war was 'increasing' and, he predicted, it will only 'continue to do so.' An anonymous senior Pentagon officialaddedthat China 'continues to be the only U.S. competitor with the intent and… the capability to overturn the rules-based infrastructure that has kept peace in the Indo-Pacific since the end of the Second World War.' Indeed, regional tensions in the Pacific have profound global implications. For the past 80 years, an island chain of military bastions running from Japan to Australia has served as a crucial fulcrum for US global power. To ensure that it will be able to continue to anchor its 'defense' on that strategic shoal, Washington has recently added new overlapping alliances while encouraging a massive militarization of the Indo–Pacific region. Though bristling with armaments and seemingly strong, this ad hoc Western coalition may yet prove, like NATO in Europe, vulnerable to sudden setbacks from rising partisan pressures, both in the US and among its allies. Building a Pacific bastion For well over a century, the US has struggled to secure its vulnerable western frontier from Pacific threats. During the early decades of the 20th century, Washington maneuvered against a rising Japanese presence in the region. These actions produced geopolitical tensions that led to Tokyo’s attack on the US naval bastion at Pearl Harbor that began World War II in the Pacific. After fighting for four years and suffering nearly 300,000 casualties, the US defeated Japan and won unchallenged control of the entire region. Aware that the advent of the long-range bomber and the future possibility of atomic warfare had rendered the historic concept of coastal defense irrelevant, in the post-war years Washington extended its North American 'defenses' deep into the Western Pacific. Starting with the expropriation of 100 Japanese military bases, the US built its initial postwar Pacific naval bastions at Okinawa and, thanks to a 1947 agreement, at Subic Bay in the Philippines. As the Cold War engulfed Asia in 1950 with the beginning of the Korean conflict, the US extended those bases for 5,000 miles along the entire Pacific littoral through mutual-defense agreements with five Asia–Pacific allies: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Australia. For the next 40 years to the very end of the Cold War, the Pacific littoral remained the geopolitical fulcrum of US global power, allowing it to defend North America and dominate Eurasia. In many ways, the US geopolitical position astride the axial ends of Eurasia would prove the key to its ultimate victory in the Cold War. After the Cold War Once the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the Cold War ended, Washington cashed in its peace dividend, weakening that once-strong island chain. Between 1998 and 2014, the US Navydeclinedfrom 333 ships to 271. That 20% reduction, combined with a shift to long-term deployments in the Middle East, degraded the Navy’s position in the Pacific. Even so, for the 20 years following the Cold War, the US would enjoy what the Pentagoncalled'uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. We could generally deploy our forces when we wanted, assemble them where we wanted, operate how we wanted.' After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, Washington turned from heavy-metal strategic forces to mobile infantry readily deployed for counterterror operations against lightly armed guerrillas. After a decade of fighting misbegotten wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Washington was stunned when a rising China began to turn its economic gains into a serious bid for global power. As its opening gambit, Beijing startedbuilding basesin the South China Sea, where oil and natural gas deposits arerife. It also began expanding its navy, an unexpected challenge that the once-all-powerful US Pacific command was remarkably ill-prepared to meet. In response, in 2011, President Barack Obamaproclaimeda strategic 'pivot to Asia' before the Australian parliament and began rebuilding the US military position on the Pacific littoral. After withdrawing some forces from Iraq in 2012 and refusing to commit significant numbers of troops for regime change in Syria, the Obama White Housedeployeda battalion of Marines to Darwin in northern Australia in 2014. In quick succession, Washington gained access to fivePhilippine basesnear the South China Sea and a new South Korean naval base atJeju Islandon the Yellow Sea. According to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, to operate those installations, the Pentagonplannedto 'forward base 60 percent of our naval assets in the Pacific by 2020.' Nonetheless, the unending insurgency in Iraq continued to slow the pace of that strategic pivot to the Pacific. Despite such setbacks, senior diplomatic and military officials, working under three different administrations, launched a long-term effort to slowly rebuild the US military posture in the Asia–Pacific region. Afterproclaiming'a return to great power competition' in 2016, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardsonreportedthat China’s 'growing and modernized fleet' was 'shrinking' the traditional US advantage in the region. 'The competition is on,' the admiral warned, adding, 'We must shake off any vestiges of comfort or complacency.' Responding to such pressure, the administration of President Donald Trump added the construction of 46 new ships to the Pentagonbudget, which was to raise the total fleet to 326 vessels by 2023. Support ships aside, when it came to an actual 'fighting force,' by 2024 China had the world’slargest navywith 234 'warships.' The US deployed only 219, with Chinese combat capacity, according to US Naval Intelligence, 'increasingly of comparable quality to U.S. ships.' Paralleling the military build-up, the State Department reinforced the US position on the Pacific littoral by negotiating three relatively new diplomatic agreements with Asia–Pacific allies Australia, Britain, India and the Philippines. Though those ententes added some depth and resilience to the US posture, the truth is that this Pacific network may ultimately prove more susceptible to political rupture than a formal multilateral alliance like NATO. Military cooperation with the Philippines After nearly a century as close allies through decades of colonial rule, two world wars and the Cold War, US relations with the Philippines suffered a severe setback in 1991. That country’s senate refused to renew a long-term military bases agreement, forcing the US 7th Fleet out of its massive naval base at Subic Bay. After just three years, however, China occupied some shoals also claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea during a raging typhoon. Within a decade, the Chinese had started transforming them into a network of military bases, while pressing their claims to most of the rest of the South China Sea. Manila’s only response was togrounda rusting World War II naval vessel on Ayungin shoal in the Spratly Islands, where Filipino soldiers had to fish for their supper. With its external defense in tatters, in April 2014 the Philippinessignedan Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with Washington. This allowed the US military quasi-permanent facilities at five Filipino bases, including two on the shores of the South China Sea. Although Manila won aunanimous rulingfrom the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague that Beijing’s claims to the South China Sea were 'without lawful effect,' China dismissed that decision and continued to build its bases there. And when Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines in 2016, he revealed a new policy that included a 'separation' from the US and astrategic tilttoward China. That country rewarded the policy with promises of massive developmental aid. By 2018, however, China’s army wasoperatinganti-aircraft missiles, mobile missile launchers and military radar on five artificial 'islands' in the Spratly archipelago that it had built from sand its dredgers sucked from the seabed. Once Duterte left office, as China’s Coast Guard harassed Filipino fishermen and blasted Philippine naval vessels with water cannons in their own territory, Manila once again started calling on Washington for help. Soon, US Navy vessels were conducting 'freedom of navigation' patrols in Philippine waters and the two nations had staged their biggestmilitary maneuversever. In the April 2024 edition of that exercise, the US deployed its mobile Typhon Mid-RangeMissile Launchercapable of hitting China’s coast, sparking a bittercomplaintfrom Beijing that such weaponry 'intensifies geopolitical confrontation.' Manila has matched its new commitment to the US alliance with an unprecedented rearmament program of its own. Just last spring, it signed a $400 million deal with Tokyo topurchasefive new Coast Guard cutters, started receiving Brahmoscruise missilesfrom India under a $375 million contract and continued a billion-dollar deal with South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries that will produce ten new naval vessels. After the governmentannounceda $35 billion military modernization plan, Manila has been negotiating with Koreansuppliersto procure40modern jet fighters. This is a far cry from a decade earlier when it had no operationaljets. Showing the scope of the country’s reintegration into the Western alliance, just last month Manila hosted joint freedom of navigationmaneuversin the South China Sea with ships from five allied nations: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines and the US. Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and the AUKUS alliance While the Philippine Defense Agreement renewed US relations with an old Pacific ally, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving Australia, India, Japan and the US, first launched in 2007, has now extended US military power into the Indian Ocean. At the 2017 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Manila, four conservative national leaders led by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump decided torevivethe 'Quad' entente (after a decade-long hiatus while Australia’s Labour Party governments cozied up to China). Just last month, President Joe Biden hosted a 'Quad Summit' where the four leaders agreed to expand joint air operations. In a hot-mike moment, Biden bluntlysaid: 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region. It is true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South Asia, and the Taiwan Straits.' China’s Foreign Ministryreplied: 'The U.S. is lying through its teeth' and needs to 'get rid of its obsession with perpetuating its supremacy and containing China.' Since 2020, however, the Quad has made the annual Malabarnaval exercisein India into an elaborate four-power drill in which aircraft carrier battle groups maneuver in waters ranging from the Arabian Sea to the East China Sea. To contest 'China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region,' Indiaannouncedthat the latest exercise this October would feature live-fire maneuvers in the Bay of Bengal, led by its flagship aircraft carrier and a complement of MiG-29K all-weather jet fighters. Clearly, as Modiputit, the Quad is 'here to stay.' While the Trump administration revived the Quad, the Biden White House has promoted a complementary and controversial AUKUS defense compact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the US (part of what Michael Klare has called the 'Anglo-Saxonization' of US foreign and military policy). After months of secret negotiations, their leadersannouncedthat agreement in September 2021 as a way to fulfill 'a shared ambition to support Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy.' Such a goal sparked howls of diplomatic protests. Angry over the sudden loss of a $90 billion contract to supply 12 French submarines to Australia, Francecalledthe decision 'a stab in the back' and immediatelyrecalledits ambassadors from both Canberra and Washington. With equal speed, China’s Foreign Ministrycondemnedthe new alliance for 'severely damaging regional peace… and intensifying the arms race.' In a pointed remark, Beijing’s official Global Times newspaper said Australia had now 'turned itself into an adversary of China.' To achieve extraordinary prosperity, thanks in significant part to its iron ore and other exports to China, Australia had exited the Quad entente for nearly a decade. Through this single defense decision, Australia has allied itself firmly with the US. It willgain accessto British submarine designs and top-secret US nuclear propulsion, joining the elite ranks of just six powers with such complex technology. Australia will spend a monumental$360 billionto build eight nuclear submarines at its Adelaide shipyards over a decade. Additionally, it will host four US Virginia-class nuclear subs at a naval base in Western Australia and buy as many as five of those stealthy submarines from the US in the early 2030s. Under the tripartite alliance with the US and Britain, Canberra will also face additional costs for the joint development of undersea drones, hypersonic missiles and quantum sensing. Through that stealthy arms deal, Washington has seemingly won a major geopolitical and military ally in any future conflict with China. Stand-off along the Pacific littoral Just as Russia’s aggression in Ukraine strengthened the NATO alliance, so China’s challenge in the fossil-fuel-rich South China Sea and elsewhere has helped the US rebuild its island bastions along the Pacific littoral. Through a sedulous courtship under three successive administrations, Washington has won back two wayward allies: Australia and the Philippines. They are once again anchors for an island chain that remains the geopolitical fulcrum for US global power in the Pacific. Still, with more than 200 times the ship-building capacity of the US, China’sadvantagein warships will almost certainly continue to grow. In compensating for such a future deficit, the US’s four active allies along the Pacific littoral will likely play a critical role. (Japan’s navy has more than 50 warships and South Korea’s 30 more.) Despite such renewed strength in what is distinctly becoming a new cold war, the US’s Asia–Pacific alliances face both immediate challenges and a fraught future. Beijing is already putting relentless pressure on Taiwan’s sovereignty, breaching that island’s airspace and crossing the median line in the Taiwan Straitshundreds of timesmonthly. If Beijing turns those breaches into a crippling embargo of Taiwan, the US Navy will face a hard choice between losing a carrier or two in a confrontation with China or backing off. Either way, the loss of Taiwan would sever the US’s island chain in the Pacific littoral, pushing it back to a 'second island chain' in the mid-Pacific. As for that fraught future, the maintenance of such alliances requires a kind of national political will that is by no means assured in an age of populist nationalism. In the Philippines, the anti-US nationalism that Duterte personified retains its appeal and may well be adopted by some future leader. More immediately in Australia, the currentLabour Party governmenthas already faced strong dissent from members blasting the AUKUS entente as a dangerous transgression of their country’s sovereignty. And in the US, Republican populism, whether Trump’s or that of a future leader like J.D. Vance could curtail cooperation with such Asia–Pacific allies, simply walk away from a costly conflict over Taiwan or deal directly with China in a way that would undercut that web of hard-won alliances. And that, of course, might be the good news given the possibility that growing Chinese aggressiveness in the region and a US urge to strengthen a military alliance ominously encircling that country could threaten to turn the latest Cold War ever hotter. This would transform the Pacific into a genuine powder keg and could lead to a war that would, in our present world, be almost unimaginably destructive.

Data Shows Chinese Government Less Popular Than State Media Makes...	By Erin Baggott Carter, Brett Carter, and Stephen Schick The White Paper protests, which spread across China in November 2022, were triggered by the death of ten people during a fire in a quarantined apartment building in Urumqi. The protests reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the Chinese government’s COVID-19 policies, which forced observers of Chinese politics to question whether the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) really enjoys widespread popular support. In contrast with the majority of protests in China driven by discontent with local governments, the White Paper demonstrations offered critiques of the central government and the CCP’s rule more generally. The CCP’s legitimacy—resting on the party’s achievements indeveloping China’s economyand reducing poverty, maintaining social stability through censorship and repression, and, increasingly, promoting a nationalist vision of China’s future—depends to a great extent on public perceptions of the regime. Popular political attitudes in China have shaped the regime’s domestic stability, the reception of its policies, and constrainedits foreign policy decisions.These pillars of CCP legitimacy appear to be shifting beneath the regime’s monolithic facade, as demonstrated bythe White Paper protests. Whether due to China’s slowing economy, the concentration of power under Xi Jinping or the heavy-handedness of the country’s COVID-19 response, researchers and policymakers must carefully analyse these changes in popular attitudes or risk greatly misunderstanding state-society dynamics. For scholars of Chinese politics, the most common tool applied to gauge public opinion is adirect survey, in which respondents are asked about their attitudes towards the Chinese government via in-person enumerators or online forms. Oneprominent study, published by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance at Harvard University, has traced popular attitudes toward the Chinese government since 2003. Their surveysplace regime support above 90 per cent, suggesting that favourable views of the Chinese government are as ubiquitous as party propaganda might suggest. These results have been covered by China Central Television,Xinhua, China Global Television Network, China Dailyand other CCP propaganda outlets, becoming part of the state’s efforts to substantiate its legitimacy — both at home and abroad. But does the CCP really enjoy such widespread support? Or do survey respondents conceal their opposition to the regime due to the threat of repression? And if so, what share of Chinese citizens really support the CCP? To answer these questions, we employed a survey technique known as a list experiment. In a list experiment, respondents are provided with a short list of nonsensitive statements, such as ‘I consider myself a sports fan’,and are asked to tally up the number of statements they agree with. Respondentswererandomly assigned to either a control group or a treatment group, with treated individuals receiving an additional sensitive statement, like ‘I support comrade Xi Jinping’or ‘the CCP government works for the people’. The results, which werepublishedintheChina Quarterly, reveal widespread preference falsification. With direct questions, individuals reported their support for Xi, the CCP and the Chinese government at rates similar to those found in prior direct survey research, reaching upwards of 90 per cent support for the regime. With list experiments, support for the regime dropped to between 50 per cent to 70 per cent. Since list experiments may not fully obviate respondents’ concerns about online surveillance, this is more likelyan upper bound on regime support. Respondents were more willing to express opposition to ‘the system of government’ than to Xi or the CCP directly. Across questions and survey waves, support for the regime varied consistently across three characteristics.Ethnic Han respondents supported Xi about 20 percentage points more than minority respondents.College-educated respondents were between 10–20 percentage points more supportive of the CCP than respondents who completed early middle school. This may be because the CCP’s efforts to shape educational curricula have succeeded,or because college-educated Han perform considerably better inthe labour market. CCP members are about 10 percentage points more supportive of the regime. This makes sense, since they elected to join the Party and benefit from its rents. The difference between regime support under direct questioning and regime support under list experiments is known as the preference falsification rate.Thesurvey experiments reveal a preference falsification rate in Xi’s China of around 25 percentage points. A recent meta-analysis examined all known list experiments in autocratic contexts and found an average preference falsification rate of around 14 percentage points. This makes Xi’s China a clear outlier and demonstrates its citizens are far more fearful of expressing opposition to the regime. These results suggestobservers should be sceptical about public opinion surveys in China that rely on direct questioning. The CCP’s sprawling internal security apparatus compels citizens to engage in widespread self-censorship, at a rate nearly three times higher than inVladamirPutin’s Russia. The pervasiveness of self-censorship has caused observers to overstate the amount of legitimacythatthe CCP enjoys. This legitimacy, the conventional wisdom goes, is born of its record of economic growth and a propaganda and censorship apparatus that persuades citizens of the regime’s merits. Theresults, most broadly, suggest the CCP confronts widespread frustration. Its recent policies, including the increase in repressionand sabre-rattling over Taiwan, should be seen as an effort to contain this frustration.

Argentina: Nine Months Of Javier Milei As President – Analysis	By Antony P. Mueller In office for just over nine months, Argentine President Javier Milei continues to face enormous economic and political challenges. His support from Congress and the Senate is fragile, and the president’s opponents are trying to mobilize the masses against his policies. This makes success in the economic sphere all the more urgent. The aim here is to find a way out of stagflation—the simultaneous occurrence of stagnation or recession and inflation—in which the Argentine economy currently finds itself as quickly as possible. The signs are not good. When the Western industrialized nations fell into stagnation in the 1970s, it took almost a decade for price inflation to be defeated to some extent and for economic growth to pick up again. Milei doesn’t have that much time, even though a lot has already been achieved. Since taking office on December 10, 2023, Javier Milei has the following advantages: Surplus since January 2024 Restriction of money creation by the central bank since April 2024 Reduction of the inflation rate since April 2024 Abolition of various price regulations (e.g., on the housing market) Reduction of various price subsidies Abolition of eight ministries, partly with complete closure and dismissal of around 30,000 state employees However, the negative side still has a heavy impact: Price inflation remains high (237 percent per year) Unemployment rises (7.6 percent) Labor force participation is very low (48 percent) Industrial production is negative (-5.4percent annual) External debt rises to around $290 billion Insufficient level of foreign exchange reserves (currently $21.7 billion) Devaluation to 975 pesos from 322 to the dollar when he took office In presenting the budget in September, the Milei government announced the following expectations for 2025: 5 percent increase in gross domestic product Reduce price inflation to 18 percent per year by the end of 2025 Devaluation of the currency to 1207 per dollar by the end of 2025 Achieve a primary budget surplus of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product If you take a closer look at the current figures, doubts grow whether these goals can be achieved. Worrying indicators are that the central bank money supply is not falling further and that the so-called M1 money supply is even increasing. Inflation expectations fell sharply in the first half of the year but have remained steady at 50 percent per year since then. With price inflation remaining high, the central bank may have cut interest rates too much and will be forced to reverse them when the rate of inflation picks up again. This, in turn, would further delay the recovery of industrial production. In addition, high payments for the interest on foreign debt are due in January next year. 2025 will be the critical year for Javier Milei, also because midterm elections are due in October 2025. By then, the president will have to whip his electoral alliance into shape to have enough votes in the legislature for the next stage of his policy. To understand why Milei—an avowed 'anarcho-capitalist'—came to power in the first place, it is enough to point out that Argentina has experienced a loss of prosperity for more than fifty years. While many other emerging markets have achieved massive gains in prosperity, the level in Argentina has fallen. But this is not the only reason why frustration is so widespread. One trigger to try something completely new is price inflation. This was already very high in all the previous decades, but in the past two years, it has risen rapidly. While the annual inflation rate was still around 50 percent at the beginning of 2022, it had risen to over two hundred percent when Javier Milei took office in December 2023. It was above all the promise to finally put an end to inflation that brought Milei into office. Now the task for him is whether he can keep his promise without the recession deepening. In a nutshell, the task is that the reduction in the money supply and the reduction in government spending will be compensated for by a corresponding increase in private sector activity so that unemployment does not rise too much. Thus, much depends on the extent to which the government succeeds in strengthening the private sector through deregulation and privatization. In addition to the domestic political problem areas, foreign trade is a decisive factor. Argentina is almost completely cut off from private foreign financing. New loans can only be expected from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but Argentina is already the country most indebted to the IMF with $42 billion in outstanding loans. Regarding the foreign debt of currently $287 billion US dollars, an estimated $15 billion US dollars are due to interest and partial amortizations starting in January of next year. Financially, Argentina will be very dependent on foreign exchange income. These can hardly be provided by the country’s export industry. Compensation would have to be made by foreign direct investment. There are already some positive signals here. But it remains to be seen whether the announcements will be followed by action because the economic climate is getting cloudy in the industrialized countries. Argentina belongs to the large group of countries that have been systematically ruined by their own governments. Whether more 'right' or more 'left,' these politicians had in common a deep penchant for interventionism. What distinguishes Javier Milei is that he offers an alternative to the Argentine people. He calls himself an 'anarcho-capitalist,' but what he promises and wants to implement is essentially a sound economic policy. Therefore, one should not expect too much anarcho-capitalism from the president. Even if he wanted to, he could not push it through politically. However, much would already be gained if he prevails in macroeconomic matters and succeeds in taming inflation and bringing about an economic upswing. This alone would have a signal effect worldwide, but especially for Latin America, where the tendency towards socialism is still widespread. Where is Milei’s anarcho-capitalism, one wonders? There is little to see of this. He is pursuing a policy that the International Monetary Fund has already prescribed for many debtor countries. Governments have often followed the IMF’s requirements rather reluctantly. The Argentinian president does it voluntarily and to an even harsher extent. To reform an entire country abruptly in an anarcho-capitalist way is an impossibility. It would probably be better if Milei took a different path: that of private free cities or special economic zones. This concept states that the government of a country designates certain territories, and the state largely withdraws administratively and leaves most of it to the private sector. Low or no taxes and almost no regulations are the incentives for companies and private investors to settle there. The labor market in these zones is almost completely free of regulation, and people come there voluntarily to work and do business. Argentina’s location, in particular, is ideal for such a strategy because of its many almost completely uninhabited regions. The Argentine government could designate areas the size of Holland and lease these selected territories to a private company, the amount of which would vary according to the economic success achieved there. A comparison of the circumstances with the already existing administrative special zones in other parts of the world indicates that the chances of success in Argentina seem very favorable. This would be particularly the case if a libertarian government, such as that of Milei, undertook to extend the absence of state rule in such a special zone as far as possible, and accordingly to create a comprehensive space for a private legal system. Such a project could have a signal function for the whole world and provide practical proof that and how anarcho-capitalism works. About the author: Dr. Antony P.

Bulgaria: Will Borisov Be Able To Form A Government? – Analysis	By Ivan Bedrov (RFE/RL) -- Bulgaria is back in very familiar territory. The October 27 parliamentary elections gave former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov's center-right GERB party the most votes, but not enough to form a government on its own. Borisov will certainly try. But despite winning five out of seven parliamentary elections since 2021, GERB has failed to form a coalition. Will Borisov Be Able To Form A Government? To form a governing coalition, Borisov -- Bulgaria's most notable and powerful politician, who has been prime minister three times since 2009 -- needs the support of at least half the deputies in the National Assembly, the country's 240-seat unicameral parliament. Looking at the breakdown of votes in the increasingly fragmented parliament, three or four parties will be needed to form a majority. So far, Borisov has only ruled out working with the far-right, pro-Kremlin Revival party, which came in third with 13 percent of the vote. Speaking on election night, Borisov said: 'We will govern with anyone who supports our program.' Enter Delyan Peevski... Much of it comes down to one man: Delyan Peevski, a controversial media tycoon with incredible sway over public opinion. He has been accused of corruption and influence peddling and sanctioned by the United States and Britain for corruption. And most Bulgarian politicians would probably agree that Peevski is the person most responsible for Bulgaria's ongoing political crisis. In a move that would likely end the political impasse, Borisov has said he would work with the second-place pro-Western reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria (PP-DB) coalition, which polled 14 percent. However, PP-DB has insisted that it will only work with GERB if Peevski has no influence on the future administration. Borisov has been repeatedly accused of having close ties to Peevski, who for many Bulgarians is emblematic of the country's corruption and organized crime. It's also unlikely that Borisov will be able to scrape together enough seats from the smaller parties in parliament, many of whom also refuse to be in bed with Peevski. So, essentially, it comes down to Borisov having to choose between the PP-DB or Peevski. After the last elections in June, GERB and Peevski's previous party could have formed a government with the support of a few independent lawmakers, but Borisov refused to make a deal. Why Can't Borisov Cut Ties With Peevski? This is the $1 million question in Bulgaria, and no one really knows the answer. PP-DB has said that Peevski de facto owns GERB through mutual business concerns. Plus, Peevski is widely thought to control Bulgaria's powerful Prosecutor-General's Office, which oversees both criminal investigations and prosecutorial decisions. In the past, investigations against Borisov have been closed and the former prime minister has received immunity from prosecution. What Are The Consequences Of This Continuing Impasse? Bulgaria is stagnating. Money from the European Union has almost dried up, and it will stay that way until the country carries out EU-mandated reforms and anti-corruption measures. Not to mention that without a functioning administration, the EU doesn't really have anyone to work with. Efforts to push reforms and anti-corruption measures, notably by PP-DB, have continually hit a brick wall. With the country in limbo, progress has stalled on Bulgaria adopting the euro and fully joining the EU's borderless Schengen zone. Are Bulgarians Losing Their Faith In The Democratic Process? While public faith in the electoral process is certainly not high, partial results have shown that the turnout for these elections might be slightly higher than the 34 percent of voters who voted in June. There were fears before the vote that widespread disillusionment with mainstream parties could result in the rise of smaller extreme parties such as Revival. However, the latest elections don't show any clear evidence of that. While fringe parties have increased their vote share, so, too, have the major parties. Could This Election Affect Bulgaria's International Course? While there are four pro-Russia parties in parliament, they have a smaller number of deputies than the pro-Western parties. Moreover, the fact that the pro-Western GERB and PP-DB parties came first and second is an indication that support for Bulgaria's EU and NATO membership remains strong. And while PP-DB's support and vote-share isn't huge, the party's constant pressure for reform is a defining feature of Bulgaria's political landscape.

Canada Must Reject Extremism In Dispute With India – OpEd	For generations, Canada's vibrant Indian diaspora has been an integral part of our society. From starting businesses to advancing our workforce, Indian immigrants have significantly contributed to Canada's growth and prosperity—just as they are doing in the U.S. Today, Canada and India share a solid international trade relationship, with bilateral trade reaching USD $9.36 billion in 2023. Canadian Pension Funds have cumulatively invested over USD $75 billion in India, viewing it as an increasingly favourable investment destination. With a growing Indian diaspora of over 2 million people in Canada, the potential for future growth is immense. Yet, despite these encouraging figures, the current trade numbers fall short of the true potential between these two vibrant democracies. A Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement has been a shared dream for many in both nations. A decade and a half in the making, this agreement would have greatly boosted economic ties. Yet, time and again, we've seen potential agreements halted by domestic political tensions, bringing us back to square one. Recent events have pushed this relationship to an all-time low. Allegations from the Canadian government, still awaiting court verification, have cast doubt on these strong economic and social ties. Over a year ago, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen wanted in India for various crimes, was killed in British Columbia. Canada's defence of Nijjar without acknowledging his criminal background or his questionable path to permanent residency raises critical questions: How are individuals with criminal records gaining access to Canada, and how are they passing background checks? Canadians want, above all, to live in safety, and it is the duty of our government to ensure that those who seek asylum and security here pose no threat to our way of life. For Canada to continue as a haven for a better life, we cannot allow individuals with questionable backgrounds to undermine the vision of peace and security that new Canadians seek. This moment calls for a larger reset in our political priorities, shifting focus from diaspora appeasement to Canadian national interests. Diversity is Canada's strength—one that should unite us in a shared Canadian dream, not divide us for short-term political gain. This atmosphere of mistrust risks the enormous potential for cultural, social, and economic cooperation between Canada and India. India, currently experiencing rapid growth with an 8.2% economic rise in FY 2023-24, boasts booming sectors in manufacturing, technology, and healthcare. Canada's advanced technology, resources, and world-renowned agro-processing industry stand to gain from a more robust partnership with India. Yet, today's trade figures don't reflect the vast possibilities of a truly collaborative relationship. Experts suggest that with ambitious agreements, we could double or even triple our bilateral trade. But this requires a strong, trusting partnership built on mutual respect, sincerity, and continued positive engagement. In a time when democracies like the U.S. and its allies are striving to counterbalance global challenges, conflict between Canada and India creates an unnecessary wedge. Instead of fostering unity, Canada's stance forces the U.S. to mediate between two of its closest allies, distracting from broader global priorities. It's essential to clarify that the vast majority of the Indo-Canadian community are peace-loving and loyal to Canadian values. A small, extremist faction within the community may seek headlines, rallying vulnerable politicians to support their divisive agenda. Open, aggressive advocacy for the Khalistan cause has instilled fear across Sikh and Hindu populations. For those who remember the horrors of the 1980s, including the Air India tragedy that took 329 lives, these renewed calls for division are a painful reminder of dark times that no one wants to revisit. Today, hate-filled slogans like 'Hindus Go Back' and the vandalizing of Hindu temples are unacceptable in Canada. All members of the Indo-Canadian community—across religious and cultural backgrounds—deserve to live free from extremist narratives that do not reflect their values. It's tragic that in pursuing short-term political aims, the legitimate voices of the broader Sikh community, proud Canadians, have been overlooked. Most Sikhs have no ill-will towards anyone and continue to lead lives that contribute to Canada's economy and cultural fabric. We honour their heritage and contributions, and so do the people of India. As Chair of the Canada India Foundation and a proud Indo-Canadian, I've witnessed the shared values of the Indo-Canadian community—peace, prosperity, freedom, and cooperation—that have historically brought Canada and India together. The current diplomatic standoff and its consequences are deeply regrettable. However, it is not too late to restore calm and pursue constructive dialogue. Together, Canada and India can strengthen not only their bilateral relationship but also their partnerships with the U.S. and other democracies, driving a global vision where democratic values thrive. I urge Canada's leaders to listen to the voices of the broader Indo-Canadian community, reject extremism in all forms, and rebuild the bonds that unite us all. It's time to prioritize unity, respect, and shared progress, ensuring that Canada's diverse society thrives and our partnership with India remains a model for mutual benefit and understanding.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz29efoag2gj0	2024-10-29T16:50:57-07:00	
US At The Crossroads As Voters Clamor For Change – OpEd	By Dr. Turki Faisal Al-Rasheed As the 2024 US elections approach, the atmosphere is charged with intensity reminiscent of the Cold War era. Since 2016, American society has become increasingly polarized, exemplified by the ongoing rivalry between Donald Trump and his Democratic counterparts. Joe Biden’s ascension to the presidency was largely fueled by public dissatisfaction with the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, a sentiment that has led many to question his effectiveness in crisis management, mirroring critiques faced by his predecessor, Trump. While the media emphasizes domestic issues such as abortion, immigration, inflation, and taxes, it is crucial not to overlook how foreign policy may sway swing voters, particularly within significant communities such as Arab Americans. The geopolitical landscape, especially the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, will likely play a pivotal role in shaping voter sentiment as we move closer to the elections. Under Biden’s leadership, US policy has thrust Ukraine into a precarious situation against Russia, with the Ukrainian populace bearing the brunt of the conflict. Nearly three years in, Russia remains resolute in its stance against NATO’s perceived encroachment on its borders. Following recent BRICS meetings, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that more than 30 countries have expressed interest in joining the group, indicating a desire to challenge Western 'hegemony' and shape a 'multipolar world order.' In Europe, allies are grappling with the fallout of the conflict, facing unprecedented fuel prices, and a refugee crisis that burdens their economies. The lack of a clear military or political resolution exacerbates these challenges, leaving Europe reliant on US directives regarding potential ceasefires in Ukraine and the broader implications for regional stability. In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to exploit a perception of a US administration as weak and disengaged, as ongoing conflicts draw in regional powers aligned with Iran. This situation raises the specter of a direct confrontation between Israel and its adversaries, a scenario fraught with peril not only for the region but also for international relations. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris finds herself in a precarious position navigating these complicated foreign policy issues. Her commitment to continue Biden’s foreign policy, which has not yielded success in Ukraine or Gaza, leaves her vulnerable to criticism. Her attempts to resonate with Michigan’s significant Arab community, such as her assertion to 'end the suffering' in Gaza, stand in contrast to her unwavering support for military aid to Israel, highlighting the fractures within the Democratic Party on foreign policy. Exploring the nuances of this crisis reveals that financial interests often take precedence over political ideologies. Corporations and state institutions have historically wielded power, sometimes leading to decisions driven more by economic gains than by the well-being of constituents. Wars are often justified through grand rhetoric, but underneath lies a stark reality of 'savage capitalism' benefitting arms dealers and the military-industrial complex. The political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once noted: 'The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values... but by its superiority in applying organized violence.' While this may prompt reflection on the past, it also suggests the need for a balanced approach in the future. Regardless of the election’s outcome, the implications for Europe are significant. Europe must develop a new strategy that navigates its relationship with the US, accounting for shifting dynamics in global politics. The need for a clear articulation of collective interests has never been more pressing as competition from China and ongoing instability in the Middle East create challenges that demand a cohesive response. In the Arab world, particularly the Gulf states, collaboration among nations will be vital in prioritizing sustainable development and avoiding conflicts. Analysts predict an inevitable and potentially swift American withdrawal from the region, necessitating a reassessment of how Arab nations work together, especially with the Biden administration’s evident desire for reduced US involvement. This transitory phase in American foreign policy could call into question whether it is the US that is leaving or merely redefining its strategy in a complex landscape. The fallout from military engagement often leaves a legacy of instability, a sentiment echoed by foreign affairs analysts. Joseph Roth’s poignant reflections in 'The Emperor’s Tomb' on the decline of powerful civilizations resonate with present-day realities, where moral decay and ineffective leadership raise urgent concerns about the future of American democracy. As the country prepares for the elections, it is clear that the American populace itself may emerge as the greatest loser. With divisions deepening and trust in leadership eroding, many yearn for a time when the presidency symbolized national unity and strength. The upcoming elections will determine not only the future of US leadership but also the implications for global politics. As the US stands at this crossroads, a calculated examination of the interplay between domestic issues and foreign policy will be vital for voters seeking meaningful change in a complex world. Ultimately, navigating the turbulent waters of the 2024 elections requires a balanced approach that considers both domestic priorities and the intricate web of global relations. As the political landscape evolves, the US public and policymakers must be vigilant and informed, ensuring they champion a vision that promotes unity, moral clarity, and sustainable progress both at home and abroad.

The Biden-Harris Administration Wasted Nearly One Billion On Misi...	The party of 'Science' apparently misled hundreds of millions of people on the actual science surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. Stop the presses. Starting in early 2020, the combined efforts ofDr. Anthony Fauci, the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, and their partners in the media caused an untold amount of damage to society and public health and might have even created conditions forincreased Covid spread. How? By repeatedly, profoundly, and often purposefully communicating inaccurate information while spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get their preferred messages across. Now, a new, massive113-page reportfrom the US House of Representatives Energy & Commerce Committee has detailed the remarkable abuses from the Biden-Harris administration and the manner in which they communicated during Covid. Biden, CDC Partners Literally Wasted a Fortune to Lie to the American People The report details a number of unbelievable inaccuracies in 2021 coming from the Biden administration’s communications team and the CDC’s messaging apparatus. Fauci and Francis Collins’ National Institutes of Health were also responsible, creating guidance using taxpayer money, nearly $1 billion per the report, that misled millions of people and caused unimaginable harm in the process. While the Biden-Harris administration’s public health guidance led to prolonged closures of schools and businesses, the NIH was spending nearly a billion dollars of taxpayer money trying to manipulate Americans with advertisements—sometimes containing erroneous or unproven information. By overpromising what the Covid-19 vaccines could do—in direct contradiction of the FDA’s authorizations—and over emphasizing the virus’s risk to children and young adults, the Biden-Harris administration caused Americans to lose trust in the public health system,' Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said after the report’s release. 'Our investigation also uncovered the extent to which public funding went to Big Tech companies to track and monitor Americans, underscoring the need for stronger online data privacy protections.' One of the most damaging, and woefully incorrect messaging campaigns centered on vaccine efficacy against infection. As the report details, Biden’s 'Stop the Spread' campaign was a pervasive marketing effort in conjunction with the CDC that claimed vaccines would end the pandemic by reducing infections. That had enormous knock-on effects, including decreasing trust in all vaccinations and ultimately harming public health. 'The entire premise of the Biden-Harris ‘Stop the Spread’ campaign was that if you got vaccinated for COVID-19, you could resume daily activities because they said vaccinated people would not spread the disease,' said Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith (R-VA). 'Despite lacking scientific basis, the administration bought into this CDC claim and misled the American public. As a result, vaccination coverage with other vaccines appears to have declined, I believe because of a growing distrust of information coming from our public health institutions.' This campaign was even more disingenuous and purposefully misleading than previously realized. The 'Stop the Spread' publicity blitz hid in plain sight a message from the CDC that even they didn’t know whether the vaccines actually stopped infection or transmission. The report shared a screenshot of a page from the Biden administration’s marketing that specifically said 'science' wasn’t sure how well the vaccines worked against infection. Yet the Biden administration made life-altering policy decisions such as vaccine mandates, discriminatory entry processes, and military vaccination requirements regardless. And that was in addition to the less quantifiable impacts like nudging millions of people to follow their preferred course of action. CDC Guidance Exacerbated Existing Problems The report also explains how the Biden administration relied heavily on guidance from the CDC, an organization that thoroughly disgraced itself during the pandemic. There were several examples highlighted, chief among them that CDC 'experts' went far beyond what even the FDA claimed Covid vaccines could do. Without evidence, the report says Biden’s marketing claimed that 'COVID vaccines were highly effective against transmission.' Within just a few months, it was clear that all the available evidence pointed towards the exact opposite direction. Per the report, this had a 'negative impact on vaccine confidence and the CDC’s credibility when proven untrue.' The CDC also had 'inconsistent and flawed messaging about the effectiveness of masks,' which created seemingly endless mandates and, again, overconfidence in an ineffective policy. Some of those mandates even continue to this day. That’s just the tip of their misinformation. A wealth of data and public embarrassments for the CDC confirmed that the organization 'consistently overstated the risk of COVID-19 to children,' the report states. That fear-mongering had disastrous consequences, from unnecessarily terrifying parents to prolonged school closures and lack of socialization—setting an entire generation of children back in the process. Still, after being repeatedly and profoundly proven wrong, the CDC has demonstrated they’ve yet to learn their lesson. In late 2024, the CDC continues to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for babies starting at six months old. That makes the US a global outlier compared to European nations that have maintained at least some level of intellectual honesty. How Do We Fix CDC Abuses? The report detailed several recommendations to fix these organizations after their disastrous work during the pandemic. Even implementing just a select few, listed below, would do wonders for fixing the institutional rot that influenced these mistakes. Congress should consider clarifying responsibility for evaluating the safety of vaccines and streamlining existing reporting systems for capturing vaccine injuries and adverse reactions. HHS and its agencies should embrace a culture of transparency and accountability. The CDC and federal public health officials should not attempt to silence dissenting scientific opinions. Also highlighted in the report is how the CDC and NIH used their weight in their attempts to censor scientists who dissented from their preferred narratives. Beyond their mistakes, profound inaccuracies, and nearly unlimited spending, their censorship efforts are equally concerning. As we learned during Covid, if there’s one thing 'experts' hate, it’s being told that they were proven wrong. Instead of learning, adjusting, and apologizing, they move to censor, criticize and mislead. This new report is the latest confirmation of these unacceptable 'mistakes.' And reaffirms the importance of ensuring they never happen again.

Scary National Debt Numbers – OpEd	Ready for a pre-Halloween scare? The U.S.government’stotal public debt outstanding surpassed$35.465 trillionat the end of its 2024 fiscal yearon September 30, 2024. That massive number is the equivalent of $268,265 of national debt for each household in the United States. This figure is above and beyond theamount ofdebt each household hasaccumulatedthrough their mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. It’salso an underestimate because the national debt has kept growing. As of October 24, the national debt increased by another $334 billion, or by about $2,647 per household. Altogether, the national debt has grown by $54,862 per household during the Biden-Harris administration’s tenure. There is a good chance the Biden-Harris administration will beat the $57,989 per household figure run up during Donald Trump’s term in office before President Biden leaves the White House on January 20, 2025. Who has the U.S. government borrowed so much from? Screenshot That’sa pretty reasonable question to ask. Political Calculations took asnapshotof the U.S.government’smajorcreditors as of September 30, 2024. The chart below reveals themajorcreditors to whom the U.S. government owes money and how much of that debt eachis owed. Here’s their overall picture of who owns the U.S. national debt: The U.S. Federal Reserve is once again the U.S. government’s single largest creditor holding U.S. government-issued debt securities worth 12.4% of the U.S. government’s entire total public debt outstanding. However, its share of the national debt is down from the 18.3% it held in 2022 and the 15% recorded last year as the Federal Reserve has continued reducing its holdings. In doing so, the Fed is still following the monetary policy of shrinking its balance sheet that it initiated in March 2022 when it began hiking interest rates to combatinflationunleashed by President Biden’s policies. Speaking of interest rates, on 19 September 2024, the Federal Reserveinitiateda new series of interest rate reductions after holding them steady at an elevated level for over a year. Those higher rates have attracted U.S. individuals and institutions such as banks, insurance companies, investment funds, corporations, and individuals to collectively increase their share of the national debt from 47.1% in 2023 to 48.8% in 2024. Social Security’s share of the national debt plunged from 8.1% in 2023 to 7.3% in 2024. This decline coincides with theongoing depletionof its Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund, which has run in the red in every year since 2009. The combined share of the U.S. national debt held by the government’s military (4.5%) and civilian (3.0%) employee retirement trust funds swelled from 7.2% to 7.5% from FY 2023 to FY 2024. Altogether, the portion of the U.S. national debt held by U.S. entities in 2024 is 76.0%, a small dip from the 77.4% in 2023, but up slightly from 75.7% share in 2022…. The portion of the U.S. total public debt outstanding held by foreign individuals and institutions is 24.0%. During the last few years, interest on the national debt has become thefastest-growingcategory of government spending. That money comes straight out of the U.S. government’s tax collections without ever doing anything U.S. taxpayers expect tobe donewith their tax dollars. Ready for the real scare? Unless something dramatic changes things, these numbers will be bigger and scarier next year.

A ‘Heroic’ Preference For Self-Destruction Is Taking Hold In Isra...	Centuries ago a boy was born. His parents understood that he had a remarkable fate before him which reflected the Will of the Great Shaman. His hair was light, his eyes were light green, and his skin was pale. It seemed obvious that he enjoyed divine favour. But then, one day, the boy’s father – a figure of standing – was killed. The family thus became unprotected, and nomads smashed the remains of his home. They made him a slave. They put wooden stocks over his legs so that he could not walk. He lived like a dog, and grew up like a dog, chained outside, eating rotten food, freezing on winter nights, wishing for death. Death however spared him. When finally he did escape, his psyche was tortured. The voices inside his head; the screams of his father; the scorching fire; his mother being tortured and killed; All whispered, just destroy everything that is in your way, and these memories will be purged. But they weren’t. His army killed millions. Nonetheless, he founded a nation of more than one million vassals. He expurgated all concepts of tribal loyalty and old identities for obedience to his State. He did all this with a tiny army; no more than 100,000. His name comes down to us today as Genghis Khan. What has this to do with today’s war in the Middle East? Well, firstly we have moved – in thisAmerican-facilitatedIsraeli war – to ‘war without limits’. The rules of war have been evicted; human rights have been discarded; international law has been shed; and the UN Charter is no more. And, as it expands, anything goes – children in Gaza decapitated by bombs, Gaza’s hospitals bombed, and the continuous displacement and massacre of civilians. The roots to this shift are complex. In part, they spring from the western postmodern zeitgeist. But also they reflect the same dilemma that faced a tormented, twisted Genghis Khan: How would he control the world without a big army; in fact, with only a tiny one. 'Everything that’s happened today was planned out just 50 years ago – back in 1974 and 1973'. I want to describe how the whole strategy that led to the United States today, not wanting peace, but wanting Israel to take over the whole Near East took shape gradually',Professor Hudson has explained (hereandhere). Hudson relates: 'I met many [neocons] at the Hudson Institute, where [I] had worked for five years in the mid ‘70s; some of them, or their fathers, were Trotskyists.They picked up Trotsky’s idea of permanent revolution. That is, an unfolding revolution – whereas Trotsky said what began in Soviet Russia was going to spread around the world: The neocons adapted this and said, No, the permanent Revolution is the American Empire. It’s going to expand, and expand, and nothing can stop us – to the entire world'. In their ambition, they were another Genghis Khan: the U.S., lacking the military means, would seize the Middle East using Israel as its proxy on the one hand, and Saudi-facilitated Sunni fundamentalism on the other. TheHudson Institute, under Herman Khan, persuaded the dominant political figure Scoop Jackson that Zionism could be America’s battering ram in the Middle East. That was in the early 1970s. By 1996, Scoop Jackson’s former Senate aides had crafted –specifically for Netanyahu – itsClean Break Strategy. Explicitly, it was the blueprint for ‘a new Middle East’. It argued that the Israel proxy would be served best by regime change in surrounding countries. In March 2003, Patrick J. Buchanan, referring to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wrote, 'Their [Clean Break] plan urged Israel to [pursue regime change through] ‘the principle of preemption''. Professor Michael Hudson points out the design’s fatal flaw: The Vietnam War had shown that any attempted conscription by western democracies was not viable. Lyndon Johnson in 1968 had to withdraw from running for election precisely because everywhere he’d go, there would be nonstop stop-the-war demonstrations. So what then was left to the United States and Israel? Well, what is available – if your objective is to found Greater Israel – is ‘war without limits’ [i.e positively seeking huge collateral deaths] – a war without limits such as that which Genghis Khan practised: the total annihilation of other peoples and the suppression of their separate identities. A single power – the Hobbesian ‘Leviathan’ – achieved through disarming everyone. The ultimate aim being to suppress any plurality of wills. The flaw is that the Israelis, as the U.S. proxy force, have limited forces, both by numbers (it is a small army, dependent on reservists), and by being constrained by its ranks being drawn from a westernised, postmodern culture. 'Postmodern thinking has swept God, Nature, and Reason away. The individual replaces everything. Facts are only what he wants them to be… There are only fictions left—but these fictions are also all of reality. Western society thus begins to look very much like an insane asylum. Of course, this is only a collective paranoia: one bomb falls somewhere in our country, and very real realities, which mock our discourses, are destroyed and this philosophy collapses',warnsDr Henri Hude. This statement, directed more broadly at the West, however summarizes Israel exactly. The latter tries to substitute the Talmud as the epistemological basis of its society, yet young Israel is largely the same TikTok generation of individualists as in the West, whose ‘facts’ come only from what the government tells them to be. And as the bombs fall on Tel Aviv, the country sinks into collective paranoia and events mock the state panglossian discourses. At bottom, postmodernism places the highest priority on Life and individual freedom. The capacity to adapt to the brutalities of this style of limitless war therefore hangs very much on culture. To successfully adapt to the horror of death and destruction, one must accept the very idea of sacrifice and suffering – the spilling of blood to feed the earth towards new growth. Israel does not have a culture of sacrifice, but its adversaries do. If culture is unable to offer a meaning to the notion of sacrifice and loss, it does not put man in a position to face the tragedy of his condition. The war without limits ideology – purely theoretically – could be a thinkable solution: Ron Dermer, a former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. and confidant of Netanyahu,was askeda few months earlier what he saw as the solution to the Palestinian conflict. He replied that both the West Bank and Gaza must be totally dis-armed – 'yes'. Yet more important than disarmament, Dermer said, was the absolute necessity that all Palestinians be 'de-radicalised'. (This has now been extended to the whole region that must be ‘de-radicalised’). When asked to expand, Dermer pointed approvingly to the outcome of WW2: The Germans were defeated, but more plainly the Japanese were fully ‘de-radicalised’ at the end of the war. ‘De-radicalisation’ therefore means installing a Leviathan-esque 'despotism that reduces the majority to total powerlessness, including spiritual, intellectual and moral powerlessness. The total Leviathan is a unique, absolute and unlimited power, spiritual and temporal, over other humans', as Dr Henri Hude hasobserved. Thus, as postmodern culture sinks into the inhuman and favours the Leviathan – with the total annihilation of other peoples and the suppression of their separate identities – the question arises, could ‘war without limits’ work? Could such terror impose on the Middle East an unconditional surrender 'that would allow it to change profoundly, militarily, politically and culturally, and to transform as a satellite within Pax Americana?' Hude goes on to note, 'The conditions demanded of Japan by the USA were exorbitant, and it was to be expected that Japan would put up a tremendous resistance. The atrocious use of the bomb broke this resistance'. The clear response that Dr Hude gives in his bookPhilosophie de laGuerreis that war without limits cannot be the solution, because it cannot deliver long-lasting ‘deterrence’ or de-radicalisation.'On the contrary, it is the most certain cause of war. Ceasing to be rational, despising opponents who are more rational than it is, arousing opponents who are even less rational than it is.The Leviathan will fall; and even before its fall, no security is assured'. The latter gives two insights as to how Hude’s analysis might apply to today’s wars: One is that whenever postmodern culture capsizes into ‘necessary’ violence (which it hyper-culpabilises, since it prioritises life, rather than suffering), it can only justify the violence through evoking a more than absolute evil – the demonized enemy. Secondly, Hude identifies such extreme ‘will to power’ – without limits – as necessarily containing the psyche of self-destruction within it too. For the Leviathan to function, it must remain rational and powerful. Ceasing to be rational, despising opponents who are more rational, and angering opponents who are less rational than itis itself, the Leviathan then must fall. One respected military observer – Maj. Gen. (Res.) Itzhak Brik, a former senior IDF commander and a former long-serving IDF ombudsman – haswarnedagain of Israel’s looming fall: Netanyahu,Gallant and Halevi are gambling with Israel’s very existence… they never think for a moment about the day after.They are disconnected from reality and exercise no judgment…When the catastrophe strikes, it will already be too late…These three megalomaniacs imagine that they are capable of destroying both Hamas and Hizbullahand ending the ayatollahs’ regime in Iran…They want to accomplish everything through military pressure, but in the end, they won’t accomplish anything. They have put Israel on the brink of two impossible situations[–]the outbreak of a full-fledged war in the Middle East, [and secondly]continuing the war of attrition.In either situation, Israel won’t be able to survive for long. Only a diplomatic agreement has the power to extricate us from the quagmire into which these three men have dragged us. Israel teeters at the edge: It doesn’t have thenecessary forces; it doesn’t have a culture of tolerating persistent suffering; and it will not be able to impose itself over the plurality of resistance that it faces. Reason already is cast aside, its opponents are ridiculed: a ‘heroic’ preference for self-destruction has taken hold. ‘Masada’ is being spoken of.

Trump And The GOP Feeling It: Can They Win The Trifecta? – OpEd	By Tim Donner There are many ways to judge the state of a presidential or Senate race beyond the tsunami of polls we attempt to process in the run-up to Election Day. While the trajectory of national and swing-state polling appears to favor the former president with just days to go until all votes are cast, the behavior of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, and down-ballot candidates on both sides is arguably even more revealing. Trumpwas pumped up as he put it all on the line in a much-ballyhooed rally on Sunday night at New York’s Madison Square Garden. To the strains of a live version of God Bless the USA, the 45th president strode onto the stage of the world’s most famous arena, after being introduced to the overflow audience by his wife for the last major speech of his third and final presidential campaign of an era he has largely defined. He channeled Ronald Reagan by kicking off his speech with that oft-repeated rhetorical question: Are you better off than you were four years ago? He spoke of a new golden age and reprised his most famous phrase prior to entering the political stage: 'Kamala, you’re fired.' He accused Vice President Harris of 'shattering the middle class,' while promising to 'make America affordable again.' He promised to end inflation and stop the invasion of criminals on the southern border, and to 'build the greatest economy in the history of the world.' He reiterated his proposals to do away with taxes on tips, overtime, and social security benefits, and announced a new tax credit for caregivers, and making interest on car loans tax-deductible – but only for cars made in America. He reiterated his enthusiastic support for tariffs and used video clips about a vicious Venezuelan gang that has seized control of apartment complexes in Colorado and Texas, promising to reinstitute the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He called for the death penalty for killing a police officer and for making sanctuary cities illegal. The speech covered the waterfront, and – as most close observers say – Trump is in the zone, appearing happier than at any other time since he strode onto the political stage. And since we know the Donald loves nothing more than winning, that tells you something by itself. His speeches have become loftier, more uplifting, his rhetoric centering more around prospects for the future instead of grievances about the past. He has clearly adopted the stance of a Reagan-style happy warrior more than during his previous two campaigns for the White House. His recent maneuver atMcDonald’s,designed to embarrass Harris and her unverifiable claim that she worked at America’s favorite restaurant, revealed a comfortable and enduring connection between the New York billionaire and everyday Americans. A Contrasting Vision In the starkest of contrasts, Harris’s campaign of joy and vibes has transformed to pure dystopia. Unable to present a clear or compelling vision of what her presidency would look like or how she can reverse the economic and cultural decline of her own current administration, she has been reduced to scaring the bejesus out of the American people by projecting dark images of a fallen democracy if Trump returns to the Oval Office. That did not work for Hillary Clinton and her immensely damaging characterization of Trump voters as a basket of deplorables and irredeemables. It is likely to be even less effective this time around since Trump already served for four years without becoming the dictator Harris says he would be if he becomes the 47th president. Even many prominent Democrats have observed that Harris’ decline in October coincided with her pivot from a positive campaign to panicking voters about her opponent. Joe Biden finally let the cat out of the bag with his recent remark about Trump, saying that 'we need to lock him up.' The left has expended countless time and treasure trying to do exactly that. And while the fast-fading president tried to backtrack and say he didn’t mean what he had just said, it presented as what many call a Washington-style gaffe, meaning he was accidentally telling the truth. It is clear now, if it wasn’t before, that the Harris campaign has become convinced their candidate cannot win on her own merits. A remarkable reality is that, unlike the relentless legal warfare conducted on the watch of Biden and Harris, Trump as president did not target or attempt to imprison any of his numerous sworn enemies. So Harris is engaging in projection, a specialty on the left, meaning that she is projecting onto her opponent the very things encouraged by her own administration. But just in time for the final stage of the campaign, prompted by a savage hit piece inThe Atlantic, Harris has taken to calling Trump a fascist. And true to form, the scurrilous piece became news by itself, enabling other left-wing platforms to double down by referring to it in their naked pursuit of a Harris presidency. Richard Nixon, nothing if not an astute politician, once opined that when a campaign is focused solely on stopping a particular candidate, the person they are trying to stop will win. Essentially, the 37th president suggested that, if the only thing a candidate can do to win is warn about the horrors of their opponent, they will fail. Hillary Clinton learned that the hard way in 2016. But Harris appears to have nothing else left in her quiver. Exhibit A in her now singularly dystopian campaign is that she will make her final pitch to voters on Tuesday at the same venue where Trump famously spoke on 1/6/21, the Washington Ellipse, presumably in a last-ditch effort to frighten the electorate out of pulling the lever for her opponent. How effective will her 'threat to democracy'strategyprove to be? We can’t be sure, but it appears that ship has sailed, with even the most left-wing newspaper in the nation’s capital releasing a poll showing Trump outdistancing Harris on the question of who would do a better job handling threats to democracy in the US. If that’s true, the Harris tank is all but empty. The Schedule Tells All A candidate’s schedule is always the most revealing about how their campaign views the race. If Trump was insecure about winning, he would not have expended valuable campaign time to visit deep-blue California to boost the prospects of a Republican House candidate. He would not spend time in the reliably blue Bronx or New Jersey – or hold Sunday’s rally at Madison Square Garden. He would not show up at bodegas, barber shops, and union meetings pressing the flesh with small groups of voters. With his seemingly bottomless cup of energy, he is still crisscrossing the critical Rust Belt and Sun Belt states, but if he appeared to be losing, he would spend every waking moment there, which, outside of mostly friendly interviews, is exactly what Harris is doing. It should not be surprising that the campaign has come to this for Harris. She bombed out and never made it to the starting line in her own generously funded presidential campaign in 2019 because she had no coherent message. Four years later, her lack of clarity and propensity for dodging direct questions with indecipherable word salads is typified by her recent response to a question from CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Asked why her proposed programs to boost the economy and lower prices with taxpayer-funded schemes to give money to new homeowners and small businesses, and using the federal government to stop 'price-gouging,' were not accomplished in the almost four years of her current administration, she replied, 'Well there was a lot that was done but there’s more to do, Anderson. I’m pointing out things that need to be done that haven’t been done that need to be done.' A Trump and Congressional Trifecta? The consequences of Harris’s wavering campaign are not limited to the presidential race. As usual, the down-ballot effect is unmistakable. By most accounts, the VP has received multiple appeals – 'thanks, but no thanks' – not to appear alongside candidates in competitive House races or swing-state Senate contests. To further accentuate the point, as their once-comfortable leads tighten to the point of turning into toss-ups, incumbent Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, plus Ellissa Slotkin, vying for an open seat in Michigan, have actually run ads highlighting their agreement with Trump on issues where Democrats fear any connection to Harris or Biden. Casey brags that 'he bucked Biden to protect fracking and he’s fighting with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating.' Baldwin’s ad boasts that 'Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill,' while Slotkin proclaims that she 'wrote a law signed by President Trump forcing drug companies to show their actual prices.' For Harris operatives, the reaction to these Senate candidates tying themselves to Trump – while not once mentioning Harris – must have been something along the lines of … ugh. With West Virginia all but certain to go red after incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin retired, and GOP challenger Tim Sheehy holding a big lead over Jon Tester in Montana (eight points in theReal Clear Politicsaverage), the barn door already appears closed on Democrats sustaining their current slim majority in the Senate. Now it has become a matter of how many seats the Democrats can protect. The possibility of a 53- or 54-seat Republican majority appears realistic. The GOP already holds a narrow majority in the House, and while limited polling is available in the 30 or so races considered competitive, 'ticket-splitting' by voters who support Trump but also the Democratic House candidate would appear to be their best hope for winning control of the lower chamber. But as PBS has reported, 'Split-ticket voters —people who vote for candidates from different parties — are increasingly rare in modern American politics.' For what it’s worth, according toPolitico, some seven weeks ago, when Trump was trailing, 'House Speaker Mike Johnson told other Republicans … that he is ‘100 percent’ convinced the GOP will win both chambers of Congress and the White House.' If Kamala Harris cannot change the current trajectory of the presidential race, Donald Trump and Republicans stand a better-than-even shot of winning the trifecta – control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Should that come to pass, a Trump second-term agenda will have a relatively unobstructed path to achieving the major change a majority of Americans say they desire.

Georgia’s Crisis: Disputed Election Reveals Putin’s Power Struggl...	Georgia is at the center of a political and geopolitical confrontation, with allegations of electoral fraud fueled by suspicions of pro-Russian interference. While President Salome Zurabishvili denounces vote rigging, imprisoned pro-European former President Mikheil Saakashvili calls for mobilization to protect the country’s European future. This crisis raises crucial questions for Europe and its eastern borders. It’s a 'stolen election' and a 'constitutional coup,' the opposition claims. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, pro-Western and at odds with the government but without real power, protested against the 'total falsification' of the election by a 'Russian operation.' Imprisoned for three years after a sham trial, the pro-European reformist former president Mikheil Saakashvili calls from his cell for 'massive demonstrations' to 'show the world that we are fighting for freedom.' Ballot-box stuffing, vote-buying, voter intimidation and, above all, a profoundly unfair campaign, the Georgian Dream, the misnamed state party created by pro-Russian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose personal fortune accounts for at least a quarter of the gross domestic product (GDP) of this small trans-Caucasian ex-Soviet republic of 3.7 million people, spared no expense to ensure victory. Throughout the campaign, he denounced what he called 'the world war party,' meaning the West. Voting for the pro-European opposition is to risk ending up like Ukraine,' hammered the party that has ruled Georgia unchallenged for twelve years. Its posters showed the ruins of Ukrainian cities to suggest what might happen if the pro-Europeans won. They made every effort to make voting difficult, if not impossible, for a diaspora largely supportive of joining the EU. The results of the vote are all the more surprising because in the early hours of the morning, the projections gave a large lead to the opposition, whose four components had finally managed to form a united front after years of division. Putin Accused of Stealing Georgia’s Future 'Europe can and must prevent the Putinists from robbing the Georgians of their European future, because this vote will also have consequences for the Western world,' stresses Thornike Gordadzé, lecturer at Sciences-Po, associate researcher at the Jacques Delors Institute and former Georgian Minister for European Integration (2010-2012). What is at stake in Tbilisi directly affects Europeans because it could determine the eastern borders of the European Union. And Russia is on the offensive. In Moldova, a week earlier, the choice of Europe came down to a handful of votes in a referendum that polls had shown to be a foregone conclusion. In Georgia, the ruling party won, officially with 53%, but with obvious fraud. Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), NATO, and EU bodies described the vote as 'marred by inequalities [between candidates], pressure, and tension. Georgians, especially the youngest and most dynamic segments of society, starting with the cities, where two-thirds of Georgians live, dream of Europe. The tens of thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets of the capital a week before the vote bear witness to this. The government is well aware of this desire for Europe and has long maintained an ambiguous stance, with statements such as 'We want Europe, but at our own pace and with respect for Georgian specifics, with the very conservative, illiberal and pro-Russian Hungarian leader Viktor Orban as our model'. EU Accession Process Blocked Despite Georgia’s recognition as a candidate country last spring, a year after Ukraine and Moldova, the authorities are making every effort to obstruct the process. In May, the country was rocked by mass demonstrations against a law on 'foreign influence,' inspired by Russia’s 'foreign agents' legislation, which has been used to crush civil society. Brussels immediately froze the country’s accession to the European Union (EU), and the United States imposed sanctions on Georgian officials. With these largely rigged elections in favor of Ivanishvili and his party, the Kremlin appears poised to achieve in Georgia what it is trying to impose by force of arms in Ukraine. There are many similarities between the fates of these two former Soviet republics. Georgians and Ukrainians swept away pro-Russian governments with the 'Rose Revolution' in Tbilisi in 2003 and the 'Orange Revolution' in Kyiv in 2004. Both represented an open challenge to Vladimir Putin in what Russia considers its 'near abroad' and zone of influence. Kyiv and Tbilisi jointly applied for NATO membership at the Bucharest Summit in June 2008, with the support of George W. Bush, who even visited Georgia in 2005. Opposition from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel derailed the attempt. Moscow Still Controls 20% of Georgia’s Territory The 2008 compromise stated in official documents that Ukraine and Georgia would join 'one day,' without setting dates or detailed commitments. This was the worst-case scenario, as it gave Putin a direct incentive to act preemptively, which he did two months later by attacking recalcitrant Georgian regions in August 2008. Since then, Moscow still controls 20% of Georgian territory in the hands of the self-proclaimed separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Bidzina Ivanishvili’s party finally defeated reformist leader Mikheil Saakashvili in the 2012 elections. In Ukraine, too, the pro-Russian government regained power before being swept aside by the Maidan Revolution in 2014 because it refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union and was preparing to sign one with Putin. The Georgian issue has an obvious geopolitical dimension for Russia and the European Union. With its gateway to the Black Sea, Georgia is an essential link in the corridor that allows Central Asia and Azerbaijan to transport their exports—including hydrocarbons—to European markets without depending on Moscow. Georgia’s connection to Europe is also vital to Armenia and its government, which is attempting a bold pivot to the West after losing the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. On September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan wiped the Republic of Artsakh off the map in a lightning military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter battle for control of Nagorno-Karabakh. While Armenia triumphed in the first war, Azerbaijan, like a shrewd strategist, has patiently consolidated its position, gaining strength and influence on the international stage. Last year, Armenia lost its ultimate geopolitical leverage, leaving it completely at the mercy of Turkey and Azerbaijan. For Moscow, control of the Trans-Caucasus is all the more strategic because it provides territorial continuity with its Iranian ally. Orban’s Support The Europeans have little room for maneuver. Closing the door on Georgia’s accession would be a victory for Moscow’s strategy of intimidation. Sanctions would only punish the Georgian population, which lives from hand to mouth. Nevertheless, it is possible to imagine personal sanctions against Ivanishvili, who has considerable assets in Europe and holds a French passport. One thing is certain: the indecisiveness and ambiguity of Western messages can only encourage Moscow to interfere more and more in Georgia, and a clear, coherent voice is urgently needed. All the more so since the pro-Russian regime also enjoys support within the European Union, starting with Hungary’s illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who hailed the 'crushing victory of the Georgian dream.' His country holds the EU presidency this semester, and he was in Tbilisi on October 28 for a two-day visit. This provocation comes at a time when the President of the European Council is urging the Georgian election authorities to 'investigate' 'irregularities.' Washington is also calling for an investigation into fraud. But these responses remain inadequate. Georgia is a test case for the West. On November 3, Moldovan voters go to the polls for the second round of a presidential election that promises to be very close, and Russia is on the offensive, notably through a relentless information war denounced in Moldova by outgoing President Maia Sandu and in Georgia by Salome Zourabichvili.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz_nYK1so0SVc	2024-10-29T16:42:58-07:00	
Mali And Algeria Feud Over How To Handle Tuareg Rebellion	Tensions between Algeria and Mali are growing over how to resolve Mali’s ongoing Tuareg rebellion, which has continued for more than a decade. Algeria supports a negotiated settlement that addresses the rebels’ concerns and builds off a 2015 agreement. Mali’s ruling junta favors a military response. 'Algeria fears that these escalating tensions could lead to a successful Tuareg separatist movement, which would inspire marginalized ethnic groups across Algeria, Niger and Libya to pursue autonomy,' analyst Assala Khettache wrote recently for the Royal United Services Institute. 'A Tuareg breakaway in Mali could potentially destabilize an already fragile Sahel region, with Algeria’s southern borders especially vulnerable.' The Algeria-Mali relationship has degraded over the past year as Mali’s junta has accused Algeria of interfering in its internal affairs by meeting with rebels. In December 2023, both countries recalled their ambassadors. Algeria has led efforts to mediate peace between Malian leaders and the Tuareg groups. This mediation produced the 2015 Algiers Accords between the former Malian government and the Tuareg Coordination of Azawad Movements. 'Algeria strongly supported the 2015 peace agreement and attempted to salvage the deal in December 2023 due to fears that renewed hostilities in Mali would mobilize the Tuareg population in Algeria and cause refugees to flee into Algeria,' analyst Liam Karr wrote recently for the Institute for the Study of War. Mali’s ruling junta has accused Algeria of harboring rebels. In January 2024, the junta ended Mali’s participation in the Algiers Accords as it ramped up attacks on rebels. In July, Mali’s military, backed by Russian mercenaries with Africa Corps (formerly the Wagner Group), were ambushed by Tuareg rebels while en route to attack the Malian side of Tinzaouaten, a community that straddles the border with Algeria. The ambush by the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security and Development killed dozens of Malian soldiers and Russian mercenaries. Although the exact number of dead remains in dispute, observers consider the fight to be the deadliest encounter for Russia’s mercenary group since it arrived in Mali in 2021. 'The ambush brought Algeria’s security concerns to the forefront, exposing the fragility of its borders and deepening its diplomatic dilemma over how to counter Russian-backed forces in the Sahel without jeopardizing its crucial relationship with Moscow,' Khettache wrote. Mali and its Russian allies followed up a month later with a drone attack on the community that killed 20 civilians and prompted a war of words between Algeria and Mali at the United Nations. Tinzaouaten has been a base for both Tuareg rebels and Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, the Sahelien branch of al-Qaida, since the two groups expelled the Malian military in 2012. The Tinzaouaten ambush and follow-up drone attack became another flashpoint in the relationship between the two nations even as they have both welcomed Russian influence — Algeria directly through long-standing ties with Moscow; Mali through its 2021 invitation to Africa Corps. Despite their common ties with Russia, Algeria’s opposition to the Africa Corps means it is unlikely to help Mali put down its rebellion by force, Karr noted. That enables rebels to retreat across the porous border with Algeria to outlast and outmaneuver Malian forces, he added. Algeria has called on the U.N. to demand an end to mercenary presence in Mali. However, Russia is unlikely to remove them because they have become a key tool for exerting influence in the Sahel, according to Karr. 'Mali is a vital piece in the Kremlin’s strategic ambitions in Africa,' he added. 'Mali is also a crucial partner for Russia’s broader political project in the Sahel.' Moscow’s continued support for Africa Corps in Mali could strain its ties with Algeria and force Algeria to rethink its preference for settling conflicts with diplomacy, according to observers. 'As tensions rise, Algeria faces the delicate task of balancing its critical partnership with Russia while considering whether military intervention in Mali is necessary to safeguard its interests,' Khettache wrote.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz0ZWHIOukhKO	2024-10-29T16:41:33-07:00	
Houthis Attack Ashkelon, Ships Off Yemeni Coast	By Saeed Al-Batati Yemen’s Houthi militia said on Tuesday it launched drones at the Israeli city of Ashkelon a day after claiming to have attacked several ships in international waters off Yemen. In a statement, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said drones were launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, claiming they 'successfully' struck their target, and vowing to carry out more attacks until Israel ends its military operations in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Israeli media reported explosions in Ashkelon and in Nahariya caused by another drone fired from Lebanon. The Israeli military said the drone launched from Yemen landed in a 'open area' in Ashkelon. 'Following an initial examination regarding the UAV that fell in an open area in Ashkelon in southern Israel earlier today, it was determined that the UAV was launched from Yemen,' it said in a statement. Previous Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israel triggered two waves of retaliatory airstrikes by Israeli warplanes, which struck power stations, ports, and fuel storage facilities in the western city of Hodeidah, which the Houthis control, in July and September. Sarea said in a broadcast on Monday night the Houthis also attacked three ships in the Arabian Sea, Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait, the latest in a series of attacks on maritime trade in a campaign the group claims is in support of the people of Palestine and Lebanon. He identified the ships as the SC Montreal, which was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea, the Maersk Kowloon, which was attacked with a cruise missile while sailing in the Red Sea, and the Motaro, which was attacked in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait with multiple ballistic missiles. The three ships were targeted because their parent companies violated a ban on sailing to Israeli ports, Sarea said. All three ships are Liberian-flagged vessels. The SC Montreal is sailing from the Seychelles to Oman. The Maersk Kowloon is sailing from Oman to an unknown destination, and the Motaro from Russia to China. The Houthi statement came hours after the UK Maritime Trade Operations, an agency that documents ship attacks, reported on Monday that the master of the Motaro, sailing 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha town on the Red Sea, reported three explosions at various intervals near the ship, but that the vessel and its crew were safe. The Joint Maritime Information Center identified the attacked ship as the M/V Motaro, 'on transit' from Ust Luga in Russia to Shanghai, adding that the ship had no connection to Israel, the US, or the UK, and it could have been attacked because another ship owned by the same company visited Israel. 'Indirectly (through multiple layers), within the ownership structure, JMIC has discovered a subsidiary linkage to a vessel visiting an Israeli port in the recent past,' the JMIC said. Since November, the Houthis have seized a commercial ship — the Galaxy Leader — and its crew, sunk two others, and set fire to several more, firing hundreds of ballistic missiles, drones, and drone boats at civilian and naval ships in the group’s campaign. Critics dispute the Houthi claims of support for the Palestinians or Lebanon, arguing that the beleaguered militia used the conflict to recruit new fighters, increase public support, deploy forces in contested areas, and silence voices calling on the Houthis to repair crumbling services and pay public employees.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz_Vg2C1-Hqi8	2024-10-29T16:40:39-07:00	
Inside The CIA’s (Largely) Secret Role In The Tibetan Resistance ...	By Tenzin Pema, Dorjee Damdul, Passang Dhonden, and Lobsang Gelek High up in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, at 9,200 feet, lies Camp Hale – widely known as the birthplace of backcountry skiing and the training grounds of the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division soldiers who fought the Nazis in World War II. Lesser known, however, is the camp’s storied past as the CIA-operated secret training facility for Tibetan resistance fighters in the early 1960’s. The Tibetan fighters who trained there – from 1958 to 1964 – were a part of a nationwide armed resistance movement in Tibet against Communist China. Sixty years after the end of the operation, Camp Hale has yielded a new secret. Called 'The Ranch' by the CIA and fondly referred to as 'Dumra,' or garden, by the Tibetans, it was the training ground for at least 259 Tibetan fighters who were then parachuted back into Tibet and what is today Nepal to aid the Tibetan resistance against China. Yet, until recently the exact location of the CIA’s training facility for Tibetans was lost to history. Quite like the story of Tibet’s armed resistance against China and the CIA’s role in it, it had remained shrouded in secrecy for many decades. Decades after the CIA dismantled Camp Hale, leaving no trace of the site— save for a few ruins of bunkers— the original footprint of the Tibetan training camp was finally identified in 2024 within the 53,804-acre expanse of alpine valley, thanks to the work of a dogged academic, a local hiker, and a former CIA trainer. In June, the families of former fighters, their supporters, and the Central Tibetan Administration’s Cabinet Minister for Security, Gyari Dolma, gathered to honor the resistance movement. Bruce Walker, now 91, is the last surviving CIA case officer out of about 30 officers who trained the Tibetan fighters at Camp Hale. 'I’m the last speaking CIA officer who can tell the story,' Walker told Radio Free Asia in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the June commemoration ceremony. His tale of the time spent there reveals the spirit of a people deeply committed to their cause who drew on a wellspring of grit, ingenuity and ability to learn the skills Camp Hale had to offer. Finding Dumra Following the People’s Liberation Army’s invasion of Tibet in 1949, thousands of ordinary Tibetans rose up in a series of independent uprisings in the 1950s to defend their country and religion against Chinese troops. In 1958, the Chushi Gangdruk army, a unified resistance force, was formally established. Led by Gompo Tashi Andrugtsang, a charismatic trader living in Lhasa, it later became known as the Chushi Gangdruk Tensung Danglang Magar or Tibetan National Volunteer Defence Army, a name it was given by a tutor to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In 1960, they set up a base in Mustang, then a small kingdom in Nepal, where they were exiled, until they were eventually forced to lay down their arms in 1974. For a large part of this period, the movement received covert financial support and training from the CIA, with four contingents of Tibetan troops flown in to train at Camp Hale from 1958 to 1964. Yet it was a secret even to those who lived nearby the Colorado training grounds. 'The local community here in Colorado still don’t know the Tibetan history of Camp Hale – much in the same way that the Tibetan community still don’t know much of the history of Chushi Gangdruk or CIA in Camp Hale,' said Carole McGranahan, an anthropologist and scholar of Tibet who spent years working to locate the site. Indeed, a false story was circulated at the time to maintain the secrecy of the training site and keep the locals at bay. 'Atom Unit Making Tests Near Leadville,' read a headline from the Denver Post in July 1959, after the press was informed that the Defense Atomic Support Agency would soon be conducting atomic testing programs at Camp Hale. 'I like to think of it now as that it was hidden in plain sight,' said McGranahan, noting how the CIA maintained the secrecy of the camp for over four decades. Word of the camp and the CIA’s role in training Tibetan fighters there only began to trickle out in the early 2000s following the declassification ofa 1964-dated CIA memorandum. A documentary released just before, titled Shadow Circus: The CIA in Tibet, by filmmakers Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin, also drew attention to the Tibetan resistance movement, even as additional details began to emerge from books, such McGranahan’s Arrested Histories, and interviews of former CIA trainers. Still, the site itself continued to remain hidden. In 2010, a plaque was installed to mark the U.S. government’s first public acknowledgment of the CIA-Tibet training camp. But even then, the exact location of the training site was unknown. Following a ceremony to mark its installation, retired CIA officers and former Tibetan fighters went looking for the original Camp Hale training grounds. The group included Roger McCarthy and Ken Knauss, the two CIA officers who had worked on the original campaign. But they came back frustrated and dismayed that they couldn’t locate the site where they had lived and worked for several years, McGranahan said. She promised to make it her mission to locate the original site. It would take years, but true to her word, McGranahan, with the help of Vail Valley local resident and hiker Tracy Walters, took on the mission. The duo took with them old photographs of Camp Hale and, while snowshoeing, matched the 1963-1964 photos to the current landscape by carefully aligning specific ridgelines to locate Dumra. In February 2024, they found the first location – rather easily, McGranahan says. 'The second one was more difficult,' she added, explaining that it required matching up the visual angles of old photographs to the physical topography of the land until they hit on the right spot. 'But we found it,' she said. She then turned to Walker and to filmmakers Sonam and Sarin for final confirmation on whether the site they had located was indeed Dumra. Walker, who was the only Tibetan-speaking CIA trainer from 1960 until the CIA shut the site in 1964, responded the very next day. 'You nailed it,' he wrote. 'You found the site. And I’m the one who took those photographs.' An operation misunderstood? Along with his wife and few friends, Walker came to Camp Hale from California in June to honor the Tibetan soldiers who he trained in the covert operation which the CIA code-named ST Circus. Now an elegant white-haired nonagenarian, Walker lit up as he recalled his time working on ST Circus, his voice filled with energy as he explained the backstory of the secret mission and smiling fondly as he recalled the commitment of the Tibetan fighters whom he had trained. 'The covert operation was misunderstood in some respects… [there’s] the impression that the Americans in the CIA were taking advantage of the Tibetans. We were not,' Walker told RFA Tibetan. 'Tibetans in the 1950s and 60s had very few international friends… in the late 1950s, the American government and the CIA were the few from the international community that were willing to come to the aid of the Tibetans,' he said. Indeed, the CIA would support the movement with training, aid, and arms until the early 1970s. 'We did what we could to get them their aid. We were not going to send an army and we were not going to send tanks, but we tried to send help to Chushi Gangdruk to fight and to make progress in the rest of the country,' said Walker. At Camp Hale, over a dozen CIA case officers trained Tibetan fighters on a full range of combat and operations skills. 'This site was specifically used for the purpose of training radio teams who would be parachuted back to Tibet to join the resistance forces and to send back messages about the situation – the resistance inside Tibet – on a real-time basis,' Walker told RFA Tibetan. Over the years, the soldiers who trained there were air dropped into Tibet and in Mustang, Nepal, where they aided and trained the thousands of resistance fighters stationed at those locations. It was actually not the first site for ST Circus. Earlier, the CIA had piloted the project with a group of fighters who were trained at Saipan, Northern Mariana Island. The first radio team to be dropped back into Tibet by Operations St Circus took place in September, 1957 – but the training grounds were moved to Camp Hale when it became apparent that the Tibetans were not used to the hot weather conditions of the island, and Colorado was selected because its terrain and weather conditions resembled that of Tibet. Life at Camp Hale Walker’s first assignment with the Tibetan project had been as a caretaker and cook for six weeks for the small contingent of Tibetans who trained at Saipan. He first arrived in Camp Hale as a case officer in April 1960, but he would not be at the camp on a permanent basis until two years later, after the CIA sent him for periods of more language training. Sporting a red beard and looking like an 'adventurous American', Walker returned to Camp Hale in September 1962, where he found the site had been renovated with new quarters added and ready to open its doors to the fourth and final batch of trainees who arrived in October that year. The camp had four classrooms, one recreation room, one staff barracks, one administration office, a gym, a mess hall, and a storage room. The Tibetan fighters had a rigorous training program there. 'It was a very busy campus,' Walker recalled, with the trainees always 'practicing one thing or another, or they were in the classrooms.' It was a huge time of learning for Walker too. 'I started out as a case officer who was not speaking Tibetan, giving instruction and compass reading to find locations on a very special map made by the CIA,' he said. He eventually gained enough proficiency to communicate directly with the trainees. 'It was a very different career change in speaking a different language to an entirely different people who I had never met before,' he reflected. The Tibetans were trained in radio operation; surveillance and combat maneuvers; parachuting at Fort Carson, another military base in Colorado; intelligence collecting; clandestine exchange of written material and film; world history and geography; and small armament training with bazookas, grenades and rifles. 'All were given training with the M1-Garand rifle, and the old 10th mountain division rifle range. Two marine sharpshooters were seconded to this project and they also gave the Tibetans instructions in self defense and jiu jitsu,' Walker said. Walker and the other CIA officers admired the Tibetan fighters, who had volunteered for the movement and had been recruited as exiles in India. They represented Tibetans from all over Tibet and came with varying backgrounds; they even included monks who had temporarily given up their vows to fight for the Tibet cause. 'They were not paid. They were simply willing and able… And boy, were they able,' said Walker. They were also quick learners, he recalled. 'They were enthusiastic, they listened, and they took to the training immediately. Above all, they were happy to be here... And it was a real pleasure to work with them in that respect because they made it easier for us to get to know them and to try to accomplish through the training,' he added. Tibetan curiosity, resilience The CIA officers were amazed by the Tibetan curiosity and ability to invent solutions to problems with the materials at hand, said Walker. There was one instance, where the fighters had reportedly made a portable rocket, apparently out of a wooden trough, using gunpowder, homemade napalm, and a small warhead, he said, citing a local Vail Daily report. The Tibetans also had a natural gift for volleyball and engaged in highly competitive tournaments. On weekends, movies would be projected in the recreation room and headquarters would send new movies on a rotation basis. The Tibetans, without any surprise, liked western movies. But their favorite was The King and I. 'Their response was a pure delight to watch,' Walker said. They also had a 'remarkable talent' for drawing, Walker said. Crayons and colored pens were made available for drawing and few of their drawings became collectibles, including an illustration that a Tibetan fighter had made representing Chinese desecration of Tibetan culture and religion which was used in CIA material. On Saturday nights, the Tibetans took over the kitchen from the CIA cooks Joe and Bill, and would make Tibetan dishes like momo and shabaley. But they didn’t (strictly) stick to this routine. One day, a shepherd from the area — who had a longstanding agreement with the government for him to traverse Camp Hale with his sheep as he led them to summer pastureland — found one sheep missing when he returned with the sheep after a month of their grazing. 'His route happened to go directly past the Tibetan compound. Not wanting to cause suspicion by denying the shepherd his annual drive, we arranged for the compound to close up tightly, presumably with everyone inside the compound and out of sight,' said Walker. Upon his return, having led his herd through the compound and out of Camp Hale, the herder soon counted his sheep and found he was missing one. 'He reported his loss to army authorities and the situation was brought to our attention. We had no recourse but to suggest the sheep must have drifted from the herd, gone astray and could not be found,' Walker said. 'Somehow we found out that two Tibetans had waylaid the sheep and later roasted it and brought it into the compound for the fellow Tibetans to eat. The herder was angry and unsatisfied but as far as we were concerned, it was out of sight, out of mind.' Best and bravest In 1960, part of the training was to practice parachute landing in advance of being airdropped in Tibet. However, aftera U.S. civilian pilot was shot down over Russiain May 1960, President Eisenhower banned further overflights into Tibet. Thereafter, the radio teams and the support teams were flown back to Thailand, and over land to border posts in India and Nepal, including Mustang. Walker acknowledged the grim reality that awaited these men upon their return to Tibet. 'They knew what would be the consequences if they were parachuted to Tibet,' Walker said somberly. 'A lot of the Tibetans who were trained on the radio teams that were parachuted in gave their lives. They were captured. Some of them went to jail, and a few of them were released, in time,' he said. 'But there were a lot of heroes — as this will attest — who sacrificed their lives as Tibetans.' An important legacy The training program at Camp Hale was closed in 1964 as the U.S. began to take a more conciliatory approach to China. CIA support for the Tibetan resistance movement ended altogether in the early 1970s as the Nixon administration took an approach of engagement with Mao’s Communist regime. Along with increased pressure from the Nepali government, which also began to cultivate warmer ties with China and internal fissures that emerged within the movement itself, the Chushi Gangdruk was forced to lay down its arms by 1974. Though the program wound down, a legacy, including crucial successes, came from the Operation ST Circus trainings that has significance today, even if the resistance movement ultimately did not achieve independence. For example, the first radio team ever trained as part of the CIA operation at Saipan – two fighters, Athar Norbu and Gatsetsang Lotse (codenamed Tom and Luke, respectively) – were airdropped in September 1957. The team, known as Team A, were able to contact local Chushi Gangdruk members in Kham, eastern Tibet, and reach Lhasa, making contact with Tibetan leaders such as the Lord Chamberlain, Thupten Phalha. As explained by Gyolo Thondup in his book The Noodle Maker of Kalimpong, the Dalai Lama was not directly involved in the CIA operations, as it was impossible for him to condone any use of violence when his entire life was committed to nonviolent Buddhist practice. But some high-ranking officials such as Lord Chamberlain Phalha knew about the resistance from the beginning and were sympathetic to its cause. 'It was Phalha who organized the Dalai Lama’s escape... Team A accompanied the Dalai Lama on his journey to the Indian border from where they radioed CIA Langley that the Dalai Lama had arrived safely,' said Walker. In the Dalai Lama’s personal autobiography titled My Land, My People, the spiritual leader acknowledged the bravery of the Tibetan freedom fighters who accompanied him undercover into exile in 1959. 'In spite of my beliefs, I very much admired their courage and their determination to carry on the grim battle they had started for our freedom, culture, and religion,' he wrote. 'I thanked them for their strength and bravery, and also, more personally, for the protection they had given me.' The Dalai Lama’s escape into exile and the role the Chushi Gangdruk played in his safe escort from Lhasa to India is till today regarded as the movement’s most significant achievement.Today, plans are afoot to build a memorial on the now-rediscovered exact training ground. The plaque that was installed in 2010 stands not too far away, its inscription attesting to the bravery of those involved: From 1958 to 1964, Camp Hale played an important role as a training site for Tibetan Freedom Fighters. Trained by the CIA, many of these brave men lost their lives in the struggle for freedom. ‘They were the best and bravest of their generation, and we wept together when they were killed fighting alongside their countrymen.’ (Orphans of the Cold War, by John Kenneth Knaus). This plaque is dedicated to their memory. Standing by the plaque, at the site he’d played a part in re-discovering and which brought back so many memories, Walker mused over the friendships gained and lost to history. 'It was an emotional parting because we became very good friends with the Tibetans and they with us. We bonded, and we were sorry that we had to break it up the way we did,' he said.

Voiceless Guam Feels ‘Injustice’ Of US Presidential Non-Vote	By Mar-Vic Cagurangan Voters in the U.S. territory of Guam will be the country’s first to cast their choice for president on Nov. 5 but it will be a symbolic and democratically meaningless exercise. As the mainland gets to have its say on who will be president, an anomaly in U.S. law means Guamanians are among the four million disenfranchised Americans living in U.S. territories whose vote doesn’t count. Politics is a hot topic on the streets of the capital Haganta – which lies 8,000 miles from Washington and 2,500 miles from Beijing – as they will pick a governor, local legislature and a non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives next week. Right at the bottom of their two-page ballot form, residents can also mark a box for their preferred presidential candidate. Sample ballot paper for Haganta for the Nov. 5 election with the straw poll question on presidential candidates at the end. [Guam Election Commission] Bearing the slogan 'Where America’s Day Begins,' Guam is 14 hours ahead of Washington time and this straw poll is considered a strong indicator of how the rest of the nation will vote. Guamanians who relocate to the mainland automatically acquire full-fledged American status in a perplexing political anomaly that creates two classes of U.S citizenship. 'Compared to only doing a mock vote back home, I feel it’s a privilege to actually be able to vote,' said Zita T. Winemiller, a retired journalist who moved to Jonesboro, Arkansas in 2017. 'Guam and all the other U.S. territories should really be a part of the voting process and included in decisions affecting all U.S. citizens,' she told BenarNews. Since the first presidential straw poll in 1980, when Guam voted for Jimmy Carter over the winner Ronald Reagan, it has reflected the mainland result, except again in2016 when they voted forHillary Clintonahead ofDonald Trump. Seven presidents have visited the territory, but mostly as a pitstop en-route to Asia, including Richard Nixon during his historic trip to China in 1972. People who live on the mainland and move back to Guam again become disenfranchised. 'I have always felt the emotional injustice,' said Ginger Cruz, the Democrats' candidate for Guam’s non-voting delegate in Washington. She returned in 2019 after living in the mainland for many years and is campaigning for Guam to have greater oversight from the White House. 'Presidential elections have a major impact on Guam. Given that two of the three legs of our economy are federally funded and everything we dois subject to federal law, we are highly impacted by presidential policies,' Cruz said. While territorial delegates can introduce bills and advocate for their territory in the U.S. Congress, they have no voice on the floor. Guam was colonized by the Spanish 1688 and ceded to the U.S. in 1898. Efforts since the 1990s to hold a non-binding plebiscite for Guamanians to choose between independence, statehood or free association with the U.S. have been struck down by the courts.It is one of 17 non-self-governing territories on the U.N.’s decolonization list. While Guam is exempted from paying the U.S. federal income tax, many argue that such a waiver does not make up for what the tiny island brings to the table. The territory is a lynchpin in the superpower’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific region and the population of 153,000 has one of the nation’s highest military enlistment rates per capita. Often referred to as the 'tip of the U.S. military spear', due to its proximity to China, the Department of Defence owns one-third of Guam lands. The territory is home to major air force, naval and army bases, five fast-attack submarines, and is awaiting about 5,000 Marines being relocated from Okinawa in Japan. Another legal contradiction is mainland Americans – including military personnel – who live in foreign countries can cast presidential absentee ballots, but not if they reside in a U.S. territory. Joyce McClure, a former New York State resident, relocated to Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2015 and voted by absentee ballot in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. national elections. 'I am proud to say I have never missed an election in 56 years, a period during which I have lived in seven different states, one foreign country and one territory,' McClure told BenarNews. She relocated to the U.S. territory and 'as a Guam resident, I voted in the 2022 Guam elections.' McClure moved back to the states last year and has just cast her mail-in ballot for president from her current home in Virginia. Guamanians who live abroad are able to cast absentee votes in their local elections. 'My son, grandchildren and sisters, nieces and nephews are still in Guam. I will always be interested in what goes on there,' said Berni Penaflor, now a resident of Washington State voting for president for the third time since moving in 2014. Other U.S. territories also affected by the law in the Pacific include neighboring Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa, along with U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean. Voter participation in Guam’s elections has dropped from above 70 percent in 2014 to 40 percent in the 2022 poll for the delegate to the House of Representatives.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHzwWlBfkq6SaY	2024-10-29T16:37:27-07:00	
US Reiterates ‘One China’ Policy Amid Reports Of Xi’s Request On ...	By Patsy Widakuswara Resisting pressure from Beijing to publicly reject independence for Taiwan, the Biden administration underscores there is no change in its 'one China' policy which takes no stand on the issue. 'We do not support Taiwan independence. We expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion,' a senior administration official told VOA Tuesday, underscoring long-standing U.S. policy on the thorny issue. 'We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.' The confirmation followed reports thatduring their last in-person meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden to change the language the administration uses when discussing its position on Taiwan independence. On the sidelines of the APEC meeting near San Francisco last November, Xi reportedly told Biden he wants the U.S. to use language stating it 'opposes' instead of 'does not support' independence for Taiwan, the current phrase used in U.S. official statements. The administration has been 'consistent on our long-standing one China policy,' the official said. Under the policy, the U.S. acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan. It considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. Beijing’s push for stronger language is not new. Ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting last year, VOA reported that Foreign Minister Wang Yi also made the request in his meetings with U.S. counterparts. The Chinese have been asking for this shift, and in some instances falsely asserting that the U.S. position is to oppose Taiwanese independence, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'I find it unlikely that the United States will take this advice without some substantial concession from China on its own position about Taiwan,' Cooper told VOA. 'I doubt this will get any traction in Washington unless it is part of a longer-term conversation about de-escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.' Biden and Xi likely to meet again in person next month in South America, where both are expected to attend an APEC meeting in Lima, Peru, and a G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It will likely be Biden’s last meeting with the Chinese leader before leaving office in January. 'It will probably be an opportunity for the two leaders to say goodbye and for their teams to wrap up a couple of loose ends, perhaps including an announcement or two on people-to-people issues,' said Cooper. Beijing is no doubt gearing up for a change in U.S. administration ahead of the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Both have vowed to be tough on China, with Trump saying he would impose '150% to 200%' tariffs on China if it sought to blockade Taiwan. Flared tensions Cross-strait tensions have flared many times in recent years. On Sunday, Taiwan's defense ministry said Chinese warplanes and warships carried out another 'combat patrol' near the island, following Beijing’s threat to respond with countermeasures to a $2 billion arms sale by the United States. The administration announced it approved the package last week, which includes its first delivery of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, advanced weapons that have been battle-tested in Ukraine. Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and Washington is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself. China 'strongly condemns' the sale. 'We will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,' said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. VOA's Nike Ching contributed to this story.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz0teIVgNtLB5	2024-10-29T16:35:44-07:00	
Can America’s ‘Self-Made’ Men Make A President? – OpEd	UBS, the giant Swiss private bank, has been tracking newcomers to the ranks of the world’s billionaire class for going on a decade now. The latest annual UBS count of the world’s new billionaires, released last November, announced a bit of history. For the first time ever, UBS noted, more people are now becoming billionaires via inheritance than through their own 'entrepreneurship.' This UBS revelation didn’t attract much public attention. But you can bet that plenty of billionaires noticed. The legitimacy of billionaire fortunes has always rested on the entrepreneurial myth our super rich invoke at every opportunity. Our brilliance, that myth goes, made us our billions. How dare any government make any move to tax away any significant chunk of our 'self-made' riches! The Biden administration has so dared, most notably by proposing a 'billionaire’s tax,' a levy that would have the holders of fortunes worth over $100 millionpaying taxesannually on the growth in the value of their financial assets, the bedrock of billionaire wealth. For the billionaire venture capitalist — and one-time Democrat — Marc Andreessen, that Biden tax proposal would be 'the final straw.' Andreessen has since thenjoinedthe pro-Trump ranks. But more than taxes have been driving high-tech movers and shakers to Trump. America’s tech-related fortunes all 'grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment,'notesJohn Naughton, a wealth analyst at the UK’s Open University. But activist regulators like Lina Kahn at the Biden administration’s Federal Trade Commission have of late beencancelingthe blank checks Big Tech has so enjoyed cashing. This new Biden-era federal refusal to automatically do Big Tech’s bidding has energized billionaires once content to pay relatively little attention to politics. Elon Musk has come to symbolize that new energy — and stands to gain the most from it. Trump has alreadypromisedto name Musk the head of a new 'government efficiency commission' he plans to create once back in the White House. That perch could easily give Musk the leverage he needs to swat away federal probes into his operations already underway in agencies ranging from theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administrationto theSecurities and Exchange Commission. Just how much are Donald Trump’s high-tech boosters now funneling into his campaign? We may never know for sure, given our contemporary 'dark money' scene. But we do havesome numberson the broader billionaire scene that can help us understand the overall political impact of fortunes built on everything from computer chips to poker chips. We know, for instance, that billionaire heiress Miriam Adelman, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has deposited $100 million into her Preserve America super PAC. Railroad heir Timothy Mellon has bestowed an even more stunning$150 millionupon his Make America Great Again PAC operation. Elon Musk — before October — had dumped some $75 million into his America PAC. Just-released filingsshowthat Musk added an additional $44 million into that PAC over the first half of October and another $2.3 million into the pro-Trump Sentinel Action Fund. What do all those millions buy? Plenty of ad time, of course, on TV and computer screens. But billionaires like Musk aren’t just buying eyeballs. They’re also doing their best to return America to the good old original Gilded Age days when our super rich couldsimply buywhatever votes they needed. Elon Musk has been leading the way to this brazen new vote-buying era. A little over two weeks before Election Day, Musk — 'thequintessentialrobber baron of America’s second Gilded Age' — began running daily lotteries open only to registered swing-state voters who signed a petition in support of free speech and the right to bear arms. The daily prize: $1 million. Paying people to induce them to vote or get registered,USA Todaypoints out, just happens to be 'an offense punishable by prison time,' and that legal prohibition holds for 'anything of monetary value like liquor or lottery chances,'holdsa U.S. Justice Department election-crimes manual. After four daily winners — and a warning from the Justice Department — Musk put his daily lottery prizeon hold. But if he should resume his lottery, the daily million-dollar prizes certainly won’t make much of a dent on Musk’s personal fortune. Musk ended October 23worth$237billion. Other pro-Trump billionaires, meanwhile, are devoting millions to the dayafterNovember 5. TheWall Street Journalearlier this weekrevealedthat a 'secretive network of GOP donors and conservative billionaires' has spent the years since the 2020 presidential election 'laying the groundwork for a more organized, better funded and far broader effort to contest the outcome.' Groups linked to billionaires like the Wisconsin shipping magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein and Hobby Lobby founder David Green, theJournalreports, 'have been scrutinizing voter registrations on an industrial scale and working to slow down the vote count' and 'bury local election officials in paperwork and lawsuits.' To add to the post-election chaos, theJournaladds, one of these billionaire-backed groups is even offering monetary rewards to 'anyone reporting election fraud or abuse.' Another Trump-boosting group, the EagleAI Network, is bombarding election officials with long lists of registered voters that it claims need investigating. These lists, charges Ben Hovland, the chair of the bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission, amount to a 'weaponization' of open-records laws, a 'resource drain' that has 'real-world consequences' for the work of local election offices that administer America’s elections. We may well end up this election year with a broken election system. Who will deserve the blame? That will ultimately belong to the billionaires who assure us, at every opportunity, that they wish nothing more than to make America great again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcaj0RELHCHz6U-lJ8DL3np	2024-10-29T16:34:20-07:00	
Will America Go To War Under Trump? – OpEd	By Jonathan Power A speech of General George Patton, a famous World War II warrior, has an uncanny resemblance to the philosophy of Donald Trump. 'All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser—Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win—all the time. That’s why Americans have never lost, not ever will lose a war, for the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.' Then came the Korean War (a stalemate), Vietnam (a loss), Afghanistan (mired in unconquerable mountains), Iraq 2 (a quagmire), Ukraine versus Russia (a proxy unwinnable war). Never mind the failures, with Trump in the saddle again, if that happens, a new toughness will be apparent—or so he says, in his usual muddled way. When president he experienced conflicts with North Korea, Russia, Iran, Syria, China, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and in Niger and Mali. 'Fire and Fury', aimed at North Korea, is in danger down the road of becoming his mantra. Recall that the US commander in Korea, General Douglas MacArthur, advocated using 34 nuclear weapons on targets in Korea and China. Polls today show that a majority of Americans think it would be right to use them if America were attacked. Obama and Biden would never press the button. I would not be so sure about Trump sometime over the next few years. Russia—Trump has pushed for a fast build-up of America’s military might, including nuclear weapons, even though America has a military expenditure as high as the combined total of Russia, China, Japan, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and India. He has no plan to discuss arms cuts, to take missiles off hair-trigger alert nor to take up ex-president Dmitri Medvedev’s important proposal for a new European Security Treaty. This would deal with Russia’s anger at the expansion of NATO up to its borders, while getting Russia’s soldiers out of Ukraine and ending its military manoeuvres in and around the Baltic. China—Trump has provoked China unnecessarily over Taiwan. This small island which has provided much of China’s investment is claimed by Beijing to be part of China. It is not. But it should not, as a counter move, declare independence, a policy that Trump seems to lean to. Rather it should realise the quiet status quo is the only policy worth its weight. Trump is aggravated by Chinese claims to islands in the South and East China seas. US warplanes already cross the borders of China’s Air Defence Identification Zones. In the 1950s, the US nearly went to war with China over the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu, owned by Taiwan. President Dwight Eisenhower considered using nuclear weapons. Eventually China did pull back. These days, no one in their right mind wants to provoke a major war fought over tiny uninhabited islands. If this be true, then the Pentagon should be ordered to take its military far away, so war cannot happen. On the economic front, there is a danger that Trump will initiate another trade war, which in the long run will lead to a US defeat. China has most of the cards. The total size of its economy is fast catching up with the US. It could buy its planes from Airbus rather than Boeing etc. It can start selling its vast savings in US Treasury bonds. Iran—Iran is the source of many of the problems of the Middle East: 'From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and train terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region.' Trump has gone to great lengths to make sure Saudi Arabia benefits politically and militarily from his views. Such an attitude undermines the job of making ISIS and Al Qaeda the primary target, as they should be. It is Iran, Iran, Iran, even though Iran is a force for defeating extremists. Yet, Iran can be negotiated with, as the US discovered when it succeeded in sealing a highly important denuclearisation agreement. Trump ripped that accord open, even though he should have known that North Korea will never trust a US deal if that’s what happens two years later. North Korea—If Trump wins, negotiations soon will be under way between the North and the US. If they work then that should be an example for how to deal with other problems. If they fail, then we should worry that Trump might lead us into a nuclear war. With Obama and Joe Biden, even though they made grave mistakes, one felt there was a momentum towards peace. With Trump, it just seems to be a momentum to war.

Denmark: TotalEnergies Discovers New Gas Condensate Resources In ...	TotalEnergies said Tuesday that the Harald East Middle Jurassic nearby exploration well (HEMJ-1X) has discovered additional gas condensate resources in the Harald field, in the Danish North Sea. Located in shallow waters, 250 km off the west coast of Denmark, the HEMJ-1X well was drilled in the Eastern part of Harald field and encountered 48 meters of net gas condensate pay in a good quality reservoir. The HEMJ-1X well will be immediately connected to the Harald platform and is expected to start producing before the end of the year through the existing Harald and Tyra facilities. 'The success of the Harald East Middle Jurassic well, nearby our Harald facilities in Denmark, demonstrates the strength of our Exploration strategy. This additional discovery at the Harald field will contribute to Danish energy supply by boosting our existing production in the North Sea in line with the Danish National Compromise', said Kevin McLachlan, Senior Vice President Exploration at TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies is the operator of the Danish Underground Consortium with a 43,2% working interest, alongside Joint Venture partners BlueNord (36,8%) and Nordsøfonden (20%).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdIoKSuLgXwbrwVIRwe573-	2024-10-29T09:45:01-07:00	
Cattle Dog Gusto: How Bluey Conquered The United States – OpEd	For decades, the cultural phenomenon known as Americanisation has taken place with diffusing ease. Momentum was gained with the retreat of communism from Europe’s eastern states with the end of the Cold War and the eventual termination of the Soviet Union in 1991. Global brands of Americana from fizzy drinks to Dallas became pervasive cultural presences. Not even children’s programming was exempt. Converts and devotees would mimic accents, adopt terms of reference, and emulate patterns of behaviour. In terms of children’s programming, Sesame Street, the work of the non-profit organisation Sesame Workshop, has been the global standard bearer. Jenny Perlman Robinson and Daniela Petrova, writing for Brookings in 2015, delved into its significance as an informal educating tool, reaching millions of children across 150 countries. 'What had started as an educational television program more than 40 years ago is now a multimedia platform that uses everything from radio, video, and books to the latest in interactive media and technology.' In 2018, Australia made its own contribution in the field. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation released an animated series that has since become a giddying global phenomenon. The US has not been spared, suggesting that Americanisation, at least in some areas, can also be given hearty doses of its own medicine. The series in question, Bluey, features an Australian dog of the Blue Heeler variety: one Bluey, a six-year-old cattle dog who lives in the Queensland city of Brisbane with sister Bingo, and parents Bandit and Chilli. By the end of March 2020, the series had won an International Emmy in the children’s preschool category, something no doubt helped by the enforced isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2023, Bluey became the second most popular streaming show in the US, logging 731 million hours. In 2024, the series became the most viewed show in the United States. Such success was due, in no small part, to a distribution deal struck between the BBC and Disney in 2019. 'The warmth and authenticity of Bluey’s family dynamic is what first captured our interest in the show,' explained Jane Gould, senior vice president of Disney Channels Worldwide. 'Bluey reminds us all of our own families, and it plays out in the small but emotionally epic dramas of day-to-day life in surprising, heartfelt and very funny ways that will engage children and parents alike.' The fascinating aspect about Bluey is its central premise: neither the viewing parents nor their engaged children are treated like passive imbeciles. Both groups can partake in the themes of the series without feeling infantilised. 'It trusts,' wrote David Sim in The Atlantic in August last year, 'that its young audience will be able to understand stories that are about the foibles and insecurities of parents too.' The web traffic site, Similarweb.com, yields an interesting statistic: the largest demographic of visitors to the official Bluey website (Bluey.tv) are those between 25-34, coming in at 28.86%. Fantasy and imagination mingle with testing, even potentially contentious issues. There are questions about premature birth ('Early Baby'); the appearance of friends who proceed to vanish ('Camping'); even questions about the fine line between full blooded banter and unacceptable teasing. In a Father’s Day episode, Bluey’s dad, Bandit, openly wonders about the merits of getting a vasectomy. Given such a format, it was bound to interest academics keen to tell us the obvious after generating the usual quantitative quarry of data. In a survey of 700 adults – part of a research project called Australian Children’s Television Cultures – we are told that Bluey was most keenly enjoyed by parents wishing to view a series with their children. Those behind the research project were keen to note the words of one of the respondents in describing the series. Bluey was 'representative of an idealised Australian ethos – relaxed, curious, and hard-working.' The influence of Bluey has also been noted in another respect. In 2022, a father in Massachusetts revealed that his child had begun using the term 'dunny' instead of 'toilet'. This brought much pleasure to ABC Sydney radio presenter, Richard Glover. 'Finally,' he chortled in The Washington Post, 'we have our revenge.' According to Glover, US popular culture had ensured that Australians of his generation had 'enrolled in a PhD program' on the subject. 'We paid the price for our enthusiasm, regularly scolded by our parents for ‘using those terrible American words.’ These included ‘sidewalk’ instead of ‘footpath’ and ‘trash’ instead of ‘rubbish’.' Now, it was time for those in the US, notably children, to learn that breakfast could be called 'brekkie', a chicken a 'chook', and 'tradie' a skilled tradesperson. Little wonder that we can find a Master of Arts thesis dedicated to the adult fandom phenomenon around Bluey, including its appeal to those millennials who show 'higher rates of anxiety, a greater distrust in the American government, and disbelief in American excellence than those of previous generations.' Anthropomorphised cattle dogs had become saviours of a sort. Something else is at play here. If Bluey is naturalistic, touching on the raw end of life in parenting and children’s lives, it functions in a digital world that is less adult, increasingly infantile and increasingly disabling. Children and adults are becoming increasingly estranged from relations through technological parting and an addiction to the screen. Funny that it should fall to a family of animated Australian cattle dogs to tie parents and children in a gentle knot of play and accommodation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdIoKSuLgXwbruofv7p8eIb	2024-10-29T09:43:25-07:00	
Robert Reich: Why Harris’s Closing Message Must Center On Anti-El...	I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling more anxious about the outcome of the upcoming election. I’m still nauseously optimistic, but the nausea is growing. I’m as skeptical of polls as any of you, but when all of them show the same thing — that Kamala Harris’s campaign stalled several weeks ago, yet Trump’s continues to surge — it’s important to take the polls seriously. Harris will give her closing message to the American people tomorrow at a rally on the National Mall’s Ellipse in Washington. Over the last several weeks, she’s focused on Trump’s threats to a woman’s right over her body and to the rights of all Americans to a democracy. Tomorrow night, though, she needs to respond forcefully to the one issue that continues to be highest on the minds of most Americans: the economy. She must tell Americans simply and clearly why they continue to have such a hard time despite all the official economic indicators to the contrary: It’s because of the power of large corporations and a handful of wealthy individuals to siphon off most economic gains for themselves. Most Americans are outraged that they continue to struggle economically at the same time billionaires are pulling in ever more wealth. Most know they’re paying too much for housing, gas, groceries, and the medicines they need. They also know that a major cause is the market power of big corporations. They want someone who’ll stand up to big corporations and the politicians in Washington who serve them. They want a president who’ll be on their side. A president who will crack down on price gouging, who will bust up the monopolies and restore competition, who will fight to cap prescription drug costs, who will get big money out of politics and stop the legalized bribery that rigs the market for the rich, and who will make sure corporations pay their fair share and end tax breaks for billionaire crooks. A president who will put working families first —beforebig corporations and the wealthy. Harris needs to sayshewill be this president. Her policy proposals support this. She’s committed to strong antitrust enforcement — cracking down on mergers and acquisitions that give big food corporations the power to jack up food and grocery prices, prosecuting price-fixing, and banning price gouging. She needs to remind voters of this. She also says she’ll raise taxes on the rich, provide $25,000 in down-payment assistance to help Americans buy their first home, restore the Expanded Child Tax Credit to $3,600 to help more than 100 million working Americans, and introduce a new $6,000 tax cut to help families pay for the high costs of a child’s first year of life. All should be parts of her speech tomorrow about why she will be the champion of working people. She wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, make stock buybacks more expensive, and expand Medicare to cover home health care — paid for with savings from the expansion of Medicare price negotiations with drug manufacturers. She needs to frame all of this as a response to the power of big corporations and the wealthy — and say in no uncertain terms that she’s on the side of the people, not the powerful. If she fails to do this in her closing argument, Trump’s demagogic response will be the only one the public hears — that average working people are struggling because of undocumented workers and the 'enemy within,' including Democrats, socialists, Marxists, and the 'deep state.' Harris should fit her message about democracy inside this economic message. If our democracy weren’t dominated by the rich and big corporations, fewer of the economy’s gains would be siphoned off to them. Average working people would have better pay and more secure jobs and be able to afford to homes, food, fuel, medicine, child care, and eldercare. A large portion of the public no longer thinks American democracy is working. According toa newNew York Times/Siena College poll, only 45 percent believe our democracy does a good job representing ordinary people. An astounding 62 percent say the government is mostly working to benefit itself and elites rather than the common good. In her closing argument, Harris should commit herself to reversing this, so government works for the common good. Harris started her campaign in July and early August by emphasizing these themes about the economy and democracy. But in more recent weeks, she’s focused mostly on Trump’s particular threat to democracy. Her campaign seems to have decided that she can draw additional voters from moderate Republican suburban women upset by Trump’s role in fomenting the attack on the U.S. Capitol. That’s why she’s been campaigning with Liz Cheney and gathering Republican officials as supporters. And why she has chosen to give her closing message on the Ellipse — where Trump summoned his followers to march on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Yet when she shifted gears from the economy to Trump’s attacks on democracy, Harris’s campaign stalled. I think that’s because Americans continue to focus on the economy and want an answer to why they are still struggling economically. If Trump gives them an answer — although baseless and demagogic — but Harris does not, he may sail to victory on November 5. Hence in her closing message she must talk clearly and frankly about the misallocation of economic power in America — lodged with big corporations and the wealthy instead of average Americans — and her commitment to rectify this.

Brig Rajinder Singh: Kashmir’s ‘Captain Of The Gate’ – OpEd	A Sinister Plan Unfolds Immediately after the British left Indian shores in 1947, both Independent India and the newly created state of Pakistan undertook a flurry of consolidation related activities. While the Indian leadership concentrated on shaping a unified India by negotiating terms of accession with the more than 500 erstwhile princely states, the Pakistanis unfortunately seemed to be more concerned about expanding the nascent nation’s boundaries through devious means. On August 18, Pakistan army’s Commander-in-Chief [C-in-C] Gen Frank Walter Messervy issued written orders outlining details of a covert military campaign [codenamed Operation Gulmarg] in garb of a tribal ‘invasion’ to annex J&K. That the army of a newly created nation would issue a war directive within 96 hours or so after its birth may sound bizarre, this is exactly what happened and Pakistan’s perfidy would have gone unreported had Maj [Later Maj Gen] OS Kalkat not stumbled upon this crucial document. Warning Ignored Serving as Brigade Major of the Bannu Frontier Force Brigade being commanded by Brig CP Murry, Maj Kalkat was authorised to open official communications addressed to the Brigade Commander in his absence. As Brig Murry was away on August 20, 1947, Maj Kalkat opened a demi-official top secret letter written by Pakistan army C-in-C that was addressed to the Brigade Commander. This document that had been signed just two days ago contained war plans for Operation Gulmarg and mentioned October 22, 1947, as the day of its commencement. Though Maj Kalkat managed to escape to India and on reaching army headquarters at New Delhi narrated details about the imminent invasion of J&K to senior military officers, unfortunately, his warning wasn’t taken seriously. Probably it was opined that a newly created nation with a host of national issues required to be urgently addressed was unlikely to take such a drastic step. In Srinagar, the ruler of J&K Maharaja Hari Singh was also oblivious of Pakistan’s sinister designs. He refused to exercise his option for accession and appeared confident that Pakistan wouldn’t resort to annexing his kingdom through force and subterfuge. The reason for his optimism was probably the ‘standstill agreement’ which Pakistan had entered into with the princely state of J&K. The ‘standstill agreement’ ensured that after Independence, all existing administrative arrangements between the British Crown and princely states would continue unaltered between the signatory dominion [India/Pakistan] and concerned princely states until new arrangements were made. Hence, any move by Pakistan to change the status quo through use of force was tantamount to brazen violation of this agreement and hence extremely unlikely. An Agreement Dishonoured Recognition of the British Crown’s suzerainty by the royalty of undivided India ruled out the scope of local skirmishes or any clash of arms between principalities. Furthermore, the British rulers ensured that state forces maintained by princely states posed no threat to the British Crown and as such, these armies were largely ceremonial in nature with negligible combat experience, and J&K was no exception. Being numerically far inferior and equipped with obsolete weapons, J&K state forces were no match for the World War 2 battle hardened regulars of the Pakistan army providing command elements as well as bolstering the strength of tribal lashkars [militias] as foot soldiers. As this force approached Muzaffarabad on the night of October 21/22, Muslim soldiers of J&K Princely State Forces stationed there mutinied, murdering their commanding officer and Dogra comrades-in-arms as they slept. With the mutineers joining the invaders, the entire 180 km route to Srinagar was left completely unguarded. The situation, to say the least, was utterly hopeless as all seemed lost! J&K’s ‘Horatius’ Emerges On October 22, the beleaguered Maharaja summoned his army chief Brigadier Rajinder Singh and ordered him to defend J&K 'till the last man and last bullet.' The Maharaja’s son Dr Karan Singh who was present in the room recalls that on receiving this order, Brig Rajinder Singh 'just saluted and walked away.' Mustering about 150- 260 men including some officers armed with obsolete weapons and limited ammunition, he set out for Uri in private transport and reached there at about 2 AM on the night of October 22/23. Taking a small body of soldiers with him, Brig Rajinder Singh moved forward and encountered the invaders in Garhi. Though it offered stiff resistance, his small detachment was greatly outnumbered as well as outgunned. Despite the overwhelming odds, Brig Rajinder Singh remained steadfast and continued rallying his troops through personal example, carrying out retrograde operations to slow down the advance of the invaders. This included blowing up the Uri bridge and fighting delaying actions from a series of defensive positions at Mahura, Rampur and finally at Baramulla. The fact that Brig Rajinder Singh was able to delay the more than 20,000-strong invading force with less than 300 men speaks volumes about his professional acumen and dedication. Despite having had several brushes with death, Brig Rajinder Singh continued leading from the front and when his driver was killed in an ambush, he took control of the wheel himself. On being grievously injured subsequently, Brig Rajinder Singh refused evacuation as it would further deplete the already miniscule strength of the defenders. Instead he ordered his men to proceed and execute the defensive battle plan as time was at a premium, leaving him where he was. Inspired by Brig Rajinder Singh’s selflessness and sacrifice, his men engaged the invaders in a tough fight during which most of them laid down their lives. Nothing is known what happened to Brig Rajinder Singh as his mortal remains were never found. However, those who fell while defending J&K from invaders didn’t die in vain- they were able to delay a much larger and better armed enemy for four days, creating a window that enabled J&K’s accession to India and facilitated the Indian army to land its troops at Srinagar airport for evicting the intruders. Brig Rajindir Singh was posthumously awarded Maha Vir Chakra, India’s second highest gallantry award. By living up to the exacting 'last man last bullet' credo, Brig Rajinder Singh has epitomised the core professional value revered by every thoroughbred military person and reminds one of Thomas Babington Macaulay’s famous lines- 'Then out spake brave Horatius,The Captain of the Gate:'To every man upon this earthDeath cometh soon or late.And how can man die betterThan facing fearful odds,For the ashes of his fathers,And the temples of his Gods?'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdIoKSuLgXwbtMnMhfkJSMi	2024-10-29T09:40:21-07:00	
Developing Countries Are Leading The Movement Toward Nuclear Gene...	Developing countries are spearheading the shift towards nuclear power in a world where reliable and sustainable electricity sources are crucial, while wealthier nations focus on weather dependant wind and solar for so-called renewable electricity. The choice of nuclear power generation ahead of unreliable renewables is driven by their need for dependable, low emissions electricity to meet their growing demand for industrial, mining and agricultural goods producing growth. The Nuclear Landscape Countries like France have embraced nuclear power since the 1960s and have for 6 decades been safely producing electricity with 56 reactors that generate 361 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Nuclear accounts for 68% of the country’s annual electricity generation, the highest nuclear generation share in the world. The French strategy includes building at least six new reactors by 2050, with construction starting in 2028 and commissioning by 2035. Nuclear energy also significantly contributes to France’s economy, supporting approximately 457,200 jobs directly and indirectly,apart from the millions employed by the industries its electricity supplies. France is also the largest net exporter of electricity in Europe. The Department of Energy (DOE) advocates for nuclear power as a cost-effective and reliable source of electricity through various reactor designs, including large reactors for bulk electricity production, and Smaller Modular Reactors (SMRs) for flexible deployment. This has recently been proven in the newly updated Pathways to Commercial Liftoff report, where advanced nuclear (small and micro modular reactors) have been cited as having a differentiated value proposition that extends to thermal industrial heat required by the oil, coal and gas industries to produce the products that the world wants and needs. The US Navy has a longstanding success with nuclear-powered vessels, emphasizing the safety and reliability of nuclear technology over decades. Nuclear power also stands out as one of the most cost-effective options for electricity generation. Filmmaker Oliver Stone's documentary, 'Nuclear Now,' sheds light on the benefits of nuclear power, showcasing its safety record, efficiency, and minimal environmental impact compared to other electricity sources. Developing Countries Leading the Charge Developing countries are leading the charge towards nuclear-generated electricity and include China, India, Korea, Indonesia, and South Africa amongst others. South Africa was the first in the world to start work on a commercial SMR in the early 2000s, which manifested into the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) project that was unfortunately politically halted in favour of green agendas in 2010. The history of the South African nuclear sector traces back to the mid-1940s, with the formation of the forerunner to the Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC). In 1959, the government greenlit the development of a local nuclear industry. Subsequently, plans commenced in the following year for the construction of a research reactor, in collaboration with the US Atoms for Peace initiative. South Africa is also leading the charge with SMR development, as nuclear expertise moved to the private sector after the PBMR project was shut down in 2010. South Africa is an exporter of nuclear expertise, as evidenced in the Barakah Nuclear facility build in the UAE where it had over 160 South African professionals working on the project that has successfully proven that nuclear power plants are both bankable and efficient. There are numerous reasons why developing nations are leading the charge in embracing nuclear energy: Electricity poverty leaves people less likely to be responsible custodians of the environment, as people in poorer developing countries brutally survive in a world with inadequate access to goods, services and economic freedoms that are abundantly available in developed economies that were built on the products made from fossil fuels. In 2019, about 759 million people could not access electricity, nearly 75% of them (570 million) from Sub-Saharan Africa, which represents about half of the region’s population. In 2022 and 2023 some countries placed the phasing in or expansion of nuclear power at the centre of their strategies to reach climate policy objectives for electricity emissions that were reliable and safe, sparking a significant revival of global interest in nuclear energy and high-efficiency low-emission (HELE) coal energy. The IEA’s updated Net Zero Roadmap shows nuclear generated electricity more than doubling by 2050, complementing renewable deployment, and easing the pressure on critical mineral supply. The only operating Small Modular Reactor in operation in the world, including the Continental United States, is the High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor - Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) in Shidao Bay in China. The foundation for this technology stems from a collaboration with the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor program in South Africa. Based on economic research by Dr Rob Jeffrey, South Africa and many other poor developing economies need to join the movement toward 'reliable and emissions-free electricity' from nuclear, mixed with High-efficiency Low emission (HELE) coal gas or oil energy as the only long-term solution for their sustained economic growth. These poor developing countries face the choice between a dark future of slow economic growth and rising unemployment or the potential of achieving high sustainable economic growth and achieving the only key objectives that matter, namely reducing poverty, unemployment and inequality. Sustainable economic growth can only be achieved through the rapid development of proven technologies with high-capacity factors like nuclear, (HELE) coal, gas and oil for affordable, reliable, continuous, and low emissions electricity that will benefit billions on this planet. It is imperative for countries, including the United States, to lead the way in adopting nuclear power to ensure electricity security and alleviate energy poverty effectively. The UK, European Union, Germany, Spain, California and South Australia are examples where the renewable transition to solar and wind has led to higher energy prices, slower growth and declines in their industrial and mining sectors. Access to electricity, infrastructure, and financial inclusion through economic development in a manner that respects both people and the environment is fundamental to human progress as a species. There is no other way to long-term prosperity. Activism without the measure of an outcome leads to entropy, which is the natural inclination of universal order towards chaos. 'Renewables', like wind and solar, only exist to generate intermittent electricity, as they CANNOT make any products or fuels! The demands for material to build wind and solar and EV batteries inflict substantial environmental degradation and humanity atrocities in China, Africa, Turkey, Democratic Republic of Congo, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. The materials for EV batteries and to. produce electricity from wind turbines and solar panels, require large-scale mining and refining of critical minerals and metals. The short life of renewables means toxic waste is an increasing problem with them Russia and China are currently leading the world in nuclear electricity generation and account for 70 per cent of new nuclear plants. Currently, there are about 440 nuclear power reactors operating in 32 countries. Today, about 60 reactors are under construction across the world. A further 110 are planned. The Path Forward The path is clear, there are no shortcuts and there is no skirting around the elephant in the room that Policymakers refuse to discuss-the path to reliable and sustainable electricity sources. Any sort of 'Just Transition' needs to result in a proportionate increase in units of production that the World needs, to live to the standards that those imposing the standards would like to live. This is the only way to a true 'Just energy transition'. One where the billions of impoverished people are given a light to shine whatever talent they have into the world. And for that, they need a spark. Astonishingly, while hungry countries are pursuing reliable and emissions-free electricity from nuclear and low-emission technologies for their electricity supply from coal, oil and gas, the wealthier countries with ample goods and services produced by fossil fuel derivatives are focusing on continuously subsidizing wind and solar for occasional and unreliable electricity.

France Applauds Morocco’s Bold Vision In Water And Energy: A Mode...	In a compelling address to Morocco's Parliament, French President Emmanuel Macron commended Morocco's forward-thinking approach to tackling critical water and energy challenges. Highlighting the country's visionary 'water highways' and urban desalination efforts, Macron praised Morocco's commitment to securing sustainable access to potable water and irrigation solutions for its growing population. His remarks placed Morocco at the forefront of innovation in resource management, with initiatives that aim not only to meet the present needs but to secure a resilient future. Few nations, Macron emphasized, have confronted the challenges of water scarcity with such determination and ingenuity. 'I believe few countries have addressed this issue with as much vigor and innovation,' he remarked, adding that France is honored to be a partner in Morocco's unprecedented policies. From the development of water highways—an impressive infrastructure designed to deliver water efficiently across vast distances—to city desalination projects that will meet the demands of expanding urban centers and agricultural areas, Macron's speech recognized Morocco's leadership in sustainable water solutions. Macron's vision for Morocco's water strategy extends beyond national borders. He expressed hope that Morocco's water highways would be a focal point at the upcoming One Water Summit, an international platform where Morocco's innovative practices could inspire similar efforts globally. France stands ready to support Morocco's journey toward 'adaptation and sovereignty,' a phrase underscoring Morocco's independence in addressing climate challenges and resource management. In the energy sector, Macron lauded Morocco as a pivotal player with vast potential to supply Europe with green hydrogen and renewable energy. 'Morocco has unique resources,' he noted, referencing the country's longstanding hydroelectric projects—an initiative dating back to the era of King Hassan II—and its extensive solar farms and wind installations, some of the largest in Africa. These projects are laying the groundwork for Morocco's emergence as a renewable energy leader, capable of delivering not only sustainable power domestically but also stable, low-carbon energy for Europe. Macron's vision for the Mediterranean's future is intrinsically tied to these new energy corridors, particularly those dedicated to green hydrogen and electricity. He affirmed, 'Yes, I am convinced that the Mediterranean's future will also be written through these green hydrogen corridors and electric routes that will bind our two countries.' These new pathways, he noted, are set to become decisive axes of growth for both Morocco and Europe, fostering a partnership that promises mutual resilience and prosperity. With this commitment to innovative water and energy strategies, Morocco is setting an example for the world. Its leadership reflects an understanding that sustainability is not merely a national goal but a shared responsibility. In Macron's words, Morocco's approach shows the world that it is possible to forge a future built on adaptation, resourcefulness, and partnership. As Europe and Morocco move forward together, these efforts underscore a new era of collaboration, one in which Morocco's bold strategies are not only a testament to its own resilience but a beacon of hope for global sustainability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSYMXdG79ILyVDYOUiYon8	2024-10-29T09:36:08-07:00	
North Korean Troops In Russia: Implications For The Ukraine Confl...	The Pentagon has confirmed that approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to eastern Russia, ostensibly to undergo military training. However, intelligence suggests that many of these troops will ultimately join the Russian forces in Ukraine. With rumors circulating that North Korea could dispatch an additional 10,000 troops by year's end, this support marks a significant shift in the dynamics of the nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine. If NATO and Europe fail to respond effectively, North Korea's troop deployment could expand even further, potentially reaching 30,000–40,000 soldiers on Ukrainian soil within six months. This would represent a substantial foreign presence in Ukraine, complicating the conflict and heightening the international stakes. According to reports, North Korean soldiers sent to Russia will begin combat operations in Ukraine by November 1. Their leader, Kim Jong-Un, has effectively condemned these soldiers to a one-way mission; they are unlikely ever to return. North Korea's strict policies dictate that soldiers interacting with foreigners may face severe consequences, possibly being held in gulag-like conditions for life. This echoes Stalin's treatment of Soviet POWs after World War II, who were punished upon returning home for their exposure to foreign influences. This deployment raises critical questions: What has Russia offered in return for North Korea's support? Some analysts believe it may involve nuclear technology, signaling a potentially dangerous escalation. With North Korea's growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict, the international community is now faced with a pressing dilemma. The presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine adds a new layer of complexity, underscoring the urgent need for a coordinated response from NATO and Europe to prevent further destabilization.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWbSe0CECQbPGulsZuxtn_	2024-10-29T09:34:44-07:00	
Myths And Reality About ISKP – OpEd	The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an affiliate of ISIS, was formed in Afghanistan in 2015 and has since been responsible for numerous acts of terrorism across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asian Republics (CARs), and even Russia. While Afghanistan remains ISKP's primary base; as has been affirmed by various UN reports, the Afghan media outlets (affiliated with the Interim Government) regularly adopt a deflective stance, redirecting blame to other nations—particularly Pakistan, which has been a significant target of ISKP and TTP terrorism. This article examines the historical context, formation, alliances and activities of ISKP in the region. In 2013, ISIS began a calculated expansion by dispatching emissaries to regions beyond Iraq and Syria, including Afghanistan. Although ISIS suffered a significant setback with its retreat from Iraq in 2014, its plans in Afghanistan were already well underway. By engaging individuals from existing terrorist factions within the country, ISIS began to consolidate its presence. Key figures disillusioned with their former allegiances, such as ex-Taliban (TTA) commanders Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost and Abdul Qahir Khorasani, played pivotal roles in establishing ISKP. In 2015, the group formalized its presence in Afghanistan, appointing Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former TTP commander who had split from TTP leader Fazalullah, as ISKP's first emir. Over the following years, ISKP continued to build alliances and bolster its ranks. In 2017, it linked up with additional extremist factions, including Jaish-ul-Adl and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami, further expanding its militant base. Most ISKP fighters today are either former TTP or TTA members who orchestrate terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other regional countries. While the core of ISKP’s fighters comprises defectors from the Afghan Taliban (TTA) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), interestingly, the group has also drawn recruits from India. For instance, during the U.S. MOAB strike on Tora Bora in April 2017, 13 Indian militants affiliated with ISKP were killed. Similarly, in 2020, further evidence emerged as Indian nationals, including Mohammed Muhasin and Abu Rawaha al-Muhajir from Kerala, carried out attacks in Afghanistan, underscoring a broader network. The regional security experts also hint at a complex connivance involving Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies to infiltrate Indian nationals into ISKP for their vested interest against Pakistan. An interesting fact is that Indian media has even provided platforms to known terrorists for propaganda against Pakistan regarding its support to ISKP. Media outlets like Sunday Guardian have been publishing such materials - repeated articles by known terrorist Ehsanullah Ehsan is a case in point. This echoes the EU DisinfoLab's findings in 2019-20 on Indian dis-info campaign against Pakistan. Pakistan is worst victim of terrorism and has been actively fighting terrorist groups including ISKP. Relating Pakistan to rendering any support to ISKP amounts to intellectual dishonesty and orchestrated media campaigns. The need of the hour is collectively counter the menace of terrorism instead of using it as proxies. As a nation deeply affected by terrorism, Pakistan has been actively combating groups like ISKP and TTP, and remains a frontline state in counterterrorism efforts. Accusing Pakistan of supporting ISKP not only misrepresents the facts but also undermines collaborative efforts against terrorism through orchestrated media campaigns. Now, more than ever, there is a need for united action to confront the global menace of terrorism, rather than misusing it as a geopolitical tool and proxies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWbSe0CECQbNybhY9v9IG4	2024-10-29T09:32:29-07:00	
France Reaffirms Support For Morocco’s Sovereignty Over The Sahar...	In a historic address before Morocco's Parliament in Rabat, French President Emmanuel Macron unequivocally underscored France's support for Morocco's sovereignty over the Sahara, a gesture that was met with resounding applause from Moroccan lawmakers. His words, 'the present and future of the Western Sahara lie within the framework of Moroccan sovereignty,' carried profound implications, not only for Morocco but also for regional stability in North Africa. This stance reflects a principled position that is neither antagonistic nor exclusive. Addressing Algeria's criticism of this alignment, Macron emphasized that France's stance 'is hostile to no one.' Algeria, which has long backed the Polisario Front—a group advocating for Saharan independence—has historically contested Morocco's claim over the Sahara. However, Macron's message was one of unity, focused on advancing development and peace. Macron's vision went beyond political rhetoric. He affirmed that French companies and operators would actively support the economic development of the Sahara through sustainable investments and initiatives that serve the local population. This commitment reflects France's intention to act as a proactive partner in Morocco's efforts to transform the region into a hub of opportunity, prosperity, and stability. France's support for Morocco's autonomy plan aligns with the growing international consensus recognizing the strategic importance of stability in the Sahara. As Macron's statement reflects, the future of the Sahara hinges on responsible economic engagement that benefits local communities, fosters inclusive growth, and counters the spread of instability. By advocating for initiatives that prioritize sustainable development, Macron positioned France as a catalyst for a brighter future for all Moroccans, from Rabat to Laayoune. This reinforcement of Moroccan sovereignty resonates not only within Moroccan borders but also signals to the global community that pragmatic diplomacy can be a force for lasting peace in contested regions. Macron's stance, grounded in respect for Morocco's territorial integrity, is a step toward a future where shared prosperity serves as the foundation for peace, diplomacy, and regional solidarity. With this speech, Macron has sent a clear message: France stands alongside Morocco in its vision for the Sahara, and together they aim to build a region marked by security, development, and opportunity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1owK7vNfNby	2024-10-29T09:31:04-07:00	
Factions And Fallout In Kabul – OpEd	When a nation claims unity amidst growing fractures, the silent echoes of internal discord often tell a different story. Recently, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, denied the existence of factions within the Afghanistan Taliban-led government and blames Afghanistan’s woes on external ‘adversaries’ he claims are out to frustrate Afghans’ efforts. However, this now well-known story of scapegoating ‘enemies’ conceals a far larger and growing problem—the clear and present fracture line within the ranks of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA). This growing divide is much more than an example of a leadership fissure; rather, it is a structural vulnerability with implications for Afghanistan and the region. Despite all the reassuring sentiments that Stanikzai has tried to convey, independent sources of information, the already cited statements of former Afghan officials, and the general course of political and, especially, economic developments in Afghanistan over the past several years do not support this image. This picture is far from the unified, ideologically coherent political movement, but the period of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, at least in the early stages of the current insurgency, is far from being a unified political project: it is a struggle of authorities not only of characters, but ideas and concepts of the future of the country. Internal divisions in the Taliban seem to be ideological, procedural and even ethnic in nature. With Afghanistan virtually shunned internationally, there is growing internal rivalry within the IEA based on differences on governance, foreign policy and internal policies. This fracturing of leadership does not only relate to petty differences in policy making. There are at the same time pro-international dialogue people like Stanikzai, who seems ready to engage in talks, and those advocating for the strict rule of Sharia law, which splits are building that can potentially bring the government down. The consequences of these Internal divisions also stretch beyond the Taliban ‘s top brass. From the ministries to the provinces and all the way to the Afghan villages, each factional disagreement shakes the country. Indices point to a government that is not only siloed within its ranks but also administrative discordant; with no clear policy direction because of incessant splits within the government. Thus, while the public statements are used to frame an external ‘enemy’, the actual threat is a divided house – a government unable to set and enforce a coherent policy agenda, and unwilling or unable to adequately address the multifaceted challenges it is facing. Afghanistan’s economic crisis is a vivid example of these unresolved contradictions. Stanikzai blames outside forces for undermining the economy, but the facts reveal that the Taliban also bear much responsibility for it. Through passing restrictive laws that prevent women from working, degrading the country’s ability to engage internationally through denying women’s input in the formation of the government, and denying competent workers their position in government, the Taliban have effectively strangled Afghanistan of economic potentiality. In addition, the fact that Afghanistan is still unrecognized by most of the countries of the world constitutes one of the most daunting challenges to economic growth. Lacking international recognition, Afghanistan cannot attract foreign investment, imports and exports, or international donations. Still, instead of analyzing their contribution to this isolation, the latter refers to ‘enemies’ within the foreign context over and over again, while ignoring the fact that many of the economic problems are the result of local self-organizing. The consequences of such internal conflict do not restrict themselves to Afghanistan. While a government bogged down by internal divisions tries to hold together, the prospects for stability in the region worsen. The various factions in the IEA have started developing diverse attitudes to the neighboring states and regional security organizations, whereas some of them call for diplomacy, others still adhere to the basic principles of confrontation and uncompromising hostility. Consequently, afraid of being an instrument in the game of different international players who will use Afghanistan as a tool to achieve their goals, political factions might make deals with other foreign actors for that very purpose. Further exacerbation of the internal fragmentation of the Taliban can very sharply worsen an already delicate security situation as policy inconsistencies emerge that inflame insurgent movements and empower them, notably when disgruntled factions or excluded leaders turn rogue. Moreover, the adjectives ‘enemies’ are not mere political tropes; rather, they are discursive practices that harbor the risk of turning into a reality. In placing Afghanistan in the status of a helpless victim of outside interference, Taliban leaders might inadvertently foster a more assertive foreign policy of response to potential threats, rather than a policy of building the stability of south and Central Asian regions. This approach could pose threats to stability in border areas, negatively impact the relations with Pakistan and Iran, and amplify instability in the entire expanse of Central and South Asia. However, the constant referring of scapegoats, the 'enemies' of Afghanistan, only undermines the Taliban’s authority. They are gradually losing control of the narrative due to failure to contain internal dissent, manage the economy and end factionalism. This deceit may seem effective in the short term, but it can lead to the rejection of the Afghan people who have been deceived by promises that some parts of their lives get better while in real life it’s only getting worse. The Afghan readers are not naive to go for the daily struggle of operating in an economy, political policies and an administration that is often focused more on internal conflict and less on development. The question remains: as leaders of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will they be hiding behind the phantom of the foreign foes or they will be demonstrating that they know that their house is divided? Unfortunately, it will take internal accountability and true reforms in order for Afghanistan to have a chance at the stability and prosperity it lacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1SImCsqq4-8	2024-10-29T09:29:51-07:00	
India-China Disengagement: Progress On The Ground, Doubts In The ...	By Manoj Joshi The Sino-Indianagreement on patrolling arrangements in eastern Ladakhis a significant achievement for New Delhi. From the outset of the Chinese actions of 2020—the establishment of blockades at six points and massing troops on the border—India has sought to deal with the situation in a measured manner. On the one hand, it confronted the Chinese at the blockade points and also amassed troops on the border, signifying a defensive rather than offensive intent. On the other hand, it pressed Beijing through firm and steady diplomacy to roll back its action. In this way, and by applying military pressure by occupying the Kailash heights overlooking Spanggur Tso, New Delhi managed to resolve four of the six blockade points by July 2022. These points were transformed into buffer zones, where neither side would patrol. Two blockades, in the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala in Demchok, proved more difficult. For two years, talks between military and civilian officials did not yield any results. Then suddenly, a few months ago, things changed, and after a flurry of diplomacy, we have a settlement that goes well beyond the deals that had been arrived at on the other blockade points. Statements from officials in New Delhi last week signalled that China and India have managed to resolve the issue of the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala. The deal announced on 21 October appears to be a multi-layered one which is likely to be rolled out in various phases. As a first step,External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, during a summit in New Delhi, said that 'the disengagement process with China has been completed'. This has been followed by whatForeign Secretary Vikram Misriannounced at a briefing—'an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the line of actual control in the India-China border areas.' Both said that through this deal, the situation that had arisen in 2020 in eastern Ladakh had been resolved. Reports quotingsources in the Armysay that 'a detailed agreement outlining the modalities of disengagement as well as patrolling was concluded at the Corps Commander level on Monday'. As a result, the Chinese blockades will be lifted this week, and the two sides will begin coordinated patrolling in the Depsang Bulge and Demchok. So in Depsang, the Indian side, which had been blocked at the so-called Y-Junction, will now be able to patrol to PP 10, 11, 11A 12 and 13 from which they had been blocked in March 2020. In turn, China will also patrol certain areas, though it is not clear as to which ones. Figure 1. Depsang blockade. Source: Author’s own, made by annotating Google Earth imagery. An important innovation here will be that the patrolling, which will begin at the end of the month, will be coordinated by the two sides to prevent the troops from coming face to face. Sources added that 'patrols will be spaced in such a manner that there would be no faceoffs.'Another reportsaid that as soon as the deal was struck, both sides began disengaging by dismantling prefabricated sheds and tents that were being used to house equipment, vehicles, and troops. The report had said that Indian and Chinese troops would now pull back from their forward positions in the two sectors by 28-29 October. In 2020, China blockaded India at six places—the Pangong Tso north bank, PP17A near Gogra Post, the Gogra-Hotsprings area of PP 15, the Galwan river (PP14), the Y-Junction in the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala. Except for the last two, the other issues had been resolved through negotiations between July 2020 (Galwan) and the PP 15 area in July 2022. But in those areas, the two sides created buffer zones varying in depth from 3-10 km in which neither side could send patrols. The current agreement involves both disengagement and patrolling. In other words, in the Depsang Bulge and the Charding Nala, the agreement reversed the situation and the Chinese blockades have been removed. This goes beyond the actions at the other blockade points, which will, for the present, remain as 'no patrol' buffer zones. Throughout the period of diplomatic engagement,India had insistedthat the process follow the sequence of 'disengagement' followed by 'de-escalation' and then by the 'de-induction' of additional forces that had been brought into the region. However, this deal is a breakthrough of sorts since it amounts to a restoration ofstatus quo anteas of April 2020 in the Depsang Bulge and Charding Nala area. If a similar process can be put in place for the other areas in question, India and China could resume normal management of the LAC. However, it will not be that easy to turn the clock back. India and China had broadly managed to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LAC with the help of a series of confidence-building agreements of 1993, 1996, 2005, and 2012 that largely covered their military conduct on the LAC. An example of its success was the fact that the Galwan clash did not involve the use of guns but of sticks and stones since the use of firearms was banned by the 1996 CBM agreement. Yet, important elements of the agreements had been violated by the Chinese. There are hints in the remarks of officials that elements of the agreement could also be extended to the eastto cover areas like Yangtse,where Indian and Chinese troops clashed in December 2022. Further, innovations likecoordinated patrolling, which were first tried out in the eastern sector, could now be applied in other areas where India and China have overlapping claims and hence insist that they will patrol them. The key to the future lies in the restoration of trust. TheArmy Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, in the wake of the announcement of the agreement, said that the bottom line of the agreement is the importance of restoring 'trust' between the two armies. Urging a restoration of the status quo as of April 2020, he said that India needed to carefully look at the issue of 'disengagement, de-escalation and normal management of the Line of Actual Control' thereafter. This would be done in several phases over some time. While disengagement, de-escalation, and de-induction may proceed apace, restoring trust will require more time. This may require a restructuring and rewriting of the CBM agreements of the past. An important outcome of the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last weekwas the instructions they have given to their Special Representatives (SR)on the Sino-Indian boundary issue—NSA Ajit Doval and his counterpart Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China—to meet soon. The last meeting of the SRs took place in 2019. It is expected that the SRs will guide the process of Sino-Indian reconciliation, which could see a thaw in their constrained political, military, and economic relations in the coming period.

Using AI In Albanian Public Procurements ‘No Easy Solution’ For C...	By Vladimir Karaj Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama has proposed using artificial intelligence in public procurement processes to tackle corruption – but experts argue that the root causes should be dealt with first. Prime Minister Edi Rama has repeatedly said that his government is planning to use artificial intelligence in the country’s public procurement processes, claiming it could offer a solution to corruption – one of the main problems Albania faces as it seeks EU membership. 'I am not saying that it will go down to zero,' he acknowledged in a recent speech, 'but we will neutralise a lot of that infestation.' Corruption in Albania is perceived as widespread. Members of Rama’s ruling Socialist Party have been hit by multiple corruption scandals over the years, while two opposition party leaders, Ilir Meta and Sali Berisha, have also been charged with corrupt practices related to their time in office. Rama’s government has been increasingly in the spotlight since the relatively new Special Structure Against Corruption and Organised Crime, SPAK started a series of investigations that brought charges on abuse of power and corruption against several dozen officials, mayors, ministers and a deputy-prime minister who is currently on the run from justice. SPAK’s efforts are part of wider efforts to tackle high-level graft, backed by Albania’s Western partners. Rama claims that he bears no structural responsibility for these cases, insisting they were just incidents of individual wrongdoing. As to tackling corruption in public procurement processes using AI, he has not explained specifically how this might work. Experts are also unsure. 'It is difficult to evaluate with the data at hand the capacities of the government to implement AI in public procurement, and it is not clear what elements of the public procurement process it will cover,' said Orkidea Xhaferaj, digital and innovation policy expert at the Centre Science and InnovationforDevelopment in Tirana. 'Although the government of Albania is working with Microsoft to implement AI for public procurement, there are concerns when it comes to technology, legal and regulatory measures, as well as operational ones. Predominantly, data management and quality remain an issue in the country, especially at local level,' Xhaferaj added. She pointed out that recruiting well-educated staff to implement such innovations remains a challenge in Albania, not only for public institutions, but also for the private sector. But she argued that using AI in public administration has a series of benefits – 'automation of processes which reduce manual work, data analytics capabilities, real time analysis of bids, contracts and notices, to address risks of fraud and errors'. However, there are practical issues too: 'The use of AI in public procurement brings about concerns in regard to cybersecurity and data privacy, and data biases raise concernsaswell,' she pointed out. She recommended that the authorities begin with smaller-scale or pilot projects before committing to involve AI in larger processes. ‘The machine is deciding’ Political observers expressed cynicism about Rama’s idea of using AI to fight corruption – seeing it as a potential tool for blame-dodging. 'He is apparently aiming to tell citizens and businesses who are complaining about public procurement services that ‘the machine’ is deciding and consequently, his administration bears no responsibility and the system that he created is causing no issues,' commented Zef Preci, executive director of the Albanian Centre for Economic Research. Afrim Krasniqi, director of Albanian Institute of Political Studies also believes that the Prime Minister is trying to avoid accountability. 'This will create a new alibi for corrupt officials,' Krasniqi told BIRN. This isn’t the first time that Rama has promised high-tech solutions for Albania’s institutional problems. Rama has previously said earlier that he believes that AI will help Albania to speed up its EU integration process by machine-translating EU laws and regulations. However, these plans failed when a public procurement call resulted in no offers. The digitalisation of the Public Procurement Commission’s documents has got under way, however; the National Agency for Information Society, which is supervised by Rama’s office, last year awarded a 17 million leks (173,000 euros) contract to a private company to begin the process. Corruption deeply rooted Albania’s Special Prosecution Against Corruption and Organised Crime, SPAK observed in its annual report that its investigations have shown how corruption has been identified from the inception of some public procurement processes and not as part of the process. 'The corrupt activity might start from the very initial stage, from the decision to allocate funds for a specific project, followed by incorrect actions and decisions from the contracting authority,' SPAK noted. The report revealed that investigations have shown direct involvement of high-ranking public officials in irregularities that start before a call for proposals is even issued for a specific public procurement process. 'We have seen direct interventions by high level officials who negotiate with a private party before a procurement or a public private partnership process has been started,' the report said. Experts believe that digitalisation and the use of AI will make little difference to this. 'One of the main faults [of the government] has been the preparation of the laws or decisions to serve specific oligarchs or political clients; many of these things that are presented as large-scale development projects have been granted to companies that have been created exactly for the purpose of winning such contracts,' Krasniqi said. Rigels Xhemollari, executive director of Qendresa Qytetare (Civic Resistance), a pressure group, says that technological innovation will not help if the people operating the new tools are the same as those who have been manipulate public procurement processes on paper. 'The problem here is not the process, but the need to fight corruption in the public procurement processes,' Xhemollari said. Jorida Tabaku, an MP from the opposition Democratic Party, said that that the government has already a high-tech tool to identify potential graft issues – the Open Data Albania online platform. Open Data Albania evaluates procurement processes according to anti-corruption criteria and flag those with suspected anomalies. Some 40 per cent of all procurement processes have been flagged on the platform. 'SPAK has arrested several high-level officials, including MPs and ministers while a deputy prime minister is currently on the run. The question is whether the government has stopped to think over what has caused this widespread corruption among its ranks,' Tabaku declared. Krasniqi said that the lack of will to analyse corruption in the current procurement system means that using AI may make no difference in practice. 'The new system provides no guarantees that it will be more successful than the traditional method of tackling corruption in public procurement,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1ohquz_oOlm	2024-10-28T17:01:26-07:00	
The Politics Of Fear: Laying The Groundwork For Fascism, American...	America is in the midst of an epidemic of historic proportions. The contagion being spread like wildfire is turning communities into battlegrounds and setting Americans one against the other. Normally mild-mannered individuals caught up in the throes of this disease have been transformed into belligerent zealots, while others inclined to pacifism have taken to stockpiling weapons and practicing defensive drills. This plague on our nation—one that has been spreading like wildfire—is a potent mix of fear coupled with unhealthy doses of paranoia and intolerance, tragic hallmarks of the post-9/11 America in which we live. Everywhere you turn, those on both the left- and right-wing are fomenting distrust and division. You can’t escape it. We’re being fed a constant diet of fear: fear of terrorists, fear of illegal immigrants, fear of people who are too religious, fear of people who are not religious enough, fear of extremists, fear of conformists, fear of the government, fear of those who fear the government, fear of those on the Right, fear of those on the Left... The list goes on and on. The strategy is simple yet effective: the best way to control a populace is through fear and discord. Fear makes peoplestupid. Confound them, distract them with mindless news chatter and entertainment, pit them against one another by turning minor disagreements into major skirmishes, and tie them up in knots over matters lacking in national significance. Most importantly, divide the people into factions, persuade them to see each other as the enemy and keep them screaming at each other so that they drown out all other sounds. In this way, they will never reach consensus about anything and will be too distracted to notice the police state closing in on them until the final crushing curtain falls. This is how free people enslave themselves and allow tyrants to prevail. This Machiavellian scheme has so ensnared the nation that few Americans even realize they are being manipulated into adopting an 'us' against 'them' mindset. Instead, fueled with fear and loathing for phantom opponents, they agree to pour millions of dollars and resources into political elections, militarized police, spy technology and endless wars, hoping for a guarantee of safety that never comes. All the while, those in power—bought and paid for by lobbyists and corporations—move their costly agendas forward, and 'we the suckers' get saddled with the tax bills and subjected to pat downs, police raids and round-the-clock surveillance. Turn on the TV or flip open the newspaper on any given day, and you will find yourself accosted by reports of government corruption, corporate malfeasance, militarized police and marauding SWAT teams. America has already entered a new phase, one in which children are arrested in schools, military veterans are forcibly detained by government agents because of their so-called 'anti-government' views, and law-abiding Americans are having their movements tracked, their financial transactions documented, and their communications monitored. These threats are not to be underestimated. Yet even more dangerous than these violations of our basic rights is the language in which they are couched: the language of fear. It is a language spoken effectively by politicians on both sides of the aisle, shouted by media pundits from their cable TV pulpits, marketed by corporations, and codified into bureaucratic laws that do little to make our lives safer or more secure. This language of fear has given rise to a politics of fear whose only aim is to distract and divide us. In this way, we have been discouraged from thinking analytically and believing that we have any part to play in solving the problems before us. Instead, we have been conditioned to point the finger at theotherPerson or vote forthisPolitician or supportthisGroup, because they are the ones who will fix it. Except thattheycan’t and won’t fix the problems plaguing our communities. Nevertheless, fear remains the method most often used by politicians to increase the power of government. The government’s overblown, extended wars on terrorism, drugs, violence, disease, illegal immigration, and so-called domestic extremism have been convenient ruses used to terrorizethe populace into relinquishing more of their freedoms in exchange for elusive promises of security. An atmosphere of fear permeates modern America. However, withcrime at an all-time low, is such fear rational? Statistics show thatyou are 17,600 times more likely to die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack. You are 11,000 times more likely to die from an airplane accident than from a terrorist plot involving an airplane. You are 1,048 times more likely to die from a car accident than a terrorist attack. You are 404 times more likely to die in a fall than from a terrorist attack. You are 12 times more likely to die from accidental suffocating in bed than from a terrorist attack. And you are 9 more times likely to choke to death in your own vomit than die in a terrorist attack. Indeed, those living in the American police state are8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist. Thus, the government’s endless jabbering about terrorism amounts to little more than propaganda—the propaganda of fear—a tactic used to terrorize, cower and control the population. In turn, the government’s stranglehold on power and extreme paranoia about the citizenry as potential threats has resulted in a populace that is increasingly viewed as the government’s enemies. Why else would the government feel the need to monitor our communications, track our movements, criminalize our every action, treat us like suspects, and strip us of any means of defense while equipping its own personnel with an amazing arsenal of weapons? So far, these tactics—terrorizing the citizenry over the government’s paranoia and overblown fears while treating them like criminals—are working to transform the way 'we the people' view ourselves and our role in this nation. Indeed, fear and paranoia have become hallmarks of the modern American experience, impacting how we as a nation view the world around us, how we as citizens view each other, and most of all how our government views us. The American people have been reduced to whatcommentator Dan Sanchezrefers to as 'herd-mindedhundreds of millions [who] will stampede to the State for security, bleating toplease, pleasebe shorn of their remaining liberties.' Sanchezcontinues: I am not terrified of the terrorists; i.e., I am not, myself,terrorized. Rather, I amterrifiedofthe terrorized; terrified of the bovine masses who are so easily manipulated by terrorists, governments, and theterror-amplifying mediainto allowing our country to slip toward totalitarianism and total war… I do not irrationally and disproportionately fear Muslim bomb-wielding jihadists or white, gun-toting nutcases. But I rationally and proportionately fear those who do, and the regimes such terror empowers.History demonstratesthat governments are capable of mass murder and enslavement far beyond what rogue militants can muster. Industrial-scale terrorists are the ones who wear ties, chevrons, and badges. But such terrorists are apowerless fewwithout thesupine acquiescenceof the terrorized many. There is nothing to fear but the fearful themselves… Stop swallowing the overblown scaremongering of the government and its corporate media cronies. Stop letting them use hysteria over small menaces to drive you into the arms of tyranny, which is the greatest menace of all. As history makes clear, fear and government paranoia lead to fascist, totalitarian regimes. It’s a simple enough formula. National crises, reported terrorist attacks, and sporadic shootings leave us in a constant state of fear. Fear prevents us from thinking. The emotional panic that accompanies fear actually shuts down the prefrontal cortex or the rational thinking part of our brains. In other words,when we are consumed by fear, we stop thinking. A populace that stops thinking for themselves is a populace that is easily led, easily manipulated and easily controlled. The following, derived by from John T. Flynn’s 1944 treatise on fascismAs We Go Marchingare a few of the necessary ingredients for a fascist state: The government is managed by a powerful leader (even if he or she assumes office by way of the electoral process). This is the fascistic leadership principle (or father figure). The government assumes it is not restrained in its power. This is authoritarianism, which eventually evolves into totalitarianism. The government ostensibly operates under a capitalist system while being undergirded by an immense bureaucracy. The government through its politicians emits powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism. The government has an obsession with national security while constantly invoking terrifying internal and external enemies. The government establishes a domestic and invasive surveillance system and develops a paramilitary force that is not answerable to the citizenry. The government and its various agencies (federal, state, and local) develop an obsession with crime and punishment. This is overcriminalization. The government becomes increasingly centralized while aligning closely with corporate powers to control all aspects of the country’s social, economic, military, and governmental structures. The government uses militarism as a center point of its economic and taxing structure. The government is increasingly imperialistic in order to maintain the military-industrial corporate forces. The parallels to modern America are impossible to ignore. 'Every industry is regulated. Every profession is classified and organized. Every good or service is taxed. Endless debt accumulation is preserved. Immense doesn’t begin to describe the bureaucracy. Military preparedness never stops, and war with some evil foreign foe, remains a daily prospect,' writes economist Jeffrey Tucker. 'It’s incorrect to call fascism either right wing or left wing. It is both and neither… fascism does not seek to overthrow institutions like commercial establishments, family, religious centers, and civic traditions. It seeks to control them… it preserves most of what people hold dear but promises to improve economic, social, and cultural life through unifying their operations under government control.' For the final hammer of fascism to fall, it will require the most crucial ingredient: the majority of the people will have to agree that it’s not only expedient but necessary. In times of 'crisis,' expediency is upheld as the central principle—that is, in order to keep us safe and secure, the government must militarize the police, strip us of basic constitutional rights and criminalize virtually every form of behavior. We are at a critical crossroads in American history. As I make clear in my bookBattlefield America: The War on the American Peopleand in its fictional counterpartThe Erik Blair Diaries,fear has been a critical tool in past fascistic regimes, and it has become the driving force behind the American police state. All of which begs the question what we will give up in order to perpetuate the illusions of safety and security. As we once again find ourselves faced with the prospect of voting for the lesser of two evils, 'we the people' have a decision to make: do we simply participate in the collapse of the American republic as it degenerates toward a totalitarian regime, or do we take a stand and reject the pathetic excuse for government that is being fobbed off on us? There is no easy answer, but one thing is true: the lesser of two evils is still evil.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1LPkkT0UC0-	2024-10-28T17:00:12-07:00	
Dissent: Gaps In The Regime – OpEd	At certain times in history, sometimes protracted events have occurred that demonstrated the power ofdissent– that (as far as we know) uniquely human capacity to express strong disagreement with some or other aspect of the political, social, or culturalstatus quo, whether this is done peacefully or, in some cases, violently, in a manner that could (and sometimes did) result in revolutionary conflict. The term, ‘dissent’ is related to another, cognate term –dissensus– in the very specific philosophical sense employed by philosopher JacquesRancière, who writes (inDissensus–On Politics and Aesthetics, Continuum, New York, 2010, p. 38): The essence of politics is dissensus. Dissensus is not a confrontation between interests or opinions. It is the demonstration (manifestation) of a gap in the sensible itself. Political demonstration makes visible that which had no reason to be seen; it places one world in another… And further (p. 69): A dissensus is not a conflict of interests, opinions or values; it is division inserted in ‘common sense:’ a dispute over what is given and about the frame within which we see something as given…This is what I call a dissensus: the putting of two worlds in one and the same world…A political subject is a capacity for staging scenes of dissensus. What should be noted above, in the first quotation, is the phrase, ‘gap in the sensible itself.’ If this seems opaque, consider that any ‘normalised’ political situation – such as that in the US today, which consists of a kind of forced ‘consensus’ brought about by the ruling party and its figureheads – structures the ‘sensible’ world of perception in such a manner that any deviation from ‘accepted’ (tacitly enforced) ways of acting meets with various degrees of disapproval and outrage. For example, dissenting views that people express about the desirability of having ex-President Donald Trump back in the White House routinely meet with howls of derision, implying that such opinions amount to lunacy. Dissensus, in this situation, constitutes ‘gap in the sensible itself,’ or inserts ‘one world within another,’ thus demonstrating that the sensible world’s organisation according tooneset of exclusive political and cratological (power-related) criteria for action and speech (or writing) can never be exhaustive.Dissensusis therefore, for Rancière, the ‘essence of politics’ insofar as no extant political dispensation is ever saturated, devoid of other political possibilities, which is why he writes that a ‘political subject is a capacity for staging scenes of dissensus.’ Accordingly, in the present time, those among us who are aware of possessing this capacity for dissensus are called upon to stage its ‘scenes,’ whether in acts of writing (or speech) or of actions, aimed at creating ‘gaps’ in the totalising regime of the sensible, established by those who desire it to saturate the sphere of social space to the exclusion of other possibilities of being political subjects. This capacity to create a ‘gap’ in the established world of power through dissent (ordissensus) has been demonstrated throughout human history. Think of the slave revolt against the might of Rome, led by the slave gladiatorSpartacusaround 73-72 BCE – when he and his followers defied the might of Rome to the point where it took the force of virtually the entire Roman army to quell the gladiator uprising – or any number of rebellions and revolutions in the course of history, rooted in dissent, including the French Revolution that started with the storming of the notorious prison, the Bastille, in 1789, as well as, sometime before that, the American Revolution that erupted in 1775, having been triggered by the so-called Boston Tea Party in 1773. Add to this the American Civil War of the middle 19th century, related to Northern dissent surrounding the practice of slavery. When, in the early 16th century, MartinLutherdistanced himself from what he saw as malpractices within the Roman Catholic Church of his time, it was another case of dissent, which gave rise to a different kind of religion within Christian ranks. These are only a few instances, among the most visible ones (given the sustained, violent conflict involved), to which could be added many others if one scoured history for examples. Here in South Africa the protest and resistance against the practice of apartheid, which took many forms, from literary and philosophical dissent, to peaceful resistance, to guerrilla warfare against the apartheid authorities, were a further instantiation of dissent. When FrantzFanonresisted the colonial authorities in Algeria, in word and deed, it was dissent. What one witnessed in Britain some time ago, in the shape of citizens protesting against Brexit, was also a sign of dissent. And when brave, astute citizensrefusedto accept modes of unjustifiable iatrocratic coercion imposed on them globally in recent times, supposedly in the name of ‘health,’ it also deserved the name of dissent. It is true, of course, that dissent need not appear in such publicly conspicuous ways; it manifests itself in households, virtually on a daily basis, for instance where subordinated women engage in dissent – sometimes silently, at other times vociferously – regarding the oppression or abuse they experience (sometimes literally) at the hands of their husbands or partners. AsFoucaultpointed out, before (some) women gained institutional power through emancipation, they always had the sexual power of their bodies to resist those who dominated them; that, too, is dissent. Today, in excessively patriarchal countries – such as Afghanistan – where the emancipation of women is but a distant, albeit beckoning, ideal, dissent assumes many guises, such as a woman perhaps openly driving a car in a courageous demonstration of independence. It should already be apparent from the above that dissent, although not always recognised as such, is ubiquitous, and everyone who reflects on this would probably be able to pinpoint a manifestation of it in their own lives. Personally, I recall several instances of dissent on the part of some members of the university faculty and senate in which I have served, for example, in the face of attempts by university management to reduce the benefits of staff members at the university in a surreptitious manner, without consideration of the negative effects this would have on the living conditions of the latter. In the work of one of the most (justly) celebrated novelists of the 20th century, who died not so long ago, JohnFowles, one encounters the following thoughtful reflection on the seldom acknowledged value of dissent (A Maggot, Vintage 1996, Kindle edition, Epilogue, location 9209): Dissent is a universal human phenomenon, yet that of Northern Europe and America is, I suspect, our most precious legacy to the world. We associate it especially with religion, since all new religion begins in dissent, that is, in a refusal to believe what those in power would have us believe – what they would command and oblige us, in all ways from totalitarian tyranny and brutal force to media manipulation and cultural hegemony, to believe. But in essence it is an eternal biological or evolutionary mechanism, not something that was needed once, merely to meet the chance of an earlier society, when religious belief was the great metaphor, and would-be conforming matrix, for many things beside religion. It is needed always, and in our own age more than ever before. The novel from the epilogue of which this is taken – and which I cannot discuss at length here – is an astonishing hybrid: part quasi-historical, part science-fiction. The excerpt from the epilogue, above, makes sense against the backdrop of its subject matter as well as the era in which it is set, namely early 18th-century England. The fictional narrative ends with an account of the birth of someone who was destined to become a historical person of note – Ann Lee, who was also known as Mother Ann, the leader of the so-called Shakers (so-called because of their ecstatic dance-shaking, which can be regarded as a kind ofsublimationin Freudian terms), who dissented from orthodox religious conventions in the belief that these were misguided, and that a new, radically different religious practice was called for. Fowles’s marvellous historical reconstruction of socially stratified, oppressive 18th-century English society inA Maggotprovides the context within which the phenomenon of Ann Lee – a female religious leader at a time when women were still regarded as naturally and constitutionally inferior to men – may be understood as the embodiment of dissent. The extremity of her dissent, and that of the Shakers, can be gauged from their rejection of sexual intercourse between men and women, including husband and wife (which is probably what led to their denunciation of marriage in the end). It is as if Ann’s disgust with the extant world of 18th-century England found its expression in the refusal to support the reproduction of the human race in a world that she and her followers considered degraded, and hence unworthy of perpetuation. What I would like to stress here, however, is Fowles’s allusion (in the excerpt, above), on the basis of his reference to religious dissent of the kind encountered on the part of Ann Lee, to the very nature of dissent, namely: ‘…a refusal to believe what those in power would have us believe – what they would command and oblige us, in all ways from totalitarian tyranny and brutal force to media manipulation and cultural hegemony, to believe[my italics; B.O.].’ This allusion makes the relevance ofA Maggotfor the present era in which we live conspicuously significant, to say the least. Regarding mainstream media manipulation and disinformation, those people who do not avail themselves of alternative news and commentary sources face a constant barrage of distorted information often amounting to outright lies, and perhaps worse, algorithmically determined, complete silence on important events occurring in the world (which the manipulators see as something that would undermine their grip on media power).

Iranian Officials Double Down On Warmongering Amid Regional Tensi...	On the morning of Saturday, October 26, during Israel’s aerial attacks targeting various military sites in Iran, the government-affiliated Khabar Fouri Telegram channel issued an announcement about 'the serious consequences of sharing images and news with opposition media.' Labeling this action a 'crime,' the channel warned, 'Anyone who cooperates with hostile foreign governments against the Islamic Republic of Iran, unless considered an enemy combatant, will be sentenced to between one and ten years in prison.' Previously, Massoud Ali, a cleric close to the office of regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei, referenced internal conflicts and disputes within the regime during wartime crises, doubled down on the regime’s warmongering in the region. He advocated for prosecuting and threatening dissenting voices against the regime’s costly interventions in the region. He questioned, 'Why isn’t the judiciary taking the actions necessary during wartime? This is wartime; they should be tried as they would be in war.' He elaborated, 'Some of these people, if we assume generosity, may be called ignorant; otherwise, they’re traitors.' The cleric also cited additional instances of turmoil and infighting within Iran’s regime and called for more aggressive terrorist interventions in the region. Ali said, 'After the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh, we refrained from action for two months, and nothing happened. During these two months, on social media and in some outlets, there was talk. God is my witness, I can barely bring myself to say it. Commanders like Bagheri, Salami, and Hajizadeh were accused of ‘political impotence.’ I apologize to them all, but this term—political impotence! This language circulated, questioning why they hesitated to act. Has this created deep-seated distrust—should it be like this?' (Regime television – October 25). A little earlier, on October 25, Alireza Arafi, the government-appointed head of the regime’s seminaries, spoke on state television, condemning any person and institution who opposes the financial and social costs of war and supporting a two-state solution. Arafi emphasized, 'We are at a historical turning point and a sensitive moment, requiring vigilance, wisdom, foundational decisions, bold steps, and resilience against those adversaries who seek to weaken the Islamic world [i.e., the mullahs’ regime]. This is a new scenario entirely. In this grand struggle and monumental confrontation, the first condition is to hold the correct and principled positions.' This 'immense clash' and 'historical turning point,' as this alarmed cleric describes, are the grim consequences of the regime’s warmongering, which has now entrapped his regime. The fact that Iranian officials are doubling down on warmongering and chaos despite overwhelming opposition against these actions within Iran reveals much about the regime’s nature. The regime intended to use war to counter uprisings within Iran and position himself as a regional power and global player. However, this strategy has backfired, leading to fear, division, and internal conflicts within the regime’s war-driven quagmire. And the regime’s costly intervention in the region, which has come at the expense of the most basic needs of millions of Iranians, will give the people more reason to rise up against this regime and take their destiny and country back from the criminal mullahs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq6ywLSsKTxKC	2024-10-28T16:57:15-07:00	
Why Austrian Business Cycle Theory Is Better Than Keynesianism – ...	By Ed Bugos '…boom and bust cycles are caused—not by the mysterious workings of the capitalist system—but by governmental interventions in that system.'—Murray Rothbard Another way to put it is that the primary cause of what you call a recession is central banking, specifically due to their inflationism and underwriting of fractional reserve banking. If you think that inflation is the product of greedy merchants or the animal spirits, or an economy that is just too hot, or climate change, you have been hoodwinked. In the first place, it is not a product of anything. The term refers to the government’s economic and banking policies. These policies have three main effects (and many knock on effects): The Cantillon effects – redistribution of incomes and wealth Interest rate manipulation – creation of unsound booms General price increases – non-uniform, but general rises in prices One of the knock-on effects is a potential run on confidence, which results in acrack-up of the policy, economy, and currency. One of the biggest factors historically behind the declines of civilizations has been the corruption of its money. It is usually the beginning and can last a century. The corruption of the dollar system has lasted over a century and the dollar has been completely fiat for 55 years now. In this time period, it has lost 99 and 85 percent of its value, respectively (since 1913 and 1971). This article will deal with the second effect above: the manipulation of interest rates, which results in the business cycle. Every economic school, other than the Austrian school, blames it on the inherent instability of the capitalist system. And as a result, they all believe the central bank exists in order to counteract these very tendencies and stabilize those wildly free markets. The Austrian school’s contention, on the other hand, is that the central bank creates the instability, and/or makes it worse than it otherwise would be, due to the impact of its forced expansion of credit (through the expansion of the monetary base) on interest rates in particular. In light of this analysis, it becomes evident that the central bank’s goals, which are repeated by the press every other day (balancing full employment and price stability) are blatant lies. They and the economic theories that justify them provide a cloak for the true goals of the central bank system: To inflate asset markets for its Wall Street friends To support, indefinitely, the deficit spending policy of the government To backstop the banking system and inflate its deposits Basically, the central bank is a tool for the theft of income and wealth for the establishment bankers, Wall Street dealers, and the pork barrel interests that influence government the most, as well as for the bureaucrats themselves, as they use it to grow the size and scope of government over time. We recognize that all of those things are justified by mainstream media, but the justifications are fallacious. Notwithstanding, debunking them is not our purpose here. For a more in depth understanding of the economic theory behind it, there are several publications citedhere. Or if you want a quickervideo elaboration, see economics professor Roger Garrison’s one-hour video. You may regard this elaboration as an intro or summary explanation of the theory, but with a focus on the difference between boom and growth. In order to understand the impact of the central bank’s money and interest rate interventions, it might help to define 'boom' and contrast it with genuine 'growth' because, in fact, the booms created by this policy can only ever undermine growth. One of the flaws of the GDP metric—and the approach of most economists in measuring growth—is that it is 'consumption' weighted. It is true that you can measure wealth by the value of final goods in theory, but in practice it is problematic and influenced by the inflation of money supply. More essentially, growth really ought to reflect the trends in production, and importantly, whether it is aimed at producing the things consumers want most urgently (i.e., which they value most). Consumer spending contributes between 60 and 70 percent to GDP, thereby understating all the spending on intermediate or producer goods. This way, economists end up measuring the growth of an economy by how much people spend on consumer goods from period to period. The more they spend, the more growth, presumably. The trouble is, how do you know if they are spending a part of the new wealth they are creating, or if they are depleting their savings, or just borrowing to spend more? The latter would not be an example of growth, yet would be regarded as growth by the government, media, and Wall Street. Certainly, the cause of growth is not consumption. That is only the beneficiary. The real cause of growth is saving and investment into the structure of production so that the economy can produce more, thereby enabling growth in consumption and wealth. Unfortunately, many analysts believe in theparadox of thrift, a puzzle whichAustrian economists solved long ago. This theory posits that while saving may seem like the right thing to do, collectively it produces depressions. This is because many economists see growth emanating from consumption and saving as holding back consumption. Falling consumption—even if it is to produce more growth so that consumption can grow in the future—is viewed as a negative. But because there is so much pressure on politicians to achieve GDP targets and to ensure that it is always growing, even when consumers don’t necessarily want to grow the economy in a given period, there is an immense amount of pressure on the central bank to stimulate investment with the printing press. By inflating credit artificially, they can stimulate investment too, except without the consumer having to make the sacrifice by abstaining in consumption. Hayek called it, 'forced savings.' You can call it 'fake savings.' The new money is mistaken for an increase in savings available for investment. But because capital is scarce and cannot be created out of thin air, if there is no curtailment of consumption, the resources (capital and labor) committed to another section of the production structure will have to be bid away to where the investment bankers want to direct it. Because this intervention bypasses or eliminates the trade-off that consumers have to make between consuming for today and investing for tomorrow, it fuels the demand for consumption and capital goods at the same time, which puts a strain on scarce resources, causing prices to rise. It crowds out real savings, encourages people to consume rather than save, and it allows the government to borrow without forcing interest rates higher in its competition for available savings. We should thus be able to grasp the long-term effects of such a policy. The investment boom that emerges is based on artificial incentives. The lower interest rates inflate the value of various capital goods, usually the favorites of investment bankers and bureaucrats. But this comes at the expense of producing the highest value consumer goods. So, it falls short in creating real wealth, and it depletes the real savings pool. The investment is driven into lines of production that appear to be economic under the ephemeral incentives but are not truly economic. This is not realized until the incentives have to be revoked, which typically happens when either prices rise so much that the central bank loses control of interest rates, or when the central bank revokes the accommodative policy to forestall that point, or for political reasons. At this point, the investment in unproductive enterprises, which is called 'malinvestment,' is laid bare, resulting in a liquidation, and often a financial crisis, thus a system-wide recession. The boom is not only unsound because the policy itself is usually temporary but because it has diverted scarce capital and labor into unproductive and uneconomic investments. Some economists have labelled it a 'cluster of errors' denoting the outcome of artificial signals in the marketplace. Since it diverts scarce capital and labor into the production of goods that eventually have to be liquidated because they are uneconomic enterprises in real terms, this undermines growth—because those resources were not available for the production of things consumers would have really wanted. Genuine growth is fueled by real savings increases. Only investment funded by actual expansion of saving can produce lasting growth. If people or businesses save enough to invest in the structure of production beyond the maintenance of their fixed capital, they will be basically adding to existing capital or forming new capital. The investment usually implies an improvement in productivity or output, or both. This allows for increased consumption in future. Conclusion A boom that is created by an artificial expansion in credit (with the help of inflated money), generated by government monetary policies, is not built on a solid foundation. And when the policy has to be reversed or when the imbalances come home to roost, the malinvestments are revealed as uneconomic, thus the market proceeds to liquidate them. This process is necessary to return the system to one that operates normally, which means one that reflects a market-determined balance between production and consumption so that prices and interest rates can more properly inform entrepreneurs. In this sense, the boom—even if it appears as growth in GDP or employment—is not growth, but rather represents a destruction of capital. On the other hand, the liquidation stage is healthy because it is simply the market trying to return prices and ratios to levels that reflect true signals. Normally the government and everyone else with an interest in the central bank will stop this liquidation before it’s complete because it is too punishing. They paper over it by trying to create a new unsound boom. Often with success on the surface since a boom feels like growth for most of us. But it is a squandering of resources ultimately. And the policy always runs the risk of producing a run in confidence on its funny money. If central banks and their interests were truly interested in eliminating the business cycle, they would stop manipulating money and interest. They would allow the liquidation to run its full course so that the market can reallocate capital and labor on a sounder footing. The important point to illuminate here is that not only is the 'boom' not the same as 'growth,' it comes at the expense of growth. It taxes growth.

Four More Items In The Wages Outpacing Prices Debate – OpEd	Ben Casselman had a usefulpiecein the New York Times examining the extent to which wages have outpaced prices since the pandemic. While he notes that for most people they almost certain have, there are people for whom this is likely not the case. In fact, this will always be the case, even in the best economy, which arguably is what we are seeing now, or at least best in half a century. But there are some additional points to the ones Casselman raised that are worth keeping in mind. Low Wage Workers’ Wages Outpaced Food Inflation First, Casselman notes that not everyone consumes the same basket of items. For lower income people, food is a larger share of their budget and food prices have risen more than the overall rate of inflation since the pandemic. This is true, but it is important to keep in mind that the lowest paid workers have seen the largest wage gains since the pandemic. To take an example, non-supervisory workers in hotels and restaurants had a 32.0 percent increase in their average hourly pay from before the pandemic. Their pay averaged $14.92 an hour in February of 2020. It had risen to $19.69 an hour in September of this year. That easily outpaced the 25.8 percent increase in food prices. No one would try to claim that someone earning $19.69 an hour today is doing well, but they are doing better than the person earning $14.92 an hour at the start of 2020. It would be hard not to score this person as being better off. 14 Million Homeowners Refinanced Their Mortgages Casselman notes that the widely derided increase in house prices has not been bad news for everyone. Specifically, the two-thirds of households that own their home might actually be feeling pretty good that the value of their house has risen. However, there is another aspect to this picture that is also worth noting. More than 14millionhomeowners refinanced their mortgages, taking advantage of the low mortgage rates we saw from the start of the pandemic until the Fed began raising rates in March of 2022. Those that didn’t borrow additional money with a cashout refinance are saving an average of $2,500 a year in interest payments. That would be a big deal for a family with an income around $80,000. For some reason these savings for a large number of middle-class families rarely get mentioned in discussions of people’s well-being. The Number of People Working from Home Has Increased by Almost 20 Million Since the Pandemic Working from home exploded during the pandemic. While it has fallen somewhat since the peak months of the shutdown period, the number of people working remotely is nearly 20millionmore than the pre-pandemic number. This increase is nearly one-eighth of the workforce. These people are saving thousands of dollars a year in commuting costs and other expenses associated with working in an office. They also are saving hundreds of hours a year in commuting time. Any assessment of whether we are better off would need to factor in the impact of the increased opportunity to work from home. Consumers’ Buying Patterns Tell Us They Feel Better Off One way to find out how people feel about the economy is to ask them. Another way is to see what they do. The answers to the first question can be somewhat ambiguous (almost everyone seems to feel they are doing much better than the rest of the country). The answer to the second question is less ambiguous. We see people buying more of just about everything. We have seen recordlevelsof air travel in the last year. We also saw recordlevelsof road travel on the summer holiday weekends. We know numbers can be skewed by the buying patterns of a small number of rich people, but that story is hard to tell here. Wealthier people do fly disproportionately, but with peak summer travel nearing 3 million flights a day, we are looking far beyond the one percent. That story is even more clear with road travel, with more than 60 million people hitting the road on holiday weekends this summer. We can also look to other areas of non-necessary spending that have seen big increases since the pandemic. Purchases of televisions was 79 percenthigherin the third quarter of this year than in the last quarter before the pandemic. (This is quality adjusted, so it does not mean 79 percent more TVs.) Inflation-adjusted purchases of restaurant meals was 10.5 percent higher last quarter than before the pandemic. Purchases at fast-food restaurants was 10.1 percent higher last quarter than before the pandemic. It’s hard to believe that the rich are driving spending at McDonalds and Subway. In short, if we look at what people are spending, they do seem to be considerably better off than before the pandemic. Again, this is not true for everyone. Some people have lost jobs and are now forced to work for lower pay. Some people have become disabled and may be able to work less (often because of the pandemic), or not at all. But if we are trying to look at the big picture, consumption patterns seem to be telling us that people feel they are better off today than they were before the pandemic.

In Post-Hasina Bangladesh, Awami League Faces Uncertain Future Af...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury With its leaders in jail or fleeing from justice, the party that led Bangladesh to independence and ruled for 15 consecutive years faces an existential crisis after a student uprising toppled the autocratic prime minister in August, analysts say. Students, who have since carried on with street protests, and some smaller political parties have demanded that the Awami League party be banned over the estimated 750 deaths linked to pro-democracy demonstrations that began in July and led to the fall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Last week, the interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus banned the Chhatra League, Awami’s student wing, whose members took part in violence that targeted students protesting against the Hasina government. Now, there are questions about whether the transitional government will follow suit by banning Awami and preventing it from participating in elections. Leaders of the student movement that toppled Hasina are serving in the Yunus government. Since Yunus took office on Aug. 8, he has promised to reform state institutions and prepare the country for free and fair polls. Hasina, who fled to India after resigning three days earlier, and her party had been accused of rigging recent general elections in Awami’s favor. 'Awami League is a 75-year-old party in Bangladesh. Sounds unbelievable but true: The Awami League faces charges of genocide,' Sabbir Ahmed, a political science professor at Dhaka University, told BenarNews. About 20 party members have been ordered to appear before the nation’s International Crimes Tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide, according to media reports. Hasina is the daughter of Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s founding president, who had led it to break free from Pakistan, whose forces were accused of committing genocide during the war of independence in 1971. The Awami party was founded in 1949, when Bangladesh was then known as East Pakistan. 'The party chief [Hasina] hurriedly fled to India, making hundreds of thousands of her party leaders vulnerable,' Ahmed said. Hasnat Abdullah, coordinator of theStudents Movement Against Discrimination, which had spearheaded the anti-Hasina uprising, called for the tribunal to put party members on trial. He also said Awami must be banned. Ahmed, the analyst, expects party leaders to remain and to organize online. 'TheChhatra Leaguehas been banned, but, I think, Awami League will not be banned, and it will stage a comeback, although slowly. They would take part in the upcoming elections – if they remain in the electoral political system, someday they will return,' he said. 'Awami League is a registered political party. There is no legal bar against conducting political activities, though their leaders have gone into hiding. The senior leaders will, now, utilize the online platform and the social media to organize themselves,' Ahmed said. An Awami League official who has been in hiding because he faces arrest over violence linked to the protests promised that his party would be back. 'The Awami League is a party having leaders and supporters even at every hamlet of the country. You will see we must return to politics, we are just waiting for an opportune time,' Joint Secretary Bahauddin Nasim told BenarNews. 'I do not claim that we made no mistakes. We are learning from our mistakes. We will present a reform of the party,' he said. 'If they ban Awami League, it will be more popular.' Another party member took a more hardline stance. Awami League presidium member Jahangir Kabir Nanak went on Facebook on Friday to declare that Hasina was still prime minister. He warned that the Awami League would one day try Yunus’ 'illegal' government. ‘Their future is not bright’ According to another analyst, Bangladeshis had largely been sympathetic to the Awami League and Hasina since the August 1975 assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But that changed when her government became more autocratic. '[T]his time, people are highly hostile to Awami League for 15 years of authoritarian rule. Their future is not bright,' Md. Shamsul Alam, a professor of government and politics at Jahangirnagar University, told BenarNews. 'The way party chief Sheikh Hasina abruptly fled to India without considering the safety of hundreds of thousands of her leaders and workers cannot be substantiated by any definition of leadership,' he said. He noted that the Awami League was split into three factions following Rahman’s assassination and in 2008, senior party members proposed dropping Hasina from her leadership role. 'But they overcame all hurdles in the past. This time, the crisis is existential as the party leaders are facing trials for misdeeds. This is difficult for them to overcome soon,' he said. Meanwhile, officials fromBNP, the top opposition party during Hasina’s rule, and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, expressed concern about possible future consequences. 'The Awami League leaders must face trial for massacres and other crimes. But Awami League must not be banned,' Zahir Uddin Swapon, chief spokesman for the BNP, told BenarNews. 'We have learned from the Awami League what consequences would await if the state authority were used in politics,' he said. 'We want the Awami League to be tried by popular judgment through votes.' Matiur Rahman Akanda, the publicity secretary of theBangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, agreed with Swapon. 'The people will decide about the Awami League for destroying the country’s democracy,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq9Nsl8hc-WrV	2024-10-28T16:52:21-07:00	
The 2024 Austrian Elections And The Rise Of The Freedom Party Of ...	By Saman Ayesha Kidwai The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) emerged as the largest party in the 2024 general elections, winning over 28 per cent of total votes (almost 13 per cent more than the previous election).1 The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) secured around 26 per cent of the vote share followed by Social Democrats with 21 per cent, the New Austrians with 9 per cent, and Greens with 8 per cent.2 President Alexander Van der Bellen has entrusted Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s government with administrative duties (as a caretaker administration) until a new leader assumes charge. Notably, the Austrian constitution does not specify a time period within which a new government must be formed after election results are announced. It could vary depending on the pace and success (or failure) of negotiations between various parties. The FPÖ was founded by Anton Reinthaller, a former SS Officer associated with the Nazi party.3 It was part of coalition governments in 2000 and during 2017–2019. While its primary support base is made up of people between the age of 35 and 59,4 it also acquired the largest support this year from a critical voting bloc—the youth and those part of the labour force—voters under 35. This development has spurred a wave of celebration among other far-right figures5 across Europe like Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini and Viktor Orbán. FPO’s performance shows that Austria’s political landscape is aligned with the broader shift to the far-right across Europe, with hardening anti-migrant rhetoric. Across Hungary, Italy, France and Germany, far-right politicians are steadily gaining ground amid the growing popularisation of conspiracy theories through social media, such as the Great Replacement6 and concepts such as Remigration.7 The recent policy measures introduced by the EU regarding immigration,8 which human rights organisations have decried, is a testament to disenchantment with the liberal democratic governance and globalisation. These trends have been supplemented by a resurgence of tribalism9 and nationalism, rejection of multiculturalism, widening socio-economic marginalisation and misinformation and disinformation that have become rampant on social media platforms. As has been observed since the 1800s, far-right and populist policies have gained momentum following a period of upheaval or crisis. Concerns regarding the viability of the Bretton Woods system and rising immigration levels across Europe, which had begun simmering mainly after the 2008 financial crisis and the 2015 refugee crisis, boiled over after the COVID-19 outbreak. As parties across the continent faced backlash for the lockdown measures and imposition of vaccination drives, the locals’ disgruntlement and skepticism about the implications of COVID-19 vaccines and handling of the health crisis grew louder. The anti-government sentiments festered as governments found themselves increasingly challenged at countering the false narratives about the lockdown measures and vaccines being promoted by conspiracy theorists rampantly. Austria was no exception to the pushback felt across the continent against vaccine mandates,10 and the far-right conservatives sought to capitalise on the resentment felt deeply by the populace in order to secure electoral benefits. The measure to impose a fine—ranging from 600 to 3,600—on those adults refusing vaccination, despite being quickly shelved, had evidently generated significant hostility among the people on the ground. Furthermore, the paranoia generated by FPÖ about Muslim immigrants outnumbering the majority population, failure of these immigrants to assimilate into the national culture, and potential Islamist radicalisation, potentially contributed to its recent success. It would not be improbable to assume that the projections by the Austrian Academy of Science that Muslims could comprise 12 to 21 per cent11 of the Austrian society by 2046, would have exacerbated the anti-immigration and anti-Islam rhetoric that has extensively been propounded by far-right parties such as FPÖ as part of its Fortress Austria platform.12 At the same time, the rising cost of living and gas prices and socio-economic crisis have worked in FPÖ’s favour. In the background of the Ukraine conflict and Austria’s dependence on Russian gas (surpassing the EU average), inflation and total household expenditures will surge as the bloc doubles down on Austrian consumption of Russian gas. Notably, FPÖ has argued favourably about continuing the purchase of Russian gas despite European attempts to diversify since 2022.13 Key Considerations The possibility of the Social Democrats combining with ÖVP and other smaller parties like Greens to form an alternative coalition government to prevent the FPÖ from assuming office has been discussed. President Van der Bellen has proposed14 that ÖVP enter into a coalition government with Social Democrats. However, such ideologically opposing movements would find themselves at odds over key domestic and foreign policy issues and could bolster the FPO’s capacity to emerge much stronger moving forward. The ÖVP, The New Austria, Social Democratic Party, among others, profess differing views on issues such as immigration, climate change, economic policies and multiculturalism.15 In the event a pan-ideological coalition government takes charge, there seems little to suggest that it would be able to curb the rise of the far-right FPÖ while maintaining a consensus on policy issues. The FPÖ and the ÖVP came together as allies in a coalition government in 2000 and then in 2017. Any political party hoping to enter into a coalition government would require to muster at least 92 out of 183 seats in the National Council (Legislature). At the moment, the FPÖ has the largest vote share with 57 seats. The ÖVP has 51 seats, the Social Democrats 41 seats, the New Austria Party 18 seats, followed by Greens with 16 seats.16 It remains to be seen whether the centre-right ÖVP will come to the aid of the FPÖ in exchange for concessions that involve a stake beyond the Chancellery.17 One of the key concessions, which seems unlikely at the moment, would require FPÖ’s leader, Herbert Kickl, to be sidelined from the subsequent coalition government. His party ran the campaign with him as Austria’s future leader. Simultaneously, he could step aside from claims to leadership in the government, based on the precedent established by the party’s previous head, Jörg Haider, in 2000, while exercising power through a proxy. If no coalition government can be proposed, the country and its leaders could be thrust into another round of elections. If negotiations between other political parties falter, Austria might find itself breaking ranks with the rest of the European Union members regarding the Russia–Ukraine conflict. The FPÖ has been critical of the sanctions against President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials due to the Ukraine crisis. This makes Kickl’s party one of the few pro-Russian political factions in Europe. FPÖ’s potential presence in a future government would be perceived as another concerning development following Robert Fico’s victory in Slovakia last year. Fico had also campaigned on an anti-Ukrainian narrative. Furthermore, FPÖ has envisaged remodelling Austria as per the model of governance practiced in Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. Several EU parliamentarians have criticised18 the erosion of liberal democracy under Orbán’s leadership and, therefore, would want Austria to presumably avoid the same fate. Conclusion It remains to be seen whether the FPÖ can convert the zeitgeist favouring far-right populism to emerge as the single-largest party and form a government without external support following the next elections. This is because, despite the Austrian tilt towards the far-right over the past several years, some key factors continue hindering the far-right from sweeping into power single-handedly with a majority stake. This includes the stark reminders of the policies enacted during the Nazi era, continued resistance (with its ebbs and flows) by political and civil society actors against cooperating with the far-right across Europe, and a largely pro-Ukrainian worldview among Europeans. Widespread protests, with numbers ranging between 15,000 and 17,000,19 were held in Vienna to express outrage against the far-right’s victory and to display resistance to Kickl’s ambition to sweep into power. These trends indicate that the FPÖ has challenges in its path of power and unless significant compromises can be made on its ideological platform and tangible assurances given to the public, it is unlikely to secure a stake in the government in the immediate future.

The Lifestyles Of The World’s Super Rich Threaten People And Plan...	The world’s superrich—including about 50 billionaires—produce, on average, more carbon through their investments, private jets and yachts in just over an hour-and-a half than the average person does in an entire lifetime, says a new Oxfam report released October 28. 'The super-rich are treating our planet like their personal playground, setting it ablaze for pleasure and profit. Their dirty investments and luxury toys—private jets and yachts—aren’t just symbols of excess; they’re a direct threat to people and the planet,' said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. 'Oxfam’s research makes it painfully clear: the extreme emissions of the richest, from their luxury lifestyles and even more from their polluting investments, are fueling inequality, hunger and—make no mistake— threatening lives. It’s not just unfair that their reckless pollution and unbridled greed is fueling the very crisis threatening our collective future—it’s lethal,' said Behar. The first-of-its-kind study, 'Carbon Inequality Kills,' tracks the emissions from private jets, yachts and polluting investments and details how the super-rich are fueling inequality, hunger and death across the world. Asked whether this would necessitate a voluntary change of lifestyles by the rich and famous, Alex Maitland, one of the authors of the Oxfam report told IDN: 'The super-rich have shown, time and again, that they can’t be trusted to voluntarily take action'. But this isn’t simply about individual responsibility, he said, 'it’s about reimagining the economic systems that allow, and even encourage, their overconsumption and pollution'. 'We need governments to step up, tax the wealth of rich polluters, and regulate corporations so that they cut emissions—not in small measures, but radically and quickly,' said Maitland. The report comes ahead of COP29, amidst growing fears that climate breakdown is accelerating, driven largely by the emissions of the richest people. The 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly known as COP29, will be the 29th United Nations Climate Change conference—and is scheduled to take place in Baku, Azerbaijan from 11 to 22 November 2024. If the world continues its current emissions, the carbon budget (the amount of CO2 that can still be added to the atmosphere without causing global temperatures to rise above 1.5°C) will be depleted in about four years. However, if everyone’s emissions matched those of the richest 1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in under five months. And if everyone started emitting as much carbon as the private jets and superyachts of the average billionaire in Oxfam’s study, it would be gone in two days. The report, the first-ever study to look at both the luxury transport and polluting investments of billionaires, presents detailed new evidence of how their outsized emissions are accelerating climate breakdown and wreaking havoc on lives and economies. The world’s poorest countries and communities have done the least to cause the climate crisis, yet they experience its most dangerous consequences. Oxfam found that, on average, 50 of the world’s richest billionaires took 184 private jet flights in a single year, spending 425 hours in the air —producing as much carbon as the average person would in 300 years. In the same period, their yachts emitted as much carbon as the average person would in 860 years. Jeff Bezos’ two private jets spent nearly 25 days in the air over a 12-month period and emitted as much carbon as the average US Amazon employee would in 207 years.Carlos Slim took 92 trips in his private jet, equivalent to circling the globe five times. The Walton family, heirs of the Walmart retail chain, own three superyachts that in one year produced as much carbon as around 1,714 Walmart shop workers. Billionaires’ lifestyle emissions dwarf those of ordinary people, but the emissions from their investments are dramatically higher still —the average investment emissions of 50 of the world’s richest billionaires are around 340 times their emissions from private jets and superyachts combined. Through these investments, billionaires have huge influence over some of the world’s biggest corporations and are driving us over the edge of climate disaster. Nearly 40 percent of billionaire investments analyzed in Oxfam’s research are in highly polluting industries: oil, mining, shipping and cement.On average, a billionaire’s investment portfolio is almost twice as polluting as an investment in the S&P 500. However, if their investments were in a low-carbon-intensity investment fund, their investment emissions would be 13 times lower. Oxfam’s report details three critical areas, providing national and regional breakdowns, where the emissions of the world’s richest 1 percent since 1990 are already having —and are projected to have— devastating consequences: Global inequality. The emissions of the richest 1 percent have caused global economic output to drop by $2.9 trillion since 1990. The biggest impact will be in countries least responsible for climate breakdown. Low- and lower-middle-income countries will lose about 2.5 percent of their cumulative GDP between 1990 and 2050. Southern Asia, South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa will lose 3 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. High-income countries, on the other hand, will accrue economic gains. Hunger. The emissions of the richest 1 percent have caused crop losses that could have provided enough calories to feed 14.5 million people a year between 1990 and 2023. This will rise to 46 million people annually between 2023 and 2050, with Latin America and the Caribbean especially affected (9 million a year by 2050). Death. 78 percent of excess deaths due to heat through 2120 will occur in low- and lower-middle-income countries. 'It’s become so tiring, to be resilient. It’s not something that I have chosen to be —it was necessary to survive. A child shouldn’t need to be strong. I just wanted to be safe, to play in the sand —but I was always fleeing when storms came. Counting dead bodies after a typhoon isn’t something any child should have to do. And whether we survive or not, the rich polluters don’t even care,' said Marinel Sumook Ubaldo, a young climate activist from the Philippines. Rich countries have failed to keep their $100 billion climate finance promise, and heading into COP29, there is no indication that they will set a new climate finance goal that adequately addresses the climate financing needs of Global South countries. Oxfam warns that the cost of global warming will continue to rise unless the richest drastically reduce their emissions. Ahead of COP29, Oxfam calls on governments to: Reduce the emissions of the richest. Governments must introduce permanent income and wealth taxes on the top 1 percent, ban or punitively tax carbon-intensive luxury consumptions—starting with private jets and superyachts—nd regulate corporations and investors to drastically and fairly reduce their emissions. Make rich polluters pay. Climate finance needs are enormous and escalating, especially in Global South countries that are withstanding the worst climate impacts. A wealth tax on the world’s millionaires and billionaires could raise at least $1.7 trillion annually. A wealth tax on investments in polluting activities could bring in another $100 billion. Reimagine our economies. The current economic system, designed to accumulate wealth for the already rich through relentless extraction and consumption, has long undermined a truly sustainable and equitable future for all. Governments need to commit to ensuring that, both globally and at a national level, the incomes of the top 10 percent are no higher than the bottom 40 percent.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zqww7EOR8tVG_	2024-10-28T16:48:26-07:00	
Pakistan: Target Acquired In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On October 25, 2024, a 19-year-old under training Army lieutenant, Arif Ullah, who was on leave at his hometown, was gunned down by unidentified militants during prayers in a mosque in the Sarai Naurang area of Lakki Marwat District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Two other persons also sustained injuries in the incident. According to a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Gentleman Cadet Arif Ullah was offering prayers in the mosque when the attack took place. The cadet was undergoing training in Kakul, but had returned to his hometown of Lakki Marwat on leave, ISPR said. On October 14, 2024, a Frontier Corps (FC) trooper, Gulzar Ali, was shot dead while two civilians sustained injuries after unidentified assailants opened fire on them in the Tank District of KP. Gulzar Ali was home on holidays. October 9, 2024, an FC trooper, on leave and visiting his family, was abducted in the Tank District of KP. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) affiliated channels claimed responsibility for the abduction. These incidents of targeting ‘on-leave’ SFs point to a new trend in recent months in KP. Though target killings SF personnel, particularly when they are off duty or visiting their homes, has been ongoing since 2023, when two such fatalities were recorded, there has been a sharp rise in such killing in 2024. According to theSouth Asia Terrorism Portal(SATP), at least 16 SF personnel have been killed in 16 incidents of such targeted attack in the current year. There is also a wider surge of attacks on SFs in the province. According to partial data compiled by SATP, KP has recorded 324 SF fatalities in 2024 (data till October 27, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, there were 260 SF fatalities. During the whole of 2023, there were 329 such fatalities. In fact, with almost two months remaining in the current year, SF fatalities in 2023 threaten to be the highest in a year since 2009, when 494 such fatalities were recorded. According to a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) report published on September 19, 2024, as many as 337 personnel of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) were killed while 616 injured in terrorist attacks carried out by terrorist outfits in the province this year. Dera Ismail Khan suffered the largest number of SF casualties, at 63, while Bannu suffered 58, North Waziristan 50 and South Waziristan 38 fatalities. At least 29 SF personnel were killed in Bajaur, 22 in Khyber, 18 in Peshawar and 16 in the Kurram District. Eleven SF personnel each were killed in Malakand and Mardan, 10 in Kohat, eight in Dir, two in Mohmand and one in Hazara District. Some of the major targeted attack on Security Forces in the current year include: October 24: At least 10 Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were killed and another three sustained injuries when their post was targeted by militants in the Draban area of Dera Ismail Khan District. October 8: At least eight SFs personnel were killed and two were injured in a militant attack in Kurram District. The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) faction of TTP claimed responsibility for the attack. July 15: A total of 12 terrorists, including two suicide bombers, and eight SF personnel were killed in a terrorist attack in the Bannu Cantonment of Bannu District. Jaish-e-Fursan-e-Muhammad, a faction of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group of TTP took responsibility for the attack. March 16: Seven soldiers, including two officers, were killed in a suicide attack on an SF post in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan District. Hafiz Gul Bahadur affiliated Jaish Al-Fursan claimed responsibility for the attack. February 5: At least 10 Policemen were killed and another six personnel sustained injuries in a terrorist attack on the Chaudhvan Police Station in the Dera Ismail Khan District. January 8: At least five Police personnel were killed and 22 were injured in a bomb attack on a Police vehicle in the Mamondtehsil(revenue unit) of Bajaur District. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack. The surge of targeted attacks against SF personnel can be attributed to the three principal factors: the United States (US)-Western withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan; the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 14, 2021; and finally, the collapse of ‘official talks’ between the Pakistan Government and TTP on November 28, 2022. The spike in violence in KP in 2023 was foreseeable, when TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali asked his fighters to resume attacks in the wake of the collapse of peace-talks. On January 2, 2024, the Federal Ministry of Interior informed the Senate (Upper House of Parliament) that the continuous influx of TTP cadres in significant numbers, with recruitment, training and deployment of suicide bombers, in the merged Districts [districts which were part of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and now merged with KP] of KP was 'cause for concern'. Significantly, when the US pulled its forces out from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind around USD 7 billion worth of military equipment and weapons, including firearms, communications gear, and even armoured vehicles. The Afghan Taliban seized the weapons during the chaotic US withdrawal. On September 8, 2023, the Pakistan Foreign Office expressed concern over the 'advanced weapons' being used by terrorists operating out of Afghanistan, in attacks in Pakistan, particularly on its security agencies. 'These modern weapons have fallen into the hands of terrorists in Afghanistan, who are using these [weapons] to attack Pakistan and its security agencies,' Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch stated. Meanwhile, the TTP is now the largest terrorist group in Afghanistan, enjoying operational and logistical support from both the Afghan Taliban and factions of the Al Qaeda terrorist network. 'The Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group: the bonds are close, and the debt owed to TTP significant,' states the 15th report of the ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda/Taliban Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council. Estimating its strength at around 6,000-6,500 fighters, the report notes that TTP is now the largest among the two dozen or so such groups that enjoy freedom to manoeuvre, under the oversight of the Taliban regime. The report notes that TTP 'continues to operate at significant scale in Afghanistan and to conduct terrorist operations into Pakistan from there, often utilising Afghans'. 'TTP has intensified attacks against Pakistan, significantly increasing from 573 in 2021 to 715 in 2022 and 1,210 in 2023, with the trend continuing into 2024,' the report, updated until May 28, 2024, states. Further, a new United Nations Security Council (UNSC) report released July 31, 2024, highlighted the severe threat to Pakistan's security from TTP, noting increased collaboration between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban in cross-border terrorist attacks, primarily targeting Pakistani military posts. 'With Taliban acquiescence, and at times support, TTP has intensified attacks inside Pakistan primarily targeting military installations,' the report from the UNSC’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIL (Daish), Al-Qaeda and associate groups, noted. Earlier on December 15, 2023, Pakistan urged a United Nations (UN) panel to investigate how TTP was acquiring modern weaponry to carry out terrorist attacks in the country. Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative, highlighted the alarming trend during a UN Security Council (UNSC) open debate on the threat posed by the diversion, illicit trafficking, and misuse of small arms and light weapons. He argued that terrorist groups like TTP acquire such weapons 'from illicit arms markets or receive them from entities that want to destabilise a particular region or country.' On September 9, 2024, frustrated with targeted killing by terrorists, Police personnel of Lakki Marwat District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa staged a protest sit-in against the terrorist attacks targeting law enforcement personnel. A consultation was held at the Police lines, where they presented their demands, including a call for full authority for police operations, and protection for officers. Following the discussions, they blocked the Bannu-Mianwali Road of the Indus Highway as part of their demonstration. Further on September 11, the Bajaur District Police announced the boycott of duties for Anti-Polio Campaigns because of Police consistently being targeted and killed while protecting polio eradication teams. The announcement was made in a video clip by scores of Policemen. The 50-second clip, seen byDawn, shows several Policemen gathered at the Police Lines in Khar, announcing their decision to boycott the vaccination drive in protest. Policemen from at least three Southern Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had already been protesting against the targeted attacks over the preceding week. In the wake of this new development, while the terrorists were equipped with modern sophisticated weapons, including sniper rifles and thermal sensors, the provincial Police forces who stand on the first line of defence, remain ill-equipped. On October 1, 2024, the Chief Minister of KP, Ali Amin Gandapur, chaired a high-level meeting in Peshawar to discuss peace and security in the province, particularly in the merged Districts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and southern KP. To enhance the capabilities of Police, 122 bulletproof vehicles were allocated to former FATA Districts, PKR 7 billion was provided for the Police in the merged districts, and PKR 1 billion was released for the purchase of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs). Additionally, 1,300 Police positions were announced for the Tank and Lakki Marwat Districts in Southern KP. Measures proposed by the Tribal Grand Jirga are also to be considered, including compensation for losses suffered by Tribal Districts’ residents. Despite the Provincial government’s claim of anti-terrorism measures to curb terrorism in the province, the terrorists continue to thrive and to target SF personnel with impunity.

India: Deepening Containment In Maharashtra – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On October 21, 2024, five Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadres were killed in an encounter with Security Forces (SFs) in a forest area under the BhamragadhTaluka(revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. The slain Maoists were identified as Sukhmati, RitaakaDeve and Jaya (women cadres), and Basant and Saoji (male cadres). Many criminal cases, including encounters, arson, murder, etc., were had been registered against these Maoists, who carried a combined bounty of INR 3.8 million. One Policeman also sustained injuries in the encounter. Police also recovered five guns from the encounter site. A press release, subsequent to the incident, issued by the office of the Gadchiroli Superintendent of Police (SP) stated, 'In view of the November 20 elections, a group of Maoists had gathered in the forest on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border for the last two days and was planning an attack. As many as 22 teams of C-60 commandos and two squads of the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] under the supervision of senior officers launched an anti-Naxal [Left Wing Extremism, LWE] operation. As soon as they reached the area, the SFs faced indiscriminate firing from Naxalites. The security personnel immediately retaliated, and in the ensuing exchange of fire, five Maoists were killed. ' Earlier, on July 17, 2024, 12 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter between C-60 commandos and Maoists at Wandoli village in Gadchiroli District. 12 bodies of Maoists were recovered from the spot along with seven automatic weapons, including three AK-47s, two INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifles, one carbine, and one SLR (self-loading rifle). Two SF personnel, including a C-60 sub-inspector and one jawan, were injured in the encounter. SP Neelotpal disclosed, 'Credible information was received yesterday morning that 12 to 15 members of Korchi-Tipagad and Chatgaon-Kasansur joint Local Organisation Squad (LOS) are camping in a forest area near Chhattisgarh border in Wandoli village with an aim to carry out subversive activities in view of the upcoming Martyrs' Week observed by Naxalites (between July 28 and August 3). Entire Korchi-Tipagad and Chatgaon-Kasansur LOS of Naxalites, including three senior cadres of the rank of divisional committee member, five area committee members and four Dalam (squad) members carrying a total reward of Rs 86 lakhs [INR 8.6 million] were wiped off in the encounter. Most of north Gadchiroli has been cleared of armed Maoist formations.' On May 13, 2024, three Maoists were shot dead in an encounter near Katrangatta village in BhamragadTalukain Gadchiroli District. The killed Maoists included PermiliDalam(armed squad) ‘commander’ Vasu Samar Korcha, who carried an INR 2.2 million bounty; Reshma Madkam, an ‘Area Committee Member’ and Kamla Madavi. Arms, including three automatic weapons — one AK-47, one carbine, and one INSAS assault rifle — and Maoist literature and other belongings were recovered from the incident location. 'Korcha and the two women were the last of the three remaining members of thedalam. The trio was trying to mobilise villagers and plan subversive activities,' SP Neelotpal said. At one time, the PermiliDalamlorded over a 1,000-square-kilometres patch in the Maharashtra. These incidents in Gadchiroli are indicative of the deepening containment against the rebels in the district, with the aggressive action against the Maoists resulting in the decimation of the rebel formations. According to partial data collated by theSouth Asia Terrorism Portal(SATP), at least 24Naxaliteshave been killed by SFs in the Gadchiroli District in 2024 (data till October 27). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had neutralised fourNaxalites, and another two rebels in the remaining period of 2023, taking the total to sixNaxalitesthrough 2023. TwoNaxaliteswere neutralised in 2022, and another 49 in 2021. On the other hand, in the fight against theNaxalites,SFs have not lost a single trooper in the district in the current year (till October 27). During the corresponding period of 2023 also, no SF trooper was killed, nor any in the remaining period of 2023. Moreover, no SF fatality was registered in 2022 as well as in 2021. The last SF fatality was recorded on August 14, 2020, when a Police Constable, Dushyant Nandeshwar (26) was killed while another Constable, Dinesh Bhosale was injured when a CPI-Maoist ‘action team’ shot them in a market at Kothi village under Bhamragad tehsil in Gadchiroli District. Significantly, since 2021, the SFs have emphatically crushed rebel activities/developments in Gadchiroli. Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documentingNaxaliteviolence and activities in the district and the State, the kill ratio emphatically remained in favour of SFs in 2006 at 1:16.5; 2007 at 1:4; 2008 at 1: 1.75; 2011 at 1: 2.22; 2013 at 1:3.85; 2016 at 1:11; 2017 at 1: 4.66; 2018 at 1: 25.5; and 2020 at 1:3. On the other hand, the Maoists got the better of SFs in 2005, with a ratio of 2.12:1; 2009 at 1.40:1; 2010 at 5:1; 2012 at 2.6:1; 2014 at 1.1:1; and 2015 at 2:1. Nevertheless, the overall kill ratio in the district remained in favour of SFs at 1:2.09. In the interim, according to the SATP database, SFs have already arrested nineNaxalitesin 2024 (data till October 27) in the Gadchiroli District, in addition to seven in 2023. 366Naxaliteshave been arrested in the district since March 6, 2000. Moreover, at least 12Naxaliteshave surrendered in 2024, in addition to three in 2023. 281Naxaliteshave surrendered in the district since March 6, 2000. The total number of arrests in the state is 490 since March 6, 2000, while 307Naxaliteshave surrendered. Civilian fatalities, a key index of security, have been following a cyclical trend in the district, without considerable relief. Three civilians have been killed in the district in the current year (till October 27). During the corresponding period of 2023, the Maoists killed one civilian. Through 2023, five civilian fatalities were recorded, in addition to five civilians killed in 2022 and four in 2021. The most common alibi given by the Maoists targeting the civilians was that their victims were working as 'informers' or 'spying’ for the Police. Several other parameters indicate that theNaxalitesare losing their sway in Gadchiroli and are also unable to orchestrate significant violence or disruptive activities due to aggressive SF consolidation in the district over the past four years and 10 months, since 2020. No major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in the civilian or SF category have been reported since 2020. At peak, four such incidents each were recorded in 2009 and 2010. Eight arson-related incidents have been recorded since 2020 – three in 2020, one in 2021, three in 2022, and one in 2023. At peak, 11 such incidents were recorded in 2019. The Maoists have engineered one incident of explosion since 2020, on May 27, 2019, during an exchange fire with a team of elite C-60 Commandos in Gadchiroli District. At peak, five such incidents were recorded in 2005. Gadchiroli, with a total area of 14,412 square kilometres, of which 11,694 square kilometres, i.e., 78.40 per cent, fall under forest cover, has, for long, provided an ideal and safe landscape for the Maoists to operate in, as the task of locating and sanitising extremists’ sanctuaries becomes difficult due to the exigencies of the terrain. Moreover, the district shares borders with Chhattisgarh, the worstNaxalite-affected Indian state, as well as with Telangana, historically the heartland of the insurgency, making it a perfect hideout for the Maoists. As a result, the district emerged as the epicentre of LWE violence in Maharashtra. Since March 6, 2000, Gadchiroli has recorded at least 721 Maoist-linked fatalities, including 166 SF personnel, 348 Maoists, 195 civilians and 12 in the unspecified category. At its peak in 2009, Gadchiroli recorded at least 99 fatalities, including 52 SF personnel, 37 Maoists, and 10 civilians. Thereafter, however, the district has seen a noticeable weakening of rebel strength. According to an October 25, 2024, media reportage, 10,000 additional paramilitary forces, approximately 150 drones, and 100 anti-mine vehicles have been deployed for poll preparations in Gadchiroli and Gondia, the two Maoist-affected districts of Maharashtra, to contain any potential sabotage the rebels during the upcoming Assembly election on November 20, 2024. SFs focused on sealing off the borders with neighbouring states, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh, from where Maoists could sneak in to disrupt polling. Further, SFs also decided to launch joint operations in the heart of the Maoist headland, Abujhmadh, to cut off possible entry and exit routes. The passage connecting Abujhmadh and the Maoists' alternative stronghold in the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone is also being cut off, with strong deployment. Sustained SF efforts to completely sanitise the ostensible ‘Red Corridor’ are essential to restoring an enduring peace in Gadchiroli and the region. The declining trends in violence in the district suggest that Maoist capacities are at a terminal stage in this erstwhile area of dominance. Aggressive operations to consolidate the gains are necessary to establish a lasting peace in the region.

Privacy In The Confessional: Is Your Smartphone Listening To Your...	By Jonah McKeown Anyone who uses a smartphone has likely experienced the same unsettling phenomenon — a pointedly placed advertisement that seems to show up right after you’ve discussed a topic or product. Could it be true that your phone is 'listening' to your private conversations? It’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer — and one that has bred enough uncertainty that bishops are starting to issue bans on smartphones in that most private of Catholic spaces: the confessional. Here’s what you need to know about the privacy concerns surrounding smartphones and how one Catholic diocese is responding. Protecting the seal Right off the bat, it’s important to point out that the Catholic Church takes privacy in the confessional very seriously. The sacrament of confession, also called reconciliation, was implemented by Jesus Christ as the means of forgiving sins. He passed the authority to forgive sins down to his apostles, who in turn passed it down to the priests of today. The 'seal of confession' binds priests to treat a penitent’s privacy with the utmost solemnity; in fact, over the centuries,some priests have chosen deathrather than reveal what they have heard. If a priest reveals any information he learned in the context of confession, he will be excommunicated from the Churchlatae sententiae— essentially, automatically. What about if someone else hears your confession, or you accidentally overhear someone else confessing their sins? Well, in that instance, the person overhearing the confession is bound by what is known as the 'secret' and is forbidden from sharing any of that information. It’s possible that a Catholic layperson could be excommunicated for breaking the secret, though normally it would involve a penal process rather than occurring automatically like it does for priests. As you can imagine, intentionally recording someone’s confession is also a big no-no. The Church formally addressed this problemin a 1988 decreein which the Congregation (now Dicastery) for the Doctrine of the Faith wrote that anyone who records or divulges a person’s confession is excommunicated from the Churchlatae sententiae. Smartphones — worth the risk? It’s long been known that the 'smart assistants' built into almost every modern phone, such as Apple’s Siri, do indeed 'listen' constantly for wake words such as 'Hey Siri' unless a user specificallyturns that setting off.(The odds are good that most tech-savvy people who are concerned about privacy have already done this.) Perhaps a deeper concern, though, is the myriad of smartphone apps that inexplicably ask for full access to a user’s camera, microphone, and location — despite no clear need for control over those aspects of a user’s phone. Could those apps be 'spying' on us? This long-simmering fear was thrust back into the spotlight late last year when itcame to lightthat CMG Local Solutions, a subsidiary of Cox Media Group, was openly bragging about its ability to listen through the microphones of people’s smart devices to 'identify buyers based on casual conversations in real time' using artificial intelligence. CMG quickly backpedaled when challenged, claiming that it had never listened to anyone’s private conversations and didn’t have access to anything beyond 'third-party aggregated, anonymized, and encrypted data used for ad placement.' Despite CMG having ties to Google, Amazon, and Facebook through those companies’ ad partner programs, all three of those companies denied they were ever a part of CMG’s 'Active Listening' program. But many have found these denials unconvincing. Browsing online, you’ll findpageafterpageof warnings that yes, indeed, your smartphone is listening in on you. (Granted, many of them are blog posts from cybersecurity companies that are selling privacy-related products, which makes them either more or less credible, depending on how you look at it.) Plus, the revelation from CMG throws some additional uncertainty into the mix. So what does the evidence say? According to one technology expert, it’s complicated. David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, told CNA that research he has personally conducted suggests that the question of whether our smartphones are constantly listening to our private conversations is, for the most part, 'no.' Choffnes, who is also an associate professor of computer science, conductedstudies in both 2018 and 2020to test the hypothesis that our phones are constantly listening. Choffnes and his colleagues ultimately examined more than 17,000 apps in an attempt to gain information about their potential to leak media content. While their analysis did uncover some security risks, 'we found no evidence that apps are surreptitiously recording audio from our phone’s microphones,' he noted. The results they got when they tested smart speakers like Amazon Alexa, however, were a different story. Most models they tested, as mentioned before, didn’t 'wake up' and start recording unless a specific 'wake word' was spoken. But sometimes, Choffnes warned, smart speakers can unexpectedly activate without a user’s knowledge because theythinkthe wake word was spoken. Choffnes also said their tests suggested that smart speakers generally collect 'only a few seconds of recording most of the time, but sometimes it was tens of seconds.' As for whether any actual human will ever hear those recordings, Choffnes noted that there have been cases where private conversations were made accessible to third-party contractors who listened to them for the purpose of improving voice assistant accuracy for speech recognition. 'So there is concern that real people have listened to real conversations. Contractually, these conversations should not be shared or leaked, but of course contracts don’t prevent misuse,' he said. 'In short, I think it’s always a good idea to be cautious, but I don’t think this [secret recording by smartphones] should be a primary concern for smart device users at the moment,' he continued. 'On the other hand, I do think there is incredible value in removing technology from spaces that we intend to be private — not only for privacy but also for peace of mind and elimination of distractions.' When asked about his opinion on policies banning smartphones in the Catholic confessional, Choffnes said that as a scientist, he 'strongly [endorses] this position' — and not just because of privacy concerns. 'I think the value goes beyond privacy, since these devices also serve as constant distractions that I would expect to be unwelcome in places of worship,' he said. Choffnes continued by saying, however, that it is important to point out that 'a mobile app recording your conversations is not usually your biggest privacy threat.' After all, it’s already well known that tech companies can and do track their users’ browsing history, app use, and exact location — using all of them for marketing purposes. Even religious apps havesometimes been caught exploiting user datain this way, he noted. 'Given how sensitive and personal one’s religion and religious activity are, I think this is an important consideration for clergy and congregants: Think twice about installing apps, try to read the fine print if you can, [and] don’t grant permissions that aren’t needed,' Choffnes said. And, he reiterated: 'Turn off your device when you need privacy and focus.' To ban or not to ban? Bishop James Conley of the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska,formalized a new policy this yearbanning priests from using their smartphones in the confessional. Father Caleb La Rue, chancellor for the Diocese of Lincoln, told CNA that he has anecdotally heard about several other dioceses implementing similar policies specifically over privacy concerns — fears of 'accidentally hitting [record], or worst-case scenario, a priest butt-dials somebody and broadcasts somebody’s confession,' he noted. The primary impetus for the Lincoln policy, however, was actually not privacy concerns but rather a recognition that a priest’s time in the confessional should be quiet, prayerful, and free from distractions, La Rue said. He said Conley had been 'strongly encouraging' priests to leave their smartphones out of the confessional since at least 2014, without going so far as to issue a formal ban until this year. 'You’re not going to have your phone out on the altar when you’re saying Mass — why would you have your phone out while you’re hearing confessions?' he said, adding it was important to counter 'the perception that the priest is scrolling Twitter while hearing confessions.' La Rue acknowledged, however, that many Lincoln priests — himself included — liked to make use of smartphones in the confessional for perfectly innocent reasons, such as for checking the time and looking up prayers or Scripture readings. Penitents, too, often bring their phones into the confessional because they have a list of their sins on it or because they have the Act of Contrition prayer pulled up for reference. At the end of the day, though, La Rue said the policy is really about 'removing anything that might possibly get in the way, or be an obstacle' to 'an authentic encounter with Christ.' 'It’s [about] trying to keep sacraments as holy encounters of God, especially God’s mercy in the confessional,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq39BLdUxuoEE	2024-10-28T16:43:08-07:00	
IRGC Chief Warns Of ‘Consequences’ For Israeli Strikes On Iran	(RFE/RL) -- Tehran is warning that Israel can expect retaliation for its recent attack on Iranian military sites, even as the country’s supreme leader appeared noncommittal on continuing tit-for-tat strikes between the two regional foes. Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said on October 28 that Israel will face 'bitter consequences' for carrying out air strikes on Iranian territory two days earlier. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei, also speaking on October 28, said that Tehran would use all available tools to respond to Israel's attack. Israel has said it successfully carried out 'targeted and precise' retaliatory strikes on Iranian military sites on October 26. The strikes -- which came in response to an Iranian missile barrage against Israel on October 1 that itself was in response to the killing of an IRGC commander -- came amid fears that Israel might launch a major attack that risked seriously escalating the possibility of all-out war between the two regional powers. Experts suggested that the strikes gave both Israel and Iran anoff-ramp to avoid a broader regional war. Iran has said that it received warning from Israel ahead of the strikes, the latest in a series of attacks and strikes between Israel and Iran related to Israel’s ongoing retaliatory war in Gaza and Iran’s role in supporting anti-Israel militant groups in the region. Iranian officials have insisted that Iranian defenses intercepted most of the projectiles that Israel fired on October 26 but have acknowledged that four Iranian military officers were killed in the attacks. Speaking on October 27 to the families of the Iranian military officers who were killed, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the Israeli action as a 'miscalculation' but stopped short of calling for an Iranian response. Instead, Khamenei called on government officials to 'understand the capability' Iran had and advised that while it was wrong to 'exaggerate' the impact of the Israeli strikes, it was also wrong to 'minimize' them. IRGC commander Salami was quoted by Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying that Israel’s military action had 'failed to achieve its ominous goals.' Salami also said the strikes were indicative of 'miscalculation and helplessness' by Israel as it continues to battle the Iran-back groups in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon. The Palestinian group Hamas is a U.S.- and EU-designated terrorist group that sparked Israel’s war in Gaza with a deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel has also launched an air assault and invasion against Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, part of which it controls. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the EU blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Reports suggest that satellite images of the aftermath of the Israeli strikes against Iran on October 26 appeared to damage facilities at military bases that in the past have been linked to Iran’s secretive nuclear program and to its ballistic-missile program. Iran has not acknowledged damage at either its Parchin or Khojir military bases that were reportedly targeted.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq5qTjJgfb5qG	2024-10-28T16:40:11-07:00	
Kim Jong Un’s Close Aide In Russia Overseeing North Korean Troops	By Taejun Kang A senior North Korean army official and close aide to leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Russia to oversee North Korean troops there helping Russia in its war against Ukraine, media reported. The North Korean troops, who according to the latest reports are mobilizing near the front lines in Ukraine, will be overseen by Kim Yong Bok, deputy chief of the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army, Japan’sKyodo Newsreported on Saturday, citing a Ukrainian military source. Kyodosaid it obtained a list of military officers in charge of the North Korean troops recently sent to Russia, and Kim Yong Bok was at the top. Although exactly when Kim Yong Bok arrived in Russia was not known, it was confirmed that he was there last Thursday, according toKyodo. Ukraine said last week that about 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were in Russia undergoing training. Russian President Vladimir Putindeclinedto deny or confirm that North Korea had sent troops to help his army, adding that Russia and North Korea would themselves decide how to implement a pact they struck in June that includes a mutual defense clause to help each other in case of external aggression. The arrival of the North Koreans has raised fears in Ukraine, its Western allies and South Korea about what they see as a dangerous escalation of the Ukrainian war. Kim Yong Bok’s profile has risen over the past year. His position as deputy chief of the army was confirmed when he was reported in state media as a member of Kim Jong Un’s entourage during a visit to a key operational training base in western North Korea in March. Moving to the front Kim Yong Bok accompanied the North Korean leader on a tour of reconstruction efforts in flood-hit areas of North Pyongan province, as reported in state media on Sept. 30, and at artillery live-fire drills by military academy graduates, reported on Oct. 6. News of Kim Yong Bok’s arrival in Russia came amid media reports that North Korean troops were mobilizing near the front lines in Ukraine, and combat with Ukrainian forces could begin this week. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Sunday that Russia was transporting North Korean soldiers to the front lines in trucks with civilian license plates. Russian police on Sunday stopped a Kamaz truck with civilian license plates on the Kursk-Voronezh highway, the intelligence agency said, adding that the vehicle was reportedly loaded with North Korean military personnel, but the driver did not have documented combat orders. Separately,The New York Timesreported on Saturday that the first North Korean troops had made the nearly 6,500 kilometer (4,038 mile) journey to the Kursk region as of Wednesday, with thousands more arriving daily. Citing troop movement data from a senior Ukrainian military officer, the newspaper said that as many as 5,000 North Korean soldiers were expected to have arrived by Monday. South Korea last weekreleaseddetailed satellite images it said showed the first deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. The United States also said on Wednesday it had seen evidence that North Korea had sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. On Friday, North Korean state mediacitedits vice foreign minister in charge of Russian affairs as saying he had heard a 'rumor' spread by foreign media that troops had been sent to Russia. The vice minister declined to confirm if troops were indeed there, saying that his ministry was separate from the Ministry of Defense.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq1xAoQP4mfPS	2024-10-28T16:38:38-07:00	
South Africa: Home Affairs Issues First-Ever Certificates Recogni...	The Department of Home Affairs has issued the first-ever South African marriage certificates officially recognising the 'type of marriage' as 'Muslim'. After changes were made to the department’s internal systems, Home Affairs has granted the first batch of 33 marriage certificates for Muslim marriages for the first time in the South African history. 'Members of the Islamic faith community have made extraordinary contributions to South Africa’s history for more than 350 years,' said Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreiber. 'While it comes hundreds of years later than it should have, it is a personal honour for me to preside as Minister over the granting of marriage certificates recognising Muslim marriages. 'This is a major step towards enhancing the dignity of this faith community and reflects the ongoing commitment of Home Affairs to deliver dignity to all our valued clients. It is also an expression of nation building, and a celebration of South Africa’s unity in diversity,' Schreiber said. He said Home Affairs stands ready to assist all clients who similarly wish to have a Muslim marriage formally recognised. 'Additionally, we have enabled our systems to retroactively recognise Muslim marriages. At a fee of R20, clients can request a reprint of their marriage certificate specifying that they wish to change the wording to reflect that it is a Muslim marriage,' the Minister said. Divorce Amendment Act In May, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Divorce Amendment Bill, which amends the Divorce Act of 1979 to recognise Muslim marriages and safeguard the interests of Muslim women and children of Muslim marriages in the event that marriages are dissolved. The amended legislation addressed shortcomings in the Divorce Act of 1979, which differentiated between people married in terms of the Marriage Act and people married according to Muslim rites, especially women. The amendments enacted by the President provided for a definition of a Muslim marriage in the Divorce Act of 1979; the protection and safeguarding of the interests of dependent and minor children of a Muslim marriage; the redistribution of assets on the dissolution of a Muslim marriage and forfeiture of patrimonial benefits of a Muslim marriage, according toa statement issued by The Presidency at the time. It said the new legislation was a response to an earlier Constitutional Court judgment that recognised the need for and importance of protecting Muslim women and children of Muslim marriages, particularly when a Muslim marriage is dissolved.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcWvC4hgS9zq3GYPT28bm6U	2024-10-28T16:36:14-07:00	
Myanmar Faces Manifold Crises As Military Conscription Drives Mas...	By Soe Nandar Linn Since the 2021 coup,the people of Myanmar have endured a severe economic downturn,human rights violationsand mass displacement under the mismanagement of the military junta. The depreciation of the Myanmar kyat against foreign currencies,the outflow of investments and an unstable business environmenthave all contributed to Myanmar’s economic decline. The organisation Armed Conflict Location and Event Data documented that 288 out of 330 townships across Myanmar have experienced12,739 armed conflictssince the coup, with 57,904 civilians killed — 4537 of them by airstrikes and heavy weapons. More thanthree million peopleare internally displaced as of August 2024and about 18 millionneed humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Development Programme reported that nearly half of the population was livingbelow the national poverty linein 2023, compared to 27 per cent in 2017. Armed opposition has beenintensifying, with the military junta losing control of more than half the country. The military has suffered from a significant number ofdefections, with soldiers leaving to join the resistance or fleeing the country. Amid these crises and facing a shortage of manpower, the junta activated conscription laws in February 2024. ThePeople’s Military Service Lawtargets men aged 18–35 and women aged 18–27, while theReserve Forces Lawconscripts veterans.Another orderconscripts men up to age 65 to form local militia groups known as public security forces. Through these laws, the junta planned to recruit 12 batches of conscripts annually, with a monthly quota of 5000 recruits per batch. Starting from April, the military began training four batches of conscripts. Forced conscription has fuelled fears among many in Myanmar, particularly working age young people, who are more likely to be drafted. The economic crisis in Myanmar, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, has already made it difficult for many families to bear the costs associated with conscription, such as bribes or the loss of income from a family member’s absence. This has led to a massive flow of people fleeing Myanmar, especially to neighbouring Thailand. After the conscription law was enforced, many young people queued at the Royal Thai Embassy in Yangon toapply for visas, while thousands have already crossed the border into Thailand, many of them undocumented. This has exacerbated brain drain, a crisis that started with the coup. The massive outflow of working-age individuals has severely affected all sectors, especially agriculture, leading to food insecurity and rising food costs. The new law has not only compelled young people to flee the country but has also driven many domestic businesses to sell their assets and relocate to Thailand.In the previous year, Myanmar citizens invested3.7 billion baht(US$ 111 million) in Thai condominiums, becoming the second-largest buyers after the Chinese. Thailand’sDepartment of Employmentreports that nearly2.3 million Myanmar migrantshad registered by July 2024 but there are still an estimated two million undocumented Myanmar nationals living in Thailand. In addition to the effects of conscription, the junta’s strict regulations on passport renewal are forcing many living abroad — particularly in Thailand — to become undocumented.Passport renewalis denied to those in Thailand on non-ED visas, a type of visa issued to students attending language schools or non-accredited educational institutions in Thailand. Other regulations include an additional 10 per cent tax on income earned abroad and amandatory transferof a quarter of earnings to Myanmar bank accounts through official banking channels. Since the coup, there have been over 4500 battles in all of Myanmar’s states bordering Thailand, wheremore than 90,000 refugeeshave been hosted in nine temporary shelters. In the past three months, 144,000 undocumented migrants from Myanmarhave been deportedby the Thai authorities. Since Thailand is a non-signatory to the 1952 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, it hasno legal obligationto provide protection for refugees. While there is a risk of forced enlistments in the junta’s armed forces, some deportees mayjoin the resistance forcesagainst the military. These multiple crises in Myanmar have also increased the risk of cross-border crime, including illicit drug trafficking, human trafficking and recently emergingscam factorieswithin the Golden Triangle region. Undoubtedly, Myanmar’s conscription law has significantly affected both Myanmar and itsneighbouring countries, particularly Thailand, in terms of humanitarian and security challenges. At present, armed resistance is the only viable path to oppose the military junta. As people are oppressed and forcefully conscripted by the junta, domestic unrest will increase and people will continue to flee.

ZIG’s Devaluation Reflects Zimbabwe’s State Of Perpetual Crisis –...	A vicious cycle of currency failure, policy inconsistency and short-term fixes has battered investor and citizen confidence. By Ringisai Chikohomero Less than five months after it was introduced, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) announced a devaluation of the ZIG (Zimbabwe Gold). The official devaluation on 27 September came a few weeks after the government startedpushingfor de-dollarisation. The reserve banksaidthe devaluation was in response to a‘resurgence in exchange rate pressures,’ which manifested in ‘the widening parallel market exchange rate premium and the increase in inflationary pressures.’ While the ZIG has been devalued to about US$1:25, it is still playing catch-up with the parallel market, which is hovering around US$1:32. The latter is closer to renowned global inflation monitor Professor Steve Hanke’sestimateof 67% devaluation of the ZIG since its introduction. The move puts ordinary citizens and businesses in a bind, and not for the first time. To the average civil servant who was paid the previous week, the announcement meant the ZIG component of their salaries lost 42.5% of its value – a major reduction in purchasing power. The constant erosion of wages has led to widespread dissatisfaction among public sector workers and further distrust in the economic and monetary policies that impoverish them. It’s now clear that ZIG wasn’t backed by gold, and Zimbabwe has insufficient reserves to back the currency Zimbabweans are accustomed to the vagaries of currency fluctuations. Over the past two decades, the value of citizens’ savings, pensions and insurance have been effectively wiped out, and their earnings whittled away. Respective Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) administrations appear oblivious to this impact on ordinary people, and government assurances that the currency will stabilise lack credibility. Business and private sector players have not been spared. Companies such as large retail shops and manufacturing firms are also burdened by currency instability and short-term reactive policy measures. Government controls and reserve shortages severely restrict access to foreign currency on the formal market. The formal allocation process, the auction system and the interbank forex market areflawedand reflect a pegged exchange rate that doesn’t allow price discovery. The reserve bank auction system has a nearly US$100 millionbacklog. At the same time, the interbank system fails to provide sufficient forex on demand. This makes it difficult for businesses that must apply for forex weekly on auction to plan, price goods, or invest in long-term growth. The informal sector – which operates almost exclusively in US dollars and is estimated to be 64% of Zimbabwe’s economy – has been a weathervane of the local currency’s credibility. It has the advantage of operating on a cash basis, escaping regulatory sanctioning and the formal banking system. Source: World Bank The black-market exchange rate often trades at double or even triple the official value for price discovery on an open market. This parallel market has become the government’s go-to scapegoat to explain the ZIG’s lack of traction, even though the parallel market is largely a reaction to currency manipulations and distortions by the monetary authorities. The distortions further point to persistent foreign currency shortages in the formal market. The reserve bank has been accused of manipulating forex by controlling access to foreign currency at the official rate, leaving businesses and citizens with no choice but to turn to the parallel market. The ZIG’s introduction was greeted with a mix of cautious optimism and scepticism from citizens expecting a similar outcome to the previous fiveattemptsat introducing a domestic currency. A local currency would be preferable, but many analysts question the government’s knee-jerk reactions and lack of transparency and consultations. Thehistoryof Zimbabwe’s failed currency and troubled economy is well documented, yet the government continues to make counterproductive decisions. Since the Zimbabwe dollar’s collapse in 2008, attempts by the monetary authorities and Ministry of Finance to stabilise the currency and support the ZIG have been largelyineffective. Several factors are to blame, including the ad hoc reactionary approach, fiscal imprudence, inconsistency in policy application and misalignment of policies with market realities. The currency crisis reflects governance overall – characterised by short-term fixes, propaganda and threats While the government said the new currency would be backed by gold reserves, the official devaluation and food inflation since August tell a different story. It’s now clear that the ZIG was not backed by gold and that Zimbabwe has insufficientreservesto back the currency. Such amismatch between government’s position and reality does little to engender trust. Currency instability is likely to make resolving the country’s external debt difficult. The African Development Bank-facilitated High-Level Debt Resolution Forum for dealing with Zimbabwe’s external debt crisis has three pillars. Comprehensive economic reforms by the government are one of them. Managing currency stability is a corepart of these reforms, but the government lacks commitment to fiscal discipline, transparent monetary policy and actions to militate against runaway inflation. Higher spending on infrastructure increases the amount of local currency in circulation, which defeats efforts at currency stabilisation. Zimbabwe’s unsustainabledebtstands at 96.7% of gross domestic product. The currency crisis reflects a deeper governance and ideological crisis. The ZANU-PF government has opted for politically expedient decisions at the expense of ensuring macroeconomic stability, which requires actively building confidence. This resonates with its overall approach to governance – characterised by short-term fixes, propaganda and threats. Zimbabwe’s biggest challenge is that the government is not invested in building a trusting relationship with citizens. Over the past two decades, citizens’ experiences have created a crisis of confidence in government that is impossible to resolve without significant political and economic reform. Source: Afrobarometer Rather than papering over the cracks, Zimbabwe needs a coherent, credible economic strategy. The painstaking task of restructuring the political economy, building public and business confidence, and long-term strategic thinking will be the Mnangagwa administration’s main challenge in the next four years. Without a consistent economic strategy, Zimbabwe will remain trapped in perpetual crisis, with ordinary citizens bearing the brunt of the government’s failures as the ZIG faces the same fate as previous local currency experiments.

North Korea And Russia’s ‘Far-Reaching’ Strategic Relationship – ...	By Abhishek Sharma Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's remarks on the presence of North Korean troops in its temporarily occupied territories have caught international attention, raising concerns about the state of deepening ties between Russia and North Korea. Following the announcement, the South Korean President called for an urgent national security meeting, after which South Korean intelligence agencies confirmedthat they believed that North Korea had sent their troops. However, both, Russia and North Korea have refuted these claims. Nonetheless, if proven to be true, this would be considered a drastic step up in their bilateral ties since the signing of theTreaty of Comprehensive Strategic Partnershipin June this year. Following the Treaty, there was already a visible increase in high-level bilateral visits between Russia and North Korea, from ministerial to senior officials. Nevertheless, the pace at which their strategic ties had developed signalled North Korea and Russia were not shying away from openly supporting each other. The troop deployment will only validate the deepening of their ties, highlighting the importance of North Korea in Moscow’s strategic calculus and vice-versa. Strengthening military cooperation All this started with Russian President Vladimir Putin'smeetingwith Kim Jong Un this year to reinvigorate their bilateral ties. Following the meeting, the relations have progressed at an unprecedented pace. Thus, the North Korean troop deployment will only prove that both parties are not hesitating to display their support on thebattlefieldand indiplomatic avenues, as already seen. However, thismilitary bonhomiebetween the two countries started last year with thevisitof Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu,who attendedthe Weaponry Exhibition 2023 alongside Kim Jong Un, signifying the importance of arms exports in this relationship. Post his visit, the defence cooperation has increased drastically, benefiting both the Russian andNorth Korean military economies. Nonetheless, the initial dealings started in thefirst year of the Russian invasion, when North Korea supported Russia by exporting arms and ammunition. Since then, the exports of military equipment have continued unabated. Some of the major arms exports between Russia and North Korea,claimedby South Korea’s Joint Chief of Staff, include 2,000 containers of military equipment, including 200,000 rounds and 1 million 122 mm artillery shells and 152 mm shells, respectively. Other arms exports, part of the tranche,includeshort-range ballistic missiles, machine guns, rocket launchers, and anti-tank guided missiles. Some open-source evidence of weapons transfer includes the Russian military jet routinevisitsto Pyongyang, the latest one on 18 October, when a Russian Air Force Ilyushin Il 62-M landed at the Sunan Airport in North Korea. A similar plane alsolandedat the same airport earlier last month on 20 September, then flew to Khabarovsk and returned to Pyongyang on 22 September. In addition, it issuspectedthat Russian naval vessels are also transferring arms from the North Korean port of Rason, infamous forexporting13,000 shipping containers carrying arms since 2022. As per South Korean Intelligence, North Korea has decided to send its troops to an active war,deployingfour brigades of 12,000 soldiers, including their special forces, signalling its allegiance to Russia. However, this is not the first time that North Korea has sent its troops to another country. During the height of the Cold War, it sent its troops to participate in wars inNorth Vietnamand Egypt. In addition, the country has also been accused of helping and training theTanzaniaandMozambique militaryand even providing missile systems. Besides, North Korea has always shown its support to both state and non-state actors in what it saw as a fight against Western imperialism. For instance, in the run-up to 1973, as war was becoming imminent between Egypt and Israel, and the formers severed ties with the erstwhile Soviet Union, North Koreastepped in, sending 20 experienced pilots and 1,500 personnel to support the Egyptian Air Force in handling their Soviet Air Force assets such as the surface-to-air missiles. Intensifying Russian support to North Korea In exchange for material support, Russia has also intensified its comprehensive cooperation with North Korea in diplomatic avenues like the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), even supporting the North Korean nuclearisation agenda. During a recent episode of an allegedincursionby a South Korean drone dispersing propaganda leaflets, Russia, unlike North Korea’s other northern neighbour, China, came out in support and condemned South Korea. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson,saidthat ‘Such acts are a blatant encroachment on (North Korea's) sovereignty and internal affairs to destroy its legal state and political framework and deny it the right to its development.’ This unequivocal support was quite unprecedented. Another landmark decision was the Russian veto of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, responsible for monitoring its multilateral sanctions. After its discontinuation, Russia flouted UN sanctions openly. For instance, Russian President PutingiftedKim Jong Un a Russian-made Aurus Limousine, openly violating the sanctions. Similarly, RUSI, a UK-based think tank report investigation,highlightedthe increasing oil trade by North Korean vessels from Russia’s Vostochny port, violating the UN-mandated 500,000 barrels of oil in favour of arms for oil arrangement between the two countries. However, the most serious U-turn was Russian support for the nuclearisation of North Korea; this stands in stark contrast to Russia’s traditional position. In a briefing, Sergey Lavrovsaidthat for Russia, ‘the very term of 'denuclearisation' as applied to North Korea has lost all meaning. For us, this is a closed issue.’ This is opposite to Russiancondemnationof Pyongyang's nuclear test and itssupport for sanctions. In 2017, a Russian spokesperson in UNSCsaidthat ‘his country did not accept the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s claim to be a nuclear-weapon State.’ This change highlights Moscow’s prioritising its geopolitical interests, supporting Kim’s nuclear agenda over proliferation concerns, unlikeChina, which continues to support denuclearisation. Far-reaching strategic alignment These developments, including troop deployment and arms exports, are tactical. However, there is a strategic logic to closer military cooperation between the two. To understand that, it is critical to look closely at the regional geopolitical dynamics in Northeast Asia between the US and its allies, South Korea and Japan. Two notable developments concern Russia and North Korea—South Korea-Japan-US trilateral security cooperation and NATO deepening ties with South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, the Japanese Prime Minister’s latest Asian NATO idea and the US Ambassador's remarks on Asian economic NATO have only strengthened the concerns in Moscow and Pyongyang about the West's and its allies' intention to corner them. Recently, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, in a press conference confirmed this thesis, stating, ‘It is obvious today that the United States and its allies decided to draw the Asia-Pacific Region into NATO’s sphere of interests by creating all these narrow and exclusive US-led military and political associations. This includes the troika formed by the United States, Japan and South Korea.’ While the question regarding why North Korea will likely send its troops is important, what is more critical to understand is what it is getting in return for its strong support for Russia. Whilst the answer to the question remains unclear due to the opacity of information, based on some reports and the recent Russian support for North Korea, it looks like Pyongyang has reached an understanding with Moscow. This understanding will likely entail providing military and diplomatic support both in materiel and kind, particularly as North Korea looks to modernise and upgrade its arsenal. Some reports suggest Russia has already supported North’s space programme, and other modern systems, such as fighter jets and air defence, will likely be the low-hanging fruits. Beijing’s unresponsive attitude and neutrality have acted as a tacit support to this relationship. Thus, going forward, if military cooperation persists between Russia and North Korea, we will likely see the latter coming out of its strategic aloofness and becoming a spoiler for the US and its allies in the region. This will likely have strategic implications for Northeast Asian regional stability and the larger Indo-Pacific region.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba And The Future Of Japanese Politics...	By Dr. Sandip Kumar Mishra In Japan’s post-Shinzo Abe era, the old days of frequent changes in top leaders appears to have arrived again. This will have implications for the country’s domestic as well as its foreign policy. Japan needs continuity and credibility in its top leadership particularly with global power transitions intensifying and becoming more complex. Unfortunately, this looks to be elusive after Shinzo Abe. Shigeru Ishiba is Japan’s third prime minister in the past four years. While the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its institutions still retain power and there is consistency in broader foreign policy, frequent changes in leadership complicate vision articulation, messaging to both friends and foes, and follow-up action on policies. Newly elected Prime Minister Ishiba is considered to be a 'maverick' in Japanese politics. He is a five-time candidate for the top post within the LDP, has held several important positions including defence minister, and himself claims to be a security expert. He also says that he reads three books a day, runs a YouTube channel, and has written a piece on his policy priorities published by the US-based Hudson Institute. His current success, however, can be largely attributed to the LDP’s old guard, who believe that for now, he will give the LDP a better chance in the upcoming October 2024 general elections. Speculations suggest that post-election, Ishiba may either be sidelined by the old guard as he doesn’t come from the LDP’s large factions, or that he may himself have to relinquish his position because of mistakes. Ishiba hurriedly announced his policy priorities after entering office. These include measures to address Japan’s demographic crisis because of the low birth rate and an aging population, and his support for the establishment of a NATO-like structure in Asia, in which the US-Japan alliance would be the lynchpin. In his own words, 'today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s East Asia,' and the security situation in Asia is 'the most severe since the end of World War II.' Ishiba was Japan’s defence minister from 2007-2009 but his tenure was not special. Recent sharp statements on security are more likely an attempt to carve out political space for himself and prevent the party’s old guard from sidelining him. Though called 'anti-Abe' within the party—because he contested against Shinzo Abe several times—he now appears to be following Abe’s style of leadership, with big domestic and foreign policy announcements. It will be interesting to see if Ishiba is also able to emulate Abe’s success in getting his point across credibly. Shinzo Abe cemented his leadership credentials through his ‘‘Abenomics’’ on the domestic front and Indo-Pacific strategy on the regional front. Ishiba appears to be trying the same approach to create a niche for himself, by making bold statements about Japan’s demographic crisis and an ‘Asian NATO’. This approach, however, isn’t easy. With a national debt that is 265 percent of GDP, and it won’t be easy for Ishiba to focus on or deal with the demographic crisis. Similarly, an Asian NATO also doesn’t sound feasible as important regional actors, who are also members of ASEAN and the Quad, don’t seem keen on the idea at this moment. So even as Ishiba adopts Abe’s approach, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to have the same effect. Shigeru Ishiba as Japan’s prime minister essentially means that the LDP is projecting a popular face for the upcoming elections. This is necessary because of the allegations of corruption within the party, and in all probability, he won’t continue for too long in this position after the LDP is able to secure victory in the elections. Ishiba, however, appears to be resolute in using this opportunity to strengthen his position and make himself politically viable in the long run. The question is whether Ishiba will be able to survive as prime minister, or the old days of short-term prime ministers in Japan are indeed back.

The Political Economy Of Vietnam’s North-South High-Speed Rail Pr...	By Nguyen Khac Giang Vietnam has had to struggle to develop an efficient railway system due to financial and technical constraints. In 2010, then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung proposed an ambitious plan to build a 1,500km high-speed rail (HSR) which would connect the two economic centres, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), bringing travelling time down to less than six hours. The project would cost US$60 billion, equivalent to two-thirds of Vietnam’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2009.[1] It was approved by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)’s Politburo and Central Committee, the highest decision-making institutions in the one-party state.[2] However, after heated public debates, the National Assembly voted against the project; 37 per cent voted in favour and 41 per cent against, primarily based to concerns about its economic feasibility.[3] Fourteen years later, the Vietnamese government revived the project, now with an estimated cost of US$70 billion. This time, the project appears more feasible – given the Vietnamese economy’s growing scale, the proven successes of several HSRs in Southeast Asia, and increased support from the public and from policymakers. However, concerns remain about its profitability, feasibility, and socio-economic impacts. Furthermore, the current deliberations are influenced by geopolitics, as Vietnam weighs potential partnerships. This essay adopts a political economy perspective to examine Vietnam’s HSR ambition. It starts by providing a brief overview of the HSR plan and its implications for the country’s overall socio-economic development. After that, it explores the political and economic motivations driving the government’s renewed push for the project and analyses the geopolitical considerations, focusing on the challenges faced by Hanoi in selecting a foreign partner. Finally, the essay discusses domestic concerns, particularly public support for the project, and concludes with reflections on the future of Vietnam’s HSR development. BACKGROUND Vietnam’s long, narrow geography underscores the critical need for an efficient railway system. However, financial and technical limitations have long impeded the development of such infrastructure. The national railway network, spanning 3,315 kilometres,[4] was largely constructed during the French colonial period between 1881 and 1936, with no significant expansion since.[5] The outdated one-meter gauge, which still comprises over 80% of the network, is a relic that remains in use in only a few other countries. Current train speeds are modest, with maximum speeds of 100km/h for passenger trains, and about 50-60km/h for freight trains. These are significantly lower than in regional neighbours where newer, faster lines have been developed. For example, the maximum train speed in Thailand is 120km/h (soon to be 250km/h when the Bangkok–Nong Khai high-speed rail line opens, perhaps as early as 2026) and in Laos is 160km/h with the recent completion of the China-funded Boten–Vientiane railway. This gap, coupled with China’s expanding railway network in Southeast Asia, risks isolating Vietnam from the emerging pan-Asian transport infrastructure.[6] As such, the North-South HSR project has become a crucial necessity to meet the country’s increasing demand for both travel and logistics. This is why domestic opposition to the project has waned. The renewed momentum behind the North-South HSR project is driven by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. In the post-COVID economic recovery, Chinh has emerged as a key promoter of mega-infrastructure projects, including the Long Thanh Airport and the 500kV Quang Trach-Pho Noi transmission line, despite an overall sluggish public investment environment.[7] He has also actively sought international cooperation from potential partners and lobbied domestic stakeholders to accelerate the project. His efforts have successfully garnered support from both the Politburo and the National Assembly for the necessary policy framework. On 28 February 2023, the Politburo issued Conclusion No. 49-KL/TW on the orientation for the development of Vietnam’s railway transportation system by 2030, with a vision towards 2045. Subsequently, on 9 November 2023, the National Assembly passed Resolution No. 103/2023/QH15 regarding the 2024 socio-economic development plan, calling for the effective implementation of the Politburo’s Conclusion No. 49. This includes accelerating the construction of several key national railway lines, particularly the East-West railway, and completing studies for the North-South HSR project, with the goal of approving the project’s investment plan in 2024.[8] At its 10th Plenum in mid-September 2024, the CPV Central Committee did indeed vote to approve the implementation of the HSR project with the 350km/h variant. This decision effectively cleared the most significant political hurdle for the project. The National Assembly is anticipated to formally endorse the project’s investment plan during its 8th session, scheduled for late October 2024.[9] ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS The construction of an HSR line in Vietnam is now more economically justifiable than when it was first proposed. The HSR would significantly reduce the travel time among key locations along the Hanoi–HCMC route, boosting domestic economic activities and partly solving Vietnam’s logistics constraints amidst increasing foreign investment. Future connections could enhance regional connectivity with neighbouring countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and China, thereby boosting trade and consolidating Vietnam’s position as a regional logistics hub. Additionally, the project is expected to stimulate real-estate development around the designated stations, reduce traffic congestion, and thus lower maintenance costs for existing infrastructure.[10] Environmentally, the HSR aligns with Vietnam’s sustainable development goals by providing a greener, energy-efficient transportation alternative that could reduce carbon emissions and lessen reliance on road and air travel. Vietnam’s economic growth over the past decade has significantly improved the financial feasibility of the North-South HSR. A proposed US$70 billion project, which would have represented two-thirds of the country’s GDP in 2010, now accounts for only approximately 16 per cent of GDP, making it more manageable, especially given that the costs will be distributed over a ten-year period during construction.[11]According to the initial proposal by the Ministry of Transport, the state budget would need to cover about 22 per cent of the total cost, or approximately US$16 billion. This proportion suggests that the project would not, at least on paper, exceed the government’s fiscal capability. The ongoing Long Thanh Airport project, which costs US$19 billion follows a similar financing model, and provides a useful precedent as the government proceeds with the North-South HSR project. However, concerns about economic efficiency persist. Vietnamese experts are sceptical about the project’s cost-effectiveness, particularly given that the current proposal includes a passenger line with a speed of 350 km/h and a capacity of 364,000 passengers per day, when projected demand by 2050 is estimated to be only 40 per cent of that capacity.[12] There are also doubts about the cost-effectiveness of an HSR line exceeding 800 kilometres.[13] Moreover, the projected cost per kilometre for the North-South HSR is approximately US$45.6 million, significantly higher than the Beijing–Shanghai HSR, which costs US$26 million per kilometre despite having a similar distance and terrain. For comparison, the average cost per kilometre of Chinese HSRs is around US$21 million for a 350 km/h line and US$17 million for a 250 km/h line.[14] Vietnam’s ability to keep the project on schedule and within budget is another significant concern. The country’s experience with metro projects in Hanoi and HCMC, where cost overruns totalled US$3.4 billion and almost doubled the initial estimates, highlights the risk of financial mismanagement.[15] It is not uncommon for projects of this magnitude to experience cost overruns. For example, the Jakarta-Bandung HSR, initially estimated at US$35 million per kilometre, ended up costing US$52 million per kilometre when it was finally completed in 2023, four years behind schedule.[16] Furthermore, the current focus on a passenger train with a 350 km/h speed does little to address Vietnam’s existing logistics problems, which are crucial for the country’s booming manufacturing industry.[17] Beyond the initial investment, there is a high likelihood that the government will need to subsidise the operational costs of the HSR, as is the case with other HSR systems around the world.[18] These operational subsidies are often substantial, which is why even high-income countries like Australia and the United Kingdom have abandoned their HSR plans after decades of consideration.[19] The current proposal for Vietnam’s North-South HSR project does not address the potential need for operational cost subsidies, leaving this financial question unanswered. GEOPOLITICS AND RAILWAY DIPLOMACY The sheer scale of the North-South HSR project presents significant opportunities for potential foreign partners, but geopolitical considerations are equally significant. When the project was first proposed, it was widely assumed that Vietnam would adopt Japan’s Shinkansen technology, which dominated the global market at the time. However, over the past decade, China has emerged as the leading power in railway technology, particularly following the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013. After securing HSR projects in Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, China is eager to extend its influence by exporting its HSR technology to Vietnam. Success in Vietnam would represent a significant geopolitical victory for China, particularly given Hanoi’s general reluctance to fully embrace BRI projects. Moreover, it would bolster the development of a China-centred connectivity network across Southeast Asia.[20] Japan remains Vietnam’s most trusted partner in infrastructure development and was the preferred partner in the original North-South HSR proposal. However, China’s rise has complicated this dynamic, and Japan’s status as the partner of choice is no longer guaranteed. After losing the bid for the Jakarta-Bandung HSR to China, Japan is determined to secure the Vietnam project as a showcase of its 'Partnership for Quality Infrastructure' initiative, competing with China’s BRI. In addition, Vietnam plays a crucial role in Japan’s strategy of constructing production networks through a division of labour among mainland Southeast Asian countries. In addition, South Korea has also expressed interest in participating in what is being termed Vietnam’s 'project of the century',[21] having successfully lobbied for the first overseas Korean-made bullet train in Uzbekistan.[22] In recent years, Vietnamese leaders have sought support from various foreign capitals without committing to any partner. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has made three visits to China in the past year, where he met with key Chinese railway corporations and directly asked for their support in Vietnam’s railway projects, including the North-South HSR.[23] During a visit to Japan in late 2023, Chinh also requested Japanese official development assistance (ODA) for the project,[24] and he made a similar appeal to South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol during a visit to South Korea in July 2024, highlighting the potential for a high-speed railway to serve as a symbol of bilateral cooperation.[25] High-speed rail cooperation was also a topic during General Secretary To Lam’s visit to China in August 2024, which culminated in an agreement to plan the Lao Cai–Hanoi–Hai Phong rail line.[26] However, despite prior discussions, the North-South HSR was notably absent from the final bilateral statements. It is clear that, similar to Indonesia and Thailand, Vietnam is leveraging its advantage as the project owner to attract alternative suppliers and strengthen its bargaining position.[27] Compared to other regional countries, however, Vietnam faces more challenges. Its long, narrow geography means that it may only be able to select a single technology, unlike Thailand, which has chosen Chinese technology for the Bangkok–Nong Khai line and Japanese technology for the Bangkok–Chiang Mai line.[28] Furthermore, the North-South HSR would be the most expensive rail project in Southeast Asia and among the most costly in the world.[29] Given the massive investment required, once a decision is made, it will be difficult to reverse, making the choice of partner—and by extension, the technology—crucial for the future of Vietnam’s railway infrastructure for decades to come. This partly explains why Hanoi is exercising extreme caution in making a final decision on the partnership. Additionally, Vietnam’s negotiating position with China is somewhat weakened by the operational status of the Laos–China Railway. With that project already in place, China may have less incentive to prioritise a Vietnamese HSR as the main line connecting China with Southeast Asia, even though initial plans for a regional railway network included Vietnam in the eastern route from Yunnan to Cambodia and Thailand.[30] DOMESTIC HEADWINDS Although domestic opposition to the North-South HSR project has diminished over the last decade, partly due to the rapid advancements in HSR technology and the positive coverage of HSRs in China and Laos, significant domestic concerns remain. One major issue is the political risk associated with choosing China as the main partner for the project. While China offers the most cost-effective option, strong anti-China sentiments in Vietnam make it a controversial decision for any leader. This is evident in the comparison of existing urban rail projects in Hanoi and HCMC. Despite the Cat Linh–Ha Dong line in Hanoi being the first operational metro project in Vietnam with fewer cost overruns than others, it has attracted the most public criticism.[31] Given the vast scale and decade-long construction period of the proposed North-South HSR, similar issues are likely to arise. While public support for the HSR project may be high at present, any incident during its construction could quickly shift sentiment. The stakes are particularly high as Vietnam might be able to select only one partner, unlike Thailand, which could involve both Japan and China in its HSR network.[32] Another concern is the dependency on foreign expertise for the project. Although Vietnam aims to localise the project, it currently lacks enterprises capable of absorbing the necessary technological transfer from international partners. This could lead to a prolonged period of reliance on foreign expertise for operation and maintenance, contradicting Vietnam’s ambition to master high-speed rail technology independently.[33] Moreover, there is a genuine concern among both the leadership and the population regarding foreign influence over critical infrastructure like the North-South HSR. This concern extends beyond the construction and operation of the railway to include land development projects along the route. A study in 2020 estimated that a significant portion (32 to 54 per cent) of the project’s profits would need to come from non-transportation sectors,[34] which would likely involve foreign builders due to the lack of technological capacity and management expertise among local partners.[35] The prospect of Chinese developers occupying prime locations along the North-South HSR would be particularly politically sensitive. A similar issue arose in 2018 when a draft law on Special Economic Zones proposed allowing foreign investors to lease land for up to 99 years, sparking nationwide protests over fears of Chinese control of strategic areas in Vietnam. Finally, the project might require a large population displacement, as it will traverse 20 densely populated provinces along a new route, rather than upgrading the existing line. Land disputes have long been a major social and political issue in Vietnam, and this project is unlikely to be an exception. Additionally, environmental challenges are expected, as the HSR line might pass through several protected biodiversity areas in the central region. CONCLUSION Today, Vietnam is arguably better positioned, both financially and geopolitically, to move forward with the North-South HSR project. However, the feasibility of this ambitious megaproject hinges on a careful cost-benefit analysis, which is fraught with uncertainty.[36] Domestically, the government faces the dual challenge of maintaining public support and managing the logistical, social, and environmental hurdles that come with such a massive undertaking. To minimise risks and potential public backlash, the government must proceed with extreme caution, prioritising transparency and public engagement in assessing the project’s viability. While the final decision will likely be influenced more by political considerations than purely economic ones,[37] ensuring public support through engagement is crucial for the project’s long-term success. Furthermore, Vietnam must maintain its agency in selecting international partners, leveraging its bargaining position while avoiding being entangled in great power competition. The choice of foreign partners, particularly between Japan and China, will not only determine the project’s success but also shape Vietnam’s choice for critical infrastructure for decades to come. To mitigate operational risks, the North-South HSR should be viewed as an integral part of a broader pan-Asian network. By connecting to Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, as envisioned in the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC), Vietnam can strengthen regional ties and solidify its position as a key player in Southeast Asia’s infrastructure development.[38] Ultimately, the success of the North-South HSR will depend on Vietnam’s ability to secure the necessary financial and technical resources while navigating the geopolitical and domestic political landscapes. The project could either become a cornerstone of Vietnam’s modern infrastructure or a cautionary tale of overreach and mismanagement. The decisions made in the coming years will be crucial in determining which path the country lands on. For endnotes, please refer to the original pdf document.

Strengthening Sovereignty: Indonesia, Malaysia, And The Philippin...	The South China Sea, a critical maritime corridor abundant in natural resources vital for global trade, has long been a locus of overlapping territorial claims. In recent years, China's assertive expansion of its 'Nine-Dash Line'/'Ten-Dash Line' has markedly escalated disputes, presenting strategic dilemmas for neighbouring Southeast Asian nations. For Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, incursions by Chinese maritime forces threaten not only economic interests and national sovereignty but also regional stability. This essay posits that a united stance, founded on regional cooperation and strategic alignment, is essential to counter China's expanding influence. By establishing a trilateral coalition within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), these countries can bolster their collective security, reinforce their territorial claims, and promote regional stability, thereby ensuring adherence to international law in the South China Sea. The Problem of Disunity: China’s Expanding Claims and ASEAN’s Challenges China's assertive territorial claims articulated through the 'Nine-Dash Line,' encroach upon exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and waters historically associated with Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Each of these nations has experienced regular incursions by Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels, disrupting economic activities and exacerbating tensions. Notably, Chinese vessels have increasingly violated Indonesia's Natuna waters, Malaysia's EEZ, and the Philippines' maritime boundaries surrounding the Spratly Islands. These unilateral incursions jeopardise national sovereignty and pose risks of militarisation, potentially creating flashpoints that could precipitate broader conflicts. Despite facing shared threats, responses from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have remained disjointed. Diverging levels of dependency on China, in conjunction with contrasting foreign policy orientations, have contributed to this fragmented approach. For example, Indonesia has sought to balance its non-alignment policy with economic engagements with China, whereas Malaysia and the Philippines have oscillated between diplomatic caution and overt condemnation of Chinese activities. This lack of cohesion has diminished the collective leverage required for effective deterrence, enabling China to exploit divisions within ASEAN. Although ASEAN possesses mechanisms for addressing regional security concerns, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, its consensus-based decision-making process restricts its efficacy as individual member states often prioritise national interests over those of the region. Implications for Sovereignty, Security, and Regional Stability China’s territorial claims and persistent incursions significantly undermine the sovereignty of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, thereby posing considerable economic and security risks. The South China Sea is home to substantial stocks of fish, as well as oil and gas reserves, which are crucial to the economies of these nations. For example, fisheries are essential for supporting local livelihoods, while the potential for oil and gas exploration could enhance energy security. However, China’s unauthorised activities threaten these vital resources, thereby impeding economic stability. Security concerns are equally pressing. The presence of Chinese vessels in contested waters is frequently accompanied by an assertive military posture, which intensifies the risks of conflict escalation. Such militarisation not only challenges national sovereignty but also contributes to regional destabilisation as the likelihood of military confrontation rises. Moreover, the unresolved disputes in the South China Sea have broader geopolitical implications, inviting external intervention from global powers such as the United States, which has committed to conducting freedom of navigation operations. This involvement further complicates regional dynamics and heightens the potential for superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia, thereby placing additional strain on regional peace. Proposed Solutions: Forming a Trilateral Coalition for Unified ASEAN Action A unified response from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines is essential for upholding regional security and maintaining the rule of law in the South China Sea. Establishing a trilateral coalition within ASEAN, provisionally termed the South China Sea Coalition (SCSC), could serve as a strategic framework for these countries to address shared challenges. Such a coalition would facilitate intelligence sharing, coordinated maritime patrols, and joint exercises, thereby communicating a strong message of regional unity and deterring Chinese encroachments. Furthermore, reinforcing these countries' claims through the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a crucial legal foundation. Although the Philippines previously secured a landmark UNCLOS ruling against China in 2016, enforcement has been limited. By collectively endorsing this ruling and submitting joint declarations to UNCLOS, the coalition can amplify international recognition of their rights, thereby strengthening their legal position. This approach underscores that China's historical claims lack a legal basis, contributing an additional layer of deterrence and a means for garnering global support. ASEAN's diplomatic framework remains vital in this context. Leveraging ASEAN’s role as a multilateral platform enables Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines to engage with other ASEAN members and foster broader consensus. By advocating for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, the coalition can assist ASEAN in adopting a more unified stance, thus enhancing the organisation’s credibility as a regional security actor. Within ASEAN, the coalition can address the structural limitations posed by consensus-driven decision-making by pushing for alignment on critical issues, even when achieving consensus proves challenging. Implementation Strategy: Long-Term Cohesion and Defence Capacity A robust implementation strategy will necessitate regular trilateral consultations and collaborative maritime security efforts among Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. High-level diplomatic meetings should be institutionalised, creating a forum for strategic alignment and intelligence sharing. This approach ensures that each country remains responsive to developments and can effectively coordinate its response. Joint patrols and military exercises will serve as visible displays of solidarity and practical mechanisms for deterring further Chinese incursions. A structured agreement on shared patrol responsibilities, coupled with unified surveillance efforts, will enhance maritime monitoring and demonstrate an assertive regional defence posture. The development of a coordinated messaging strategy is also essential. Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines should jointly articulate their commitment to peaceful resolution and rule-based maritime governance, aligning with global norms to reinforce their position internationally. By promoting transparent communication, these countries can mobilise public support within ASEAN, illustrating that regional sovereignty is a collective responsibility. Potential Obstacles and Mitigation Strategies Achieving a unified response necessitates the navigation of substantial obstacles, including economic dependencies on China and the intrinsic structural limitations of ASEAN. China continues to be a principal trade partner for Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines; thus, the potential for economic repercussions may inhibit the adoption of a resolute stance. To address this challenge, diversifying economic partnerships and reinforcing intra-ASEAN relations while promoting intra-ASEAN trade could diminish reliance on Chinese markets. This shift would afford these nations greater autonomy in policy decisions. Furthermore, ASEAN's consensus model presents another challenge. The coalition might advance informal agreements among ASEAN members regarding South China Sea policies without requiring unanimous assent. This semi-formal approach could promote stronger commitments while adhering to ASEAN's fundamental principles, thereby facilitating a balanced and unified response to shared security concerns. Conclusion Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines confront a collective threat in the South China Sea that necessitates coordinated action to uphold sovereignty, stability, and rule-based governance. By forming a South China Sea Coalition, these countries can attain a more assertive regional posture, safeguarding their territorial claims and economic resources. The role of ASEAN is essential, as it provides a multilateral platform that can elevate the coalition’s stance within a broader regional context. Through the adoption of a unified approach, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines can enhance their security, bolster ASEAN’s credibility, and support the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea. Recommendation To progress, the South China Sea Coalition should prioritise the establishment of regular diplomatic and defence meetings, the development of shared maritime patrol frameworks, and the submission of joint legal declarations to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). By aligning its initiatives within ASEAN and adhering to international legal frameworks, this coalition can formulate a cohesive strategy that reinforces ASEAN's collective voice, thereby ensuring that Southeast Asia remains a stable, rule-governed region despite ongoing challenges from external powers.

Agricultural Cooperation Among BRICS Countries: A Panacea For Foo...	Agricultural cooperation among BRICS countries is a crucial tactic to address the pressing issues of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that afflict the Global South. More than 3.2 billion people live in this region, which is facing a complex crisis where access to healthy food and sustainable farming practices sustain cycles of deprivation. Despite international efforts, 828 million people—many of whom resided in BRICS nations—went hungry in 2022. These issues are exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, and climate change, which disrupt food supply chains and reduce agricultural productivity. In this sense, the BRICS framework presents a unique opportunity for collaboration, enabling member countries to leverage their collective agricultural resources, technology, and knowledge. In order to address persistent issues like food security, malnutrition, and health problems, BRICS has made agricultural cooperation a top priority. As a crucial concept, Anne Garland Mahler of the University of Virginia has distinguished three primary definitions of the Global South. First of all, it has been used in IGOs to describe economically underdeveloped nation-states and as a post-Cold War alternative to the term 'Third World.' Second, it has been applied post-nationally to regions and people negatively impacted by contemporary capitalist globalization. Deterritorial conceptualization, which refers to the transnational political subject's resistant imaginary resulting from a shared experience of oppression under contemporary global capitalism, gives it a third meaning. Current State of Hunger, Poverty, and Malnutrition Hunger, malnutrition, and poverty are complex problems, have been facing by the Global South, which includes regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Despite the numerous interventions of national, regional, and international organizations, millions of people continue to suffer, and ongoing conflicts, economic instability, and climate change often exacerbate these issues. The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023 report estimates that 828 million people globally went hungry in 2022, with the Global South accounting for a significant portion of this number. According to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, a large number of nations in this region—particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa—have alarming or serious levels of hunger. The economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted livelihoods and food supply chains, are one of the numerous causes of this hunger crisis. Conflicts in countries like Yemen, South Sudan, and Syria have hindered food production and access. Furthermore, more extreme weather events like droughts and floods threaten agricultural productivity in already vulnerable areas, making climate change a serious threat. Around 700 million people, or 8.5% of the global population, make less than $2.15 per day and are considered to be living in extreme poverty. Progress has stalled because of low growth, COVID-19 setbacks, and increased fragility. In low-income countries, poverty rates are higher than they were prior to the pandemic. 44% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people, still live below the poverty line, which is more suitable for upper middle-income countries ($6.85 per day). Since the 1990s, the number of people living below this level has barely changed due to population growth. In 2024, 67 percent of people living in extreme poverty were in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the region only comprising 16 percent of the world's population. Two-thirds of the world's population lives in extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa; when all fragile and conflict-affected countries are included, the percentage jumps to three-quarters. Roughly 72 percent of the world's extreme poor live in countries eligible for International Development Association (IDA) assistance (Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet Report, WB, 2024). Malnutrition is a complicated problem with a wide range of manifestations in the Global South. Stunting is a symptom of chronic malnutrition that affects 149 million children under five, according to the Global Nutrition Report 2023. Stunting rates are the highest among in the South Asian nations. However, approximately 45 million children suffer from stunted children, a severe form of malnutrition that significantly increases the risk of death. Furthermore, 2 billion people globally experience hidden hunger, or micronutrient deficiencies, which can have major health consequences like impaired cognitive development and increased susceptibility to diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malnutrition is a major cause of child mortality, contributing to roughly 50% of deaths in children under five. Children who are malnourished have higher rates of morbidity and mortality because they are more susceptible to infectious diseases. Adult survivors of malnutrition are more likely to develop chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Indicating a dual burden of malnutrition, obesity prevalence is also increasing in the Global South. Malnutrition has a substantial financial impact; estimates indicate that it can result in losses equal to two to three percent of a nation's GDP because of decreased productivity, medical expenses, and lost potential. Many communities in the Global South are vulnerable to shocks, and they lack the resilience to deal with economic or environmental disruptions. Furthermore, social inequality is significant because marginalized groups, including women and children, are at the highest risk of hunger and malnutrition. Discrimination and limited access to resources make it difficult for them to get enough food and nutrition. International attention must be given immediately to the concerning levels of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that are currently occurring in the Global South. As the consequences of conflict, economic instability, and climate change continue to worsen, sustainable solutions are crucial to guaranteeing food security and enhancing health outcomes for millions of people. Cooperation, particularly within the BRICS framework, can lead to a healthier and more equitable future by significantly boosting agricultural productivity, advancing nutritional education, and enhancing food access. BRICS’s Potential for Food Security The food production and supply potential of the BRICS countries—China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, have been emerging substantially. With the addition of five more countries, the BRICS nations—which are both major developing nations and emerging markets—now produce around 40% of the world's grain. The 2021–2024 Action Plan's primary goals are to: accelerate agricultural development to improve nutrition and food security; improve the use of water resources in agriculture; increase trade in safe and high-quality agro-products; promote sustainable agriculture, with a focus on small and family farmers; and share agricultural best practices and information through BRICS platforms. The BRICS Strategy on Food Security Cooperation has identified key areas for collaboration within the food sector and delineated precise methods for their implementation. On 16–17 April 2024, Russia convened the inaugural meeting of the BRICS Working Group on Agriculture through videoconference. During this session, the member countries were introduced to the key priorities of the BRICS chairmanship in the agricultural domain: securing food security, enhancing mutual trade, and promoting sustainable agricultural production. Vasily Osmakov, the First Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, stated that Russia stands prepared to serve as the guarantor of the technological foundation for food security. He emphasized the importance of enhancing the BRICS partnership and implementing social technologies to address food security. Brazil, a vital supplier of fertilizers, significantly contributes to food security, with nations working in harmony within a unified agricultural production chain. In 2023, Russian farmers are projected to acquire 80% more fertilizers compared to five years prior and 2.5 times the amount used in 2013, reflecting a consistent rise in crop yields. In 2023, agricultural export revenues surpassed US$45 billion for the first time, marking a remarkable achievement. Over the past five years, these exports have nearly doubled. Over the past years, Russia has ramped up its exports of mineral fertilizers to the Global South by 25%, rising from 23.5 million tonnes in 2022 to 29.1 million tonnes in 2023. Approximately 1.2 billion individuals in the Global South rely on food cultivated with Russian fertilizers, representing 22% of all fertility nutrients utilized by local farmers. Hala Helmy El-Said, Egypt's Minister of Planning and Economic Development, highlighted the government's efforts to expand agricultural land and enhance crop yields, aiming to ensure food security for over 100 million citizens in the country. Mikhail Khachaturyan, an Associate Professor at the Department of Strategic and Innovative Development of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, emphasized that key initiatives in BRICS agriculture and food security include programs aimed at sharing farmers' experiences in executing agricultural projects under challenging conditions, as well as investment projects focused on land reclamation, seed production, crop cultivation, livestock breeding, and the establishment of water treatment systems. In June 2024, Moscow served as the venue for the 14th Meeting of BRICS Agriculture Ministers, presided over by the Russian Minister of Agriculture. The meeting addressed the advancement of sustainable agriculture, the creation of the BRICS grain exchange, and various other pertinent matters. The Russian Ministry of Agriculture is prepared to collaborate with BRICS members on exploring the potential for settlements in national currencies, as well as the establishment and advancement of a BRICS grain exchange. Agricultural Cooperation Among BRICS Countries With the theme 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security,' the 14th The BRICS Ministers of Agriculture convened in Moscow on June 28, 2024. The meeting not only emphasized the integration of new member nations into the established interaction mechanisms but also celebrated their accession to BRICS on January 1, 2024. The ministers acknowledged the significant role that BRICS countries, which represent over 45% of the global population and more than 30% of agricultural land, play in safeguarding global food security. To tackle ongoing challenges related to food security and nutrition, they highlighted the importance of creating fair and sustainable food systems, particularly for at-risk populations such as women, children, and smallholder farmers. The Agriculture Ministers of BRICS recognized the impact of natural disasters, climate change, inequality, and international conflicts while addressing the vital challenges surrounding food security. They called for the cessation of trade restrictions and unilateral coercive measures that could exacerbate these issues. They emphasized their commitment to accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in the realms of eradicating hunger and improving nutrition through innovative agricultural practices. Ministers agreed that a fair, transparent, and rules-based trading system, underpinned by the World Trade Organization, was crucial, with enhancing agricultural trade identified as a key priority. To ensure a consistent supply of food and essential inputs, they highlighted the importance of minimizing trade disruptions, particularly in agriculture and fertilizers. The BRICS Agricultural Research Platform has seen the member countries commit to enhancing research initiatives, utilizing technology to boost production, and developing as well as sharing sustainable agricultural practices. To safeguard natural resources, enhance soil health, and mitigate the impacts of climate change, there was a pronounced focus on sustainable agricultural practices. The ministers urged greater collaboration in advancing indigenous agricultural systems, acknowledging the importance of traditional farming methods. They recognized the accomplishments of the Agricultural Cooperation Working Group and emphasized the importance of South-South cooperation in enhancing developing nations' capacity to produce food. In order to strengthen BRICS' approach to food security, the meeting ended with plans to create a new Action Plan for Agricultural Cooperation for 2025–2029. The ministers added their support for Brazil, which will host the next meeting in 2025, and thanked the Russian Federation for hosting the event. Conclusion In conclusion, immediate and cooperative action is required to address the interconnected problems of hunger, poverty, and malnutrition in the Global South. The magnitude of these problems, which impact over 3.2 billion people, calls for sustainable solutions that go beyond conventional methods. Food security and health outcomes in the region can be greatly improved by the special agricultural cooperation platform provided by the BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS nations can promote sustainable practices, increase productivity, and provide fair access to wholesome food by utilizing their combined agricultural capabilities, which make up a significant amount of the world's grain production. Their efforts, like the creation of the BRICS Agricultural Research Platform and the BRICS Strategy on Food Security Cooperation, demonstrate a dedication to tackling food security issues while fostering resilience among marginalized groups, especially women and smallholder farmers. It is impossible to exaggerate how urgently equitable food systems are needed, since malnutrition continues to be a major cause of adult chronic illnesses and child mortality. In order to ensure that hunger and poverty are not only lessened but completely eradicated in the future, the BRICS framework's emphasis on sustainable agricultural methods and South-South collaboration is essential. The potential of the BRICS countries to revolutionize agricultural methods and enhance food security could be a cure-all for the Global South as long as they continue to create cooperative plans and projects. The BRICS nations can set the path for a more equitable and healthy future by continuing their dedication and collaboration, guaranteeing that everyone has access to enough food that is safe and nourishing. The collaboration in agriculture among BRICS nations emerges as a formidable answer to the pressing food security issues faced by the Global South. Through the integration of resources, technology, and expertise, the BRICS nations have the potential to propel sustainable agricultural practices, alleviate hunger, and enhance community well-being—demonstrating that united initiatives within BRICS could serve as a solution to food insecurity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTFpYFHaRgwmg	2024-10-27T16:54:54-07:00	
The Kims Are Coming – OpEd	After a few cat and mouse days of Defense Secretary Lloyd 'Raytheon' Austin’s denials, the Pentagon finally yesterday affirmed that therewasevidence of a North Korean military presence in Russia. Asked what they were doing in Russia, Austin replied,'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out.' For days, South Korea (no conflict of interest there) and Ukraine (nor there) had been claiming that thousands of North Korean soldiers had swooped in to rescue a beaten and bloodied Russian army from certain defeat at the hands of Ukraine (which has lost nearly a million men at arms in the nearly three year war). As the Russian army accelerates its pace,burning through the last fortified towns in eastern Ukraine,the mainstream media continues – with a few reluctant but panicked exceptions – to push the 'Russia is losing' narrative. The added twist of thousands of 'evil communists' from North Korea screaming across the Russian tundra (on horseback, no doubt) promises to add new plot lines to the drama concocted by the mainstream media and most of Washington, and indeed the usual suspects are biting furiously at the bait. Take US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Michael Turner. He is so outraged that there might be members of the North Korean military in Russia that he actually sent a letter to President Biden calling for war. 'If North Korean military forces join Russia’s war against Ukraine,'Fox Newsreportedhim to say, 'the US should consider the possibility of direct military action.' Against whom? We are already involved in a proxy war with Russia through Ukraine. We are already directly involved in Israel’s seven-front war against its neighbors and Iran. Who does Chairman Turner think we should attack if North Korean troops are present in Russia? Russia? North Korea? China? All of them? North Korea and Russia have justsigned a treatywhereby their two militaries will more closely collaborate and even come to each other’s aid if one is threatened. While such an agreement may give Turner and the other neocons the vapors, it is nothing different than the mutual defense treaty the US has with its NATO partners and with many others on a bipartisan basis. Treaties for me but not for thee? Is that the name of the 'rules-based international order' game? The hypocrisy runs even deeper. It is well-known and widely reported that NATO countries aretrainingUkrainian troops not onlyin NATO countriesbutinside Ukraineitself. So it’s absolutely fine for the US and its NATO partners to insert troops inside Ukraine to train its military to kill more Russians and to evenoperate sophisticated weapons systems inside Ukrainethat the Ukrainian military could never operate on its own, but if Russia strikes up a deal with North Korea where the two armies can train together inside Russia, it’s a 'red line' (as Chairman Turner wrote) that demands that we start WWIII. It seems we are not sending our best and brightest to Congress. What we are witnessing is the birth of a new narrative after some 500 Ukraine narratives have already collapsed under the weight of their own contradictions. Remember the two years of 'Russia is losing' narrative? Well just this week NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, saidin an interviewwith the German Spiegel magazine that Russia would emerge from this conflict actually STRONGER than when it entered! But of course they are losing… So what to do? Just as the Hollywood writers do once a sit-com has run too many seasons and is playing itself out, plot-wise, insert a new character. Insert anew twist, to bamboozle the viewers and give them a new reason to keep watching the program. It’s funny but not funny, because the future of the world hangs in the balance. Just like the film 'Idiocracy' has become a documentary in our absurd times, so has 'Wag the Dog.' The military industrial complex with its Hollywood-like allies producing endless narratives to keep the gravy train rolling… P.S. if anyone believes this whole insane and hysterical anti-North Korea narrative is not political…well I have a bridge in Brazoria, TX, to sell you… This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTJp-cVEvAVVq	2024-10-27T16:53:05-07:00	
Iran’s Response To Israel’s Response Could Be A Game Changer – Op...	The tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated to a point unseen in the past four decades, marking a critical juncture for the region. Recent strikes by Israel on military facilities in three Iranian provinces represent an unprecedented direct attack, further intensifying the hostilities between the two regional rivals. This escalation does not bode well for regional stability. If the trend continues, it could spark a wider conflict that would not be limited to Israel and Iran, but could envelop other regional players and even global powers.For several decades, Iran’s primary military strategy has revolved around asymmetrical warfare, leveraging proxy forces to achieve its objectives without directly engaging its enemies. This indirect approach has allowed Tehran to influence conflicts in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, while avoiding a full-scale confrontation with Israel. Iran’s government, particularly its Revolutionary Guards, has relied on Hezbollah in Lebanon, various Shiite militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen to counter Israel and its allies without provoking direct retaliation. This method has proved effective, allowing Iran to expand its influence without the risks of an all-out war. However, recent events suggest that there has been a shift away from this established modus operandi.The dynamic changed dramatically in April when Israel launched airstrikes on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, which Tehran regarded as a blatant provocation. In response, Iran did something it rarely does — it directly attacked Israel with missiles and drones. This marked a significant departure from Iran’s typical strategy of using proxies to fight its battles. The launch of hundreds of missiles and drones into Israel showed that Iran was and is willing to take greater risks.Following Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all of Iran’s domestic and foreign policies, particularly when it comes to matters of national security, wasted no time in ordering retaliatory strikes. However, despite the immediate strike orders, Iran chose not to sustain a prolonged attack. This restraint may have been a calculated decision, allowing Iran to express its discontent without fully committing to a costly conflict.The situation intensified even further after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which was followed by an Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon. In response, Iran launched over 100 missiles into Israeli territory, a dramatic escalation in hostilities. Israel, in turn, vowed to retaliate, raising the stakes to an even higher level. The dangerous unpredictability of these back-and-forth strikes has left both countries on high alert, where any miscalculation could lead to a full-scale war that neither side may be able to control. The escalation reached a new peak with Israel’s attacks on military facilities within three Iranian provinces. This direct strike on Iranian soil signifies Israel’s intent to degrade Iran’s military capabilities and serves as a clear warning to Tehran. This unprecedented move has placed Iran in a position where a robust response may be unavoidable, escalating the risk of regional conflict. The international community, including the US and European powers, is closely watching how Iran will respond, as any retaliatory actions could further destabilize the Middle East.The most critical aspect of this conflict is how Iran will respond to Israel’s latest and most direct strike yet. This moment could be the tipping point that either leads to a de-escalation of tensions or pushes the two nations toward full-scale war. Iran’s response will be closely watched by not only Israel, but also by the broader international community. If Iran chooses to respond strongly, it could trigger a chain reaction that would engulf the Middle East in a larger, more devastating conflict. On the other hand, a more measured response from Tehran could defuse the situation, at least temporarily.There are several potential scenarios that could unfold in the coming days. One possibility is that Iran will downplay Israel’s retaliation, choosing to treat it as insignificant rather than escalating the situation further. This scenario has precedent; when Israel launched airstrikes in April targeting an Iranian air defense facility in Isfahan after Iran’s missile attack, Tehran decided not to escalate the conflict further. Instead, Iranian officials played down the attack, and the situation cooled down. Such a response is seen as favorable for Iran, as it avoids the risk of direct war, which Tehran is likely keen to avoid given the current state of its economy which is under immense pressure due to sanctions and mismanagement.Iran may revert to its strategy of asymmetrical warfare, activating all its proxies across the region, including the Shiite militia groups in Iraq, to retaliate against Israel.Another possible scenario is that Iran will vow to retaliate harshly, but will delay any significant action in an effort to de-escalate tensions. This would allow Iran to save face while avoiding a costly conflict with Israel. By keeping Israel uncertain about when or if the retaliation will come, Iran can maintain psychological pressure on Israeli leaders, who would be forced to remain on high alert. This tactic has been used before, most notably after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. At that time, Iran ordered retaliatory strikes, but did not follow through immediately.Ultimately, Iran’s response to Israel’s latest move will be critical in determining the trajectory of this conflict. The tit-for-tat nature of these retaliations is incredibly dangerous. No matter how carefully planned a country’s military actions might be, the inherent unpredictability of war means that things can quickly spiral out of control. A full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel would not be confined to those two nations. Other countries in the region, such as Syria and Iraq, could be drawn into the fray, as well as global powers such as the US and Russia. This could lead to a conflagration that would engulf the entire Middle East, with devastating consequences for the region and the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTPFjyohAmdc3	2024-10-27T16:51:16-07:00	
Another Black Hundreds Group Revived In Putin’s Russia – The Unio...	Just as took place in the last decades of the Russian Empire, extreme right and often prepared for violent Russian nationalist organizations are springing up in Putin’s Russia, announcing their intention to fight against all the Kremlin’s enemies so as to defend the Russian people. The most prominent of these so far is the Russian Community organization which has branches in 140 Russian cities (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/10/extremist-russian-community-now-active.html), but it and most of its allies have been cautious about highlighting the obvious parallels between themselves and their notorious pre-1917 predecessors. Now, a new group has emerged whose leaders say they are not creating something new but restoring these tsarist-era groups. At a congress in Moscow in the Christ the Savior Cathedral, a group of more than 1,000 officials and activists announced the restoration of the Union of the Russian People (tsargrad.tv/news/sojuz-russkogo-naroda-tysjacha-neravnodushnyh-russkih-ljudej-obedinilis-radi-budushhego-rossii_1072812). Organizers, led by the Orthodox oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev declared that 'we are a union of Russian people who are not indifferent, a union of the Russian people, and that in our movement there are no limits.' They also said that the meting had attracted governors, deputies, business people, scholars, soldiers, priests, students and sportsmen.' Among the speakers were Duma vice speaker Pyotr Tolstoy, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova, Duma deputy Aleksandr Boroday, and former ROC MP priest and now prominent actor Ivan Okhlobystin. Their participation suggests that this new movement enjoys support from the Kremlin. On his telegram channel, Malofeyev outlined the group’s goals: 'Our ideals and values are simple: Russia is a great Orthodox state-civilization. The Russian people is the state-forming state and on its well-being depends the well-being of all the citizens of our country. The foundation of the people is a strong, traditional, multi-child family, the support of which is the most important obligation of the state' (t.leme/kvmalofeev/3053). The Russian nationalist oligarch said that 'the overwhelming majority of Russian people' support these ideas. 'We are the voice of the Russian Orthodox majority. The revived Union of the Russian People. All who are not indifferent to the future of Russia should join the Society Tsargrad and its Russian Militia.' (On that group, which took part, see t.me/s/russian_druzhina.) Not everyone in Russia is thrilled by this development. Moscow commentator Viktor Frolinsky suggests that it 'is designed to inherit all the worst in the Black Hundred movement of pre-revolutionary Russia: Ideological obscurantism, aggression and servility to those in power' in the country (vkrizis.info/russia/soyuz-czarya-i-grada/). Even the Tsargrad title that the revived Union of Russian People has chosen is indicative, he continues. This word 'refers to imperial dreams of Constantinople and the chauvinistic organization' of Aleksandr Dubrovin, an anti-Semite who eaded the predecessor of today’s Union of the Russian People and organized pogroms. Before he was executed by the Soviets, Frolinsky said, Dubrovin identified himself as 'a monarchist communist.' People like Malofeyev and his ilk can say they same thing. Indeed, they are now doing do.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTIgSnOpXlRK5	2024-10-27T16:49:02-07:00	
A Stunning De-Capitation? The Netanyahu ‘Madness’ – OpEd	A major war between Israel and Iran is soon likely to erupt – so says Israel’s Defence Minister Gallant. It will be initiated when Israel launches its long mooted strike on Iran. Gallant haspromisedthat Israel’s strike on Iran will be 'lethal, precise andespecially surprising', adding that Iran 'won’t understand what happened to it, or how'. ‘How’ so – an interesting choice of words. As of this morning, there is no sign of the lethal response promised by Gallant. It would appear that Israel which initially attached importance to responding swiftly and directly, is awaiting the THAAD anti-ballistic missile batteries to be set up – and for the U.S. troops that will operate them to arrive in Israel. THAAD likely is no ‘game-changer’. Iran proved on 1 Octoberits abilityto saturate and overwhelm Israeli Air Defence capabilities through two successive volleys of incoming ballistic missiles. The point here about the THAAD arrival is that, on the one hand, Israel isrunning shortof intercept missiles, and secondly, that drawing the U.S. into a war between the U.S. and Iran – is hugely more important for Netanyahu than keeping to timetable. The THAAD batteries paradoxically might do just that (draw the U.S. into the war). With U.S. forces now deployed on the ground in support of Israel’s military kinetic action against Iran, Israel effectively inserts an American ‘tripwire’ into the war drama: Should American soldiers be killed, then the U.S. is at war with Iran; It would feel bound to react forcefully to the deaths of American soldiers. Netanyahu has been wanting this war for 25 years. He can now see it taking solid shape – directly in front of his eyes. It comes too, from his perspective, at an benign juncture – just before the U.S. elections in which almost every candidate vies to pronounce his or her fealty to Israel. To be clear, this is no ‘small beer’. It may evolve into a major conflict with Russia, should Tehran be threatened. Israel’s genocide in Gaza and its inhuman – beyond all Rules of War – bombing of civilians in Lebanon to force a terrorised submission, has turned Russia into a full partner with Iran. Russia therefore, has worked hard to supplement Iranian defences with their own top-of-the-line defence systems. Russia’s role however likely will be confined to providing Iran with this defence assistance: Russian ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance); its latest electronic warfare system; certain missiles; and possibly S-400 Air Defence missiles (though their arrival in Iran has not been confirmed). Russia will have a prime interest in observing how these weapons perform against an Israeli strike. Should they function well, it will provide a major boost to Russian general deterrence. And here lies the key point: For Israeli Zionists and American neocons, the path to a de-fanged Moscow is viewed as passing through a de-capitated and defeated Tehran. Iran winning – the Resistance winning therefore – is very much a Russian interest. Excited by Israel’s de-capitation of much of the Hizbullah senior leadership, and heartened perhaps by unauthorised (and wrong) signalling from Iran that it might respond perfunctorily to an Israeli strike, Team Biden might well perceive a new Zionist-led Middle East about to be born. Will the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon intervene to stop the march to conflict – as they did over Blinken’s escalation plans in Ukraine? It seems unlikely. They have unreservedly supported Israel up to now. And they have agreed to send the THAAD batteries. The Joint Chiefs certainly will have experienced the strong pro-Israeli sentiment in Congress, in marked contrast to the growing disenchantment with Ukraine. Yet, taking on Iran – supported by Russia and China – is no small thing: Is it truly ‘winnable’? What if it isn’t? What if Israel loses – and therefore America loses? It would be an earthquake; a humiliation that would shake the western world. One commentator, James Kroeger, intriguinglypredictsthat 'Israel’s attack, if it comes, will be yet anotherdecapitation strike: This time executed in even more stunning fashion than the one they pulled off vs Nasrallah'. 'You see, the Pentagon won’t sign on to IDF’s plans to attack Iran’s oil fields or even Iran’s buried nuclear industry; but they have a history of supporting Israel when it targets the Resistance leaders who oppose Israel. Didn’t the IDF just use 82 – 2,000lb U.S. bombs in Beirut to kill Nasrallah? With full U.S. complicity? 'As a basic concept, the U.S. is likely to approve and possibly even enable a ‘decapitation’ strike on Iran’s key leaders in Tehran in the belief that Iran would be too stunned to respond with a ‘total war’ attack on Israel. After all, what did Iran do after Nasrallah was killed? Attack some IDF Air Bases in a way that killed no Israelis? Did it deter Israel from daring to attack Iran once again?' 'What the Pentagon wouldnotbe likely to approve is the use of nukes to decapitate Iran’s government – because it just might be enough to trigger the all-out war that the Pentagon so fears: But what if cunning Israel, after accepting America’s assistance in an operation to deliver a conventional ‘bunker buster’ bomb attack on the Supreme Leader, decides on its own, to also deliver a tactical or strategic nuke on Tehran that completely devastates Iran’s chain of command?' 'Understand, Israel’s intent isnotto avoid an all-out war with Iran, but to ignite one & using a nuke on Tehran would do just that. 100% guaranteed. Bibi understands that after such an attack, if Iran responds by attacking Israel with everything it’s got, he’ll be able to get Congress to pass a Declaration of War vs Iran'. 'MSM and the State Dept [together with Congress] would be marshalled first, to deny that nukes were used, and then to make emotional excuses for why Israel needed to use its nukes 'to defend itself'. The theme they’ll endlessly repeat: Poor Israel, threatened with annihilation by terrorists, resorted to the only weapons it had left to defeat the evil it was facing …'. 'Madness? Yeah. Netanyahu ‘madness’'… Yet, Gallant’s enigmatic 'lethal, precise and especially surprising: Iran won’t understand what happened to it, or how' – odd wording fits neatly with this Kroeger thesis. Big unknown: Will the Pentagon be able to take a stand and refuse to comply? Indeed the Pentagon consistently has opposed all-out war between the U.S. and Iran. Why?All the war ‘games’ played over successive years have resulted in America losing.

Israel’s Iran Reprisal, Middle East Destabilized – OpEd	On Saturday, Israel’s retaliatory attack was framed as 'carefully calibrated.' But in the absence of ceasefire, regional turmoil is simmering close to an edge, thanks to the escalation ladder. Early on Saturday, Israel hit Iran with a set of airstrikes, stating it was targeting military sites in retaliation for the 180 missiles that Iran fired into Israel over 3 weeks ago (which itself was a reprisal against a prior Israeli offensive). Officially, it was a 'carefully orchestrated, underwhelming retaliation' that was preceded by Israel's message to Iran ahead of the impending attack. But not everything is what it seems to be in the Middle East. The stories behind the stories The Israeli retaliation was designed to be underwhelming; not by the Netanyahu cabinet, but by the White House and the Pentagon. Presumably, portions of Iranian military sites in three provinces – Tehran, Ilam and Khuzestan – were hit. Iran said its air defenses successful and damage was estimated as 'limited.' Yet later, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated Israel targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.' It also hit surface-to-air missile sites and 'additional Iranian aerial capabilities.' To stress that the retaliation was more effective, the Israeli Air Force later claimed that these attacks had destroyed 'the backbone of Iran's missile industry', a critical component of its ballistic missile program. The targets struck were sophisticated equipment that Iran could not produce on its own and had to be purchased from China. Subsequent reports claim Israel destroyed air defense systems near oil refineries in retaliatory strike on Iran. If that’s the case, Netanyahu government was trying to minimize the damage it caused in Iran, to appease the White House and defuse a potential Iranian response. By the same token, Netanyahu struggled to deflect international attention away from atrocities in northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. The Netanyahu cabinet was playing with fire. Retaliation scenarios and repercussions Since early October, I had argued that there were basically three basic scenarios for an Israeli retaliation: First, a proportionate Israeli retaliation would signal might without causing widespread economic and human costs. A disproportionate escalation would also target vulnerable infrastructure. Finally, if the aim is to seek regime change, the retaliation would additionally target Iranian nuclear sites and critical military infrastructure, hoping to destabilize Iran for a US-style regime change. In the first case, Iran would likely contain its further response. In the second, Iran would escalate. In the third, all bets would be off in the Middle East and global reverberations would ensue. Israel’s Saturday attack seems to have been positioned within the scenario 1 (unless critical infrastructure was, indeed, destroyed which takes us into scenario 2 and more lethal consequences). This was a surprise to many who expected a massive Israeli reprisal, as President Netanyahu and his defense minister Gallant had pledged and the cabinet’s far-right had urged. Reaction in Israel The net effects in Israel? PM Netanyahu lost political capital. In part, he will suffer heavy criticism by the Messianic far-right. It seeks a war with Iran and would like to drag the U.S. administration into a regional conflict. At the same time, the opposition blames Netanyahu for the failure to better sync Israeli responses with Washington (the argument of center-right Benny Gantz). Another part of the opposition says Israel should have deployed a stronger response against Iran (the argument of the centrist Yair Lapid). The fact that a pure scenario 2-like retaliation did not happen - if that proves to be the case - is likely a direct outcome of hard American pressure. After all, the initial Israeli retaliation plan was leaked, which undermined the expected scenario 2 attack. Most likely, Israel’s initial plans were far more aggressive and offensive. Most probably, those plans were buried after U.S. pressure. If the Biden administration and/or its stakeholders were behind the leak, it would not be surprising. A regionwide war in the Middle East is the last thing the Democratic White House needs just two weeks before the U.S. presidential election – particularly as the fragile lead of Vice-President Kamala Harris is softening. Israel, Iran and US presidential race The way the Israeli response was constrained may contain the ongoing destabilization in the Middle East in the short-term; until the U.S. election day. That, however, is predicated on the assumption that the impending attack by Hezbollah against more than two dozen Jewish settlements in northern Israel will not further escalate the status quo. Nonetheless, during the U.S. presidential transition – between November and mid-January – there is another vacuum when much can still happen. It is not in the interest of Iran to attack. But it is very much in the interest of the Netanyahu cabinet and particularly PM Netanyahu to retaliate harder. To retain his immunity and avoid prosecution for corruption, Netanyahu depends on the far-right support. The bottom line: If Harris wins the US election, Netanyahu will face some constraints. If Trump emerges as the winner, Netanyahu is likely to see it as a carte blanche for a broad-scale Iran attack. Currently, both Israel and the U.S. share the strategic objective of destabilizing Iran and undermining its government. As I show in my bookThe Fall of Israel, these goals were developed in the US already two decades ago. The question is not 'what' and 'why', but 'when' and 'how.' The Middle East crisis is far from over. Tragically, the future of the Middle East is effectively a hostage of the U.S. presidential race. Regional uncertainty There are many possible scenarios, as long as Israel is able and willing to execute offensive actions in multiple fronts, thanks to the incessant flow of U.S. weapons to Israel, American bases in Israel and the region at large, and massive financial inflows of U.S. military aid. In the past, U.S. military aid to Israel amounted to $3.8 billion per year; last year, it soared to $18 billion. It is not transparent aid. The Biden administration has not disclosed its true extent. Financially, it contributes to the soaring U.S. debt, which already exceeds the size of the American economy. In the Gaza Strip and possibly in southern Lebanon, this aid has made U.S. complicit to genocidal atrocities. Thanks to the continued destabilization, the turmoil in the Middle East is simmering close to an edge. Worse, the uncertainty is likely to prevail as long as Israel’s genocidal atrocities, backed by U.S. weapons and funds, continue in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere in Israel’s proximate neighborhood; there is no ceasefire between Israel and Hamas; the Israeli hostages are ignored by the Netanyahu cabinet; the anti-Arab pogroms prevail in the West Bank which is effectively being annexed into Israel; the IDF keeps pushing deeper into southern Lebanon; Iran’s government and critical civilian and military infrastructure remain Netanyahu cabinet’s ultimate targets, with intelligence and logistical support by the United States. The worst is not behind. It has only been deferred, for now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTEjsVgkX2oon	2024-10-27T16:45:24-07:00	
For A ‘New’ Bangladesh: An Astute Strategic Prism? – OpEd	The sweeping protests in July-August 2024 that ousted Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s (Hasina) authoritarian rule, won the country an innovative brand---the 'New' Bangladesh minus the earlier steamroller governance. In the wake of that upheaval, which still rings throughout the country, two hot-button disputes reemerged from its not-so-hidden past: While Hasina’s sudden tumble ripples like a political earthquake in India, will New Delhi be a threat to Bangladesh’s future stability and sovereignty? Should Bangladesh reset its ideological and identity sensitivities as a bulwark against a future despotic menace? Both are existential questions. But Dr. Mohammad Yunus is now busy navigating between the populist cry for a retribution against the perpetrators of the banished tyranny, responsible for wanton killings and repression, and the simmering demands for an early restoration of an elected democracy. The post-Hasina leaders need an astute strategy to deal with the emerging Bangladesh-India encounters and the ideological contents for the country’s national integrity and sovereignty. Neither the strategic imperatives nor the ideological probes will take care of themselves---not in 'new' Bangladesh where Hasina’s earlier autocratic rule is more than a painful remembrance! Her swift collapse has severely jolted India, the persistent benefactor of the hegemonic leadership that rigged three consecutive elections boycotted by the opposition parties. And the maximum number of Bangladeshis are more confident now, which is likely to pop up in their domestic and diplomatic aspirations. Geo-politics, however, does not give Bangladesh easy choices in dealing with its big and powerful neighbor that surrounds the country from three sides. But India’s enormous size and its military as well as economic prowess have not yet offered an unrestrained diplomatic advantage over Bangladesh, still blistering against its ousted autocrat, now sheltered in India. New Delhi’s old political ties to the AL and its remnants scattered across the band evoke deep suspicion in Bangladesh. Not long ago, Guardian, the British newspaper disparaged India’s strategy of putting all its diplomatic eggs in the basket of one leader (Hasina) and one party (Awami League/AL) as a 'myopic' venture. India hopes for Bangladesh’s 'eternal obligation' to yield to New Delhi’s wishes because of its overt and covert help towards the 1971 struggle for independence. Narendra Modi’s brazen anti-Muslim policy is humiliating to the Bangladeshi Muslims although the Hasina government did not raise an eyebrow against India’s Hindutva zealots. It will be a thorn in the future Indo-Bangladesh relations. New Delhi tries to handcuff Dhaka’s domestic and foreign policies on the grounds of the (Bengali) Hindu minority’s alleged insecurity in Bangladesh while the Indian media continues to smear Bangladesh’s current Interim Regime for its apparent capitulation to the Islamic militants and their leaders. Badruddin Umar, a senior socio-political commentator in Dhaka recently pointed out that the Indian intellectual community has been mostly silent about the unprecedented protests that recently dislodged a dictatorship after an enormous loss of lives and destruction of infrastructures. Hasina’s rapid plunge on August 5 dramatized India’s loss in Bangladesh, but India’s popularity faltered with the bulk of Bangladeshis, not long after the 1971 independence. As New Delhi became the enabler of the Hasina-led single party (AL) juggernaut, India’s unpopularity spiraled in Bangladesh throughout the last decade. India will be a threat to Bangladesh’s internal politics and stability if New Delhi tries for a 'regime change' by rehabilitating and regrouping Hasina and her AL. She has settled in a virtual exile in India, but scores of the AL leaders have also fled to India, and the whispering reminiscences of the 1971 Indian military intervention stoke up anxiety in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshis itch for Hasina’s extradition to face a domestic or international trial for the hundreds of students and ordinary citizens deliberately killed or wounded by the politicized police, security forces and the AL-hired goons during the tumultuous civil unrest in July-August 2024. China, New Delhi’s archrival may now extract more geo-political advantages from the post-Hasina regime; it will not be welcome to India and the western rivals vying for influence in the region. The storm of protests that evicted the Hasina government changed the country’s political calculus. The secular Bangalee nationalism that gained an unprecedented ascendancy against the earlier Pakistani Muslim nationalism exhausted its political traction since 1971. Secularism and Bengali nationalism provided an ideological cover for Hasina’s long tyrannical rule. She also postured her regime as a thundering protection against Islamic orthodoxy in Bangladesh. Those appeals, exclusionary in their substances, merit a reset although it is not yet certain if Dr. M. Yunus’ cabinet is ready to step into emotionally charged identity debates. The western style secularism has failed to take roots in most Muslim countries including Bangladesh mainly because the social, political, and religious interactions in the Muslim-majority countries are not identical with those of the European and North American nation-states. The stringent secular rhetoric that indeed equated conventional Islamic expressions with hardline fundamentalism hastened the country’s political polarization. The Muslim political inheritances of Colonial Bengal, the 1947 Partition and former East Pakistan connect with what is independent Bangladesh today. Not surprisingly, the Bangladesh government exiled in India in 1971 did not have enough time to deliberate on the details of the expected country’s ideological and identity configuration. Even though their political and historical contexts did not match, Bengali nationalism sauteed in Rabindranath Tagore’s patriotic song as the national anthem became a convenient choice blessed by India at those critical hours. Later in Bangladesh, the 'pro-liberation forces' and their 'cult of patriotic fervor,' a vocabulary borrowed from (late) Ashok Mitra, a West Bengali leftist intellectual, denied the Muslim inspiration’s space in the country’s chronicle. But those ideological postures effectively helped the AL to consolidate its authority multiple times---by Hasina in recent years, but also by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Sheikh Mujib) at the dawn of Bangladesh. Muslim distinctiveness, not a religious extremism, is a security asset for Bangladesh’s sovereignty, independence, and integrity. Once A.K. Fazlul Haque, in the 1940s, called upon the people not to apologize for being Muslims. The liberal perception of the Islamic groups as the 'enemy' of Bangladesh sovereignty is a dangerous appellation that undermines national harmony. The Islamic parties stand for the curse of the liberal intellectuals and politicians---the stance goes beyond the right-wing parties’ controversial resistance to the 1971 breakup of Pakistan. In my Asian Survey, November 1994, article, 'The Liberals and the Religious Right in Bangladesh,' I observed that the right-left controversy eventually destabilized peace and democracy in Bangladesh while, globally, that time-worn dichotomy gradually yielded to a more pragmatic and multilateral view of life. The feisty Muslim consciousness, however, survived through their populist roots. Partly, the liberal-secular clash emanates from the liberal establishment’s 'blind spot' about religion. Anyone who appeals to Islamic values endures the relegation as a Maulabadi (fundamentalist/fanatic), enemy of Bangladesh independence scratching for zealotry. The AL and their liberal allies abused this epithet as a political capital against the so-called religious right. But the country’s strategic future and its democratic development call for participation of all groups including the Islamists in the political process. Majority of the liberal leaders, their outfits and the cohorts did not raise a hell against the New Delhi-supported authoritarian regime for the last fifteen years. Hasina’s ultimate downfall came from the swelling anti-job-quota roil that transformed into a fearsome coalition against her long dictatorship. The widening political upheaval involved diverse elements--- the opposition-blessed protestors, rightwing Islamic campaigners and the ordinary citizens who came out of their hiding plus a handful of human rights NGOs. The courageous student coordinators from both sides of the ideological scale blasted through deaths and destruction conducted by the police and the armed partisans. But it was an effective example of a strategic partnership between the right and left to exorcise a merciless autocracy that consistently denied democracy, fair election, and a peaceful political transition in Bangladesh. This article was published in the New Age (A Bangladeshi national daily, Dhaka), 07 October, 2024.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTFY9CNcoXfpQ	2024-10-27T16:43:52-07:00	
Militant Attacks And Challenges To Peace In Jammu And Kashmir – O...	The region of Jammu and Kashmir is witnessing signs of renewed tension, challenging the anticipated transition toward democracy and stability. A recent series of violent attacks have raised alarm, indicating the complex security scenario that both the central and state governments must address. Shortly after the newly elected government took office, the region experienced multiple attacks that threatened to destabilize the administration’s efforts to restore order. One such attack occurred on October 24, near Gulmarg, when terrorists ambushed an Army vehicle, resulting in the deaths of two civilians and two soldiers, with several others injured. The targeted vehicle belonged to the 18 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) and was en route from Botapathri when it was fired upon. Among the victims was an army porter who succumbed to injuries sustained during the attack. According to police sources, the attackers aimed at a Rashtriya Rifles unit stationed along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gulmarg. The incident took place in a high-security zone near the India-Pakistan border, a restricted area typically accessible only to Indian Army personnel. In response, security forces have launched intensified operations to secure the area and ensure the safety of troops. Initial reports indicated that six soldiers were injured, prompting additional deployments to evaluate the situation and reinforce security measures. This marked the fourth major incident within a week, highlighting a worrying trend. Earlier, on October 20, another deadly attack occurred near Sonamarg, along the Srinagar-Leh national highway. Militants targeted a camp housing workers of an infrastructure company, aiming to inflict significant casualties. The attack claimed the lives of seven employees, including both local and migrant workers, who were part of the Z-Morh tunnel construction team. This tunnel is a critical infrastructure project meant to enhance connectivity between Gagangir and Sonamarg in Ganderbal district. The attackers indiscriminately fired at various parts of the workers’ camp, including the mess area, and reportedly remained on site for a considerable period. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) later arrived to conduct forensic analysis and is expected to lead the investigation. This assault marked a shift in militant tactics, as large infrastructure projects in Jammu and Kashmir had seldom been targets in the past. The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a militant outfit linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. TRF’s operational strategy, led by Sheikh Sajjad Gul, has evolved to focus on both local and non-local targets, moving beyond its earlier focus primarily on Kashmiri Pandits. TRF has become increasingly active in the region over the last several months, aligning its actions with significant political developments, such as the recent Assembly elections—the first since 2014, especially after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. The October 24 attack, along with earlier incidents, occurred shortly after the elections in which the National Conference, led by Omar Abdullah, allied with the Congress to secure a majority and form the new government. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack, calling it 'dastardly and cowardly.' He expressed sympathy for the victims, emphasizing that the workers were unarmed civilians contributing to a crucial infrastructure project. Abdullah reiterated that violence against civilians would not transform Kashmir into Pakistan, a claim often promoted by militant groups. His father, Farooq Abdullah, also condemned the attack, stressing that dialogue remains impossible as long as Pakistan continues to support violence in Kashmir. The recent surge in violence appears to be part of a broader escalation in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the Jammu region, which has seen increased militant activity since 2021. Historically, militancy has been concentrated in the Kashmir Valley since 1989, while Jammu had remained relatively peaceful after the early 2000s. However, the strategic shift towards Jammu—predominantly a Hindu-majority region—suggests a calculated change in militant operations, potentially aimed at diverting security forces from more strategic areas in the Valley. Militants have adapted to the region’s rugged terrain, exploiting forested mountains and limited road connectivity to launch surprise attacks. The region’s geographical challenges, combined with a heavy concentration of security forces in the Valley, may have driven militants southward toward Jammu. Experts also suggest that militants are deliberately shifting focus to disrupt India’s broader security apparatus, taking advantage of Jammu’s relative vulnerability. The insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, which began in 1989, has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Despite the government’s rationale for abrogating Article 370 in 2019—asserting it would reduce violence and spur economic growth—recent statistics paint a different picture. From 2021 to 2024, there have been 33 militant-related attacks in Jammu alone, including eight in 2024, resulting in 11 soldiers killed and 18 injured. One of the deadliest incidents occurred in June 2024, when nine Hindu pilgrims were killed and over 30 injured during an attack on a bus in Reasi district. This marked a significant escalation, following a series of attacks targeting civilians and security forces. The attacks also cast doubt on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that the insurgency in Kashmir was nearing its end, as indicated by his government’s multipronged strategy after the region’s special status was revoked. The July attacks, including ambushes in Kulgam, Kathua, and Doda districts, highlighted persistent challenges to the central government’s claims of stability. The revocation of Article 370 was accompanied by legal and administrative changes that further centralized control over Jammu and Kashmir. New land-related laws allowed greater central control, while measures such as curfews, internet shutdowns, and mass arrests deepened the trust deficit between Kashmiris and the Indian government. Critics argue that these policies have eroded civil liberties, resulting in widespread discontent. Arrests under controversial laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Public Safety Act have targeted journalists, human rights activists, and lawyers. Local governance, despite recent elections, remains weak, with significant powers vested in the centrally appointed governor. The political downgrade of Jammu and Kashmir from a state to two Union Territories in 2019 limited local leaders’ ability to implement meaningful change, fuelling grievances. Experts suggest that restoring peace in the region would require measures that address the political wounds caused by the revocation of Article 370, such as reinstating statehood and local governance. In response to the ongoing violence, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah’s cabinet proposed a resolution urging the central government to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha approved the resolution, marking a significant step toward reestablishing the region’s former status. Omar Abdullah also met Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who reportedly assured the central government’s full support for the new administration. Meanwhile, the broader India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir remains unresolved, posing risks of prolonged regional instability. Experts emphasize that diplomatic negotiations, coupled with efforts to reduce violence, are crucial for achieving lasting peace in Jammu and Kashmir. Without urgent measures for dialogue and reconciliation, the cycle of violence is likely to persist, complicating India’s internal security and foreign relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTO9Gx40GDFmU	2024-10-27T16:42:29-07:00	
New Paintings And Details Uncovered In Egyptian Temple Of Esna	The Roman-era temple of Esna, 60 kilometers south of Luxor in Egypt, is undergoing extensive restoration work in an Egyptian-German cooperation project. The temple proper no longer exists, but the large vestibule or pronaos was rediscovered more than 200 years ago, and is complete. The restoration work has been in progress since 2018. On the Egyptian side it is led by Hisham El-Leithy from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MoTA) Documentation Center; on the German side, by Egyptologist Professor Christian Leitz from the Institute of Ancient Near Eastern Studies at the University of Tübingen. Over the past 1800 years, local people lit fires in the temple vestibule. As a result, the once-colorful wall and column decorations were blackened. Over the past six years, a team of up to 30 Egyptian restorers led by Ahmed Emam revealed the colors of the astronomical images covering the entire ceiling as well as the colors of the 18 inner columns. Yellow and red predominate A new phase of restoration began this year. Specialists finished restoring the southern inner wall and the southern part of the western rear wall. They brought to light the original colors with dominant yellow and red pigments, marking a sharp difference from color schemes found elsewhere, for example at the temple of Dendara, where white and light blue predominate. 'The greatest discovery this year was the many painted details of the clothing on the king and the deities of Esna, their crowns and their thrones,' says Christian Leitz. 'Previously, we could not see them at all due to the thick layer of soot over the reliefs.' All these painted details are an integral part of the offering scenes which cover the inner walls of the temple. Researchers knew about the hieroglyphic texts and the reliefs; but the freshly-uncovered decorations on the throne images have their own meaning. In one scene – an offering of bow and arrow to the goddess Neith – the conservation team uncovered four painted bows in the lower part of the throne – perhaps part of originally nine bows, a reference to the 'nine bows' as a designation for Upper and Lower Egypt and seven other territories ruled by the king of Egypt. Another example is the apron of the king in one of the offering scenes. It is decorated with two plants: The papyrus (top) is the emblem of Lower Egypt and the lily (bottom) the emblem of Upper Egypt, symbolizing that the king is the ruler of the two parts of the country. Perhaps the most spectacular scene is the one with the holy barque of the local deity Khnoum which carries the shrine of the god. This boat is carried by several priests who are bringing it out from the innermost part of the temple in a procession, so that on special occasions the people of Esna could at least see the closed shrine of the god. For the rest of the year it was hidden in the temple to which only the priests had access. The conservation work will resume at the beginning of November. The main goal for the next winter season is the cleaning of the outer part of the six front columns of the temple. This cannot be done in summer due to the great heat. The Esna temple restoration work is sponsored by the Ancient Egypt Foundation, the American Research Center in Egypt and the Gerda Henkel Foundation. The pronaos The pronaos of the temple in Esna is 37 meters long, 20 meters wide and 15 meters high. It is a sandstone structure which was erected in front of the actual temple building before or during the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius (41–54 AD) and was probably much larger than the temple itself. Its location in the middle of the city center probably contributed to the fact that the vestibule was preserved and was not used as a quarry for building materials as other ancient edifices were during the industrialization of Egypt. Even in Napoleon's time, the pronaos attracted attention among scholars, as it was considered an ideal example of ancient Egyptian temple architecture.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTDpIxaHo2Lky	2024-10-27T16:40:58-07:00	
Scarce Room At The Top Of Vietnamese Politics For Women – Analysi...	By Zachary Abuza Communist systems are purported to be egalitarian and gender neutral. But in Vietnam, as with China, despite the lofty rhetoric, the country falls short in terms of its own stated goals and ideals. A handful of women have excelled in the Vietnamese corporate world, such as tycoon Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. And Truong My Lan has set the bar for spectacular corporate scandals, receiving the death penalty and a life sentence in two cases involving fraud and money laundering at Van Thinh Phat and Saigon Commercial Bank. Vietnam, which celebrates women’s day on Oct. 20, is often touted for having some of the highest rates of female political participation in Southeast Asia. Based only on the metric of parliamentarians, with just under 30%, Vietnam does stand above its ASEAN peers, with the exception of the Philippines. But in other aspects of politics, Vietnam is falling far short of its stated goals. Gender equality was always tied to the ideals of the socialist revolution. One of the first laws passed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the Marriage and Family Law of 1959 that gave women equality under the law. Article 26 of the Constitution, amended in 2013, assures gender equality, and puts an onus on the state for advancing women’s rights, and prohibits sexual discrimination. In their 2024 country report, Freedom House wrote that 'Vietnam has enacted policies and strategies aimed at boosting women’s political participation, but in practice the interests of women are poorly represented in government.' Vietnam set a high bar for itself, with the goal of having 60% of all state agencies and local governments having key female leaders by 2025, and 75% by 2030. Vietnam seems on track to have 35% female representation in the National Assembly by 2030. Plucky parliamentarians Vietnamese women have fared well in the plucky National Assembly. Though controlled by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), it is not a rubber stamp, and has demonstrated a surprising degree of independence. Women’s participation in the National Assembly fell between 2007-2016, before recovering. But it is still below their target. Women currently comprise 27% of National Assembly delegates. But beyond the National Assembly there is a dearth of female representation at both the senior level of leadership and the key pathways to senior leadership that would result in greater female representation down the line at the 15th and 16th Party congresses, expected in 2031 and 2036, respectively. There is currently only one woman on the elite 15-member Politburo: Bui Thi Minh Hoai, who was elected mid-term at the 9th Plenum in May. Truong Thi Mai, the only woman elected to the 18 member Politburo at the 13th Congress in January 2021, was forced to resign in May as part of the ongoing Blazing Furnace anti-corruption scandal. Mai headed the CPV’s Secretariat, making her the highest-ranking female politician in the country’s history. With Mai’s resignation, there are currently no women on the 12-member CPV Secretariat, which is in charge of the party’s day-to-day affairs. The 12th Politburo was the acme of female representation, with three women among 19 members, or 16%. Tellingly, all three women served in National Assembly leadership positions: chair Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, deputy chair Tong Thi Phuong, and Mai, then a member of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee. Phuong and Ngan likewise served on the 11th Politburo, concurrently serving as deputy chairs of the National Assembly. So even in the Politburo, often the pathway to power for women comes through the National Assembly. Pathways to power What about other pathways to power? For starters, only one-third of the Communist Party’s 5.3 million members are women. In the current term, nine of the 63 provinces or provincial-level cities were headed by a woman: An Giang, Bac Ninh, Hai Nam, Lai Chau, Lang Son, Ninh Binh, Quang Ngai, Thai Nguyen and Vinh Phuc. In mid-2024, the newly minted Politburo member Bui Thi Minh Hoai was appointed chair of the Hanoi Party Committee, following the forced resignation of the incumbent, Dinh Tien Dung, on corruption charges. That brings the number of provincial committee chairs to 16% of the total. This is important, because roughly one-third of the Central Committee is composed of provincial representatives. At the time of writing, the Central Committee had only 183 members and alternate members. Only 16, or 9%, are women. This is down from the 13th Congress in January 2021, when women comprised 9.5 percent of the Central Committee. At present, only two provincial governments, Bac Ninh and Binh Phuoc, are headed by women, a mere 3%. Within the State Council, none of the five deputy prime ministers are women, and only three of 22 minister-level officials are women. These include Minister of Internal Affairs Pham Thi Thanh Tra, Minister of Health Dao Hong Lan, and the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, Nguyen Thi Hong. Correcting imbalances The minister of health has been under a cloud ever since the Viet-A covid-19 test kit scandal, which rocked her ministry, and landed her predecessor in jail. Netizens have long mocked the ministry as a font of corruption. The State Bank governor, likewise, has been under intense scrutiny following the government’s failure to adequately regulate Saigon Commercial Bank, caught up in the Truong My Lan and Van Thinh Phat scandal, which led to a $24 billion government bailout of the bank. One area where women are continuing to excel is within the country’s elite diplomatic corps. At a recent ceremony, five of 16 newly appointed ambassadors were women. While that is important for Vietnam on the world stage, it does little in the world of Vietnamese politics. Gender equality has been a concern since the onset of the socialist revolution; Ho Chi Minh himself made it a priority of the revolution. But in recent years, the CPV has fallen short of its stated goals. There is a chance to rectify that at the 14th national Party Congress, expected to be held in January 2026. Planning, including the composition of the 14th Central Committee, is already underway. While the elite Central Committee and Politburo are out of balance in a number of ways – most notably regional dynamics – the party has to move beyond tokenism in representation of women within its highest decision-making bodies.

Muslim And Arab American Leaders In Michigan Endorse Trump	Prominent Muslim leaders were invited by former USPresident Donald Trumpon Saturday during a campaign rally in Michigan to announce their support for the Republican candidate. Trump was joined onstage by what his campaign described as 'prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community' to encourage Muslim and Arab American to endorse him in the Nov. 5 presidential election. The former president also said that he was banking on 'overwhelming support' from these voters in the state, according to CNN. 'They could turn the election one way or the other,' Trump said of the Arab and Muslim communities, who are critical of US support for Israel in its war on Gaza. On stage, the Muslim leaders cited Trump’s commitment to ending conflicts. 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war,' ImamBelal Alzuhairitold thecrowd. Alzuhairi described Trump as the 'peace' candidate. 'The bloodshed has to stop all over the world. And I think this man can make that happen.' Trump said that Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a 'stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East.' 'That’s all they want,' he said. The endorsement of Trump by Muslim and Arab communities would be a notable shift by Michigan’s Muslim community, who have traditionally aligned with the Democrats.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTAjCBbne-mbL	2024-10-27T16:37:33-07:00	
Israel Hopes Focused Targets In Retaliatory Strike Will Limit Ira...	By Linda Gradstein Israeli officials say its series of strikes Saturday overnight on Iran achieved their objectives.'Following the directive of the political echelon, we carried out precise and targeted strikes on targets in different areas in Iran,' Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing.'These included missile manufacturing facilities used by Iran in its attacks on the State of Israel over the past year. Simultaneously, we targeted Iran’s surface-to-air missile arrays and Iranian aerial capabilities that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran. Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' Hagari said.Iranian state news site IRNA quoted the nation’s air defense organization as saying Israel attacked military centers in Tehran and in the western provinces of Khuzestan and Ilam. It said Iranian forces 'successfully' intercepted many of the strikes, ensuring they caused only 'limited damage.' On Sunday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, did not call for retaliation. Instead, he said, the attacks 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed.' 'It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country,' said Khamenei, who has the final say over all major decisions in Iran. The U.N. Security Council will meet Monday following a request by Iran after Israel’s attack, claiming that Israel violated international law. Iran Israeli analysts said the decision to limit the attack to military targets gives Iran a way to back away from its escalating rhetoric against Israel. 'Israel didn't make it larger than it was expected,' Beni Sabit, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies, said. 'Last time, Iran attacked [Israel’s] military bases, air force bases, so Israel also attacked military bases, air force, air defense bases, and also some military factories for missiles and drones.'So, we see that Israel wants to close this event to pass this message to Iran that it is closed, [this is] a closure, and we don't want to escalate it,' Sabit said. 'So now it depends on Iran, if they take this message, understand this message, or no — they want to escalate it, too.' The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said there had been no Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted. IAEA inspectors are safe and continue their vital work. I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety & security of nuclear & other radioactive materials,' Rafael Mariano Grossi wrote on social media platform X.One of Israel’s broadcast network’s reported that Israel initially planned to strike Iran’s oil and natural gas facilities but changed the targets after U.S. pressure, a claim the Israeli prime minister’s office called 'totally false.''Israel chose the targets ahead of time, based on its national interests,' the prime minister’s office said in a statement, 'and not based on American directives.''That’s how it was, and that’s how it will be,' the statement reads.Israeli analysts say the ball is now in Iran’s court, and they can choose to de-escalate the conflict with Israel.'I do hope they realize that the best way to go would be to stop attacking Israel with ballistic missiles,' said Shlomo Shapiro a professor of national security at Bar Ilan University.'If the Iranians would retaliate now, that may drive Israel to an even harsher response, and that could escalate into a regional conflagration. I don’t think any of the sides now need that and I hope that cooler minds will prevail,' Shapiro said.The Israeli government did not issue any special instructions to the population after the strikes, meaning they did not expect an imminent Iranian response. On October 1, Iran attacked Israel with 200 missiles, which damaged property but did not cause any fatalities. Israel vowed at that time to respond, and almost a month later, it launched this series of attacks on Iran, which showed Israel’s capability for long-range attacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTPHVhF0_XvMh	2024-10-27T16:35:53-07:00	
BRICS: Brazil Says It Was Just Outlining Criteria For New Admissi...	By Lucas Pordeus Leon Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Relations explained it does not advocate the admission of any specific nation to BRICS, adding, however, that it did advocate the creation of criteria and principles to guide the choice of the bloc’s new members. According to the Secretary for Asia and the Pacific at the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ambassador Eduardo Paes Saboia, the criteria include defending reform of the UN, not accepting unilateral economic sanctions, and having friendly relations with all the member countries. Brazil’s position was clarified after the Venezuelan government said in a statement that Brazil had vetoed the Caribbean country’s entry into BRICS, and that the move was an aggression. Representatives of Brazilian diplomacy, however, maintain that the group has merely outlined criteria and principles for new members. According to the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry’s note, 'the Venezuelan people feel indignation and shame at this inexplicable and immoral aggression by Brazilian diplomacy, which is maintaining the worst of [former Brazilian President] Jair Bolsonaro’s policies against the Bolivarian Revolution founded by Commander Hugo Chávez.' During this week’s BRICS meeting in Russia, the list of countries that could join the group as associate members was defined, but Venezuela was left out. By consensus of the ten BRICS member countries in Latin America, Cuba and Bolivia were selected. Nigeria, Turkey, Malaysia, and Indonesia were also cited as meeting the defined criteria. Brazil has been diplomatically distancing itself from Venezuela since the election on July 28 this year, which resulted in the re-election of President Nicolás Maduro. The outcome was contested by the opposition, international organizations, and other countries, including Brazil, on the grounds that the electoral data per polling station had not been presented.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeZW1iZ8ONWTKc_Eiiu8w62	2024-10-27T16:31:50-07:00	
After Preliminary Election Results, Disappointment For Georgia’s ...	By Joshua Kucera (RFE/RL) -- The ruling Georgian Dream party eked out a slim victory in Georgia's pivotal parliamentary elections, preliminary results showed. Georgian Dream won just under 53 percent of the vote, with 69 percent of the precincts tabulated, according to the first preliminary results that the Central Election Commissionreleasedjust over an hour after polls closed on October 26. Four opposition blocs topped the threshold of 5 percent required to gain seats in the parliament, totaling just over 38 percent. The parties had agreed to cooperate as a united front against Georgian Dream, campaigning against the ruling party as an authoritarian, pro-Russian force. Pro-Western Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who has broken with the ruling Georgian Dream party, said she will not recognize the results of parliamentary elections held on October 26 and alleged that the country has been thevictim of a 'Russian special operation.' Zurabishvili did not present any evidence to back up her claim in a brief statement to the media in Tbilisi on October 27. Foreign Policy Focus The vote was deeply polarizing in Georgia and closely watched around the world, seen as a crucial battle in the country's post-Soviet history. The campaign messaging from both sides was dominated by foreign policy messages. The opposition accused Georgian Dream of sabotaging relations with the European Union and United States. They promised to restore relations with the West. Georgian Dream, meanwhile, claimed that the opposition parties woulddrag Georgia into warwith Russia and that the ruling party would ensure peace. The first foreign leader to congratulate Georgian Dream was Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whoweighed ineven before the first official results were announced. Orban's illiberal domestic politics and West-skeptic foreign policy has been an inspiration to Georgian Dream and he has become a key ally to Georgia's leaders. Opposition parties had predicted that a high turnout would be good news for them, but that did not turn out to be the case. More than 2 million voters came out, even before voters abroad were tabulated, representing 59 percent of eligible voters. It was the highest turnout since 2012, the year that Georgian Dream came to power. With the narrow victory, Georgian Dream was denied its stated goal: a constitutional majority, which requires 113 seats in parliament. Exact numbers were not immediately available but if this result holds it would give Georgian Dream under 90 seats in parliament. That would prevent the party from carrying out one of its most extreme campaign promises: to ban the opposition parties, under the pretext that they provoked Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008. Election Violations The vote was plagued by large numbers of apparent violations. Election monitors recorded dozens of physical altercations outside voting places around the country, as well as other forms of intimidation of voters. There were widespread allegations about the marking fluid that voters were supposed to get on their fingers to prevent them from voting a second time: that the fluid quickly wore off, or that poll workers let in voters who already had the marking. The election was marred by 'violations of vote secrecy, physical violence and threats of violence, interference with the legitimate work of observers and journalists and attacks against them, [and] incidents of illegal campaigning,' the watchdog group Georgian Young Lawyers' Associationsaidin a preliminary assessment. Opposition-friendly exit polls had predicted a strikingly different result, with Georgian Dream taking only 41 or 42 percent of the vote and the collective opposition between 48 and 52. Based on those results, opposition figures declared victory before the first official results were announced. It was not immediately clear how the opposition parties would respond. The initial results were based on the electronic counting of the votes, which was expected to be completed on election night. A hand-counting of the votes, plus a counting of the precincts that did not have electronic systems, was expected to be completed in the morning of October 27. Many expected that a Georgian Dream declaration of victory would spark protests, given the deep opposition to the party among many in Tbilisi. The city saw large-scale demonstrations in the spring against Georgian Dream's adoption of a notorious 'foreign agent' law. But as of just before midnight on election night, masses of people were not taking to the streets. Joshua Kucera is a journalist living in Tbilisi.
