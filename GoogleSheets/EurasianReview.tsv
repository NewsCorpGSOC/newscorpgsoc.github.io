Iran’s Unconventional Naval Platforms – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu Iran’s Drone Carrier Program: An Overview To help address its conventional military industrial disadvantages, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been converting commercial vessels into drone carriers and naval missile launch platforms. Tehran has outfitted basic commercial ships with carrier decks and asymmetric offensive weapons such as combat drones, bomb-laden unmanned boats, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. These new platforms appear capable of wreaking havoc in the region. Since Tehran modifies these vessels with predominantly commercial components, traditional arms control measures are ineffective at restricting their construction. While Tehran cannot match its adversaries’ technologically superior aircraft carriers and helicopter landing docks, these makeshift vessels allow Iran to imperil regional maritime shipping and threaten the United States’ naval presence in the Middle East. Iran Commissions Its First Drone Carrier In early February 2025, Iran’s first drone carrier, the IRIS Shahid Bagheri, officially joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy. The inauguration ceremony was held in the city of Bandar Abbas, strategically positioned on the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s new naval platform might look technologically and structurally inferior to modern aircraft carriers and amphibious assault vessels. But a careful assessment of the vessel’s design philosophy reveals that Iran has taken the lessons from the success of its Yemen-based Houthi proxy and implemented them at a larger scale. Like the Houthi arsenal, these makeshift drone carriers are designed to create tactical advantages and strategic leverage. The Shahid Bagheri was formerly a container ship, the Perarin. With a length of 787 feet and a takeoff runway of approximately 570 feet, the Shahid Bagheri is well-equipped to support a variety of Iranian drones, including loitering munitions. Vertical takeoff platforms can launch from and land on the carrier without any special modifications. The vessel also boasts a unique design feature: an angled flight deck, akin to a ski jump, that points toward the vessel’s starboard edge. This design allows the flight deck to extend beyond the Perarin’s chassis, lengthening the runway and allowing larger drones to launch from the carrier. Nonetheless, satellite imagery shows that the design of the carrier’s flight deck leaves little room for heavy aircraft recovery operations, since any landing errors could damage the vessel. It is unknown whether the craft has barrier recovery or arrested landing features to protect the ship and crew in touchdown and abort incidents. A Closer Look at the Shahid Bagheri The Shahid Bagheri provides its operators with a broad range of robotic warfare options. In her debut, she carried two subscale variants of the Qaher unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), one 60 percent smaller and the other 25 percent smaller than the Qaher’s original airframe. While it is not known whether the larger variant managed to take off from the platform, the smaller Qaher launched successfully. The Ababil-3, which can carry guided munitions or function as a kamikaze drone, also took off successfully from the carrier. The Atlas sub-variant of the Ababil-3 has a fortified airframe that allows it to carry a greater payload. Notably, the Houthis have used a kamikaze variant of the Ababil family, the Qasef. The Shahid Bagheri also had a Mohajer-6 UAV onboard during its launch ceremony. Designed by Qods Aviation Industries, the Mohajer-6 drone incorporates composite plastic materials to reduce its weight. The aircraft is equipped with a laser rangefinder and electro-optical infrared sensors. It can conduct automated takeoffs and landings and carry jamming and electromagnetic sensor payloads, important capabilities for combating electronic warfare operations. Finally, it has a line-of-sight control range of 120 miles and a ceiling of 18,000 feet, which lets it evade the engagement envelopes of most low-altitude short-range air defenses. Most analysts estimate that the drone can fly for around 12 hours, though some have reported it can last as long as 24 hours in the air. The Mohajer-6 is also the first variant of its class certified for guided munitions like Qaem-1 glide bombs. The Russian military used a limited number of Mohajer-6 drones in Ukraine to coordinate attacks, particularly over Odesa. The Shahid Bagheri can also launch Shahed baseline loitering munitions, unmanned surface vehicles for asymmetric naval warfare operations, and, theoretically, unmanned underwater vehicles. The IRGC has used the invaluable combat experience it gained from the Houthis’ drone and missile strikes against the US Navy’s assets in the region to develop these disruptive capabilities. With its drone carrier fleet, the IRGC can replicate the Houthis’ highly attritional combat operations on a larger scale. Iran’s floating bases can attack targets with mixed strike packages consisting of naval drones, loitering munitions and aerial drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, and underwater robotic warfare platforms. Such an arsenal would threaten any maritime grouping in the Middle East. Seaborne Missile Platforms Iran’s power projection fleet can also carry anti-ship, air-defense, and land-attack missiles. The Shahid Mahdavi, a floating missile platform, was built on the container ship Sarvin and is roughly the same length as the Shahid Bagheri. This platform features helicopter pads along with ballistic missile launch positions. In 2024, the vessel test-fired Fateh-baseline ballistic missiles, likely the longer-range Dezful variant. The Houthis demonstrated that coastal anti-ship ballistic missiles can be effective even against moving targets. A floating Iranian missile and drone carrier would stress regional air and missile defenses to a considerably more worrisome extent. Apart from the Shahid Bagheri drone carrier and Shahid Mahdavi missile platform, the Islamic Republic fields the Makran, formerly a crude oil tanker, as a forward-base ship with rotary-wing naval aviation support features. Tehran also uses the Shahid Roudaki, another former container vessel, as a drone and missile launch platform. Tehran’s fast-growing fleet of floating drone and missile carriers is boosted by spy vessels such as the Saviz and the Behshad, which were also converted from container vessels. Equipped with intelligence capabilities and command-control features, these platforms play a vital role in providing Iran’s drone-carriers and floating missile bases with targeting data in real time. The Geopolitical Impact of Iran’s Disruptive Naval Capabilities In its 2019 report on Iranian military power, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) concluded that unmanned aerial vehicles are Iran’s most rapidly advancing air power capability. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 vindicated the DIA’s findings, as the Kremlin pounded Ukraine with Iran-made Shahed loitering munitions. The Houthi militia, meanwhile, showed what Iranian anti-ship missile technologies can accomplish when used alongside robotic naval warfare assets. The DIA assessed that Houthi activities in the Red Sea reduced maritime traffic in the region by over 90 percent. This affected the global economy severely, as 15 percent of global shipping transits the area, and alternate routes add roughly 11,000 nautical miles and $1 million of fuel per voyage. The Houthis’ attacks also proved lucrative: the militia allegedly made $2 billion per year by extorting and strong-arming shipping companies. Iran’s drone carriers could do even greater damage to global shipping and maritime trade, particularly if the IRGC coordinates with its Houthi proxies. Worse, Iran’s drone and missile capabilities are more potent than they have ever been. Lessons from Yemen and Ukraine have provided Tehran with invaluable real-world knowledge. And because Iran has diversified its logistics network with commercially available components, traditional arms control frameworks can do little to stop this threat. Many in the West have long thought that dialogue and diplomacy could tame Tehran’s hostile ambitions. Shahed drones buzzing over Ukrainian skies, Houthi projectiles targeting Red Sea shipping, and Iranian proxies sowing instability throughout the Middle East proved these assumptions to be groundless. Absent a more realistic Western approach to Iran, Tehran’s new unconventional naval platforms threaten to further destabilize the region.

US Paris Climate Agreement Exit Will Hit Africa Hard – Analysis	By Dhesigen Naidoo On his first day in office, United States (US) President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw his country from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement. This latest plunge of the US climate change rollercoaster may be the most impactful yet. The Paris Agreement was initially met with resistance from the US, followed by enthusiasm. Under George HW Bush, a strong environmental agenda was supported at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, followed by a unanimous Senate rejection of Kyoto Protocol ratification during the Bill Clinton era. Then there was the first Paris Agreement withdrawal during Trump’s first term, followed by an enthusiastic return under Joe Biden. The latest withdrawal will take effect in one year and continue for at least three more, depending on the 2028 US presidential election outcome. Unlike the previous exit, which lasted only 107 days before Biden rejoined the agreement in 2021, there is now a reasonable time for significant harm to global climate action efforts. These impacts will be felt at multiple levels and in four main areas. The first is direct funding support. In its continued moves to weaken the United Nations system, US support for other countries and non-state actors to fully implement the Paris Agreement will be limited or seized altogether. Unlike the US’ previous exit, there is now enough time for significant harm to global climate action efforts An early casualty might be developed countries' US$300 billion pledge at COP29 in Baku. This may extend to the US being a lower-profile player in replenishing global funds like the Green Climate Fund to the tune of US$4 billion, and the new Loss and Damage Fund. The US’ dismissive stance on climate change, combined with Trump’s insistence that North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries increase their defence spending amidst heightened global insecurity, may see climate funding reduced in the developing world. This has grave implications for the mitigation and adaptation ambitions, and in particular, the needs of African countries. An example is the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) which facilitate the movement to low-carbon growth in Africa. Two African countries, South Africa and Senegal, have operational JETPs, and pilot plans are underway for three more – Egypt, Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco. The outlook for these energy transitions is grave in the short term, as the US has, to date, been a principal partner. The second impact of the US withdrawal is the gap it will leave in global institutions. After climate change sceptic David Malpass was appointed World Bank president in Trump’s first term, Biden used the position's vacancy to install climate action embracing Ajay Banga as head. Many progressive policy changes followed, including loan and grant packages for the close-down and repurposing of coal-fired power stations in South Africa. If the World Bank’s climate efforts are arrested, a knock-on effect could occur in many of its partners The World Bank Detox Development report is also highly innovative. It proposes redirecting already dedicated fossil fuel subsidies towards low-carbon energy sources, keeping the subsidies under the energy security banner – but with a renewables and nuclear character. There may also be funding possibilities for the damage caused by climate disasters, and investments in climate adaptation to help vulnerable communities cope. Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ mantra and its supporting measures put this World Bank proposal at risk. Recent COPs and the 2023 Climate Finance Summit have made it clear that national and especially multilateral development banks should lead the global climate finance drive. If the World Bank’s climate efforts are arrested, a knock-on effect could occur in many of its partners. Hopefully, there will be sufficient pushback from the European Investment Bank, Asian Development Bank and the New Development Bank (BRICS Bank). If that happens, the African Development Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa may be encouraged to continue their climate aspirations. Commercial banks are also vulnerable to policy shifts back to fossil fuel investments. A market opening for fossil fuel chain investments, initially in the US and then beyond, could see the formula for easier profits compared to renewable energy investments becoming attractive to commercial bank investors and shareholders. Key countries must galvanise a global climate agenda at this year’s BRICS and G20 summits The third effect of the US’ Paris Agreement exit relates to the country’s role as an active negotiator in COP meetings while its withdrawal is pending. Given that it questions the UN’s value generally and its climate position in particular, the US could retard already sluggish efforts to secure more commitment for mitigation targets, adaptation financing and reasonable compensation for loss and damage. This will affect poor countries the most, whose contributions to the global carbon budget are negligible, if any. The impact will go beyond lower levels of financial aid, and into the domains of reduced technical assistance and capacity building. Africa – a vulnerable region with the highest concentration of least developed countries globally – will feel the brunt immediately. Fourth, Trump’s stance on the climate issue has disturbingly garnered support in other countries. The most visible to date has been Argentina, where President Javier Milei, a self-declared Trump ally, has said he will consider leaving the Paris Agreement. Others may follow, weakening the climate multilateral platform. The best chance to get this train back on the rails is at COP30 in Belém, Brazil in November. There is still room and hope for a more robust agreement on climate action. To achieve this, key countries must galvanise a global climate agenda at plurilateral forums in 2025 – the BRICS summit under the Brazilian presidency in July and the G20 summit under South Africa’s presidency in November. The G20 Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors meeting this week in South Africa will also be significant. The alternative is reduced climate action and a faster slide to global climate catastrophe – with Africa and the developing world as the first victims.

Malaysia’s Reform Aspirations Clashed With Political Realities In...	By Kai Ostwald After focusing on political survival in 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim entered 2024 with ambitious plans to restore Malaysia’s standing as one of Asia’s leading economies and middle powers. Economic growth exceeded expectations — fuelled in part by a surge in foreign investment — particularly in the semiconductor sector, the Malaysian ringgit saw a modest recovery and Anwar’s active diplomacy elevated Malaysia’s global profile. Yet 2024 also demonstrated that ambition alone is insufficient to overcome Malaysia’s entrenched political divisions. Anwar’s government, constrained by an unwieldy coalition and the volatile pull of identity politics, struggled to advance significant reforms. Race and religion remained potent political flashpoints. In March, a convenience store inadvertently sold socks embossed with the word ‘Allah’, triggering viral outrage. Several political leaders used the incident to paint Anwar’s government — and its Chinese-majority coalition partner, the Democratic Action Party — as insufficiently protective of Malay-Muslim interests. Even the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a key member of the ruling coalition, saw its Youth Chief join the fray, highlighting the coalition’s internal tensions. In May, Universiti Teknologi MARA — a university historically reserved for ethnic Malays and other bumiputera — proposed temporarily admitting students from other ethnic backgrounds to its postgraduate cardiothoracic programme to address a critical shortage of qualified surgeons. The backlash was swift, with students and Malay nationalist groups mobilising in protest. In August, former prime minister and opposition leader Muhyiddin Yassin was charged with sedition for appearing to question a royal decision which followed the 2022 election. While his comments drew public criticism, the sedition charge itself reignited debates over selective prosecution. After years of politicising Malaysia’s race, religion and royalty, identity-based populism has become a force unto itself, with no clear way to contain or navigate it in pursuit of substantive reform. Another former prime minister, Najib Razak — serving time for his role in the 1MDB corruption scandal — remains a political liability for Anwar. Though popular within UMNO and its base, he is widely denounced as a kleptocrat elsewhere. In February, a Pardons Board unexpectedly halvedNajib’s sentence and slashed his fines, fuelling backlash from the public and government. Anwar’s predicament is unenviable — he needs UMNO’s backing to govern, but Najib’s preferential treatment undermines his reformist credentials. Beyond politics, Malaysia faced compounding crises in late 2024. Severe flooding in the northern states displaced hundreds of thousands, while sporadic shortages of local white rice deepened food security concerns. Transnational haze persisted and a string of incidents, from power outages in East Malaysia to a tourist vanishing into a Kuala Lumpur sinkhole, exposed pressing infrastructure gaps. None of these challenges have easy fixes. Still, Anwar may find some relief in Perikatan Nasional’s waning momentum. The opposition, which surged in 2023, has been increasingly fractured. Merdeka Center polling also suggests strengthening support for the government, which could give Anwar more manoeuvring room in 2025. The upcoming Sabah state election will be another key test of his coalition’s stability. Malaysia’s foreign policy in 2024 reflected ongoing strategic balancing. Anwar sought to maintain ties with both China and the West while amplifying Malaysia’s support for Palestine, often through sharp critiques of Western hypocrisy and the rules-based international order. Mid-year, he announced Malaysia’s application to join BRICs while making high-profile visits to Beijing and New Delhi, prompting speculation about Malaysia’s geopolitical realignment. That interpretation is premature, as Malaysia continues to seek strong ties with the United States and other Western partners. Malaysia’s relationship with China, while robust, has had tension. A leaked Chinese diplomatic note ordering Malaysia to halt exploration in its own South China Sea exclusive economic zone underscored the complexities of this balancing act. Anwar, who made dozens of international trips in 2024, frequently spoke off-the-cuff to build rapport with global leaders while also addressing domestic concerns. Many of his statements, shaped by shifting political pressures, reflect tactical positioning rather than a cohesive foreign policy shift. Malaysia’s 2025 ASEAN Chairmanship will be a pivotal test for Anwar’s leadership. Expectations are high for meaningful progress on regional challenges, particularly the crisis in Myanmar and tensions in the South China Sea. Failure to secure tangible results could deepen ASEAN’s fragmentation, prompting member states to pursue mini-lateral alternatives. Simultaneously, Malaysia must build momentum for the successor plans to the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint — frameworks that will shape the region’s future. Negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area upgrade are set to conclude under Malaysia’s leadership, giving Kuala Lumpur leverage in shaping their final forms. While loftier objectives — such as finalising the South China Sea Code of Conduct or facilitating Timor Leste’s formal ASEAN accession — may prove elusive, Malaysia’s Chairmanship will be central to shaping the agenda and fostering consensus. With global politics in flux, Malaysia’s ambitious 2025 agenda will require not just bold leadership, but also pragmatic goal setting, stronger coordination and effective delegation. These may be Anwar’s real tests.

How Can The Study Of Hierarchy/Heterarchy Influence The Future? –...	How new information changes theories. Hierarchies are a familiar form of human organization where individuals and groups of high social status are ranked above others and make decisions. Some examples are an oligarchy, a small group of committed individuals (sharing religion, wealth, etc.); an absolute monarchy that controls all the levers of power; and an activity that requires a clear chain of command (armies and firefighters) for a rapid and coordinated effort. Another form of human organization is a heterarchy, where individual and group status is based on behavior, values, and the willingness to work for the common good; decisions are taken cooperatively. (An earlier version of this article originally appeared as an entry for Heterarchy in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1) Examples of heterarchy are elected national assemblies, unions and guilds, or a group activity whose leaders have the requisite knowledge for the required tasks. These are bare-bones characterizations—a continuum—rather than a one-or-the-other condition; sociopolitical governance is usually a mix, with strict rules for certain purposes and more flexible rules for others. Taken together, the two terms aid the examination of all sociopolitical systems and the study of how decisions are mediated and change over time. A Traditional View of Social Complexity Since archaeology's founding as a discipline in the 19th century, most interpretations have assumed a linear progression from small, early, and 'simple' societies to those that were more populous, appeared later in time, and were 'complex.' Such a definition of complex (having more administrative levels) is in contrast to the definition of complexity in nonlinear systems (more richly networked). Political systems were assumed to have greater stability the more they tended toward tiered hierarchies of power. In 1962, the American cultural anthropologist Elman Service introduced a framework classifying evolutionary stages of social and political organization into four categories: band, tribe, chiefdom, and state. He focused on the managerial benefits of the theory, which posits that chiefdoms arose due to the advantages of centralized leadership and culminated in the formation of states. In this model, leaders offer tangible benefits to their followers who consolidate the leader's power and support the expansion of bureaucratic organizations. Since Service formulated this model of complexity in human societies, dissatisfaction with both the model and the underlying assumption has grown considerably. Scholars2 have complained about the definition of these categories; the lack of clear evidence in the archaeological record; the failure of much archaeological data to fit a cultural evolutionary model; and the objectionable and persistent association with racism and colonialism. Most egregious is the assumption that ancient peoples and contemporary non-state groups are somehow less intelligent and creative than citizens of nation-states. This has played directly into Eurocentric convictions that conquest and colonial takeover were a favor to 'backward' peoples. Today, scholars realize that throughout the course of human history, there were many different forms of self-governance. The root problem has been the definition of complexity. Service understood complexity as many levels of governance, each subordinate to the one above (tiered). Heterarchies have many links (networked) of shifting importance over time. A tiered administrative system describes the formal organization of states but, even in states, the social scaffolding is better revealed when governance is seen as a network, with both official entities (departments) and unofficial ones (groups and individuals who can fulfill various functions). Heterarchy Reflects Real-Life Flexibility Introducing the concept of heterarchy into the study of societies has helped to understand puzzling activities and structures that are found in the past and the present. It is not necessarily a replacement model so much as a complementary one; studying the interplay between the two systems can be particularly instructive. First, the hierarchy-heterarchy relation admits both temporal and spatial flexibility. For example, governmental heterarchies can become more hierarchical over time, and vice versa, without collapsing. Heterarchical relationships among elements at one spatial scale or in one dimension (for example, members of the same club) may be hierarchical at another scale (the privilege of seniority in decision-making). Heterarchy is both a structure and a condition. Applying the concept of heterarchy to the study of ancient and existing societies is likely to have many uses, and exploration has begun in some areas: heterarchies of scale, heterarchies of power, and heterarchies of values. Heterarchies of Scale Spatial analysis in archaeology facilitates the study of shifting configurations of occupied areas, how they were used by their inhabitants, and how socially equal households were. Service was operating under a general assumption common among archaeologists that, over time, increasing group size was related to its complexity, defined as the size of habitation and evidence of growing political centralization, elite activity, and social stratification. In the early 2020s, excavations in Eastern Europe revealed that there were cities of up to 320 hectares (almost 800 acres) with a population of 10,000 people as early as the fourth millennium BCE but, as inequality increased, the cities lost population and were abandoned. These large population aggregations in the past found mechanisms to reduce inequality but, when that ability diminished, people left.3 Heterarchies of Power Power relations are demonstrably the most complicated and important aspect of the governance of human societies. It is particularly important to know how power shifts occur and under what conditions various power distributions constitute stable and unstable configurations. Studying this would greatly assist the study of change and perhaps explain how certain forms of governance can be associated with histories of stability and instability. Addressing the decreasing capacity of macro-states to control political and economic processes in a globalized world, political scientists have also found the concepts of heterarchy and complex systems useful in moving past failing paradigms.4 Heterarchies of Values Power relations are predicated on systems of values that, as conditions change, are ranked and reranked in their importance by individuals, groups, and organizations. Neuropsychologist and cybernetician Warren McCulloch, who examined cognitive structures in the brain, called this collective organization a heterarchy.5 He demonstrated that the human brain is not organized hierarchically but adjusts to the reranking of values as circumstances change. McCulloch contrasted a hierarchy of (ranked) values with a heterarchy of values that defied both ranking and predictability. For example, an individual may be against abortion rights but support the death penalty (or vice versa). McCulloch's 'nervous nets,' the source of the brain's flexibility, are structurally similar to the adaptive capacities of fluidly organized and highly communicative groups. McCulloch's insight into the autonomous nature of information and communication in the brain revolutionized its neural study; it also solved major organizational problems in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer design. It is quintessentially human to make nimble cognitive leaps among scales.5 1 Crumley, Carole L. (2007). 'Heterarchy.' In International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.

ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model – Analysis	By Yang Xite The global economic landscape is undergoing profound restructuring. As major economies repeatedly fall into the 'stimulus-rebound-weakening' fluctuation cycle during the pandemic recovery, and as the marginal benefits of quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus continue to diminish, a fundamental question has emerged: Has the underlying logic driving economic growth undergone a systemic shift? Over the past decade, multiple rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve have failed to replicate the V-shaped recovery seen after 2008. The Eurozone's negative interest rate policy has quietly faded during the energy crisis. Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy has consistently failed to achieve the 2% inflation target. These phenomena collectively point to a confusion within the economics community: Why has the classical model, based on the input of production factors, become increasingly difficult to use to explain the growth dynamics of the real world? This disconnect between theory and practice is particularly evident in China's economic transformation. In 2024, fixed asset investment across the whole society grew by 3.2%, retail consumption grew by 3.5%, and the goods trade surplus hit a new high of USD 767.9 billion. According to the traditional 'three pillars (investments, consumptions, exports)' model, this should have resulted in a strong recovery. However, the subjective experience of micro-level entities sharply contrasts with the macro data. The manufacturing PMI has been below the threshold for five consecutive months, youth unemployment remains high, and the capital market's risk appetite continues to stay low. This paradox suggests that latent variables, not captured by traditional models, are reshaping the economic system. In this context, ANBOUND's senior researcher proposed ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model, creating a new observational dimension. This model groundbreakingly incorporates the relationships between three key factors: technology, reform, and culture, into the analysis framework. While global central bank governors are still debating the end point of interest rate hikes, this model has quietly revealed that the essence of modern economic growth has already evolved from a 'quantitative approach' driven by factor accumulation to 'ecoefficiency' based on system coordination. Specifically, ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model builds upon the traditional 'three pillars' framework and constructs an analytical framework of 'three bases and three multipliers', decomposing economic growth into three fundamental indicators: investment, consumption, and net exports, as well as three multiplier coefficients: technology, reform, and culture. The first three indicators serve as direct statistical measures of economic output, reflecting the data relationships and manifesting as explicit economic momentum. The latter three represent multiplier effects, showing coefficient relationships that amplify or diminish the impact of the first three, together forming the dynamic system of economic growth. This reveals the complexity of economic growth, especially in the current context of China's economic transformation. Ignoring the regulation of coefficient relationships could lead to policy design falling into the problem of treating symptoms but not the root causes. From the perspective of the theoretical lineage of economics, traditional growth models, such as the Solow-Swan model and New Growth Theory, primarily focus on the interaction between the input of production factors and technological progress, with little consideration of the institutional variables specific to China. The unique value of ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model lies in its ability to integrate not only the classical theories on capital, labor, and technology but also the role of government actions through reform and cultural factors within the system. For example, through reform and innovation, the Chinese government can strengthen areas such as fiscal policy, industrial planning, and institutional innovation. This can directly stimulate investment (such as infrastructure projects), indirectly boost consumption (such as tax reductions to promote domestic demand), and even reshape the structure of net exports (such as the Belt and Road Initiative, BRI). Therefore, it is important to emphasize that ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model is not a simple extension of traditional quantitative economic models. Its core lies in revealing the driving logic of economic growth through system coordination, facilitating the design of policies that can effectively stimulate economic growth. Between 2000 and 2024, China continued to rely on investment-driven growth in the face of external shocks, but this approach to regulation often came with side effects such as overcapacity and mounting debt. The root cause of this lies in the lack of deep consideration for reform to optimize investment efficiency. If policy returns are solely focused on short-term GDP numbers, while neglecting long-term goals such as industrial chain security and technological autonomy, it could lead to a vicious cycle of 'investment - unfinished projects - re-investment'. This has already led to profound lessons in areas like semiconductor manufacturing and the photovoltaic industry. The key to breaking this dilemma lies in the coordination of the three multiplier coefficients, namely technology, reform, and culture in ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model. First, technological innovation, as the core variable of the coefficient relationship, plays a crucial role through multiple pathways. According to ANBOUND Technology Innovation Transforming Productivity Model as discussed by ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan, the multiplier effect of technology on the economy can be realized through three modes: industry returns, policy returns, and capital returns. Taking industry returns as an example, China's manufacturing sector has enhanced its value added per unit of investment from RMB 1.8 / RMB invested in 2012 to RMB 2.4 / RMB invested in 2024, which is empirical evidence of the technology coefficient amplifying investment effectiveness. However, the capital return pathway faces significant distortions in China. The technology sector in A-share has been systematically overvalued in terms of price-to-earnings ratios, and although the registration system reform has accelerated the IPO process, the market's focus on 'financing over investment' has resulted in capital being unable to effectively nourish the real economy. This highlights that the activation of the technology coefficient relies not only on the intensity of research and development investment, with China’s R&D expenditure as a share of GDP in 2024 is 2.7%, but also on accompanying institutional reforms to streamline the transformation chain from 'laboratories - capital markets - industrial applications'. Secondly, the economic value of the cultural coefficient is often underestimated, yet it is closely related to consumption. It deeply participates in economic operation through implicit mechanisms such as shaping consumption preferences, brand premiums, and innovation ecosystems. On the demand side, the role of cultural identity in driving consumption upgrades has become increasingly significant. For instance, the market share of Chinese trendy brands in areas such as clothing and cosmetics has risen from 28% in 2018 to 47% in 2024. Behind this shift is the cultural coefficient reshaping the consumption logic of 'Made in China - Chinese Brands - Chinese Values'. On the supply side, cultural factors indirectly influence total factor productivity by affecting the quality of human capital. For example, the localization of 'craftsmanship spirit' in the Yangtze River Delta region has resulted in a patent conversion rate for high-end equipment manufacturing that is 12 percentage points higher than the national average. More profoundly, the cultural coefficient factor also defines the ethical boundaries of economic growth. When the concept of 'nature is wealth' is translated into institutional practices such as carbon trading markets and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments, culture becomes the underlying operating system that harmonizes growth with sustainability. Finally, the effectiveness of the reform coefficient is primarily reflected in its ability to optimize the coordination of the three key data relationships. Taking China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) industry in 2024 as an example, the government implemented a series of combined policies, such as phasing out subsidies (adjusting the consumption coefficient), financing for charging infrastructure REITs (leveraging social investment), and strategic reserves of lithium resources (stabilizing net export costs). As a result, the industry saw an 18% growth in fixed asset investment, while the consumer market penetration increased to 35%, and exports of power batteries surpassed USD 12 billion. The success of this multi-objective coordination lies in the government's shift from being a 'direct intervener' to a 'system operator'. For instance, the country’s Ministry of Finance prioritized special bond funding to support the construction of tech parks, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released space for private investment through its negative list management, and the cultural department’s IP incubation programs promoted cultural and tourism consumption. After the cumulative effect of these various policy tools, the economic benefits generated far exceeded a simple sum of individual measures. Currently, the key to breaking through China's economic challenges lies in how to rebalance the coefficient relationships under the 'threefold pressure'. On the investment side, the use of local government special bond funds needs to shift from 'quantity' expansion to 'quality' improvement, enhancing the industrial relevance of new infrastructure through the infusion of the technology coefficient. On the consumption side, the cultural coefficient should focus on resolving the people’s paradox of 'having income but not daring to spend', in order to unlock medium- to long-term potential by fostering emerging business models like those catered for senior citizens and immersive experiences. On the net export side, the reform coefficient needs to reshape the BRI cooperation model, turning cultural identity into institutional public goods, such as mutual recognition of standards and co-governance of intellectual property. Crucially, these three coefficients are not independent. Technological breakthroughs rely on government-led basic research investments, such as reforms. Cultural soft power construction needs to be empowered by technological means. Meanwhile, the improvement in government governance resulting from reforms is closely linked to institutional innovations within a cultural context. This interconnectedness requires that policy design go beyond departmental perspectives and seek the optimal solution within the interactive framework of 'technology-reform-culture'. In this regard, ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model provides a systematic foundation for understanding China’s 15th Five-Year Plan, as well as creating a more potential-driven, flexible window for correctly assessing the future prospects of the country's economic growth. Therefore, this model is not intended for academic purposes alone, but rather to define the future trends of economic growth, creating the necessary conditions and opening up pathways for that future development. Final analysis conclusion: Looking through the perspective of the new stage of high-quality development, the practical significance of ANBOUND's Economic Growth Model is becoming increasingly evident. It signals to decision-makers that economic growth is not just a 'data race' but also a 'coefficient revolution'. As the marginal returns of traditional growth drivers decline, breakthroughs in technology to push the productivity frontier, reforms to reconstruct incentive-compatible mechanisms, and culture to activate social capital will become key to overcoming the middle-income trap. Historical experience shows that any single dimension of growth faces a ceiling. The United States’ over-reliance on capital returns has led to industrial hollowing out, while Japan’s technological strength has been constrained by cultural isolation, which weakens its innovation vitality. China's path to breaking through lies in leveraging its institutional advantages to weave a 'six-dimensional network', deeply integrating the sharpness of technology, the precision of reform, as well as the cultural aspect.

The Future Of The US In Europe: A Proposal – Analysis	By Aaron Stein (FPRI) -- US President Donald Trump is a radically transparent person but still manages to surprise. After promising for years that he would put pressure on Ukraine to agree with Russia to halt fighting, Trump has recently followed through. He directed his administration to extort the Ukrainian government for a natural resources agreement, ostensibly to 'pay back' the American taxpayer for military assistance, and called on Europe to provide a military force to occupy the country to deter a Russian resumption of fighting after any agreement is reached. Trump’s demands have caused a serious fissure in transatlantic relations. It is essential to understand the roots of these fissures so that the US-European relationship can evolve to meet the moment. Trump is remarkably consistent, and elements of his worldview have become mainstream, particularly his demand of Europe to do more for itself so that Washington can focus on the Indo-Pacific. The Obama administration first announced the 'rebalance' towards Asia in 2011, which continued during the first Trump administration, accelerated under former President Joe Biden, and will likely fully mature during Trump’s second term. The 'rebalance' always included a basic tradeoff: The United States would de-emphasize its commitments in the Middle East and Europe in favor of a reallocation of forces in Asia and Australia. For nearly to two decades, American officials have extolled their European counterparts to spend more on defense, settling in recent years on asking for an increase in spending to 5 percent of GDP (with 30 percent of total defense spending allotted for new procurements). This call came after years of disquiet about Europe’s failures to live up to the 2014 NATO agreement in Wales to increase defense spending to 2 percent of total GDP. Europe has been slow to respond but spurred by Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and now the shock of a second Trump administration, the urgency to increase defense spending has increased. This urgency, however, has come with deep concern about the future of European security and whether or not Trump will sell out Europe to Moscow. It also may be impossible for Europe to meet under current fiscal rules. Germany remains hampered by its refusal to alter the debt brake (at least for now), France’s fiscal situation is less than ideal, and the United Kingdom remains mired in the self-induced malaise brought about by Brexit. The 5 percent figure is currently more than the money spent on defense in the United States, so any such increase would entail a longer-term plan for getting there. It would also entail significant changes to Europe’s social contract. It may also be necessary, if European nations want to follow through on their renewed pledges to be more autonomous from the United States. There is also a different option: to agree at the next NATO summit to increase defense spending to 3.5 percent and to try and shape the future of the security of Europe—in cooperation with the Trump administration—in mutually beneficial ways. The increase may not be easy, but it is worth trying. I believe there is still a way out of this crisis, but it requires Europe to follow through and spend more and ask Washington for specific things to enhance regional security. The United States can defend Europe through a smaller presence. Europe can spend more. It is time to think about how to do this. A Straightforward Policy The Trump administration’s Europe policy is remarkably straightforward. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth described it bluntly: The United States is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail … As the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front. Together, we can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and Pacific respectively. The good news is that the administration has told anyone who will listen that it remains committed to the defense of Europe. Hegseth was very clear, telling his counterparts, 'The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop.' However, the shift in US priorities has raised a basic policy problem almost every administration has had to navigate since NATO’s founding: how to reassure European leaders that Washington would fight for European security if a localized conflict did not directly impact American continental security. This is where the Trump administration has fallen woefully short. In a social media post, Trump extolled Europe for 'failing to bring peace' and suggested that 'Ukraine is far more important to Europe than it is to us … We have a big, beautiful ocean as a separation.' This isolationism would suggest America cannot be trusted. This feeling of betrayal is made worse by Trump’s desire for a rapid peace agreement with Russia about Ukraine, which has thus far seen his administration’s talking points tilt towards those from the Kremlin. This incongruity needs to be addressed with better messaging from Washington and can be done in ways that align with Trump’s worldview. A Very Clear World View Trump has had very consistent views on foreign policy. In an interview with Playboy in 1990, Trump (speaking about himself in the third person) was very blunt about his approach towards US adversaries and allies: He [Trump] would believe very strongly in extreme military strength. He wouldn’t trust anyone. He wouldn’t trust the Russians; he wouldn’t trust our allies; he’d have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it. Part of the problem is that we’re defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing … We’re being laughed at around the world. If this sounds familiar, it is because the man hasn’t really changed at all in nearly four decades. He has a very black and white approach to global security, believing that the United States has to have a strong military that is not tasked with defending allies, nor specifically looking to fight adversaries. He also has a healthy aversion to nuclear conflict, telling Playboy and the New York Times, almost three decades apart, virtually the same thing. I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people believing it will never happen because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit. Now, compare to his thoughts in 2016. Look, in the perfect world everybody would agree that nuclear would, you know, be so destructive, and this was always the theory, or was certainly the theory of many. That the power is so enormous that nobody would ever use them … And, you know, we have been under the impression that, well we’ve been, I think it’s misguided somewhat, I’ve always felt this but that nobody would ever use them because of the power. And the first one to use them, I think that would be a very bad thing. And I will tell you, I would very much not want to be the first one to use them, that I can say. Trump is neither articulate, nor diplomatic, but he is very consistent. The basic outline of his foreign policy, therefore, is easy to understand: Trump does not view alliances as additive to US power unless allies can defend themselves; Russia is not to be trusted, but also not to be unnecessarily quarreled with, and nuclear war should be prevented at all costs. However, Trump’s zero-sum approach to diplomacy also provides clear opportunities for European actors. It is naive to suggest Trump’s policy is simply more of the same from America. It is not. His policy vis-a-vis alliances is an anathema to how the US-European defense partnership is currently structured and explains why so many are now concerned about the future of the transatlantic partnership. I understand the anxiety. However, it is important not to fall into the trap of manifesting an outcome that does not need to happen. At their core, Trump and his foreign policy cadre are asking Europe to defend itself with America acting as a backstop to deter, with nuclear weapons, further Russian aggression. Hegseth did not say so directly during his recent trip to the continent but overtly implied it when he said that NATO 'will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on the continent.' This division of labor, it appears, will involve Europe assuming the conventional defense of Europe, with Washington providing nuclear guarantees, along with some elements of continued conventional assets. The question, then, is how to make the US nuclear guarantee more credible, even if such actions could raise the risk of nuclear conflict. The solution is actually a dual-track approach to US-Russian dialogue, of the type favored by Trump, alongside a clear vision of how nuclear guarantees could be additive to the 'division of labor' approach the administration favors. The test case is Ukraine, where the administration is seeking to deploy European troops in the country if an agreement on a ceasefire can be reached with Russia. The Trump administration, however, has refused to specify whether or not any European presence in Ukraine would come with a US security guarantee.Hegseth has said the troops would be deployed outside of the NATO structure and, therefore, not be covered under the Washington Treaty’s mutual defense clause. This could work with some combined European force under the leadership of a European general and be structured in a way similar to the ad-hoc coalitions that Washington has cobbled together for every military endeavor it has launched since the end of the Cold War. However, it appears that both France and the United Kingdom would condition any such deployment on a US security guarantee backed by US platforms based in Poland or Romania. Options for Mutual Defense Ground Forces and Limiting National Caveats The basic outline does provide Europe with a way out of this crisis with Washington. It is absolutely vital for France and the United Kingdom to offer up at least a division of troops to be deployed in Ukraine. Without providing a specific military proposal, Europe may be pushed to the side and only presented with a final outline of requirements by Washington. These troops need to be garrisoned near the front line and have very clear rules of engagement and clear reporting lines. One of the many concerns I have is that a multinational European force will be bogged down by bureaucracy, beset by national caveats and rules about how they can be used, thereby making the force impotent from the start. Somebody needs to be in charge and national caveats about how to use force minimized from the start. This will require a strong European leader and all parties to the European-led force to agree to subordinate national commands to a non-American leader. This will be tough. The Trump administration would be very wise to consider deploying special forces with these European brigades to augment capabilities and, importantly, to train Ukrainian units in the country. Air Support, Space Assets, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance The United States Air Force should also consider deploying aircraft from Lakenheath, England to Poland to support this European force. Europe should be asked to provide tanker support in Poland, thereby allowing for a smaller number of jets to patrol the NATO-Russian border. These jets would also be on-call for Allied troops in contact situations to support European troops in Ukraine. Finally, any European force in Ukraine would be almost entirely dependent on US-provided space assets, as well as unmanned aircraft to monitor the line of contact. These assets should be deployed in support of the European force, ideally based out of Poland (or Germany) and be modeled on the myriads of air operations America and Europe have launched together over the past three decades around the world. This approach should also include a robust role for US contractors, who are critical for the servicing of Ukraine’s armed forces. Air and Missile Defense There is also a role for NATO. The Alliance has provided augmented air and missile defense to Turkey for more than a decade. The deployment of both Patriot and SAMP/T missiles in Turkey was spurred by the Syrian civil war spilling over the border. Bashar al-Assad is now deposed. Ankara now occupies Syria. There is simply no reason to continue to deploy European missile defenses on a border that Ankara now controls. The mission should be repurposed, with NATO providing air and missile defense interceptors in Poland. The combination of these missile interceptors, alongside US and European Air Forces, should spur renewed debate about how best to patrol Ukrainian air space in the event of a ceasefire. The obvious model to pull on would be the multinational air defense of West Germany during the Cold War, complete with a dedicated reporting structure, established air corridors, routes for Allied jets to transit in and out of, and procedures to intercept any aircraft that crossed the line of contact. This all can be done from a hub in Poland, with US support, and in ways that does not require anything more than a slimmed down special forces presence inside Ukraine. A multinational air defense would also obligate the United States to NATO’s territorial defense—a goal Trump and Hegseth have both said they would honor—and help to extend those guarantees across the border into Ukraine. Finally, there is a way to tie the future of European security to Trump’s future policy agenda in ways that could be additive to the settlement of Ukraine. The early warning infrastructure for current and future US missile defenses is deployed throughout Europe. There also are two interceptor sites in Poland and Romania. These facilities are important for the administration’s 'Golden Dome for America' missile defense concept, where Hegseth has said future Pentagon budgets should spend more funds. The Role of Nuclear Weapons The final proposal is a bit more controversial but would also fit with US priorities over the next four years. If the United States is serious about providing nuclear guarantees for Europe without a large troop presence, it should consider soliciting European opinion about deploying more nuclear weapons in Europe. As of now, Washington has approximately 200 gravity bombs stored on five airbases in Europe. The weapons are not really usable in a crisis, and instead, the security of the Alliance is guaranteed by US long-range forces deployed on submarines and in the continental United States. The United States should propose deploying a nuclear armed, ground launched missile for deployment in Europe. The Typhon launcher can carry both the Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles. The Tomahawk could be assigned a modernized nuclear warhead and be deployed in Poland or Germany. The return of more usable nuclear weapons in Europe would have an obvious deterrent effect on Russia and put more 'American skin in the game' without a dramatic increase in troops. The role of nuclear weapons could also raise the stakes of a Russian violation in Ukraine and, ironically, more tightly tether the United States to the future of Europe. The defense of Europe would take on a more pronounced nuclear dimension, ensuring that any conflict that expands beyond Ukraine’s border could 'go nuclear' and therefore risk catastrophic escalation to include strikes on the US homeland. This fear of escalation would require the United States to think about future security on the continent, perhaps assuage some European concerns, and fit with Department of Defense funding priorities. France should consider a once-a-year European-only nuclear exercise modeled on NATO’s annual Steadfast Noon exercise. The basic idea would be to integrate the European Air Forces into a simulated nuclear strike mission. The exercise would obviate the need to deploy French nuclear weapons outside the country (a very unlikely scenario) or undercut the US nuclear guarantee to the continent. NATO agrees every time it rewrites its strategic document that the ultimate security of the Alliance is American nuclear weapons deployed primarily on submarines and inside the United States. The Allies have agreed that French and British nuclear weapons 'have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly' to Alliance security. France has overtly suggested that it is ready to have such a discussion, but too often these calls lead to a fracturing of European opinion rather than a serious debate about the future of nuclear deterrence on the continent. The transatlantic relationship is changing rapidly. It is vitally important to think about how to manage the change so that the Alliance endures and adapts. There is a clear pathway forward to ensure the United States remains engaged, Europe remains protected, and a ceasefire in Ukraine is enforced. There is also a way to do this that advances the European project, continues to roll back Russian revanchism, and works within the quirks of Trumpism. The United States is finishing its pivot to Asia, but it can and should be able to defend the continent with a more pronounced European effort and additive US capabilities.

Judicial Adventurism Can Imperil Democracy – OpEd	The only period of legal authoritarian rule in India was June 1975–March 1977 following the declaration of an Emergency by Prime Minister (PM) Indira Gandhi. I happened to be back in India, based in New Delhi, doing archival and interview research for my PhD. The experience of the overnight transition from a rambunctious democracy to which argumentative Indians had taken with gusto, to a stifling and oppressive rule by state fiat, was deeply and permanently sobering. It led to my first academic article on returning to Canada, ‘The Fate of India’s Parliamentary Democracy’ (1976). Looking back at that now, I expect I would temper my harsh criticisms of PM Gandhi. For in fact the constitutional crisis arose from an Allahabad High Court verdict, confirmed by one Supreme Court justice that was appealed but not heard before the Emergency came into force. She had won a decisive victory in the 1971 general election with 68 percent of seats in parliament. I would now be strongly opposed to the judges vacating a clear verdict on a technicality of violating electoral laws which, if applied across the board, would have led to almost all parliamentarians losing their seats. But my main point in recalling that incident and leading with it is that the issues of constitutionalism and the boundaries between law and politics and the institutions of the judiciary, legislature, and the executive, have preoccupied me for half a century in both their philosophical abstractions and practical applications. Importantly, my opinions have changed in the sense that at the end of the day, I’ve come to believe that politicians and the political process pose less of an institutionalised threat to people’s freedoms, liberties, and speech than unelected, unaccountable, and unsackable judges who often, in the guise of interpreting laws, don’t hesitate to make – and make up – laws. Indeed in India in the end it was the voters who dealt Mrs Gandhi a crushing electoral defeat in 1977 for all the thuggish excesses under the Emergency, but then brought her back decisively in 1980 when they discovered just how incompetent the other lot of rabble-rousers were. Law, Politics, and Norms in International Affairs Human rights courts have become the place where democracies go to die. Law, both within and among nations, is an effort to align power to justice. All justice systems rest on a dynamic interaction between law, politics, and norms. Politics is about power: its location, bases, exercise, effects. Law seeks to tame power and convert it into authority through legitimising principles (e.g. democracy, separation of powers, due process), structures (e.g. legislature, executive, judiciary), and procedures (e.g. elections, trials). Law thereby mediates relations between the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful. No one is above the law in democracies; everyone is subject to the laws that apply without fear or favour to all. But equally, everyone is under the law and law protects everyone. Only when both conditions apply is everyone equal under the law. The greater the gap between power and authority, the closer we are to anarchy, to the law of the jungle where might equals right, and the greater is the legitimacy deficit. Unlike national courts, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) are not embedded in a broader system of democratic policy-making. There are no political checks on them. In a national system, the office of the prosecutor functions within a well-established structure of state governance. In the international system, neither the ICJ nor the ICC was established as part of a centralised system of world government. The ICJ regulates only interstate relations. The ICC has jurisdiction over the nationals of state parties and, in some contested contingencies, can exercise jurisdiction over non-party nationals also. But in doing so it displaces the state as the conduit of democratic representation and provides no alternative mechanism for democratic governance, which has landed it in deep trouble with the Trump administration vis-à-vis Israel. In the idealised conception, the constitution encapsulates and articulates the social purpose of a state. The laws and institutions of state give practical content to the social purpose and work together to that common end. The closest equivalent to a constitution for the international order is the Charter of the United Nations adopted in 1945. But there is no world state whose social purpose can be found in the purposes and principles spelt out in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter. In The United Nations, Peace and Security (Cambridge University Press, 2006), I described the UN as ‘a symbol of an imagined and constructed community of strangers’ (p. 369), but also noted that the Founders’ ‘vision of a world community equal in rights, bound by a common vision and united in action is still to be realised’ (p. 359). The last great reform effort faltered in 2005 in part because of the erosion of the sense of community as the UN membership had almost quadrupled since its creation in 1945 with the addition of almost exclusively non-Western newly decolonised nations. Nor is there a world government with its own legislature and executive. The General Assembly and Security Council are very inadequate equivalents. Moreover, the Security Council, dominated by the five permanent members, is not elected by the Assembly, not answerable to it, and not dismissible by it. The UN does have a secretariat but it doesn’t have its own law enforcement agencies nor its own military force. Instead, it is dependent on member states’ cooperation for these tasks. Nor does the UN have its own elaborate structure of a multi-layered judiciary from lower courts to an apex court exercising civil, criminal, and appellate functions. Comparable, for example, to the Australian constitution which deals with ‘The Judicature’ in Chapter III, Chapter XIV of the Charter does list the ICJ as ‘the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,’ incorporates the court’s Statute as an annex, and describes it as ‘an integral part of the present Charter’ (Article 92). In communist systems, courts are not just an integral part of the structures of state, but an equally integral part of the communist party regime. Independence of the judiciary from the party is incompatible with the organising ideology of communist rule and unimaginable in practice. Thus it is that China’s ICJ judge Xue Hanqin, a vice president of the court, is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and a former director general of the department of treaty and law in China’s foreign ministry. No surprise then that, consistent with Chinese policies, in 2019 she ruled that the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean should be returned by Britain to Mauritius and in 2022 was one of only two judges to dissent from the majority judgment calling on Russia to suspend the invasion of Ukraine. The second dissenting judge was Russian. As for the ICC, why should it have authority over constitutionally legitimated democracies like Australia, Israel, or the US? But if the ICC cannot claim authority over democratic countries, can it fairly claim jurisdiction over non-democracies like China and Russia? At the other end of the spectrum lies the UN Security Council as the sole enforcement arm of international criminal justice should ICJ and ICC decisions be defied or disrespected. Unfortunately, the Security Council’s democratic credentials are exactly zero and its successful resistance to meaningful reforms has greatly eroded its legitimacy. Having multiple layers of national courts and judges means that by the time it gets to the apex court, there is greater distance of the judges from the location, events, time, and passions of the crime. In addition, the apex court’s judges benefit from the facts already elucidated and arguments canvassed and clarified in the lower courts. Australia’s Cardinal Pell was found guilty in a unanimous jury verdict; this was upheld by a two-to-one majority by the Victorian Court of Appeals but overturned in a unanimous High Court judgment. The international system lacks such essential safeguards, with only one ICJ and ICC each. This multiplies the possibility of wrongful verdicts with no recourse to appeal. Law, Politics, and Norms in National Affairs The UN system’s legitimacy deficits notwithstanding, a rules-based international order offers the prospect of normative protection, albeit less than foolproof, for the weak states against the predatory instincts of powerful states. The international rule of law is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for regulating the use of force and levelling the playing field for small and great powers. Domestically, a firmly established rule of law offers more reliable protection for the poor, weak, and marginalised members of society than the discretionary beneficence of an enlightened despot. The gap between the normative structure and power equations exists within nations as well, but to a significantly lesser degree in democratic countries. In apartheid South Africa, judges routinely denied reality staring them in the face to uphold a system of criminal injustice against blacks and Asians. In Canada, courts have succumbed to the pressure of racialised justice and apply what are called Impact of Race and Culture Assessment reports (IRCAs) in sentencing. The justification is that these will help judges better understand how poverty, systemic racism, and discrimination might have influenced and constricted the life choices and trajectory of the convicted offender. In a further subcategorisation of this racialised justice, clients who self-identify as black do not need an endorsement from the court to obtain an IRCA report, but self-identifying members of other racial communities do. In the US it’s generally acknowledged that filling a Supreme Court vacancy is of more long-term consequence than a presidential election. The nomination battles in the Senate are conducted more along ideological lines disguised in the language of legal qualifications of the nominee. The remarkable reliability of predicting the vote of most justices along the conservative-liberal divide on most precedent-setting important cases belies the myth of the impartial majesty of the legal system interpreting and applying independently objective laws. Within Western countries, the reality of mass immigration plus a difference in birth rates between native and immigrant groups means that the Third World has come to the West and diluted the pre-existing social cohesion and cultural community, to the extent that one existed. The contrast with the continuity of cultural cohesion in low-immigration, low-crime, and high-trust Japan that I witnessed firsthand during almost a decade of living in Tokyo is striking. In recent years a clear divide has emerged between the ruling elites and their peoples in the welcoming versus increasingly hostile attitudes towards continuing mass immigration. Not only is the legal clerisy, including lawyers and judges, part of the ruling elite. In addition, it too has been captured by the prevailing nostrums of the centre-left ideology during the long march through the institutions. In Australia, we saw this most clearly in the failed Voice referendum in October 2023 which would have given special recognition to Aboriginal Australians by inserting an entirely new chapter in the constitution. Lawfare and Activist Judiciaries Imperil Democracy Laws simultaneously act as both a licence and a leash. On the one hand, in their permissive function they enable individuals, authorised agents of the state, businesses, and organisations to engage in particular behaviours. On the other hand, in their restrictive function, they set out limits to what the various actors may do, transgressing which puts them beyond the safety of the law. The rights and responsibilities of the different actors as prescribed in law are the bedrock of the rule of law. Constitutional governance and the rule of law in turn are essential underpinnings of democratic politics. There is a corollary. If there is an imbalance between the licence and leash attributes of law, if laws make it either all too easy or impossible for the government to govern, then democracy can end in tyranny, with all or too much power concentrated in the government at the expense of citizen’s liberties; or its opposite, anarchy, with a complete collapse of the functions of government. In recent years I have become increasingly apprehensive at the weaponisation of law to paralyse governments, by human rights lawyers in particular, albeit not exclusively so. An essential component of the democracy project has been to transition nations of people holding power into nations of laws. Law seeks to tame the arbitrary and capricious exercise of power. Democracy seeks to make the holders and wielders of power chosen and dismissible by the citizens and the exercise of power subject to the consent of the people. ‘Judicial romanticism’ is the belief that judicial activism is the solution to all social-political conflicts and ills. It is a conceit of judicial romanticism that law can never be appropriated to serve the ideological worldviews of the juristocracy and in the process frustrate the functioning of democratic politics. Regional and global institutions of justice like the European Court on Human Rights, the ICJ, and the ICC worsen the anti-democratic pathology by not being grounded in local culture and values and physically located at considerable distance from ‘We, the people.’ The end result is that the rule of law is corrupted into the bastard child of a rule by lawyers. Within nations, Western democracies have reached an inflection point on mass immigration. The highly charged issue is proving decisive in shaping electoral outcomes from the US to the UK, Italy, The Netherlands, and Germany. One would think that this should make judges all the more cautious in venturing into the political minefield. Wrong. Pushed by voters to take back control of porous borders, governments are often frustrated by courts that buy activist lawyers’ suits alleging breaches of national, continental, and international human rights laws and conventions. USA Gwythian Prins of the LSE uses the metaphor of Trump as the captain of an ice-bound ship of state who is dynamiting the pack ice with linked and sequenced charges to break free. The shock waves from the explosions are being felt around the world. The Democrats’ weaponisation of the justice system against Trump during the Biden administration was so cynical that in the end it backfired spectacularly and proved more politically damaging to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than to Trump. Having lost the presidency and Senate to the Republicans and failed to win back the House, Democrats have turned to lawfare to frustrate Trump’s voter-mandated second-term agenda. Why? Because the vigorous campaign to disinfect the DC swamp with sunlight is proving fatal to the swamp-dwelling bureaucracy. Trump’s blizzard of executive orders to implement his campaign promises of cutting back on government inefficiency, waste, and corruption have been countered with a flurry of lawsuits from panicked unions and Democrats that have produced some stay orders. The nationwide injunctions could bring Trump’s frenetic implementation schedule of his agenda to a stuttering halt. The institution and practice of national injunctions inevitably encourage forum shopping to lodge a case in a jurisdiction and with a judge likely to be sympathetic to the complaint. Yet there is a legal case to be made, as per a well-cited 2017 article by Samuel L Bray in the Harvard Law Review, that a federal court should give a plaintiff-protective but not a national injunction. The latter is a relatively recent innovation in US jurisprudence: ‘a federal court’s power to issue injunctions is restricted to a specific defendant’s conduct only with respect to a specific plaintiff.’ Another risk is that the injunctions might be playing into a calculated strategy of provoking lawsuits that will clarify the executive’s right to control the bureaucracy, including the so-called independent agencies that have sprawled over the last century and blur the legislative-executive-judicial boundaries. This might prove to be the most effective route to reining in the administrative state. Congress has seeded a veritable forest of regulatory agencies that perform executive and quasi-judicial functions that are free of executive control and judicial oversight, reporting only to Congress. It might be an idea for those attempting to block Trump’s ability to govern through court injunctions to look again at some of the poll findings on what voters liked about Trump: he doesn’t care what others think, says what he means, and does what he says. Vice President J D Vance, who is proving to be an articulate, cogent, and telegenic champion of the Trump agenda, tweeted on 10 February: ‘Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.’ It has had 63 million views. On 9 February, Trump himself commented that judges interfering with the executive’s political agenda was ‘a disgrace:’ ‘No judge should…be allowed to make that kind of a decision’ whereby ‘a president can’t look for fraud and waste and abuse.’When asked directly by an ABC News reporter on 11 February whether he would comply with a judge’s adverse ruling, Trump replied: ‘Well, I always abide by the courts and then I’ll have to appeal it. But then what he’s done is he slowed down the momentum.’ This has produced conniptions among Democrats and their cheerleaders, frothing that Trump is provoking a constitutional crisis. Set aside the memory of Biden openly boasting a year ago that the ‘The Supreme Court blocked’ his student loan debt relief plan ‘but that didn’t stop me.’ Separation of powers means there are limits to the jurisdictional overreach of all three branches, including the judiciary. Who holds the judiciary accountable to its limits? To claim that any reminder to the courts to stay in their judicial lane and not stray into the legislative and executive lanes risks a constitutional crisis, is to make the judiciary the sole arbiter of its own reach and limits, as well as that of the other two branches. Nice job if you can get it. Maybe Trump should launch a campaign to Make America Governable Again. A constitutional cleanup, not a constitutional crisis. UK PM Keir Starmer is already firmly stuck with the public belief that he is operating a two-tier justice system and has become known as Two-Tier Keir. Starmer’s Attorney General Lord Hermer, a human rights barrister colleague and close personal friend, is in a class of his own in the portfolio of cases involving allegations of breaches of international human rights law by the UK. His roll call of clients included the former leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, one of the plotters of the 9/11 attacks, an al-Qaeda chief linked to the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, a willing ISIS bridedemanding the right to return to Britain, and a Pakistani terrorist who plotted to bomb a Manchester shopping centre. Most recently, Hermer is reported as supporting an Oxford don, who backed the claim of Mauritius against the UK in the Chagos Islands case, as the UK’s nominee to the ICJ. Announcing Professor Dapo Akande’s nomination last year, Starmer said he was ‘personally committed to strengthening international rule of law and the institutions that support it.’ Some UK verdicts have been so outrageous as to make one wonder if judges are trolling the public and daring the government to reverse some of their incendiary rulings. Rulings just this month have granted a Gaza family of six right of entry under a family reunion scheme enacted for Ukrainian refugees, as if there are not already enough Jew-hating residents; stopped an Albanian criminal’s deportation because of his ten-year old son’s distaste for foreign chicken nuggets; granted asylum to a woman who, having failed eight times to gain asylum, joined a Biafran terrorist organisation and reapplied because of risks to safety if returned to Nigeria, with the judge acknowledging she’d joined the group solely ‘to create a claim for asylum;’ prevented deportation of a Pakistani man incarcerated for child sex offencesbecause depriving his children of their convicted paedophile Dad would be ‘unduly harsh;’ allowed a convicted paedophile, sentenced to more than five years imprisonment, to stay in Britain because he would face ‘hostility’ if deported back to Zimbabwe; and aborted attempts to deport another convicted paedophile Sri Lankan because, being gay, he could face prosecution in his home country. Europe In a similar vein, Gavin Mortimer argues in The Spectator that the judiciary is fuelling Europe’s immigration crisis. An Italian court ordered 49 migrants who had been sent to Albania after a sea rescue to be brought to Italy, the third judicial frustration in four months of PM Giorgia Meloni’s efforts to curb illegal immigration. A French court overturned the deportation order of a convicted Algerian with two failed attempts to enter illegally. An angry Interior Minister asked: ‘Should our law protect dangerous individuals or protect French society against dangerous individuals’? Germany suffered the death of a police officer in Mannheim in June by an Afghan; the deaths of three people in Solingen in August stabbed by a Syrian asylum seeker; a December car attack on a Magdeburg Christmas Market by a Saudi refugee that killed five people; and a stabbing in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg in January by an Afghan asylum seeker who killed two. Vice President Vance in his remarkable speech on 14 February at the Munich Security Conference, referencing the car attack on a trade union rally in Munich the previous day by a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker who killed a 37-year-old mother and her two-year-old daughter and injured 37 people, asked: How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilisation in a new direction? He received an answer of sorts the very next day. A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker took a knife to a crowd in Villach, a southern Austrian town, killing one 14-year-old boy and wounding five people. The serial attacks associated with refugees and asylum seekers solidify the sentiment that Germany is adrift in uncharted waters. They fuel public support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, one of whose members was convicted last year of incitement to hatred for repeating official statistics showing Afghan migrants are disproportionately likely to commit serious sexual offences. The AfD is routinely castigated as far-right, a descriptor that is fast proving to mean ‘Too Right’ or ‘Totally Right.’ Vance’s meeting with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, in conjunction with his failure to meet one-to-one with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, was deeply symbolic. Optics matter. Vance’s message to the European leaders in the audience, in capitals across Europe, and in Brussels, was: democracy means listening to the people and responding to their concerns. In effect their sniffy reply was: Opinions may vary on that. Australia One of the best examples of the dangers of judicial activism by woke-infected Australian judges is the Love decision. In 2020 Australia’s apex court decided in a 4-3 split verdict that two men, neither of whom was born in Australia or was an Australian citizen but both claimed Australian Aboriginal ancestry, were not aliens and therefore could not be deported as non-citizens for having served over a year each in prison for violent assaults. The majority judges’ reasoning explicitly included Aboriginals’ inalienable connections to the lands and waters of Australia, irrespective of their citizenship status. Any Australian who still believes that the Albanese government has not been influenced by electoral calculations in its kid-glove treatment of anti-Semitism, hate speech, and violence against Jews is ripe for being sold one of the most iconic opera houses in the world, on the steps of which the current wave of soft policing of hate-spewing anti-Semitic protests was first witnessed and the images went viral around the world. How appropriate is it for NSW chief justice Andrew Bell to publicly criticise Elon Musk as the man ‘who attacked the Australian government’s attempts to regulate the flow of misinformation and disinformation?’ As The Australian’s Janet Albrechtsen commented, instead of trying to play the role of chief censor, ‘‘The only person Bell should censor is himself.’ Conclusion Allister Heath, editor of The Sunday Telegraph, wonders just when British democracy gave way to ‘a tyranny of the human rights lawyers.’ The Telegraph itself argued in an editorial on 12 February that judicial overreach has made Britain ‘almost ungovernable.’ It added: ‘Through a series of decisions and unintended consequences reaching back decades, the judiciary of this country has been permitted to consolidate power at the expense of other branches of the state. This must now be wound back.’ When PM Starmer and Opposition Leader Kemi Badenoch both criticised the Gaza family decision as wrong, Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr huffily declared herself to be ‘deeply troubled.’ Their criticisms, she said, were ‘unacceptable’ because any public criticism fails to ‘respect and protect’ judges. Yeah, right. The politicians were not demanding the judge be sacked. Justice Carr is demanding that the two major party leaders self-censor any criticism of judicial decisions inside Parliament. To avoid criticism, judges need to be better educated on the boundary between interpreting laws and dictating policy, or else resign from the bench and run for public office with their own policy platform. It’s the politicised quality of the judgments that is lowering public esteem for the judiciary, not the fact that political leaders are responding to that public disquiet. As this article documents, the problem is far more widespread across the West than just the UK. In the 2019 Reith Lectures, the distinguished former Supreme Court judge Lord Jonathan Sumption issued a warning against ‘law’s expanding empire.’ He’s been sobered by how the European Court of Human Rights has acquired powers well beyond its treaty. In an article for The Law Association of New Zealand on 3 November 2023, he cautioned: ‘We have to have a minimum of fundamental rights in order to function as a democracy. That I accept. But if we place too many rights beyond the reach of democratic choice, then we cease to be a democracy just as surely as if we had no rights at all.’ This article was published at Brownstone Institute. A shorter version of this was published in the Spectator Australia magazine on 22 February.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JsfSmomCUuMz	2025-02-26T17:04:02-08:00	
Yes, Marx Advocated Violence And Political Repression – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed I was recently taken aback by a lengthy piece that I read (very oddly) in the Wall Street Journal. Jacob Berger is a professor of philosophy at Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He authored an article in the WSJ on January 23 entitled 'Why MAGA Folks Should Read Marx,' in which he wrote: '[G]iven the history of murderous communist regimes like Stalin’s Russia, Mao’s China and Pol Pot’s Cambodia, it is tempting to infer that Marx encouraged tyranny. But Marx did not advocate violence or political repression, and he would be appalled by the atrocities committed in his name. He pressed for revolution, but he envisioned that the ideal transition from capitalism to communism would be peaceful and democratic, like the Velvet Revolution that freed Czechoslovakia from Soviet rule in 1989.' The Marx to whom Professor Berger was referring was Karl, not Groucho. So, I read that paragraph again, thinking perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me. Karl Marx 'did not advocate violence or political repression'? That is not my recollection, and I think I’ve read everything the bohemian scribbler ever wrote, whether with pens or crayons. He 'envisioned that the ideal transition from capitalism to communism would be peaceful and democratic'? Did I miss something in all that Marxist stuff I read? Marx called for a 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' Can dictatorship ever be consensual and serene? My good friend and Spectator editor Paul Kengor urges people to read The Communist Manifesto. That’s where Marx and his sugar daddy collaborator Friedrich Engels attacked capitalism and sketched their vision for a socialist/communist future. Paul echoes a famous quip from Ronald Reagan: 'How do you tell if someone is a communist? He’s someone who reads Marx and Lenin. How do you tell an anti-communist? He’s one who understands Marx and Lenin.' What seemed to be unadulterated revisionism in Professor Berger’s article prompted me to take up Paul’s suggestion. I read The Communist Manifesto again for probably the third or fourth painful time. I arrived at the inescapable conclusion that Professor Berger does not understand it. Despite left-wing academia’s frequent embrace of Marx, The Manifesto comes across to a reasonable and thoughtful person as mindboggling nonsense. It’s gobbledygook writ large as if cooked up by nincompoops. It’s the sort of thing one would expect from a witch doctor who misdiagnoses the problem and then prescribes all the wrong medications, who thinks the patient who suffers from a toothache needs his feet removed. The Manifesto consists of one oversimplification after another: Everything, including what and how a person thinks, reduces to the rigid economic 'class' into which he was born. Everybody is either an oppressor or a helpless lump of the oppressed. Life is all about conflict. The book’s generalizations are so sweeping and unsupported as to be ridiculous and meaningless, such as the claim that if you are a male capitalist employer (a 'bourgeois' in Marx’s pejorative terminology), you see your wife as nothing more than 'a mere instrument of production.' At the same time, you and your fellow male capitalist employers 'take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.' People are thus reduced to caricatures and homogenized in the Marxian blender so that no exceptions can corrupt the preconceived stereotypes that serve the Marxian narrative. At one point, Marx and Engels sputter this fatuous bunk: 'But does wage labor create any property for the laborer? Not a bit.' That’s right. 'Not a bit,' the two pseudo-intellectuals proclaim. Nobody anywhere knows of anybody working for wages who owns a thing after they get their paycheck. Nobody has ever seen or heard of a worker who saves and invests, starts a business, or improves his economic condition by accumulating property. Oh, I thought, I’m sure Marx and Engels have footnoted this. I’ll look at the bottom of the page to discover the source of this absurdity… Oops, no footnotes. None! The authors of this spleen-venting screed labeled a 'manifesto' expect you to take their word for it. And you’d better not disagree because, they assert in shameless arrogance, 'The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination.' Let’s return to the paragraph I cited from Professor Berger’s article. He wants us to believe that Marx was a peaceful fellow. In re-reading The Communist Manifesto, I looked for anything indicating Marx opposed violence. I found otherwise—on page after page. Marx despised religion but postured as a prophet. History is marching inevitably toward a communist future in which all government would magically 'wither away' after a period of a socialist 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' He never explained what would prompt anybody with total power to suddenly proclaim of his own volition, 'See you later, I’m outta here.' Did Marx know this by using tarot cards, palm reading, or a Ouija board? Did he read animal entrails? From where did his super-confident knowledge of the future come? Don’t ask me. I don’t believe in witchcraft or soothsaying folderol. But it’s obvious from The Manifesto that Marx (and his pal Engels) saw violence to achieve the communist objective as a given. Consider this paragraph: The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible. Can centralizing all instruments of production in the hands of the State be achieved peacefully? Professor Berger may think so, but Marx did not. Read on: Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production. That’s word salad for 'We’ll have to kick the s— out of a lot of people.' The Manifesto claims that 'the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.' Perhaps Marx somehow saw a future Professor Berger skipping over that, so he reinforced it with this assurance: '[Y]ou reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is just what we intend.' Marx criticizes socialists who do not understand the necessity of revolutionary violence. They naively 'wish to attain their ends by peaceful means' that he says are 'necessarily doomed to failure.' Does this paragraph from The Manifesto make you think of the non-violent Mahatma Gandhi or a maniac with violent proclivities? In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.…They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. The 'forcible overthrow' of not some but 'all existing social conditions.' How could Professor Berger get away with claiming that a man who put his name to such a chilling statement was a peacenik? Perhaps the most famous part of The Manifesto is the list of pithy declarations of what the communists want done—known as the 'Ten Planks' of the document. Are they mere helpful tips for better living, or are they prescriptions for the violence that Professor Berger denies? Let’s look at just a few of them: Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. How is this 'abolition' supposed to happen? Either everybody voluntarily hands over their belongings to the government, or the government shows up with guns and seizes them. The former is children’s fairy tale stuff; the latter is the only realistic option, and it is hardly non-violent. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. Don’t pay your taxes. You’ll find out whether taxes are voluntary contributions or not. You won’t even have to read The Communist Manifesto to discover what Marx intended here. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. How do you keep Mom and Dad from passing stuff on to their kids? Give them a pamphlet explaining why they shouldn’t? Good luck with that. I think you’d better bring guns. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. Nothing to see here. Surely Marx intended for such confiscations to be 'mostly peaceful' at the least. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. Once the government takes over radio, television, the newspapers, the Internet, and every other method by which we convey our thoughts or our bodies, it will allow us to say anything and go anywhere we want. Wake up, Professor Berger. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. When Marxists are in charge, you’re damn well gonna work. It might even be as a peon in some big, conscripted farm army. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.Remember the scene in the 1985 film The Killing Fields, in which Cambodian communists forced city dwellers into the rice patties? They took Marx seriously. He wanted the state to decide where you live and work. Can that possibly be a non-violent exercise? Alas, methinks I belabor the point. Read Paul Kengor’s The Devil and Karl Marx if you need more evidence that Karl Marx was not just a Red Mr. Rogers. Will someone at Lycoming College call out Professor Berger for intellectual malpractice? Maybe some of his fellow academics? I’m not holding my breath. About the author: Lawrence W.

President Trump’s Ukraine Policy: The Art Of The Deal – OpEd	When President Trump was running for election in 2024, he said he’d end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. That hasn’t happened. Lately, he’s called Ukraine President Zelensky a dictator and even blamed him for starting the war with Russia. It seems he’s tilting toward Russia in his attempt to negotiate an end to the war. President Trump wants a personal victory in that dispute, and for him, a victory would be the end of the war. It matters little to him whether the war ends with Russia pulling out and leaving Ukraine with its old boundaries, or with Russia taking full control of Ukraine, or something in between. He isn’t taking Russia’s side, or Ukraine’s side. He wants a win for himself. At least some of his recent negative comments about Ukraine were intended to lower Zelensky’s expectations about the war’s outcome. That’s the art of the deal. Push for a hard bargain that gives negotiators much less than they would expect so that you can make concessions to make everyone feel like they got a good deal. If Putin thinks the war could go on forever, it will put more strain on the Russian economy and cause unrest at home. He may also worry that Russia will have to pull out without gaining land. At the same time, Zelensky may fear that Ukraine could lose all the territory that Russia claims. Because of these concerns, there is a chance for both sides to negotiate a deal that is better than these outcomes. Meanwhile, President Trump wants to declare a victory by seeing the war end, regardless of its outcome. He has repeatedly stated his goal of ending the war and never stated what he thought would be a just outcome. From a foreign policy standpoint, President Trump may be leaning toward Russia to strengthen Russia’s ties to the US and weaken the bond between Russia and China. But that may not be realistic, especially because everyone—including President Trump—knows that four years from now, someone else will be residing in the White House. The big problem with allowing Russia to keep any of the occupied territories is that it sends a message to Putin that he can use the Russian military to take territory from other sovereign nations, but President Trump apparently does not see it this way. The best outcome from the standpoint of global security would be for NATO to agree that Ukraine can never join in exchange for Russia agreeing to Ukraine’s original boundaries. That may be a tough sell, but President Trump, the deal-maker, could make it appear to be a victory for both sides. The bottom line: President Trump wants a deal, and when it happens, he will declare it a victory for himself, regardless of the terms of the deal.

The Gold At Fort Knox Was Stolen From Americans – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken In recent days, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Senator Rand Paul, and some others have pressed for an audit of the US gold reserves, with a special focus on the gold at Fort Knox. This is perfectly reasonable given that the US gold reserves—which are the property of the US Treasury and not the Federal Reserve—have not undergone even a partial audit in at least forty years. Part of the reason for the audit is to discover if any of the gold has been stolen. The US Mint, the government agency that acts as custodian of the gold, has reported for many years that the official size of the gold reserve is 8,133.46 metric tons of gold. Since there has been no audit in so many decades, though, the Mint’s position is essentially 'trust us, bro.' Trusting federal bureaucrats has never been a particularly wise policy, and this is why there are ongoing demands for some sort of transparent audit. If the total size of the US’s gold holdings is revealed to be a number below the official number, then it will just be the latest reminder that there a great many thieves and incompetents among the people running the US federal government. After all, if there is less gold than reported in the US gold reserves, it was presumably stolen at some point. This would be a fitting destiny for the US government’s gold since much of that was stolen to begin with. When I say 'stolen,' I don’t even mean in the sense that 'taxation is theft' and that the US bought the gold using tax dollars. In truth, the way the US Treasury acquired much of its gold hoard is even more underhanded than ordinary taxation. Rather, it is likely that most of the gold at Fort Knox, as with the US regime’s gold in general, is gold stolen from ordinary Americans as a part of Franklin Roosevelt’s efforts to end the gold standard and confiscate private gold holdings in the United States. That is, the US gold reserves are a legacy of the way the US government reneged on its promises to redeem US dollars in gold. Rather than pay out the gold that was owed to holders of US dollars, the US government hoarded it instead. That stolen gold is what the auditors will be counting if the US government ever allows an honest accounting of the Treasury’s gold reserves. Where Did the Gold at Fort Knox Come From? In his 1994 article for The Journal of Economic Education, economist William C. Wood writes that 'the Fort Knox depository is now an artifact of gold standard days.' He then adds, 'The gold currently in Fort Knox came from the melting of Depression-era gold coins, from lend-lease arrangements in War II, and from government operations under the gold standard.' That reference to 'Depression-era gold coins' is telling. Most of those gold coins were likely the coins confiscated from private owners by the US government following Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6102 which outlawed the private ownership of gold. Few Americans owned gold bars, of course, and the gold that was in non-institutional private hands was mostly gold coin. Roosevelt’s edict required that private citizens hand this gold over to the US government in exchange for what was effectively below-market prices. And what if you would rather not give up your property to the US government? Too bad. Moreover, private banks and the central bank held gold in the form of coins for dollar holders who, prior to confiscation, would occasionally present US dollars for redemption in gold. This is, in part, the gold in Fort Knox that that Wood classifies as gold held for 'government operations under the gold standard.' After 1933, however, banks did not need to hold onto any gold coins for this purpose since Roosevelt’s effort to end the gold standard included a prohibition on banks paying out gold. So, these coins ceased to have an immediate market value among banks. Where did all these gold coins end up? Most ended up with the US Treasury after the Treasury seized the Federal Reserve’s gold in 1934. Evidence of this can be found in the nature of the gold that is now held at Fort Knox. Wood further explains that the gold there is not the type of gold usually found in gold bars used for international transactions: 'The gold resulting from melting of coinage has considerably lower quality than the ‘fine’ or ‘good delivery’ gold commonly used in international trade. The majority of the gold in Fort Knox is the lower-quality coin gold.' The legacy of the US regime’s gold theft is not limited to the coins that happened to be in private hands in 1933, however. Much of the gold that is in the US gold reserves today is gold that would have been paid out to the private sector had the US government not reneged in its promises to pay war bonds in gold. The 1934 Default on Gold-Based Liberty Bonds Every time there is a debate over the so-called 'debt ceiling,' various servants of the US regime like Jerome Powell or Janet Yellen claim that 'the United States has never defaulted.' This is a lie. Arguably, it was a default, in the broad sense, when Roosevelt’s regime refused to make good on its obligations to dollar holders under the gold standard. The US also defaulted in a formal and legal sense when it refused to pay its World War I Liberty Bonds in gold as promised. Specifically, in 1934, the United States defaulted on the fourth Liberty Bond. The contracts between debtor and creditor on these bonds was clear. The bonds were to be payable in gold. This presented a big problem for the US, which was facing big debts into the 1930s after the First World War. As described by John Chamberlain: By the time Franklin Roosevelt entered office in 1933, the interest payments alone were draining the treasury of gold; and because the treasury had only $4.2 billion in gold it was obvious there would be no way to pay the principal when it became due in 1938, not to mention meet expenses and other debt obligations. These other debt obligations were substantial. Ever since the 1890s the Treasury had been gold short and had financed this deficit by making new bond issues to attract gold for paying the interest of previous issues. The result was that by 1933 the total debt was $22 billion and the amount of gold needed to pay even the interest on it was soon going to be insufficient. So how did the US government deal with this? Chamberlain notes 'Roosevelt decided to default on the whole of the domestically-held debt by refusing to redeem in gold to Americans.' In other words, thanks to its profligate deficit spending, the US government was running out of gold by the early 1930s. So, the regime defaulted on the gold bonds. The gold that would have passed into private hands was hoarded by the federal government and declared off limits to the public. Much of that gold remains in the US gold reserves today. Defaulting on International Gold Obligations Not all of the US Treasury’s gold is stolen from ordinary Americans. Some is stolen from foreign governments. Another illustration of the dishonesty of the 'we never defaulted' narrative is the fact that the US government defaulted in 1971 on its obligations to foreign government under the Bretton Woods system. That is, rather than pay what was owed to foreign governments, the US government once again decided to steal this gold and simply said 'tough luck' to everyone with a legal claim to the gold. Or, as Treasury Secretary John Connally said at the time, the dollar 'is our currency, but it’s your problem.' US Gold Reserves: A Legacy of Theft and Lies Like most everything else the US government 'owns,' the gold in the US gold reserves is there due to many years of lies, gaslighting, and deception. The gold is there because the US regime defaulted on its debts and reneged on its promises to back dollars in gold. One could argue that the gold stolen from foreign governments was not as egregious in the same way as the gold confiscation of 1933 and 1934. That’s arguably true since the gold 'owned' by foreign central banks was largely founded on defaults and thefts resulting from the abolition of the gold standard in those countries years earlier. Even if this is the case, the fact that Bandit A (the United States government) robbed Bandit B (i.e., foreign governments) that hardly makes Bandit A a hero. If a true auditing team is ever allowed to actually examine the US regime’s gold, it will be examining the evidence of crimes from long ago. The auditors will be counting the gold stolen from our ancestors to enrich the state and its friends.

DOGE’s Dollars To The People – OpEd	President Trump is considering a plan to send 20 percent of the money saved by DOGE back to Americans in the form of household tax refund checks. As the people should know, a similar plan has already been performed in, of all places, California. California Dollars Then In 1987, Gov. George Deukmejian took $1.1 billion in surplus state money and sent rebate checks to taxpayers. The governor was pleased to 'protect this money for the taxpayers' and honor, 'the spending limit enacted by the voters through the initiative process,' a reference to the People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, Proposition 13 on the 1978 ballot. At the time, soaring property taxes burdened working families and threatened to toss the elderly out of their homes. While this was going on, the state enjoyed a budget surplus of $2.5 billion that would rise to more than $7 billion, about half the state budget. Gov. Jerry Brown blasted Proposition 13 as 'a rip-off' but it passed in a landslide, with 65 percent of the vote. Gov. Brown then proclaimed himself a 'born-again tax cutter' and proclaimed support for the measure, which did not 'cut' taxes. The measure only limited the rate at which property taxes could be increased. Proposition 13 mandated no new state spending and required no new state government hires. Even so, politicians and bureaucrats blame the measure for fiscal problems that actually stem from waste and fraud. The People’s Initiative had been in place for more than a decade but did not prevent California from boasting a budget surplus in 1987. That year, Gov. Deukmejian refunded surplus money to the people. The checks were signed by State Controller Gray Davis, elected governor in 1998 and recalled in 2003, giving way to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. No payback to the people occurred under him or any governor since. In 2017, recurring Gov. Jerry Brown branded as 'freeloaders' those who opposed a transportation package that nearly doubled Californians’ gas taxes. So Brown, a three-time presidential candidate, wasn’t a 'born-again tax-cutter' after all. California Dollars Now The administration of Gavin Newsom, elected in 2018, deployed some of the highest income and sales taxes in all 50 states. In the style of Proposition 13, embattled Californians fought back with the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, which gave voters the final approval on future taxes and fees imposed by state and local governments. The measure gathered nearly one million signatures and qualified for the Nov. 5, 2024 ballot, but Gov. Newsom and mentor Jerry Brown teamed up to get it taken off the ballot. Under Gov. Newsom, no money from any budget surplus would be coming back to taxpayers. That leaves government waste as a source for the funds—in the style of the DOGE plan. On this front, California abounds in possibilities. If University of California President Janet Napolitano can hide $175,000,000, as intrepid state auditor Elaine Howle discovered, there could be a lot more left to find. The UC’s vast DEI bureaucracy, which violates the voter-approved California Civil Rights Initiative, is another possible source of funds for the people. California’s vaunted bullet train is well into the billions, with no riders but a Sacramento headquarters and three regional offices. The unelected Coastal Commission rides roughshod over property rights and does nothing to mitigate wildfires. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) does little to mitigate pollution but punishes the workers by ramping up the cost of gasoline. Such counterproductive, unaccountable bureaucracies could form a source of reparations for the people. George Deukmejian, who passed away in 2018, showed that it is possible to return money to the taxpayers who provided the funds in the first place. If Gov. Newsom follows suit, that could slow the exodus of workers and businesses from California and perhaps prompt some to return.

US Shows Interest In Bolstering Ties With Central Asian States	(Eurasia.net) -- When it comes to Eurasia, the Trump administration has acted quickly to reverse the foreign policy of its predecessor, underscored by moves to foster a rapid thaw in relations with Russia. But there is one Biden-era legacy that the Trump State Department seems intent on preserving, an initiative to increase US influence in Central Asia known as the C5+1 format. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the US interest in building up the C5+1 framework during a February 21 talk with Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov of Uzbekistan. According to a State Department spokesperson, Rubio 'discussed continued cooperation, including through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, in support of a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.' The main driver of US interest in Central Asia is the region’s abundant natural resources, not only oil and natural gas, but also minerals and rare earths used in high-tech devices and for clean energy and defense purposes. A geographic consideration may also factor into the US policy calculus: Central Asian states sit on China’s western border, and an avowed aim of Trump’s second term is containing Chinese global economic influence. Rubio in his discussion with his Uzbek counterpart specifically mentioned that 'the United States looks forward to working with Uzbekistan to highlight mutually beneficial opportunities for investment in critical minerals and US civil nuclear energy technologies.' Saidov indicated that Uzbekistan was eager to engage with the United States, describing his conversation with Rubio as 'candid and productive.' In a statement posted on Telegram, he added that Uzbekistan would work to expand bilateral ties 'in all spheres without an exception,' focusing on 'building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions [and] ensuring prosperous development.' Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are considered the lynchpin states within the C5+1 context. Then-secretary of state John Kerry initiated the C5+1 format in 2015. But the Biden administration significantly elevated the framework’s status by convening the first-ever presidential-level summit of C5+1 leaders in 2023. The following year, the Biden administration launched a related initiative, dubbed the B5+1 process, to specifically promote trade and investment. The Rubio-Saidov discussion indicated that the United States will remain committed to backing Uzbek efforts to gain entry to the World Trade Organization. Prior to Trump’s return to the White House, the two countries inked an agreement in December to expand mutual market access. US officials at that time hailed the Uzbek government’s 'significant progress' in opening the country’s economy. The February 21 talks also confirmed that Uzbekistan will work with the United States on the repatriation of illegal Uzbek migrants. Rubio thanked Saidov for Uzbekistan’s 'cooperation in curbing illegal migration.' Seven Uzbek deportees arrived in Tashkent on February 24, Uzbek media reported. The US has reportedly shipped additional Uzbek deportees to Panama and Costa Rica. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan is taking the lead on regional efforts to engage the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Tashkent hopes that by pulling Afghanistan into a closer trade orbit with Central Asia, Uzbek officials and their counterparts from other regional states can increase their negotiating leverage with the Taliban on matters of regional concern, in particular Afghanistan’s construction of the Qosh Tepa canal, a project that could upset Central Asia’s already delicate water resources balance. A high-level Taliban delegation held trade talks in Tashkent on February 22 resulting in agreements covering railroad improvements, the creation of a free trade zone on the Uzbek-Afghan frontier, de-regulation of agricultural exports, mining and oil & gas development and a power transmission line project.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JjJmys_ymek1	2025-02-26T16:50:14-08:00	
The Start Of A US Government Exit From Supporting Coronavirus Sho...	Even people who took one, two, or three experimental coronavirus 'vaccine' shots during the height of the coronavirus scare are saying 'nope' to taking any more 'boosters.' Yet, behind the scenes, the United States government has kept funding companies in the pharmaceutical industry to continue developing new iterations of the unpopular 'vaccines.' This situation may be changing. A new action by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. puts a temporary halt to US support for the development of a pill form of coronavirus 'vaccine.' This could be the start of an exit of the US altogether from aiding coronavirus 'vaccine' development and, possibly, from aiding other drug development as well. Emma Colton provided in a Tuesday Fox News article details regarding how Kennedy 'issued a 90-day stop-work order on Friday related to the HHS contract with American biotech company Vaxart Inc., which is working to develop a new COVID-19 vaccine that can be taken orally.' 'Kennedy and other health officials,' further wrote Colton, are 'set to examine the study’s initial findings over the next 90 days before deciding on next steps.' This pause, Colton notes, prevents Vaxart from invoicing of the US government for 230 million dollars for clinical trials. The US government has been a key participant in the experimental coronavirus shots push. President Donald Trump helped ramp it up with the creation of Operation Warp Speed to develop coronavirus shots and then inject them quickly into as many people as possible. President Joe Biden and politicians on the state and local level also sought to increase 'demand' for the shots by imposing mandates that people take them in order to keep their jobs, enter stores and other locations, or otherwise proceed with their ordinary activities. Kennedy’s initiation of a pause in Vaxart support, as well as his previous action indicating the US government will move from promoting that people take vaccines to encouraging people to exercise informed consent in regard to vaccines, suggest a major shift in US policy is underway. Since Friday, the price of Vaxart stock has been down about 30 percent. While this share price drop likely would have worried prior Health and Human Services secretaries who saw themselves as partners with the pharmaceutical industry, Kennedy seems to have other motivations that involve instead placing emphasis on priorities including advancing the health of Americans and ensuring his department has independence from special interests — including pharmaceutical companies.

Anthropology For Kids And Visual Assembly Are Reimagining Work, E...	These interactive books and events encourage fresh perspectives on long-standing social systems. in adapting to societal change, and mental health issues that can lead to suicide and mass shootings. The challenges associated with inflexible thinking have become more evident post-pandemic. 'While rates of depression, anxiety, and mental health conditions have increased in the general population during this time of rapid change, individuals with greater inflexible thinking have had the most difficulty adapting to our continuously changing environment,' explains Psychiatry Online. No one is insusceptible to cognitive inflexibility. The Society for Personality and Social Psychology theorizes that 'once you've become accustomed to a particular simplification of reality, you will have trouble switching to a new one even when it would be more useful to do so. Switching is hard because it takes effort to reconfigure how to think about a problem.' The works of artist and writer Nika Dubrovsky encourage flexible thinking, particularly in how we perceive firmly established social structures. Her project Anthropology for Kids hopes to inspire young people to think outside the box on subjects like work, jobs, education, food, money, beauty, and art. The importance of this work is underscored by evidence suggesting that efforts to increase cognitive flexibility early in life may have lifelong benefits. Anthropology for Kids's books are inspired by what the website refers to as the 'democratic Soviet children's literature.' This genre, invented in the 1920s, served 'as a means to communicate with the general population in a language that everybody could share.' Anthropology for Kids's books contain spaces for readers to fill with drawings and writings. This is intended to provoke thought on 'questions that every human needs to have an opinion on,' Dubrovsky says. In 1990, Dubrovsky immigrated to the U.S. from Saint Petersburg, Russia. As a migrant in New York and the mother of a young boy, she 'spent a lot of time trying to figure out how the education system works in the U.S. and what education is [in the first place],' she explains. Dubrovsky's late husband, the anthropologist and author David Graeber, helped expand her knowledge of anthropology, which she saw as 'the best possible education for kids, because that's the way to [stop] reproducing all of our patriarchal, Eurocentric ideas about things like family, money, and property.' The spirit of open-ended anthropological inquiry meshed well with Dubrovsky's background in contemporary art, which Walker Art Center's website describes as art that 'reflects the complex issues that shape our diverse, global, and rapidly changing world.' The site adds that 'many contemporary artists explore personal or cultural identity, offer critiques of social and institutional structures, or even attempt to redefine art itself. In the process, they often raise difficult or thought-provoking questions without providing easy answers.' In the early 2000s, Dubrovsky began fusing art with anthropology by creating interactive workbooks for her young son. This evolved into Anthropology for Kids, which also holds workshops where participants are encouraged to work with the project's books as a group. In 2024, MIT Press published Cities Made Differently, the first English-language Anthropology for Kids book. This is the first in a three-book series that also aims to explore new perspectives on museums and artists. An outgrowth of Anthropology for Kids called Visual Assembly emerged during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the U.S. in 2020. The website for the Museum of Care, which honors the legacy of Dubrovsky's late husband, describes Visual Assembly as 'a democratic form of creative collaboration used to reimagine new ways to run and organize our social systems.' While it uses artistic tools, it 'is not only an art project. Mainly it is about a public debate on how to rearrange' social institutions and services like education and health care. A Visual Assembly event in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in February 2025 typifies these experiences: A multigenerational, culturally diverse group of approximately 20 participants sat at a table covered with a map of an imaginary city. Attendees collectively imagined and designed the city they would like to inhabit. Visual Assembly events have been held in locales like Spain, Iceland, Germany, Cuba, New York, and London. 'It's interesting how people from very different backgrounds have similar reactions to the [same] questions,' Dubrovsky notes. 'For example, when people imagine dystopian spaces, [their descriptions] are always poetic, but [when Visual Assembly participants] imagine utopian spaces, they're very practical. They immediately start to think, 'How would we produce our food? Where would we deal with our trash?'' Dubrovsky feels that these commonalities among event participants indicate that people of different cultures and ideologies can build grassroots social spaces together. 'If we just started to provide people with the spaces to think together and share their ideas about how they can do that, maybe [we would discover] that many more people than we think agree with each other. All humans need the same things, like kindergartens, hospitals, and housing. It's interesting to see [similarities in] ideas of what an ideal society [would look like when] we refrain from using [left-versus-right] language and start talking to people just as people. That's what children's literature does, and that's what anthropology has always done because it's trying to figure out the differences between cultures and groups of people. But also it's the belief that everyone is a human being, so we're all fundamentally very similar to each other.'

Apple Strikes Deal With Indonesia, Secures Future Market Access F...	By Tria Dianti A new agreement between Apple Inc. and Indonesia will allow the tech giant to sell the iPhone16 in the country, a senior government official said, resolving a dispute over investment requirements that led Jakarta to ban the model. The deal commits Apple to hundreds of millions of dollars in new investments, said Indonesian Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita. Those include the establishment of a research and development center, integration of Indonesian suppliers into its global manufacturing network, and expansion of education and technology programs. The agreement allows Apple to regain compliance with Indonesia’s Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certification, a rule mandating that foreign tech companies invest in the country in exchange for market access. 'The talks were challenging until the very last 15 minutes,' Agus told reporters in Jakarta on Wednesday. 'But the memorandum of understanding has now been signed electronically on a provisional basis.' For Apple, the agreement represents a win in Southeast Asia’s largest country, where smartphone penetration is rapidly increasing. The iPhone 16 is expected to hit Indonesian stores soon after Apple secures the necessary certification and distribution permits from the government. 'Sales could begin as early as next month,' Agus said, though he declined to provide a specific date. The 2017 regulation requires that 40% of smartphones sold in Indonesia use domestically sourced components. The policy is part of Indonesia’s push to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports. The dispute escalated in late 2024, when Apple failed to meet its previous investment commitments under the regulation, prompting Indonesian regulators to block sales of the iPhone 16. Unlike rivals such as Samsung and Oppo, which have built local assembly plants, Apple had chosen to fulfill its obligations through innovation investments, a strategy that fell short of government expectations. With iPhone sales halted, Apple entered negotiations with the Ministry of Industry, culminating in this agreement, which the government said was a fresh investment cycle rather than a continuation of past obligations. Under the new deal, Apple has pledged U.S. $160 million in hard cash investments and will deepen its supply-chain presence in Indonesia, the industry ministry said in a statement. The company will bring in Luxshare, a key supplier in its global supply network, to invest $150 million in a new manufacturing facility in Batam, an industrial hub near Singapore. The plant will produce AirTag accessories, with Indonesia set to become the supplier for 65% of the global AirTag market. An AirTag is a tracking device that when attached to a user’s belongings, such as keys, helps the user find the item. Apple has also agreed to source AirTag batteries from Indonesian manufacturers, further embedding local suppliers into its ecosystem, the industry ministry said. Additionally, Apple is expanding production in Bandung, where local company Long Harmony will manufacture mesh fabric for AirPods Max, making it an official part of the company’s global supply network. These investments represent a change in Apple’s approach to meeting Indonesia’s local content requirements, moving beyond software and education programs to deeper supply chain involvement. One of the most significant commitments in the agreement is Apple’s decision to establish a research and development center in Indonesia, focused on software innovation, the ministry said. It will be Apple’s first research and development center in Asia and only the second outside the United States, after Brazil. The facility will partner with 15 leading Indonesian universities, including Bandung Institute of Technology and University of Indonesia, and will also be part of the Indonesia Chip Design Collaborative Center (ICDEC), an initiative aimed at strengthening Indonesia’s presence in the semiconductor and chip design industry, it said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5Jg8wE549_9fD	2025-02-26T16:29:42-08:00	
Bosnia’s Defiant Serb Leader Dodik Sentenced To One Year In Priso...	By Laurent Geslin (EurActiv) -- Bosnia's Serb political leader Milorad Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office by a Bosnian court on Wednesday. In defiant remarks to supporters, Dodik responded by vowing to ignore the rulings of the judiciary in Sarajevo – and urging them to do the same. Rarely has Bosnia and Herzegovina’s unity appeared so fragile, nearly 30 years after the signing of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. Dodik, president of Republika Srpska (RS), the Serb entity in the deeply divided country, was ordered to serve one year in prison and banned from public office for six years by a Sarajevo court for defying the decisions of the High Representative, the international official responsible for overseeing the country’s post-war peace agreement. 'They say I am guilty. There is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations. What matters is that you are here,' Dodik told his supporters, who had gathered outside the National Assembly building in Banja Luka, the largest city in Republika Srpska. He had refused to travel to Sarajevo for the verdict, having previously stated that he would reject the court’s ruling 'whatever it may be'. Dobik can lodge an appeal against the verdict, although it remains unclear if he will. Republika Srpska defiance In the summer of 2023, Republika Srpska's National Assembly passed laws refusing to recognise the High Representative’s decisions, barring their publication in the Official Gazette, and preventing their enforcement within the entity. In response, the High Representative introduced amendments to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s criminal code, making non-compliance with his rulings a criminal offence. Ahead of the verdict, thousands of people gathered in Banja Luka, waving banners in support of Republika Srpska and its president: 'Today Dodik, tomorrow all of us', 'Conviction of the president, attack on Republika Srpska', and 'Srpska is our pride, the president is our protector'. On Tuesday, Republika Srpska's National Assembly launched a two-day emergency session in which Serb representatives were instructed to block decision-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina state institutions. Lawmakers are also expected to vote today on resolutions rejecting the verdict and refusing to recognise the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the country’s highest judicial authority. Rising regional tensions A long-time ally of the Kremlin, Dodik has ruled Republika Srpska unchallenged since the mid-2000s and has regularly threatened to push for the Serb entity’s secession. His hardline stance has always been backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who recently denounced what he called 'political attacks' against the RS leader. 'We need stability in the Balkans. This is precisely what President Dodik has ensured over the years: a stable and prosperous Republika Srpska,' Orbán declared on X just over a week ago. According to Bosnian media reports, members of Hungary’s special police forces have arrived in the Serb entity in recent days. Meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has convened a National Security Council meeting in response to the verdict and is expected to travel to Banja Luka later today. Vučić, who is facing growing protests in Serbia, appears keen to seize the moment and use pan-Serb ethnic solidarity as a political lifeline to deflect from intense domestic pressure. A major anti-corruption demonstration is planned for Saturday in Niš, while a general strike has been called for next week.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoWUK23tz2V7	2025-02-26T16:26:04-08:00	
RFE/RL Obtains Copy Of US-Ukraine Minerals Deal	By Ray Furlong and RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has agreed a deal to allow the United States access to its natural resources, a major agreement that comes amid rapid diplomatic efforts to end Russia’s three-year full-scale war against Kyiv. The deal, a copy of which was obtained by RFE/RL, does not address key questions and leaves most details to be provided by a future agreement. It does not contain specific U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand by Kyiv. The agreement also does not specify whether the United States would continue to supply military equipment and ammunition to Ukraine. Key Points No Security Guarantees: The deal supports Ukraine’s pursuit of security assurances but doesn’t provide them Resource Development: Ukraine and the U.S. will jointly develop Ukraine's natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas Reconstruction Fund: A joint fund will receive 50% of Ukraine’s state-owned resource revenues Reinvestment: Fund profits will be reinvested 'at least annually' for Ukraine’s economic recovery Pending Details: Governance and ownership specifics will be negotiated later The text of the deal begins by noting that Washington 'has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion.' But it makes no mention of Washington’s demand for a right to $500 billion in potential revenue from accessing Ukraine’s mineral wealth that was seen in an earlier draft of the deal. This was a point that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly said was unacceptable. No Security Guarantees for Ukraine The agreement does not include firm U.S. security pledges. But it does say that the United States 'supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees.' It also says that Washington 'will maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.' Beyond these general statements, the main body of the agreement concerns the establishment of a jointly owned Reconstruction Investment Fund. Ukraine has agreed to put 50 percent of future revenues from its government-owned natural resources into the fund. It says this relates to mineral wealth, oil, and gas, as well as related revenues from liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and ports. It explicitly states that 'such future sources of revenues do not include the current sources of revenues which are already part of the general budget revenues of Ukraine.' Money from the fund will be reinvested in Ukraine 'at least annually.' Unanswered Questions There are many questions which have not been answered. The agreement states these will be addressed in a future agreement, which working groups will start negotiating 'without delay.' Among these key points is how the joint ownership of the fund will break down, suggesting it may not be a simple 50-50. Details of the fund’s 'governance and operation' are also still to be resolved. The deal states that neither party can 'sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of' any part of the fund without agreement from the other party. In other words, neither side can unilaterally withdraw. The agreement says it is subject to approval by Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, but does not mention Congressional sign off. Ukrainian lawmaker Bohdan Kytsak, from Zelenskyy’s ruling Servant of the People party, told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service that the deal presented potential benefits for the economy. 'This requires a huge number of specialists, scientific research, and the emergence of new technologies,' he said, adding that U.S. investment could create a 'new economy.' A former economic adviser to Zelenskyy, Oleh Ustenko, told RFE/RL that 'symbolism plays a larger role here than financial and economic issues.' For U.S. President Donald Trump this may represent a political win. He has pushed hard for the deal and now he has got it. For Zelenskyy, a scrap awaits over the details. For now, the deal could ease a bitter and public rift that saw Trump brand him a 'dictator.' Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL. He has reported for RFE/RL from the Balkans, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and elsewhere since joining the company in 2014. He previously worked for 17 years for the BBC as a foreign correspondent in Prague and Berlin, and as a roving international reporter across Europe and the former Soviet Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoHs3l1_N3P3	2025-02-26T16:24:30-08:00	
US, Ukraine To Sign Minerals Deal, But Security Issues Unsettled	By Ken Bredemeier President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a deal giving the United States substantial rights to Kyiv’s lucrative rare earth minerals and to compensate Washington for weapons sent to Ukraine to fight Russia’s three-year war of aggression. Trump, at the first Cabinet meeting of his new presidential term, said that Zelenskyy will be at the White House on Friday to sign the pact and for discussions about the state of the war. Trump said the deal 'brings us great wealth,' but said his first goal is to end the war, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians. 'My No. 2 thing is to get paid back,' Trump said of the more than $100 billion in munitions Washington has shipped to Kyiv to support its fighters. 'Without our equipment, that [war] would have been over very quickly,' with Russia overrunning Ukraine. As it is, Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory and has vowed to not give any of it back in a would-be peace settlement. Trump said he expects to eventually reach a deal with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting. Trump initiated talks with Putin about ending the conflict but the first discussions last week between the top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, excluded Ukrainian and European officials. 'Because I got elected, this war is going to come to an end,' Trump declared. He said Putin 'had no intention of settling this. We’re going to have a deal.' But he said Ukraine 'could forget about' joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a peace settlement. In Kyiv, Zelenskyy said at a news conference that the framework for the rare earth mineral deal was complete, but that U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine that the Kyiv government views as vital have yet to be settled. Trump has long expressed skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Ukraine. Last year, he refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war. Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator, without blaming Putin for the invasion. The U.S. leader has said he is particularly peeved that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, agreed to the Ukraine military assistance without any provision that Ukraine would pay back the cost. Biden led the coalition of Western allies in providing the military aid as a way to fight Russian aggression without sending their own troops to fight alongside Ukrainian forces. Zelenskyy says the U.S. military aid was a grant and not a loan that needed to be repaid but now has agreed to the deal for the rare earth minerals needed for manufacturing technology products. Zelenskyy said he expects to have wide-ranging substantive discussions with Trump. 'I want to coordinate with the U.S.,' Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian leader said he wants to know whether the U.S. plans to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for weapons investments and whether Washington plans to lift its economic sanctions on Russian entities and high-level associates and friends of Putin. Elements of the deal Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the country’s public television channel that the agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine. Under terms of the deal, the plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s minerals, oil and gas to create a 'stable and economically prosperous Ukraine' if the war is ended, and half to a U.S.-controlled fund. The New York Times reported the economic agreement includes a line that says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace,' but does not spell out details on what that might entail. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Trump on Wednesday in Washington to spell out a European initiative for a 30,000-person peacekeeping force to enforce a Russian ceasefire with Ukraine if such a truce can be reached, although no peace talks have been scheduled. European leaders have said a peacekeeping force would require an American 'backstop' of military assistance, such as American satellite surveillance, air defense or air force support. Trump has not committed the U.S. to such a plan but on Wednesday called the peacekeeping force 'a good thing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoQJaVzJofTn	2025-02-26T16:22:08-08:00	
Romania Indicts Right-Wing Presidential Hopeful Georgescu	By Marian Chiriac Romanian prosecutors on Wednesday indicted right-wing presidential candidate Calin Georgescu on six charges, including incitement to undermine the constitutional order, spreading false information, and founding an anti-Semitic organisation. Georgescu, a populist politician known for his NATO-sceptic and pro-Russian views, faces ten to 20 years in prison if convicted, and may be barred from May’s re-run presidential election. He was leading in the first round of the initial election last November before it was annulled by the Constitutional Court. Police initially took Georgescu for questioning after stopping him in traffic in Bucharest on Tuesday. 'Calin Georgescu was going to file his new candidacy for the presidency …. The system stopped him in traffic and he was pulled over for questioning at the Prosecutor General’s Office! Where is democracy, where are the partners who must defend democracy?' Georgescu’s communications team posted on Facebook. Dozens of people, including far-right politicians in parliament, protested in front of the General Prosecutor’s Office against what they described as his 'abusive detention' and 'abuse by the totalitarian state'. Earlier, police and prosecutors started searches in 47 sites in an investigation related to a group of 27 people for allegedly 'acting against Romania’s constitutional order', and the 'creation of an organisation which spreads fascist, racist and xenophobic messages'. Around noon on Wednesday, prosecutors announced the confiscation of some 1 million euros and various weapons from people who were searched. Although prosecutors did not name Georgescu or his aides in their statement, shortly after news of the searches broke, Georgescu claimed the raids were aimed at blocking his new presidential bid. Georgescu won the first round of the presidential elections in November, signalling that EU-member Romania was joining the region’s growing trend toward far-right populism. His unexpected success led the Constitutional Court in December to order a re-run of the vote, citing alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state', likely referring to Russia. Georgescu, known for his advocacy of sovereignty and traditional values, has gained support among those disillusioned with the current political landscape. The latest polls say he leads in voting intentions. Romania is to re-run the election on May 4, with a potential run-off scheduled for two weeks later. His cause has also received unexpected support from the Trump administration in the US. US Vice-President JD Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, accused EU leaders of engaging in 'rampant censorship' and 'cancelling elections, as recently occurred in Romania'. Elon Musk amplified these claims on his social media platform, X, where he criticised the annulment of the elections and called the head of Romania’s Constitutional Court a 'tyrant'. Musk also shared content from Georgescu supporters and far-right groups.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5Jv_opjWxq7zn	2025-02-26T16:14:34-08:00	
The Western Media’s Israel-Palestine Double Standard – OpEd	America and Israel’s manipulation of the violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, exaggerating crimes against Israelis or Jews and ignoring those that target Palestinians and Muslims, should anger the entire world, especially the people of the Middle East. Unfortunately, this disparity does not get much attention in either the US or Israel. But the gap between how the two are reported is immorally immense. Last Thursday, explosions destroyed three empty civilian buses in separate car parks in Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. Israeli police immediately called it a terrorist attack. Even though no one was hurt, the nonlethal attacks dominated media reports in America and Israel. Meanwhile, barely reported by any American mainstream media is the daily carnage in Gaza. Israel’s violence in the Strip takes place 24 hours a day, every day, meaning it does not fit the journalistic definition of 'news' — that of being 'new.' Under that cloud is another wave of ongoing violence being carried out by the Israeli security services and armed Jewish settlers against West Bank Palestinians. Little is being reported. It is almost like nothing is taking place. But it is happening. Daily. The day before the attacks on the three empty buses, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported that Israeli forces had killed at least three Palestinians in an attack on a house in the Far’a refugee camp. The mainstream American media ignored this. Had the victims been Israeli, the reporting would likely have been hysterical. B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights watchdog staffed by Jews and Arabs, continues to persevere despite an ongoing campaign of harassment, beatings and bullying by Israeli security forces. It reports on violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Israel itself, but its findings are often ignored. This month, for example, B’Tselem published a report into the events of Dec. 19, 2024. At about 10 a.m. that day, two vehicles with Palestinian license plates drove into the market street, a central thoroughfare in Balata Refugee Camp in Nablus. Local security signaled for the unknown buses to stop and that is when Israeli soldiers emerged from the vehicles and began firing indiscriminately, wounding six people and killing two. Halimah Abu Leil, 80, who was shopping for vegetables in the market, was shot and killed. The Israeli attack lasted more than two hours. Soldiers blocked all attempts to take the injured Palestinians to hospital for treatment. The Israelis entered a nearby home, expelled the family that lived there and used it as a command center. They used one of the family’s daughters, Lara Sawalmeh, as a human shield, stationing her at the front door as they shot at residents from the home’s windows. A neighbor, Qusai Al-Saruji, peeked out of the door of his balcony to check if the raid was over so that he could go to work. He was shot dead, the B’Tselem investigators reported. Even with all that detail confirmed by a highly respected agency, nothing was reported by the Western news reporters who work out of Jerusalem under Israeli government supervision. In another incident last year, Israeli forces went on a campaign of destruction in Tulkarem refugee camp. B’Tselem reported that special forces personnel arrived at the camp at about 12.30 p.m. on Sept. 10 in civilian vehicles with Palestinian license plates. They were later joined by additional military, border police and Shin Bet forces, who brought bulldozers. The purpose? To dig up the streets, smash Palestinian-owned cars parked on the side of the road and block the entrances to homes. The destruction was so widespread it turned much of the area into rubble. As residents returned to their homes on hearing about the raid, the Israeli forces shot at them. Two young Palestinians were killed. They were Ahmad Majdubah, 25, who was trying to close the gate of his family’s car wash to go home, and Hibat Allah ‘Obeid, 21, who stepped out of her house with her mother to see what was happening. Also, in the summer of 2024, Israeli forces repeatedly entered Hebron and injured dozens of Palestinians. B’Tselem volunteers took testimony from 25 of the victims who were abused by Israeli soldiers between May and August last year. They describe acts of violence, humiliation and abuse by Israeli soldiers against men, women, teenagers and children. The victims gave harrowing accounts of physical and psychological abuse, including beatings, whippings, cigarettes being put out on their bodies, blows to their genitals, injections of an unidentified substance, prolonged binding and blindfolding, threats, insults and more. Soldiers appeared to select the victims arbitrarily as they went about their daily lives. In most cases, they were taken away to military facilities, where the worst of the abuse occurred. None of the victims were suspected of or prosecuted for any offense. They were mostly released immediately after being assaulted, with many requiring medical treatment. Only two victims were arrested and both were released without charge within days. Nearly every Palestinian city is being targeted by Israeli forces and Palestinians are being killed every week. But where are the media reports? These incidents are ignored. Why? Because terrorism against Palestinians is not considered news by the mainstream Western news media and many Western reporters are forced to work under the confines of Israeli government censorship. They lack the courage to speak out against the inhumanity occurring right before their eyes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JvZTyabhfd6j	2025-02-26T16:11:11-08:00	
Syria After Assad: Addressing Chemical Weapons And Accountability...	By Shravishtha Ajaykumar Despite a Sunni majority in Syria, the Assad regime has managed to maintain its dominance through a combination of autocratic and kleptocratic rule, using patronage to secure loyalty. On 8 December 2024, following a 10-day uprising, Bashar al-Assad, son of Hafez al-Assad, was brought down along with the entire Assad Regime. The Syrian Civil War has highlighted the human tragedy and the failure of many international conventions aimed at preventing the use of banned weapons, including chemical warfare. Despite global prohibitions and condemnation, several Syrian actors have been known to deploy these weapons against protestors and civilians on multiple occasions. With the formation of a new Syrian government, the issue of chemical weapons has assumed a renewed urgency in making Syria a state free of such weapons. Bashar al-Assad's regime and chemical warfare Chemical warfare has seen use across multiple incidents of warfare throughout history. During World War I, several countries employed chlorine and mustard gases, resulting in at least 1.3 million people being affected and the death of over 90,000 people. The tragedies of the War led to many negotiations around the use and disuse of chemical weapons, leading to the formation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1993, officiating an agreement aimed at the cessation of the use of chemical weapons, and the elimination of their resurfacing. Nevertheless, between 1993 and 2020, there have been over 300 cases of chemical weapons use. One such prominent case was the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong Nam, allegedly ordered by his cousin and North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un, and the 2018 assassination of Sergei Skripal, allegedly by the Russian State. Key incidents of chemical weapon use The Syrian civil war also sought to disillusion the world on the mitigation of such atrocities. As the Syrian opposition started gaining ground, the Assad regime threatened and terrified of losing power, resorted to using chemical weapons to preserve its authority and control the dissidents. In particular, sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas were used indiscriminately against military and civilian infrastructures. There have been 13 isolated attacks in Syria attributed to different actors from 2013 to 2020. Table 1: Alleged Cases of Chemical Weapon Use in Syria 2013-2020 DateAlleged PerpetratorInjured/Affected3/23/2019Unknown2111/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1011/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1111/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1111/11/2016Free Syrian Army2411/3/2016Ansar al-Din Front, Authenticity and Development Front, Nur-al-Din al-Zinki Movement2910/30/2016Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusrah Front, Free Syrian Army358/16/2016Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)58/2/2016Nur-al-Din al-Zinki Movement204/7/2016Ahrar al-Sham, Free Syrian Army, Jaysh al-Islam (Syria)298/21/2015Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)244/11/2014Al-Nusrah Front1013/19/2013Unknown130Source: Global Terrorism Database Three cases of chemical weapons in civilian areas have left a global impact. The first major chemical weapons attack in the Syrian Civil War took place during the Ghouta attack in 2013. Rockets armed with sarin gas were shot from the early morning hours into rebel-controlled sectors of Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, resulting in the death of 1500 people. The Ghouta attack shocked the international community, as it represented a clear violation of the CWC and raised alarms about the regime’s willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Although Assad’s regime denied responsibility, alleging that insurgents were responsible for the attack, growing evidence from the United Nations (UN) investigators suggested that Assad’s forces perpetrated the crime. In 2017, sarin was also found in Khan Shaykhun, where another rebel stronghold was bombed, killing over 80 people, including children. Responding to that attack, the US conducted missile strikes, launching 59 tomahawk missiles on the assumed origin of the chemical attack, the Shayrat Airbase. Notwithstanding the US actions and the international community’s condemnation, the resolution was not adopted by the UN Security Council due to Russia’s use of Veto, where the Assad regime appeared unaffected, continuing its use of chemical weapons in later incidents. In 2018, a chlorine gas assault in the city of Douma, Eastern Ghouta district, killed 42 individuals in a civilian area in an attempt to target a rebel base. The Syrian regime had been trying to achieve a recapture of the region, and the chemical attack took place as a prelude to a concerted effort to annex the territory. The attack was deployed amid an evacuation agreement, impacting civilians who were attempting to leave an area under attack. The international community, including the United States (US), France, and the United Kingdom (UK), condemned the attack, accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) dispatched a fact-finding mission (FFM) to examine the incident. Following that rebuke, the US, UK, and France conducted airstrikes against facilities that they alleged were associated with the Syrian chemical weapons effort. Despite the retaliatory strikes, the Assad regime, while denying liability for the attack, instead attributed it to the rebels, and the airstrikes again failed to interrupt the regime's activities. The end of the Assad regime, accountability, and enforcement Despite such numerous reports, investigations, and condemnations, including those by the UN and OPCW, Assad's government faced little consequence for its actions. Efforts to hold the Assad regime accountable was met with significant challenges, including the consistent opposing positions from allied nations such as Russia, which repeatedly vetoed proposed actions in the United Nations Security Council. While the regime's fall may be considered a geopolitical win, it does not negate the need to hold defence forces accountable for war crimes that particularly used chemical weapons against civilians. The non-enforcement of the CWC and the resistance to international retaliation have revealed the flaws in the fundamentals of the CWC and other international conventions. The voluntary nature and lack of enforcement rules in such frameworks make them little more than symbolic gestures, failing to translate into meaningful action or real accountability. The Syrian case conveys that international legal frameworks should be established and actively enforced through attribution and accountability globally, and domestically. Despite the end of the Assad Regime, Syria still contains stockpiles of chemical weapons and now must clear them to ensure such weapon use is not seen in the future. The CWC must be strengthened, and its enforcement must be redefined to prevent future tragedies. First, increasing the attribution of chemical attacks is essential. Investigative bodies like the OPCW must be better equipped to gather irrefutable evidence and ensure that perpetrators are identified; sub-committees like the FFM and JIM (Joint investigative mechanisms) must perform regular check-ins, especially in the trade and access of materials that help formulate chemical weapons and ensure accountability in not just the case of use, but also in the supply chains routed to those using chemical weapons. In addition to the control and monitoring of chemicals, the removal and control of the infrastructure for manufacturing chemical weapons is equally important. Those suspected of resuming or resurrecting their production must be under the international community’s immediate radar while invoking sanctions. Countries that are behind procurers of iodine strokes, much like in the situation of Syria with Iran and Russia, should face diplomatic, financial, and judicial repercussions. Strengthening the CWC’s attribution, accountability, and international cooperation mechanisms are vital in holding perpetrators accountable and deterring future violations. As Syria recovers from the Assad regime, the international community must prioritise the destruction of its remaining chemical weapons stockpiles. Only through robust monitoring, stricter controls on chemical precursors, and a unified global response can we prevent further atrocities and guarantee that chemical weapons will never again be used as a tool of war.

Rare Earth Minerals Front And Center In The Push For Peace In Ukr...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- A few weeks ago, rare earth elements, critical minerals, and other natural resources seemed like just one more factor in efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine. Now they are front and center, a dominant focus of U.S. talks with Kyiv and a prominent vein of the intensifying diplomacy that also involves Moscow, the European Union, and others as Russia's full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. There were strong indications on February 25 that an agreement on a framework deal had been reached and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be in Washington later this week to sign it. The deal would cover the joint development of Ukraine’s critical minerals and other natural resources, such as oil and gas, according to multiple news reports quoting unidentified sources in the Ukrainian government. The reports said the agreement was a framework for a broad economic deal that would include the exploitation of rare earth minerals. It was not immediately clear whether the agreement carries any specific U.S. security guarantees or if Washington has committed to sending additional military aid, Reuters reported. But one Ukrainian government official quoted by the Associated Press said that Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs. There was no formal confirmation from the U.S. side, but President Donald Trump said Zelenskyy wants to come to Washington to sign the deal. 'I hear that. I hear that he's coming on Friday,' Trump told reporters at the White House, adding that Zelenskyy 'would like to sign it together with me' and the deal on had been 'pretty much negotiated.' Bloomberg reported earlier that Ukraine’s cabinet is expected to recommend on February 26 that the deal be signed, and AFP quoted a senior Ukrainian official as saying the government was 'working on the details' and 'considering a visit to Washington for Friday to sign the agreement.' Reuters cited two sources it did not identify as saying Zelenskyy plans to travel to Washington on February 28 to meet with Trump. The Financial Times cited Ukrainian officials as saying Kyiv is now ready to sign the agreement after the United States 'dropped demands for a right to $500 billion in potential revenue from exploiting the resources.' It said the draft deal did not include specific U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s assault, which had been one of Kyiv’s complaints about previous versions. The reports of agreement on the terms came less than a month after Trump said on February 3 that his administration was 'looking to a do a deal with Ukraine to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things.' His remarks sketched the bare outlines of a trade-off: U.S. aid, including the tens of billions of dollars in mostly military support that Washington has already provided, in exchange for access to critical minerals. Since then, wrangling over a potential deal played into discussions at the February 14-16 Munich Security Conference and a starkly public exchange of criticism between Trump and Zelenskyy, who said he had rejected an initial U.S. proposal due in part to a lack of concrete security guarantees. Trump Expecting Zelenskyy To Sign Mineral Deal The White House redoubled its efforts to reach a deal with Kyiv in the wake of those developments, and on February 24 Trump said he expects Zelenskyy to come to Washington to sign an agreement sometime in the next two weeks. Earlier that day, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said in a post on X that talks on the deal were in their 'final stages' and 'nearly all key details [have been] finalized.' Hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly added a new element to the transatlantic discussions about critical minerals in what looked like a bid to complicate the path toward a U.S.-Ukraine agreement. He chaired a high-level government meeting on rare earth metals and offered the United States a chance at joint exploration of Russia's own deposits, adding: 'We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasize, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine.' Putin spoke after Trump hailed the possibilities for close U.S.-Russian economic cooperation in the event of a peace deal. He touched on a sensitive issue that is at the heart of his war against Ukraine and is likely to be a major bone of contention as efforts to end the war proceed, saying potential rare earth exploration deals could include deposits in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, in the resource-rich region known as the Donbas. On February 23, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko told a news conference that 'about $350 billion worth of these useful critical materials' are in Russian-occupied territory. At 3.8 million metric tons, Russia's rare earth reserves are the fifth-largest in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The main Russian rare earth mining and production companies have been nationalized since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and are now controlled by Rosatom, the state nuclear company, which has strong ties with close Putin associate Mikhail Kovalchuk, RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit, Systema, reported on February 25. Rare earths are a class of more than about 17 minerals -- among them yttrium, cerium, and lanthanum -- that are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's surface. They're in increasing demand because of their use in products such as batteries, computers, smart phones, magnets, electric cars, and high-tech weaponry. What Are Ukraine's Mineral Resources? Ukraine says it has reserves of half the 50 minerals the United States deems 'critical to the U.S. economy and national security' -- a broader category that includes lithium and titanium, among others -- and of more common mineral resources such as coal, iron ore, oil, and gas. U.S. officials have said that the minerals deal would enhance Ukraine's security because the United States would want to protect its interests, but Zelenskyy has stressed that Kyiv needs strong and reliable security guarantees in the event of a cease-fire or peace deal. In addition to concerns about security guarantees, the amounts the United States has mentioned have also caused consternation in Kyiv. Trump said earlier this month that he wanted 'the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earths,' and a new draft proposed by Washington after the rejection initially called for Ukraine to contribute to a U.S.-held fund until it reached that amount. Zelenskyy has pointed out that American wartime aid so far has been far below $500 billion and that much of the money has gone to U.S. weapons producers. As of September, Congress had appropriated $174.2 billion in emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine-related purposes, with 64 percent of that going to the Defense Department and defense-related accounts, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Financial Times said it had seen the 'final version' of the agreement, which it said was dated February 24 and did not include a demand for $500 billion. The deal would 'establish a fund into which Ukraine would contribute 50 percent of proceeds from the ‘future monetization’ of state-owned mineral resources, including oil and gas, and associated logistics,' the newspaper reported, and the fund would 'invest in projects in Ukraine.' According to the newspaper, the deal excludes mineral resources that already contribute to Ukrainian state coffers, 'meaning it would not cover the existing activities of Naftogaz or Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest gas and oil producers.' While the draft includes no specific security guarantees, AFP quoted a 'senior Ukrainian source' as saying 'there is a general clause that says America will invest in a stable and prosperous sovereign Ukraine, that it works for a lasting peace, and that America supports efforts to guarantee security.' Existing EU-Ukraine Memorandum Amid tension between the United States and the EU over Russia and the war in Ukraine, meanwhile, the news agency AFP reported that an EU official said the bloc had proposed a separate deal between the EU and Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen on February 24, the third anniversary of the start of the full-scale invasion.'Twenty-one of the 30 critical materials Europe needs can be provided by Ukraine in a win-win partnership,' AFP quoted the European commissioner for industrial strategy, Stephane Sejourne, as saying. 'The added value Europe offers is that we will never demand a deal that's not mutually beneficial.' However, European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said on February 25 that there was 'no proposal' from the EU, adding the bloc has had a partnership with Ukraine on critical minerals since a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2021.Von der Leyen 'reaffirmed [a] commitment to implement this memorandum of understanding and accelerate the work to strengthen our mutual benefit partnership,' he said. 'As you see, this is really here about cooperation with Ukraine and not about any sort of competition with the United States.'Speaking to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity, a senior EU official said he would be 'surprised' if Von der Leyen and the European Commission 'would want to challenge the U.S. on this.'

Exploring Ancient Understandings Of Meteorites In Archaic Societi...	Five times a day, approximately one-fourth of the world's population turns toward Mecca to bow their heads in prayer. The Kaaba at the center of this global genuflection has a cornerstone that some speculate is a meteor. Meteoritic artifacts appear as early as the dawn of Egypt's Early Dynastic Period, approximately 4,500 years ago. Archaeological teams in the 1920s reported that beads from the Gerzeh cemetery in northern Egypt had very high concentrations of nickel, typical of meteoritic iron. These are the earliest analyzed artifacts, and modern metal testing technologies mean that chemists can now identify and catalog the presence of meteoritic iron in archaeological collections across Eurasia. Since 2013, this has led to many discoveries reframing the prominence of extraterrestrial resources in the archaeological record, including identifying that King Tutankhamun's dagger was crafted from a meteor. Experts believe this opulent weapon was a gift to the boy king's grandfather Amenhotep III around 1300 BCE, from the king of the Mitanni region, based on the Amarna tablets. This high-status gift is one of the many ways meteoritic iron was revered by ancient civilizations. One of the earliest Egyptian hieroglyphics for iron seems to be derived from a longer phrase translating to: 'iron from the sky.' This word has cosmological connotations associated with the Egyptian belief that the sky was an iron pot or tub filled with water, and bits of it fell to the Earth in the form of meteorites. 'We have evidence for the idea that the sky was a dome made of iron in a few different civilizations,' explains Victoria Almansa-Villatoro, the Egyptologist who analyzed the hieroglyphic for iron (and sky), during an interview. 'If all of these civilizations had this idea and they are so spread apart, it is possible that the idea goes way back in time, maybe before writing was invented.' Almansa-Villatoro emphasizes tracing any common meanings or beliefs linking such cultures is purely speculation. Contemporaneously to the Mitanni, it is believed the Hittites used meteoritic iron by 3,000 to 2,000 BCE as one iron dagger excavated in Alaca Höyük in modern-day Turkey was made from a meteor and dated to 2,500 BCE. Iron pendants from Umm el-Marra in Syria and an iron axe from Ugarit in Lebanon are other key examples of hammered meteoritic iron. The process of working with meteoritic iron is much simpler than having to reduce the impurities out of terrestrial iron ore (because meteoritic iron is already a metal). All that needs to be done is hammering the material. This key difference is why meteoritic iron appears well before terrestrial iron and even before the beginning of the Bronze Age, which varies by region but is approximately from 3,000 to 1,200 BCE. The Gerzeh beads and King Tutankhamun's dagger were hammered cold or hot, similar to early gold and copper processing. Smelting out impurities from terrestrial iron demarcates the start of the Iron Age because Bronze Age furnaces were not hot enough for such a complex process. The dawn of this development is between 1,200 and 600 BCE depending on the region. How early metallurgists started working with iron ore is still being actively explored by experts. Even though the melting of copper is much simpler than iron production, it may have played a role in the development of iron reduction. 'Copper slags have a lot of iron oxide, and if your furnace reduces too much you will get a small amount of iron in your slag,' explains geochemist and metallurgist Albert Jambon, Sorbonne University, during an interview. 'Maybe the first people were working with slags, but to go from slag to an ore, I just don't know.' Slag is the waste from metal processing, and it is a good and readily available source of data in the archaeological record. Jambon devised a chemical strategy for identifying meteoritic iron by studying the ratios of nickel to iron and copper in artifacts. It seems that all the iron artifacts from the Bronze Age came from outer space, but research published in 2025 identified that three of 26 iron artifacts were meteoritic. These artifacts were found in an early Iron Age cemetery of the Lusatian culture in modern-day Poland. Oddly, these artifacts were not found with any wealthy implements in what seemed like graves of 'commoners,' a stark contrast to how meteoritic iron was valued during earlier historic periods. Even though approximately 17,000 meteors weighing more than 50 grams hit Earth each year, most are made of stone. Only about 4 percent are composed of iron alloys with abnormal nickel content that people can use. These materials became a rare commodity for ancient people, who began valuing this easy-made iron above gold. Cuneiform tablets found at the Old Assyrian Colonial site of Kültepe-Kanesh in Turkey from approximately 4,000 years ago refer to a 'sky metal' that cost as much as 40 times the price of silver. Silver was the most valuable common precious metal in the region at the time. Assur, the capital of the Old Assyrian city-state, felt that the meteoritic iron needed to be taxed, which makes Jan Gerrit Dercksen of Leiden University think that it was common enough to be included in the system of trade tariffs. In Anatolia, not every merchant could afford to trade meteoritic iron, and it seems that groups of merchants combined their funds to buy this sky metal in bulk according to Dercksen. There was a smaller source of meteoritic iron coming from the East into Assur, but it is difficult to identify where the trade originated. Jambon has struggled to identify more meteoritic iron artifacts farther East, but it has been difficult to obtain and test artifacts from Turkey. As for Iran, there are very few iron artifacts and they don't appear well into the Iron Age. This as well as the context in which most Bronze Age meteoritic iron was found suggests that its rarity in part made it a highly valued commodity. This changed with the Iron Age, while meteoritic iron remained rare, terrestrial iron became more common and the early Iron Age cemetery site in Poland is the only identified site where meteoritic iron was found alongside terrestrial iron. It is unclear how much meteoritic iron was used as the number of iron artifacts exploded in the archaeological record. 'There are two possibilities: either there was so little meteoritic iron [artifacts] that it looks like there was no meteoritic iron or the second possibility [is], the price of iron sank so much cheaper than copper,' explains Jambon. 'People didn't care anymore about meteoritic iron because iron was so common it was no longer fashionable.' The Sky is Falling There is evidence globally that meteors have carried importance across millennia, including the Western Hemisphere. Archaeologists in Arizona found the Winona meteorite inset in what was assumed to be a ritual cyst in a pre-Columbian settlement. The Clackamas tribe in Oregon have a rich oral tradition and a range of ceremonies surrounding the Willamette meteor, the largest meteor found in North America. Just like the ancient Egyptians, the Hopewell tribe made beads out of meteoritic iron brought from more than 400 miles away as well as adzes and earspools. In the 1500s, Indigenous guides brought Spanish soldiers to a field of at least 26 impact craters 500 miles north of Buenos Aires that they called Piguem Nonraltá. The Spanish translated this to Campo del Cielo—'field of the sky.' The Spanish soldiers claimed they saw a huge slab of iron but couldn't believe the local stories that it had fallen from the sky. The meteor shower occurred approximately 4,500 years ago and was recorded by the local cultures as a great catastrophe. Spanish records indicate that the Indigenous tribes made weapons from the iron, but none have been preserved or identified. This field is home to some of the world's largest meteorite fragments including the 30-ton Gancedo fragment found in 2016. A meteorite currently in the Academy of Sciences of Munich struck Zanzibar in the middle of the 19th century only to be revered by the Wanika tribe until a Maasai cattle raid made them lose respect for it. They promptly sold it to German missionaries. Prehistoric stone tools also developed a type of lore as good luck charms in different periods and regions due to different cultic traditions largely associated with cosmological concepts. Tuvan reindeer herders in northern Mongolia continue to collect prehistoric stone tools for good luck and call them 'sky stones.' Obsidian and flint tools of the Neolithic and Paleolithic in both classical Greek and Roman periods were called 'lightning stones' because they looked like weapons and were associated with the lightning bolt weapons of Zeus. It was recorded as late as the 20th century in Italy that Neolithic flints were treated as amulets to protect against lightning and natural disasters. It is speculated that people didn't associate these tools or lightning stones as man-made from an earlier period. Scholar Christopher A. Faraone writes that there is 'no evidence that the Greeks or Romans realized that these axe-heads were manufactured by previous stone-age cultures and indeed the inclusion of them in [natural history and geology books] confirms... that they were believed to be 'natural' stones which, like amber, jet or coral, had special protective powers.' The historical depth and meaningful associations people have historically placed on meteoritic iron are more fully illustrated by the tale of a 1,000-year-old Buddha statue, made by the Bon culture in Tibet. A Nazi expedition looted the statue weighing just more than 10 kilograms between 1938 and 1939 not knowing that it was made out of meteoritic iron. Indiana Jones wasn't there to rescue the statue, and it disappeared for decades. The statue reappeared in the hands of a private collector, who collaborated with researchers and determined its extraterrestrial composition and landing spot on Earth. They determined it came from the Chinga meteor which landed 10,000 to 20,000 years ago in southern Siberia, likely traveling thousands of kilometers in its journey to Tibet. While the space-born Buddha is one of the most unique and intricate objects crafted from a meteor, the oldest meteoritic artifacts found east of the Levant are weapons from China's Shang Dynasty, dating to 1,400 BCE. A knife and a pole-mounted dagger-axecalled ge from 900-800 BCE were also made from meteoritic iron. Baetyls Meteors are part of many myths and stories around the globe, but one of the most interesting correlations between meteors and sacred sites is found in southwest Eurasia and the Mediterranean region. Baetyls are an ancient tradition of using sacred stones thought to be meteorites or based on meteorites. The etymological origin of the word translates to 'house of god.' Thought to originally refer to open-air sites of worship from the original Semitic term, depictions across cultures and civilizations, however, all show hewn stones at the center of god's house that some speculate are meteorites. The word baetyl itself is now used to refer to these revered stones. In Agia Eirini, Cyprus, more than 2,000 terracotta figurines were found surrounding and facing a cultic stone on an altar. This miniature terracotta army was surrounding a round-shaped small boulder that appears contextually to have been treated as a sacred baetyl. Baetyls were known to be in the Phoenician cities of Byblos and Tyre and were adopted by Greek tradition in Delphi at the Temple of Apollo and the Needle of Aphrodite in Paphos. The origin of the baetyl at Tyre may be related to accounts from the Phoenician writer, Sanchuniathon, that the goddess Astarte found a stone fallen from the sky, which she took to Tyre to worship in a shrine. It is even speculated that the cultic practices around meteors played a role in the founding of Rome. Rome had a sacred black stone and shrine like a baetyl called the Lapis Niger, which was believed to have been derived from preexisting cultic worship practices. According to the Roman Grammarian and teacher Marcus Verrius Flaccus, the Lapis Niger marks a spot of ill omen and was intended to be the mythical founder Romulus's burial spot but was, in fact, not used as such. Excavations under Giacomo Boni at the Roman Forum in 1899 uncovered what was dubbed the Lapis Niger and the tomb of Romulus. This was something of a misnomer because it is unclear whether he actually found this site or if the accounts were accurate in the first place. The archaeological journal volume about his excavations from 1903 suggested that the polished black stone on the Lapis Niger that Flaccus saw could have been a meteorite, but the excavations from 1899 only seemed to have uncovered copies influenced by the Lapis Niger. Etruscan grave markersfrom a major necropolis in Cerveteri have similar black stones to that of the Lapis Niger. There are several textual references to sacred stones from the sky in Greco-Roman sources that experts believe are meteor fragments. The religious historian Mircea Eliade even asserted that important holy sites, including the Palladion of Troy, the Artemis of Ephesus, and the Cone of Elagabalus in Emesa, were actually based on meteorites. There is no physical evidence supporting the origin stories of these shrines and the historical speculations surrounding them—no excavated or identified baetyl was a meteor. Other descriptions of baetyls are regularly just rock or even simply mounds of earth. The same stands true for the Egyptian Benben stone—a black pyramidal stone thought to either be on top of a pyramid or influence the pyramids in ancient Egypt. Benben has become a generic term for the top cornerstone of a pyramid or obelisk, but it is derived from a revered one mentioned repeatedly in Egyptian texts. The original was venerated at the 'Mansion of the Phoenix' within the Great Sun Temple of Heliopolis but likely predates the sun cult of Ra. It is linked to the creation story of Atum, one of the oldest Egyptian deities. The Benben is either the hill he rises out of the waters from or what he falls out of the sky on (remember the Egyptian sky being an iron tub of water). But Atum is credited with and linked to many cosmological symbols. Just like the Black Stone of the Kaaba in Mecca, it is still not scientifically conclusive whether or not any revered stones recorded in historical documents are meteors. It is speculated there are cultic, pre-Abrahamic items of worship inside the Kaaba Similarly, any potential meteor worship in the Greco-Roman pantheons could have been derived from earlier traditions, like how Atum's Benben predated the Sun God Ra. Although the Black Stone, or al-Hajar al-Aswad in Arabic, makes appearances during the lifetime of Abraham and Muhammad, it supposedly fell to Earth when Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden. It landed where they were to build the first temple, and it was placed into the Kaaba by the Prophet Muhammad in 605 CE. According to tradition, the Black Stone was originally white but turned black as it absorbed the sin of the hajis who touched it at Mecca. Islamic tradition is the only source of information on the origin of al-Hajar al-Aswad. In the oldest known epic poem from Mesopotamia, the titular protagonist Gilgamesh dreams of a meteor landing outside the ancient city of Uruk that he is unable to move. This dream has prophetic meaning for the rest of the epic, putting meteors front and center in one of the oldest pieces of literature. Philosophers of the Greco-Roman period were some of the first known to record rocks falling from the sky. Aristotle, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder, to name a few, were the first to record a meteor fall in Turkey around either 467 or 466 BC. Meanwhile, the community of European scientists debated the existence of meteors until the early 19th century; a meteor shower in France in 1803 ended the debate. The uncertainty of textual references can hopefully be proved by the archaeological record. Jambon first started using his chemical analysis looking for meteoritic iron in 2010 after purchasing an XRF instrument. Despite the many obstacles in obtaining old artifacts from around Eurasia, he continues to shine a light on ancient metallurgical technologies.

How AI Can Help Both Tax Collectors And Taxpayers – Analysis	New technologies have the potential to improve the relationship between governments and citizens. Tax portals, customs IT systems and online services have simplified interactions with public authorities, reduced bureaucratic hurdles, and increased transparency. Now, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as the next transformative force. Known for its ability to understand and produce human language, GenAI opens possibilities that go beyond simple automation. However, in an area as politically sensitive as taxation, it also raises important questions that could quickly undermine trust. Tax authorities are beginning to explore GenAI, though most efforts are still at an early, experimental stage. The most evident area so far has been on improving communication with taxpayers. In Singapore, a virtual assistant answers tax questions in multiple languages and has cut call-center inquiries by half. Korea has deployed an AI guide to help citizens file and pay taxes. In France, AI can analyze incoming emails and propose draft responses for civil servants to validate. While these applications are promising, a more profound question emerges: Can GenAI significantly alter the relationship between governments and citizens? Furthermore, how will it influence the way citizens experience and perceive taxation—a politically sensitive process that is governed by law yet deeply intertwined with social norms and practices? What’s new with GenAI? Most AI systems currently used by tax and customs authorities are predictive and built for a single function. They analyze large sets of structured data—like past tax declarations or transactions—to produce things like risk scores to indicate possible fraud. By contrast, GenAI is a generalist system that understands almost all forms of information and is designed to interact with humans in any language. It can handle a range of tasks, from drafting letters to providing interactive guidance about tax regulations and assisting officers in their investigations. By training a GenAI agent with legal texts, tax codes, operating procedures, and internal guidelines, administrations can adapt it to specific needs. The result is a dynamic system capable of understanding and producing content that both civil servants and taxpayers can interact with. Transforming the State-Society Relationship While AI tools already in use often enhance efficiency, they have not fundamentally changed the way revenue authorities work or engage with citizens. They mostly replaced manual tasks or systems for econometric or statistical modelling. With GenAI, there are more profound implications. Internally, it can help tax and customs officials to focus on analytical and judgment-based roles, allowing them to become oversight specialists and increasing their productivity. Externally, it can reduce the knowledge gap between administrations and taxpayers, aiding in the interpretation of complex provisions, navigating laws, identifying deductions, and even auto-filling forms. For low-income countries, GenAI offers the opportunity to drive organizational reforms and leapfrog into the most modern systems. For example, in Madagascar, the customs authority wants to use GenAI to improve risk management, combat fraud and increase revenue, using data accumulated over 10 years to train its system. The human-like interactions offered by AI chat tools can personalize the process, as shown in Singapore and Korea, where users can ask questions and receive plain language replies. Citizens’ organizations, academics, and political parties can also use GenAI to examine proposed reforms, compare scenarios, and engage in deeper policy debates. This two-way transformation could increase overall trust, making taxation feel less like a frustrating obligation and more like a shared responsibility of both taxpayers and governments. Preconditions for success Despite its potential, GenAI also comes with challenges. Issues related to data quality, ethics, privacy concerns and hallucinations (i.e., incorrect results) must be addressed to reinforce and not erode trust. For instance, Korea’s approach—directing particularly sensitive queries to human agents—reflects the need for careful oversight of confidential matters. Results must be explainable and perceived as fair in all cases. Effective knowledge management is another requirement. Revenue authorities have extensive laws, regulations, case records, and operational manuals. However, scattered archives and incomplete digitization can hamper efforts to train AI systems effectively. A human must determine which documents are accurate, relevant, and suitable for inclusion in the training material. As GenAI becomes integrated into various aspects of revenue administration, employees will need to be trained to interpret, correct, and complement its outputs. Policymakers must ensure that errors are reported and addressed promptly. By providing human-like capabilities to support taxpayers and tax authorities, GenAI can act as both taxman and taxpayer assistant, automating routine tasks, clarifying complex issues, and fostering a more transparent and collaborative relationship. This technology can lower administrative hurdles, demystify tax obligations, and invite broader participation in policy debates. However, shaping it properly requires strong leadership, ethical policy frameworks, and vigilant oversight of data quality, privacy, and accuracy.

The Possible Reality Of The ‘Century Of The Americas’ – Analysis	By Zhou Chao It is undeniable that as of this year, the basic process of de-globalization has been ongoing for roughly a decade. The further divergence of the global economic development pattern is, therefore, an indisputable fact. As for the countries and regions that are likely to take the leading positions in the future global economic landscape, many different views have emerged in the commentary. Some argue that, with its young population and increasingly stronger economic power, India's position in the global economy will be further strengthened. Others point out that, with similar advantages, Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam are expected to become key players in the future global economic pattern. There are even opinions that foresee a promising future for the five Central Asian countries. In this regard, however, the Americas seem to have been somewhat overlooked. That being said, a senior researcher at ANBOUND has long expressed the view that, in terms of the future global economic structure, the possibility of a 'Century of the Americas' should not be underestimated. Latin American countries, represented by Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as North American countries, including the United States and Canada, will occupy a more important position in the global economic structure, with greater influence. In several prior analyses, ANBOUND has highlighted that the past focus on the economic aspects of globalization has been one-sided and superficial. This approach has resulted in overly long and complex global supply chains, which have proven highly vulnerable in the face of sudden events such as natural disasters and regional conflicts. Moreover, the widening global wealth gap has fueled increasing dissatisfaction within countries over this narrow form of globalization. As a result, regionalization is expected to emerge as a long-term trend, with the United States gradually redirecting its attention and resources to the geographically closer Americas. Recently, in matters such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the United States has essentially adopted a unilateral approach and marginalized Europe. Conflicts between the U.S. and Europe in areas such as trade, investment, and defense spending are likely to continue intensifying for a period. Furthermore, with the rise of conservative forces in the U.S. and the deepening ideological divide between them and the European Union's establishment faction, tensions in U.S.-EU relations are continuously strengthening. Moreover, since the beginning of the century, due to its own structural bloating and complex legal regulations, the EU's economic vitality has gradually weakened, and it has fallen behind China and the U.S. in areas such as cutting-edge technological research and development. The intensification of U.S.-EU contradictions and the EU's decreasing economic vitality may undermine the importance of the EU as the primary destination for U.S. capital's long-term overseas investment. For the entire Americas, the U.S.'s primary task is to effectively manage and integrate the entire continent both ideologically and economically. In North America, the economic strength of the U.S. and Canada is undeniable. While Canada has developed clear opposition with the U.S. on specific issues such as trade disputes, the ideological divide between the two countries is minimal. Economically, Canada remains highly dependent on the U.S., and its eventual full integration into the U.S.'s regional strategic framework is merely a matter of time. Therefore, the U.S.'s most important task is the integration of the entire Latin American region. In terms of economic development and strategic integration, the Latin American region holds significant importance for the U.S. The Latin American region is rich in mineral resources, holding at least 65% of the world's lithium reserves (concentrated in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil); 49% of the silver reserves (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and Mexico); 44% of the copper reserves (primarily in Chile and Peru, with Mexico following); 33% of the tin reserves (found in Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia); 26% of the bauxite reserves (concentrated in Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, and Jamaica); 23% of the nickel reserves (mainly in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic); and 22% of the iron reserves (concentrated in Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico). In addition, the Latin American region is also rich in oil and gas resources. Effectively managing and developing these resources is of great strategic importance to the U.S., as it plays a crucial role in ensuring resource independence and reducing reliance on China. Furthermore, the Latin American region is itself a massive consumer market. With a population of approximately 665 million, it accounts for 8.3% of the global population. The population is notably concentrated in a few leading countries, with Brazil and Mexico ranking as the seventh and tenth most populous nations in the world. Additionally, the region has a relatively young demographic structure. Data shows that in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Chile, around 24% of the population is under 15 years old, while 65% is between the ages of 15 and 65, indicating a youthful population. The gender ratio in the region is also relatively balanced. In recent years, Latin America's economic growth has been characterized by fluctuations, with consumption potential being relatively promising. Brazil and Mexico are seen as markets with the greatest growth potential. All of these factors provide the U.S. with relatively ideal returns on potential capital investments in the region. It is also important to note that, although some countries in the Latin American region face internal political instability and other issues, the overall situation in the region remains relatively favorable on a global scale. Unlike certain Southeast Asian nations, Latin America does not suffer from severe internal military fragmentation or warlordism. The activities of criminal groups in the region, while a concern, do not possess the same level of destructive power as the Islamist extremist forces in Central Asia and the Middle East. The internal issues in Latin American countries are primarily due to inadequate governance capacity, and these challenges are far more remediable compared to those faced by some of the major countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. In terms of the U.S.' integration of the Latin American region, the major regional powers remain the primary targets. This means that the success or failure of future U.S. integration efforts largely depends on the attitudes of Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. As for Mexico, although there are confrontational feelings and positions toward the U.S. on issues like tariffs, there is no serious ideological opposition. Furthermore, Mexico's heavy economic dependence on the U.S. makes it highly likely that Mexico will be successfully integrated into the U.S.'s regional strategic plans. Mexico's own economic strength and growth prospects are also highly regarded by global capital. As for Argentina, President Javier Milei's radical reforms have already yielded significant results. His series of reforms in the monetary and financial sectors have effectively deepened Argentina's integration into the United States' regional strategy. Regarding Brazil, the country is currently governed by left-wing forces, and this creates an ideological distance from the U.S. Economically, Brazil faces structural issues such as low investment efficiency and heavy reliance on final consumption and primary product exports. However, Brazil's overall economic performance remains relatively stable, and its inflation rate is not as alarming as Argentina's. It is also important to note that in the last election, the left-wing forces did not have an overwhelming advantage; right-wing forces still maintain significant influence at both the local and central levels. This suggests that Brazil's economic reforms could still move toward an American-style neoliberal model, potentially integrating into the U.S.'s regional strategy in the future. As for other countries, due to their relatively limited population and economic scale, their ability to resist U.S. influence is weaker, making the possibility of full integration into U.S. strategy quite high. In the case of Cuba, the country has long been affected by isolation and sanctions, with ongoing internal economic and social struggles. Additionally, its aging population is the highest in Latin America, and the country's social vitality is likely to continue to decline, making it difficult to effectively obstruct the U.S.'s future strategy for the Americas. For Venezuela, although Nicolás Maduro's rule remains relatively stable for now, due to its limited overall scale and national strength, it lacks the capacity to significantly hinder the U.S.'s integration and control over the entire Latin American region. Due to the various challenges that still exist in Latin American countries, the U.S.'s efforts to integrate the region face numerous challenges. The U.S. is the dominant power in the Americas, and its development needs were historically met through global markets. In the future, these needs may primarily be met by emerging countries on the American continent. Clearly, in order to achieve this, countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil must possess large, young populations, thriving manufacturing sectors, and stable social environments. Only then will these Latin American countries be able to effectively absorb and meet the development and investment requirements of U.S. capital, providing sustained growth and driving social and economic prosperity. Achieving these requirements will face a series of uncertainties, but it is not impossible. Once U.S. capital, technology, human resources, and ideas truly reshape the entire Latin American region—especially the key countries, the economic power and social development levels of these nations can experience significant leaps. Their international status and influence could also be greatly enhanced, thus creating a prosperous 'Century of the Americas'. A Latin American region like this would not only become an important base for the U.S. in the era of regionalization but also a key support point for strengthening U.S. global influence when the trend of globalization resurges. Final analysis conclusion: Since the launch of the Trump 2.0 era, actions such as demanding Canada join the U.S. and Denmark in ceding Greenland, and forcing Panama to quit the Belt and Road Initiative, have all indicated that the U.S. will gradually shift its focus and investments toward the entire American continent. Fully integrating the Americas, including Latin America, will become a key component of the U.S.'s future global strategy. While this strategic plan will face numerous challenges, it is not without possibility. If successful, both the U.S. and the major countries in the Americas will be able to further enhance their global standing, creating a 'Century of the Americas'. Throughout this process, China's existing interests in Latin America may face continuous and significant disruptions.

Vienna Process Offers A Genuine Alternative To The Taliban – Anal...	By Luke Coffey More than 100 Afghans from different ethnic and minority groups recently gathered in Vienna, Austria, for the fifth meeting of the Vienna Process for a Democratic Afghanistan. Over the past two years, the Vienna Process has emerged as the primary forum for anti-Taliban resistance movements to coordinate, strategize, and chart a common path forward. While the international community has struggled to formulate a coherent approach to Afghanistan, this growing coalition of opposition groups has steadily built a framework for an alternative future. The Vienna Process has grown in both scope and influence since its inception in September 2022, one year after the Taliban’s return to power. The first round brought together over 30 participants from various Afghan minority and ethnic groups, who issued a joint statement rejecting Taliban rule as unacceptable. Perhaps the most significant outcome was the emergence of Ahmad Massoud, the son of famed anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, as the de facto leader of the resistance. By April 2023, the second round had expanded to include a broader range of activists, representing diverse ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds. While Massoud and the National Resistance Front remained central, the Ankara Coalition, Hazara, and Uzbek representatives played key roles. Notably, nearly half of the participants were women. This time, they took a bolder step, agreeing to support all forms of resistance against the Taliban, including armed struggle. The third round in December 2023 saw even greater participation, with over 50 representatives from anti-Taliban groups. For the first time, Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek commander and longtime Afghan powerbroker, sent a personal envoy. The presence of international observers from the US and Europe signaled a growing recognition of the resistance movement. By June 2024, the fourth round had grown to 70 participants, including influential figures such as former Afghan Vice President Yunus Qanuni; Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq; and Anarkali Honaryar, an Afghan Sikh. Women’s rights activist Parwana Ibrahimkhel, who had been imprisoned by the Taliban in 2022, also joined. To develop a roadmap for Afghanistan’s future, participants broke into working groups focused on politics, foreign policy, human rights, and economics. This week’s fifth round was even larger and included almost 100 attendees. For the first time, there was a session giving international observers from the US and Europe an opportunity to speak and engage. In addition to Ahmad Massoud, other notable attendees included Yasin Zia, leader of the Afghanistan Freedom Front; and Rangin Dadfar Spanta, the country’s former national security adviser. The biggest outcome of this meeting was the agreement to a roadmap that various working groups had been drafting since the last meeting in June. This program is the opposition’s attempt at showing that there is an alternative to the current Taliban rule. All aspects of Afghanistan’s future and society are covered to include future economic development, security, diplomatic relations, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women’s rights. A special commission of 19 members representing all walks of Afghan society was also formed. This commission will work together and coordinate a response to implement the roadmap. At the heart of the Vienna Process is Massoud. Since fleeing to his ancestral homeland in the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul, Massoud has pursued a dual-track approach to countering the Taliban. Militarily, the NRF is active in many provinces across Afghanistan, primarily in the north, using guerrilla warfare tactics to target Taliban forces. Last year alone, the NRF launched dozens of attacks, making it a persistent security challenge for the Taliban. Diplomatically, Massoud has led an international effort to raise awareness of the resistance and build alliances. This is one of the main reasons the Vienna Process has gained momentum. The Vienna Process offers a rare good news story about Afghanistan. Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, they have shown little ability to govern effectively. The country faces an acute humanitarian crisis that worsens each year, and the economic situation remains dire as questions arise over the sustainability of international aid. Meanwhile, human rights conditions continue to deteriorate, with ethnic minorities persecuted, girls banned from schools, and women forced out of many workplaces. Yet, the NRF and other Vienna Process participants demonstrate that an alternative future is possible. The situation today mirrors the 1990s when the Northern Alliance controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, yet refused to surrender to the Taliban. Likewise, the NRF and other resistance groups must continue their fight and ensure that the world does not forget them. The Taliban itself is deeply divided, with competing factions vying for power. These internal fractures could create opportunities for the anti-Taliban resistance to establish safe zones and reclaim territory. The international community would be wise to engage more seriously with the Vienna Process. While a few international observers attended this week’s meeting, no senior government officials participated. At the next Vienna Process gathering, representatives such as the US special envoy for Afghanistan and counterparts from other nations should attend — even if only as observers. It makes little sense that much of the international community engages with the Taliban as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan, while failing to establish meaningful dialogue with resistance movements such as the NRF and others in the Vienna Process. With each round, the Vienna Process has become more inclusive and strategic, positioning itself as the most significant platform for Afghanistan’s anti-Taliban resistance. Global policymakers should take note. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

What Is Danantara, Indonesia’s New State Investment Body? – Analy...	By Arie Firdaus Daya Anagata Nusantara (Danantara), a new state investment management body launched by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, aims to boost the nation’s economy. The announcement on Monday fulfilled a key campaign promise by Prabowo, who took office in October. But what exactly is Danantara, and how does it fit into Indonesia’s economic ambitions? Here’s what you need to know: What is Danantara? Danantara is designed to consolidate funds from Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and channel them into strategic projects, such as renewable energy, industrial development, and food production. Prabowo has described it as an 'economic catalyst' with the ambitious goal of accelerating Indonesia’s growth rate and ensuring long-term prosperity. The name Danantara is derived from three Indonesian words: Daya (energy or strength), Anagata (future), and Nusantara (Indonesia). They reflect the body’s mission to become a driving force for the nation’s economic future. With an estimated initial asset base of U.S. $900 billion, Danantara ranks among the world’s largest state investment bodies. It surpasses Malaysia’s Khazanah ($37 billion) and Singapore’s Temasek ($596 billion) and is the seventh-largest globally. What will Danantara do? Danantara’s primary role is to optimize the management of Indonesia’s state-owned assets and invest in high-impact projects. According to Prabowo, the body will focus on areas related to sustainable energy, food security and industrial downstreaming that involves processing raw materials into higher-value products. 'We no longer want to sell our natural resources cheaply or serve as raw material suppliers for other nations,' Prabowo said during the launch. 'High-impact projects will generate significant value for our nation, create quality jobs, and ensure long-term prosperity for the Indonesian people.' Why was Danantara created? The idea for Danantara emerged during Prabowo’s presidential campaign, where he pledged to create a superholding company to manage Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises more effectively. Inspired by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, the plan was initially slated for launch in November 2024 but was delayed. Danantara’s creation was formalized following the third revision of Indonesia’s SOE Law, passed by the House of Representatives on Feb. 4. While it was initially envisioned as a replacement for the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, the ministry now retains some oversight powers, including a 1% 'special share' that grants the government veto power over strategic decisions. Who is leading Danantara? Rosan Roeslani, Indonesia’s minister of Investment and head of the Investment Coordinating Board, has been appointed Danantara’s chief executive officer. Rosan, who led Prabowo’s 2024 presidential campaign team, is joined by Pandu Sjahrir, a businessman and nephew of National Economic Council Chairman Luhut Pandjaitan, as chief investment officer. Pandu was a member of Prabowo’s campaign team as well. The Dantantara team also includes Deputy Minister of SOEs Dony Oskario, who will serve as chief operating officer. The presidential office has indicated that a former president may be appointed to Danantara’s leadership, but no details have been provided. How is Danantara funded? Danantara’s initial capital comes from seven major state-owned enterprises, including Bank Mandiri, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Telkom Indonesia, and energy giant Pertamina. Together, these companies have contributed around $20 billion in initial funds from their revenues. Additional SOEs are expected to join Danantara in the future, which will further expand the body’s asset base. The first phase of investment will focus on nickel and bauxite processing, food production, and green energy projects. How does Danantara compare with Indonesia’s existing investment fund? Indonesia already has a sovereign wealth fund, the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA), established in 2021 under former President Joko Widodo. However, Danantara is broader in scope, combining investment management, asset development, and sovereign wealth fund functions such as managing and investing state assets. INA will eventually be absorbed into Danantara. What are the concerns? Despite its ambitious goals, Danantara has faced skepticism from analysts and transparency advocates. Some worry that its leadership, dominated by political appointees rather than independent professionals, could undermine its efficacy. 'Danantara looks more like a political institution for elites rather than a professionally managed fund,' said Budi Frensidy, a capital market analyst at the University of Indonesia. Others have raised concerns about oversight. Under its legal framework, Danantara’s audits will be conducted by a public accountant chosen by shareholders and approved by the SOE minister. Only if the House of Representatives requests it would there be an intervention by the Supreme Audit Agency, which is the government body responsible for accountability of state finances. The law does not explicitly grant oversight authority to Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) either. Danantara’s CEO Roslan has sought to address these concerns, stating that the body is not immune from the law. 'The KPK can certainly step in, especially if there are improper or criminal acts,' he told reporters on Monday. Prabowo has also stressed the importance of transparency, declaring that Danantara 'must be auditable at any time by anyone because this, once again, belongs to our children and grandchildren, [and] to the future generations of Indonesia.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdu5wjfluXLeSBMFh7WUnkK	2025-02-25T17:24:40-08:00	
Trump’s Russia Strategy: Breaking The Sino-Russian Alliance Or St...	By Dr. Hasim Turker The return of Donald Trump to the White House has marked a departure from the conventional trajectory of US foreign policy. His administration’s approach to Russia signals a recalibration of priorities, reflecting an underlying strategy aimed at reshaping global alignments in Washington’s favor. Rather than maintaining the confrontational stance of previous administrations, Trump appears to favor a more conciliatory approach toward Moscow, a shift largely dictated by the imperative of countering China’s rise. This shift, however, raises critical questions about its broader consequences, particularly for the transatlantic alliance and global stability. Russia and China: The New Strategic Equation For decades, US foreign policy has been characterized by a dual containment approach toward both Russia and China. However, Trump’s return to power suggests a shift in focus, prioritizing China as the primary geopolitical challenger while seeking to ease tensions with Russia. This change underscores a belief that continued antagonism toward Moscow only serves to push Russia further into China’s strategic orbit. The assumption behind this approach is that an entrenched Sino-Russian partnership presents the most formidable challenge to US hegemony. If the two powers deepen their military, economic, and diplomatic coordination, Washington faces a significantly more complex threat environment. By offering diplomatic and economic incentives to Russia, the Trump administration aims to weaken this partnership and prevent Beijing from leveraging Moscow’s resources in a future confrontation with the United States. The urgency of countering China stems from its growing economic and military power. China has surpassed the United States as the world’s largest trading nation and advanced significantly in AI, semiconductor manufacturing, and quantum computing. The modernization of the People’s Liberation Army and its growing naval power challenge US strategic superiority in the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, Beijing’s global outreach through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative has significantly expanded its influence across Africa, Latin America, and even Europe. Against this backdrop, Trump’s foreign policy team views Russia as a secondary concern. While Moscow remains a geopolitical competitor, its ambitions are seen as more regionally focused, making engagement with Russia a strategic move to free up resources for the broader confrontation with China. A Diplomatic Strategy to Divide Russia and China Trump’s approach recalls President Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972, where Washington exploited the Sino-Soviet split to contain Moscow. However, this time, the roles are reversed, as the United States seeks to engage Russia in an effort to weaken China’s strategic position. The administration envisions diplomatic engagement, the lifting of select sanctions, and potential de-escalation of tensions over Ukraine as mechanisms to bring Russia back into a more balanced relationship with the West. The assumption is that, with the right incentives, Moscow might be willing to moderate its ties with Beijing. Yet, this assumption is flawed. Unlike during the Cold War, when ideological rifts separated China and the Soviet Union, today’s Russia-China partnership is built on shared opposition to Western dominance. Both countries benefit from economic cooperation, joint military exercises, and diplomatic coordination in multilateral institutions such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Given these realities, the likelihood of Russia abandoning its close ties with China in exchange for uncertain US concessions remains low. Implications for NATO and European Security While the logic behind Trump’s approach is clear, it carries significant strategic risks. By deprioritizing support for Ukraine and easing pressure on Moscow, Trump may embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin. A perceived retreat by the United States could encourage Russia to expand its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe through hybrid warfare or direct military action. The administration’s skepticism toward NATO, combined with its reluctance to maintain military aid commitments to Ukraine, risks fracturing the transatlantic alliance. European nations, uncertain of Washington’s reliability, may seek alternative security arrangements, undermining the cohesion that has underpinned Western stability since World War II. Additionally, by engaging in direct negotiations with Moscow without meaningful European participation, Washington risks sidelining key allies such as Germany, France, and Poland. This could push European nations toward a more independent foreign policy stance, reducing Washington’s ability to coordinate a unified response to global security challenges. Concrete Policy Shifts and Their Consequences Trump’s realignment is already manifesting in concrete policy decisions. His administration has signaled a shift away from previous commitments to European security, urging NATO members to increase their defense spending while casting doubt on the United States’ commitment to Article 5. He has also moved to curtail military aid to Ukraine, undermining Kyiv’s ability to resist Russian advances. While these measures are intended to secure Moscow’s neutrality in a US-China confrontation, they carry long-term risks that could outweigh their short-term gains. If Russia interprets these moves as signs of Western weakness, it may choose to exploit them rather than reciprocate with genuine geopolitical realignment. A More Strategic Alternative: Balancing Engagement and Deterrence If the objective is to prevent an entrenched Sino-Russian alliance while maintaining US credibility, an alternative approach is needed. Rather than offering unconditional concessions to Moscow, Washington should pursue a strategy of selective engagement coupled with reinforced deterrence. Diplomatic engagement with Russia should be contingent on verifiable actions, such as de-escalation in Ukraine and a commitment to cease aggressive military posturing in Eastern Europe. European allies should be encouraged to increase their defense contributions, but US commitments to NATO must remain firm. Enhanced joint military exercises and forward deployments in Eastern Europe would deter Russian aggression while ensuring NATO’s resilience. Economic relief should only be granted in exchange for concrete behavioral changes from Moscow, using sanctions as a bargaining tool rather than a premature concession. Washington should explore areas of limited cooperation with Moscow, such as arms control and Arctic governance, without jeopardizing broader security commitments. Conclusion: Long-Term Strategic Considerations Trump’s foreign policy shift toward Russia represents an ambitious effort to reshape global alignments, but its long-term ramifications remain uncertain. While a Russia-China split could, in theory, provide the United States with strategic flexibility, the execution of this policy raises concerns about its sustainability and unintended consequences. Weakening NATO at a time of growing Russian assertiveness could compromise transatlantic security and embolden Moscow to test Western resolve. Moreover, Russia’s incentives to break from China remain limited, making it unclear whether Washington’s overtures will result in meaningful realignment or simply encourage further geopolitical adventurism. A more sustainable strategy would balance engagement with deterrence, ensuring that diplomatic initiatives with Russia do not come at the expense of broader US strategic interests. History has shown that unchecked concessions rarely produce lasting stability, and the challenge for US policymakers lies in navigating this complex realignment without sacrificing critical security commitments. The broader question remains: Can the United States successfully realign its global strategy while maintaining stability, or will this shift inadvertently accelerate the rise of revisionist powers?

Japan: Strong Reactions To A Weak Yen Shake Economy – Analysis	By Willem Thorbecke The Japanese real effective exchange rate is now at its lowest level in 54 years. Despite the pressures of a depreciating yen — from import prices to debt repayment — Japan’s global competitiveness and financial markets make it well-equipped to handle these challenges. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has tightened monetary policy cautiously. It abandoned negative rates on the uncollateralised overnight call rate in March 2024 and raised the target to 0.25 per cent in July 2024 and to 0.5 per cent in January 2025. The move in July sparked a 6 per cent appreciation of the yen and a 12 per cent drop in the stock market, while the move in January proved uneventful. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has been waiting for what he calls good inflation — inflation driven by wage increases that increase consumption and aggregate demand — to tighten policy. Despite years of easy monetary policy and wages increasing 5.1 per cent in the 2024 spring wage offensive, real disposable income has not increased. This has led to sluggish growth in real consumption. The BOJ may face pressure to tighten in order to resist a disorderly depreciation of the yen. This is especially true as the US Federal Reserve may slow monetary policy easing because of inflationary risks due to tariffs, large US budget deficits and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. The weak yen increases the prices of imported energy and food. This has raised average household costs in 2024 by 90,000 yen (US$590). To combat this, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba implemented stimulus measures to subsidise utility bills and provide cash for poorer households. But one problem with both the BOJ’s tightening and Ishiba’s stimulus package is that they increase budget deficits. By raising interest rates, the BOJ raises the cost of servicing Japan’s public debt. At 1.2 per cent, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds are at their highest level in 14 years. Debt service costs in 2025 are already forecasted to be above 4 per cent of GDP. Ishiba’s package, along with increased spending on military and social security categories, will turn the forecasted primary budget — the budget excluding interest payments — from a surplus into a deficit of 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2025. With a public debt of 250 per cent of GDP, Japan needs to eschew additional borrowing. It should instead allow entrepreneurs to play a larger role in allocating resources. The weak yen also impacts Japan’s international transactions. It raises the costs of imports of food, fuels and other items. Yet the stimulus to exports is mitigated as many manufacturers relocated factories abroad during the strong yen period that lasted until 2012. Since the weak yen increases the cost of imports and has a tenuous impact on exports, it contributed to a trade deficit in 2024. But the weak yen raised the yen value of repatriated profitsand contributed to a 47 per cent increase in tourism. Primary income inflows and tourism revenues more than offset the trade deficit, pushing the overall Japanese current account to a surplus of 4 per cent of GDP. The Nikkei 225 stock market index also benefitted from the weak yen. It increased 19 per cent in 2024 and finished at its highest year-end level ever. Much of this occurred because the weak yen increased the yen profitability of companies such as Toyota and Komatsu, who obtain revenues from abroad. It has yet to be seen whether many Japanese firms who moved factories abroad during strong yen episodes — such as after the 1985 Plaza Accord and the 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis — will return production to Japan as the yen remains weak. The government has pushed to return semiconductor manufacturing to Japan. The weak yen may help this plan succeed. As an oil importer, Japan faces challenges from high energy costs which are only raised with yen depreciation. It is seeking to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and to promote renewables and safe nuclear power. Somewhat paradoxically for an oil importer, oil price increases raise stock prices for Japanese industrial firms. This is because Japanese companies produce niche goods and services that are needed as energy prices increase. These high-quality niche products also improve the resilience of the Japanese economy. Japanese firms produce the lion’s share of photoresists and image sensors, used in the electronics industry and medical equipment. Japanese firms are also major suppliers of inputs to the semiconductor industry. With Japan consistently ranking as the most sophisticated economy, finding substitutes for many Japanese goods is hard. This provides Japanese companies with a stable source of demand for their products across Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Europe and the United States. This diversification reduces their exposure to difficulties in individual markets such as China. Japan will face challenges in 2025, including uncertainties from United States President Donald Trump, competition from South Korean and Chinese firms, dangers from wars and natural disasters, a shrinking workforce and an aging population. Japanese companies have navigated difficulties associated with the Russia–Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic and the weak yen. These past successes provide reason for optimism that Japan can weather the coming shocks.

Is Taiwan Fever Breaking In Lithuania? – Analysis	By Thomas J. Shattuck (FPRI) -- One of Taiwan’s most significant foreign policy achievements since the COVID-19 pandemic was the expansion of its unofficial diplomatic cooperation with Lithuania. Both countries opened unofficial representative offices in each other’s capitals—in 2021, Taiwan’s office opened in Vilnius, and in 2022, Lithuania’s office opened in Taipei. The announcement of the 'Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania' resulted in a coercive firestorm from Beijing. Since then, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has utilized various diplomatic and economic mechanisms to pressure and punish Lithuania. The two nations’ relations remain at the chargé d’affaires level, with both countries’ embassies remaining closed. After the fall 2024 elections in Lithuania, the new government in Vilnius has made the reestablishment and normalization of Lithuania-PRC relations a foreign policy priority. As these debates continue in Lithuania, it is essential to analyze the state of Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan, the implications of backing down to Beijing, and the current state of the Lithuanian economy and trade vis-à-vis PRC economic coercion. Taiwan-Lithuania Trade and Investment After the PRC announced trade repercussions for the enhanced Taiwan-Lithuania relationship, it was incumbent upon Taipei to demonstrate that it could be a reliable trade partner and make it worth the aggravation for Vilnius. After all, the PRC removed Lithuania as a country of origin, preventing anything from Lithuania from entering the PRC. During the first few months, Taiwanese people went out of their way to purchase items from Lithuania that were banned from entering the PRC. To her credit, then-President Tsai Ing-wen announced several new initiatives to encourage Taiwanese investment in Lithuania and to spur joint projects. The Tsai administration set up a $200 million investment fund for high-tech industries and a $1 billion credit fund for joint projects. Some funds have been utilized, but not as many as those figures would presume. Most of the investments were related to fintech and laser technologies. According to an official familiar with Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan, Lithuanian politicians are more confident about the bilateral relationship than Lithuanian businesses are since there is a general unfamiliarity with Taiwan and how it conducts business. There are not a lot of easy wins for either country due to the types and sizes of their economies. Nevertheless, trade between Taiwan and Lithuania increased by 50 percent in 2022 from 2021. Taiwan did its part to demonstrate that it supported Lithuania during the diplomatic crisis. However, that spirit was not extended through businesses utilizing these new opportunities, so while the funds are there, the follow-through has been lacking. But that does not mean Lithuania is now worse off because of its trade situation with the PRC. Is Lithuania Worse Off? One would assume that the PRC cutting off all trade with a country like Lithuania would be economically devastating. After several years, the opposite has turned out to be true. The reason for this is simple: Lithuanian exports to the PRC accounted for under one percent, while PRC imports to Lithuanians were only 4 percent. At the outset of the crisis, some Lithuanian industries were heavily affected because the sanctions essentially turned off their business with the PRC overnight. The industries hit hardest by the crisis were furniture, lasers, and high-tech manufacturing. Companies in these industries lost tens of millions of euros from the loss in business in the initial shock. However, this is not the whole story. These companies and industries found new opportunities elsewhere in the European Union, Indo-Pacific, and the United States (not to mention the PRC quietly reduced its economic sanctions on Lithuania). The industries needed time to diversify away from the PRC and shift to other markets. In fact, 'the total exports of Lithuanian origin goods to the ten Indo-Pacific countries increased by 60.4 percent [during January-June 2022], exceeding the volume of exports to China by four times (compared to January-June 2021).' Trade between Lithuania and the PRC has improved since 2022—a reason cited by the European Commission when asking the World Trade Organization to suspend the European Union’s case against the PRC. Lithuanian exports to the PRC are still not at the pre-crisis level, but they reached the floor in early 2022, with a slow but steady increase since then. At the macro level, Lithuania’s gross domestic product has fluctuated but remained positive since the PRC crisis. In 2021, it grew by 6.4 percent; in 2022, it grew by 2.5 percent; and in 2023, it grew by 0.3 percent, with projections for 2024 of over 2 percent. A Lithuania official noted that Lithuania and its economy were not affected by PRC actions because imports and exports recovered due to the ease of finding new markets for certain commodities. The Battle of the Narrative However, measuring the impact of the PRC’s actions on possible deals with other companies and countries worried about angering the PRC is difficult. During the height of the crisis, Beijing was pressuring companies and governments not to use Lithuanian components. There was a general fear of reprisal for anything Lithuanian and how Beijing could expand that punishment beyond Lithuania. While the economic figures speak for themselves, it appears that the PRC has won the battle of the narrative by emphasizing how much worse off Lithuanians are due to Vilnius’ decision to enhance cooperation with Taiwan. Part of this narrative warfare is the failure to make Lithuania the 'gateway' in Europe for Taiwan. In early 2024, a study by the Eastern Europe Studies Centre found that 47.6 percent of Lithuanians believed that 'China is a profitable market and that Lithuania should be pragmatic and refrain from criticizing it.' About 44 percent still thought Lithuania’s 'economy would struggle without investments from China,' even though GDP figures point to a different reality. Most tellingly, 37 percent believed that 'support for Taiwan does not bring any economic benefits to Lithuania and is less important than maintaining good economic relations with China.' However, 40 percent had no opinion, and 22 percent disagreed. These numbers are a shift from another survey conducted in 2022 by GLOBSEC. Slightly over 42 percent of Lithuanians agreed that the PRC 'presents a danger (significant threat)' to Lithuania, and 71 percent disagreed with the statement that 'the Chinese regime could be an inspiration' for Lithuania. This skepticism could be attributed to President Gitanas Nausėda’s consistent disagreement about allowing the Taiwan office to be named 'Taiwanese Representative Office' and not 'Taipei.' He emphasized this point regularly since the beginning of the crisis and continues to do so. Current Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas campaigned on getting the Lithuania-PRC relationship back on track, but has remained silent on what the future holds for the name of the Taiwan office in Vilnius. He noted that he would work towards restoring full ties 'without humiliating ourselves, falling to our knees, and begging for anything.' One of the architects of the expansion of Taiwan-Lithuania relations, Gabrielius Landsbergis, who was serving as foreign minister then, is no longer serving in parliament after his party only won twenty-eight seats in the 2024 parliamentary elections. He maintains that allowing Taiwan to open an office and use the word 'Taiwanese' was the correct decision. He traveled to Taiwan for the first time in January 2025 to receive an award from President Lai Ching-te. While in Taipei, he said changing the name of the office in Vilnius would be an 'enormous mistake' and that 'it is more than just a name. It is part of [Taiwan’s] identity.' Landsbergis reminded the world that the crisis occurred because the PRC created it through sanctions against Lithuania. It is not really up to the current government in Lithuania to fix a problem that it did not create. Looking Ahead The most crucial issue for Lithuania remains the closure of its embassy in the PRC, which makes it difficult for Vilnius to conduct diplomacy with Beijing. It is difficult for people to obtain visas to visit the country for business or pleasure. A Lithuanian official interviewed on these topics noted that the United States and most of the world maintain an embassy in Russia despite the war in Ukraine. Aggressors and competitors can conduct diplomacy, but this is not the case for Lithuania and China. The sticking point is allegedly the name of the 'Taiwanese Representative Office,' and according to one school of thought, the change in the name will fix all problems. If the current government in Vilnius backs down after years of being resolute, it would mark a significant blow to democratic nations standing up to PRC coercion. The PRC’s actual problem lies with the fact that Lithuania expanded its cooperation with Taiwan, not one specific word. The name is just a detail of a larger part of PRC coercion of third parties to limit Taiwan’s international space and ability to conduct its foreign policy. What happens if Vilnius requests that Taipei change the name of its office and Beijing does not fully restore the Lithuania-PRC political and economic relationship for a different reason—like the fact that it left the China-CEE in 2021? That would be a serious blow to the legitimacy of the government, especially in a country that has a history of standing up to authoritarian regimes. Lithuania needs an open and operating embassy in the PRC, but it is incumbent upon Beijing to change its coercive behavior, not Vilnius to back down. About the author: Thomas J.

Musk’s ‘Super Government’ And The ‘New Elites’ – Analysis	By Zhao Zhijiang Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are shaking revamping the U.S. federal government. This is done through applying corporate strategies like cost reduction and efficiency improvement to government agencies, with the goal of building a super-government that no other country can match. As its name suggests, the DOGE is truly efficient. Within less than a month of its establishment, it has pushed through a series of reforms across multiple fronts. These include eliminating agencies, making personnel changes, limiting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s foreign payments, and cutting the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments. Every day, the DOGE shakes up the power structures in Washington. The department's current goal is to cut USD 3 billion per day, and this pace may increase in the future. Recent reports show that Musk and his government efficiency team have already reached at least 19 American government departments and gained internal system access in some of them, further expanding their power. In response to external criticism and attacks, President Donald Trump defended Musk's team, claiming that the federal government is too bloated and that waste and fraud have caused excessive financial losses. Now, Musk continues pushing toward the creation of a 'super-government', focusing on those who profit from politics, particularly Democratic senators. Recently, a video circulating on social media showed Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who usually appears composed, rudely elbowing a reporter who kept challenging her. In the video, the reporter first asks why Warren is bothered by transparency and opposes Musk exposing fraudulent government spending. Then, he asks, 'How did you get a 12 million dollar net worth on a 200,000 dollar salary?' Throughout the exchange, Warren remains silent, smiling as she walks and greets others. Her staff tries to escort the reporter away. When Warren approached her vehicle, she visibly got angry and elbowed the reporter. The video sparked a flood of outraged comments online, with many criticizing Warren as hypocritical and demanding she release her financial and tax records. Some even suggested the reporter should sue Warren for the assault. There are other Democrats in a similar situation to Warren, with unclear income sources and net assets far exceeding what would be expected of a U.S. civil servants. Recent data quoted by Musk shows that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has an annual salary of USD 223,000 but a net worth of USD 202 million. Current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer earns USD 210,000 annually, with a net worth of nearly USD 75 million. Some like certain left-wing critics question Musk's data and accuse it of being false information. However, when looking at open-source data and statistics published by authoritative research organizations like OpenSecrets, it becomes clear that these Democrats qualify as 'super-rich' under the standard definition, belonging to the wealthiest 1% of American society. For instance, OpenSecrets data shows that Pelosi's assets exceeded USD 100 million in 2018, reaching USD 115 million, while Warren had nearly USD 8 million in assets that same year. American people have known about these issues for a long time, and previous U.S. administrations were aware as well but chose to turn a blind eye and ignore them. Now, however, Musk's scrutiny has focused on this group of establishment Democrats, judges, and prosecutors, and this is causing quite a stir. The reason is that these individuals' income sources are problematic. During last year’s U.S. election, these establishment figures and people in the courts banded together to attack Trump. Recently, there have been reports showing that USAID provided large sums of money to an organization controlled by financial tycoon George Soros, which in turn funded a large number of prosecutors. Essentially, Soros’s organization was directing them to prosecute Trump during the election. It is said that the financial transactions of these institutions have already been exposed. Additionally, some argue that USAID, with its large amounts of unclear funding, is now the engine behind the U.S. left-wing culture, fueling many of the issues Musk and Trump are determined to change. The question is, what kind of result will Musk's current efforts lead to? A senior researcher from ANBOUND believes that these efforts by the non-establishment factions in the U.S. will actually create a new elite system. These new elites will no longer come from humble beginnings; they will already be wealthy, born into privileged families, and not rely on politics to make money. For them, holding political office is about contributing and serving. Take Musk himself as an example: a billionaire who works for zero salary, earning not a single penny, yet does his job tirelessly day and night, even sleeping in his office. A government made up of such people is what ANBOUND’s team has referred to as an 'elite government'. This is the government Musk aims to build. This, in essence, restores the old tradition of rule by nobles and elites. The only slight difference is people like JD Vance. From his autobiography Hillbilly Elegy, it is clear that Vance is an elite who grew up from humble beginnings. Through his own efforts, he escaped the poverty of the Rust Belt, attended Yale, worked in California, and gradually made his way into U.S. politics, eventually becoming vice president. However, one Vance alone might struggle to handle the vast governance system of a country like the U.S. Therefore Musk’s vision either needs more idealists to succeed, or it could end in failure and collapse. We can see that Musk’s recruitment for the DOGE is aimed at finding people like him. The department’s job posting on X outlines that applicants must have exceptionally high IQs and be willing to work over 80 hours a week, focusing on the tedious task of cost-cutting, with zero pay. This in effect reflects Musk’s own lifestyle and work philosophy. According to a report by Wired, the six young people in the department leading the charge for streamlining government are between 19 and 25 years old. Some are still in college, some started businesses during college, and others have interned at Musk’s companies or those of his friends. None of them have government experience, but they are experts in technology and algorithms. For example, Akash Bobba, of Indian-origin, has interned at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates, working in AI, data analysis, and financial modeling. Another example is Gavin Kliger, whose father graduated from Cornell University and works as a lawyer at the well-known credit reporting agency Experian. These prodigies come from privileged backgrounds, with strong starting points in life, good family circumstances, and little concern for wealth or salary. If a generation of capitalist giving-back, and dedicated 'new elites' truly emerges in the U.S., it would undoubtedly be a significant development in the field of political science. Musk’s efforts to build a 'super government' could gain increasing social support and gradually become part of the mainstream mindset. The outcome, of course, remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Musk’s push to create a super government will have an impact just as profound as his mission to land on Mars, and it will undoubtedly have a massive influence on the world. Final analysis conclusion: When a generation of capitalist giving-back, and dedicated 'new elites' truly emerges in the U.S., it will undoubtedly be a major event in political science. Musk's efforts to create a 'super government' may also gain increasing social support, gradually becoming part of the mainstream mindset.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ0y1G_ajCdhn	2025-02-24T16:13:11-08:00	
President Joe Biden’s Decision To Posthumously Pardon Marcus Garv...	By Lipton Matthews President Joe Biden’s decision to posthumously pardon Marcus Garvey has been met with widespread acclaim in the United States and across the global black diaspora. Garvey is revered as an iconic black nationalist and Pan-Africanist thinker, celebrated for his vision of racial uplift and economic self-sufficiency. However, his legacy is far more complex than the hagiographic portrayals suggest. Rather than echoing the usual fawning sentiments, this article will provide an overview of Garvey’s conviction and ideological framework. Garvey’s 1923 conviction for mail fraud remains one of the most controversial episodes in American history. As the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), he was accused of defrauding investors in his ambitious Black Star Line (BSL) shipping venture. However, his trial occurred in an extremely hostile environment. Due to his vocal criticisms of the white political establishment, J. Edgar Hoover had been determined to indict Garvey for fomenting discord as early as 1919. When initial attempts proved abortive Hoover pursued other means to secure a conviction, ultimately arguing Garvey’s management of the Black Star Line could possibly constitute fraud. To build a case, Hoover deployed agents to infiltrate the UNIA. FBI surveillance of Garvey played a key role in justifying his presidential pardon, but the legal basis for such a pardon is more nuanced. The trial judge, Julian Mack, was a known ally and contributor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), an organization that frequently clashed with Garvey. Members of the NAACP supported efforts to prosecute him, and just one day before the trial, the organization’s secretary, James Weldon Johnson, wrote to Mack, raising concerns about impartiality. Citing the precedent set in Berger v. United States, which permits judicial recusal based on extrajudicial factors, Garvey submitted a petition for Mack’s recusal, but it was denied. Faced with a stacked deck, Garvey dismissed his attorney after being advised to accept a plea bargain. This decision only worsened his situation, as Mack failed to ensure Garvey fully understood the consequences of waiving his right to legal representation. Further compounding the miscarriage of justice was the perjury of Schuyler Cargill, a key witness for the prosecution. Cargill claimed to have prepared mailings and made deliveries for the BSL between 1919 and 1921, yet he was unable to identify his supervisor or coworkers. His testimony was crucial, as Garvey’s conviction rested on the allegation that a letter was sent to Benny Dance encouraging him to buy shares in the BSL. However, Cargill later admitted that prosecutors had instructed him to lie about his employment. Also of relevance is Cargill’s declaration that the prosecutor showed him a copy of a circular that the court intended to present to him, which inevitably biased the proceedings. Despite these improprieties, Mack failed to flag Cargill’s testimony as improper, and the prosecution’s case remained intact. The trial’s dubious handling extended to Benny Dance, another prosecution witness. While he received mail from the UNIA, he admitted that he did not always read the contents and could not confirm whether any letter from Garvey urged him to invest. Strangely, the envelope presented in court was empty. Nevertheless, in mail fraud cases, the mere existence of an envelope can be sufficient for conviction, even if its contents remain unknown. It is not impossible for the perpetrator to erroneously post an empty mail, so the existence of an envelope is stronger evidence. Despite these unfavorable circumstances, Garvey appealed his conviction. While the original case was marred by prosecutorial misconduct and judicial bias, the failure of Garvey’s appeal was due to the incompetence of his appellate attorneys. Legal scholar Justin Hansford argues that Garvey’s defense team pursued an ineffective strategy. Instead of emphasizing the lack of intent to defraud, they argued that there was no proof Garvey had used US mail to facilitate fraud. Hansford contends that this was a flawed approach, as they should have known that there was no need to identify the contents of the envelope to establish that Garvey proposed a scheme to defraud. Moreover, Garvey’s own trial testimony did not contradict the prosecution’s assertion that he had solicited investments via mail. By advancing weak arguments, Garvey’s attorneys effectively endorsed the prosecution’s case. Hansford even stated that it would have been nonsensical for the court to overturn his conviction based on the arguments they proposed. Undeniably, Garvey’s original case was imperfect, hence he applied for an appeal to rescind the conviction which was unsuccessful due to the incompetence of his attorneys. Furthermore, one of the judges presiding over the appeal was Justice Learned Hand, who criticized the activism of Justice Mack, so the charge of judicial misconduct is inapplicable in this case. Therefore, Biden’s pardon was unnecessary since Garvey appealed and failed in his second attempt to exonerate his name. Further, Garvey’s defenders often overlook his own awareness that the Black Star Line was poorly managed and undermined by corrupt staffers. While FBI infiltration and sabotage played a role, the BSL resembled a Ponzi scheme destined for collapse. Disgruntled employees even claimed that he purchased overpriced ships and later used the vessels for propagandistic purposes to the detriment of profit. Due to the precarious financial situation of Garvey’s enterprises, he resorted to diverting funds budgeted for financing the shipping line to sponsor the Negro World and other businesses. Strapped for cash, Garvey failed to pay employees on time and summarily dismissed accountants who exposed his financial practices. The opinion expressed by the appellate court echoes the sentiments of many who thought that Garvey preyed on naive people: The substance of the indictment is that, while there center around Garvey other associations or corporations for their object the uplift and enhancement of the negro race, the entire scheme of uplift was used to persuade Negroes for the most part to buy shares of stock in the Black Star Line at $5 per share, when the defendants well knew, notwithstanding florid representations...that said shares could never be worth $5 cash. Beyond his legal troubles, Garvey’s ideological framework warrants scrutiny. His philosophy emphasized black self-reliance, entrepreneurship, and the establishment of an independent African homeland. However, his views also contained troubling elements. As A. James Gregor notes in Black Nationalism and Neofascism, Garvey’s rhetoric and organizational methods bore striking similarities to European fascist movements. Garvey even described himself as a fascist and claimed that Mussolini borrowed ideas from him. Like European fascists, he viewed racial and tribal conflicts as inevitable and saw militarism as essential. He also believed that racial groups should always be prepared for battle and expecting to win such battles without industrializing was futile. Additionally, as a tribal thinker, Garvey opposed the multi-racial state. Garvey promoted the concept of racial homelands. Unlike liberals, he felt that Africa was for Africans, Europe was for Europeans, and America was built by white people for their descendants. Garvey’s vision for an independent black state was unapologetically nationalist and anti-integrationist which made him an opponent of the NAACP’s integrationist agenda. Another similarity between Garveyism and fascism is the primacy of the nation-state as an avenue for economic and social advancement. Both Garveyism and early fascism posited that individuals achieved personal fulfillment through the state. Likewise, these philosophies countered Marxism by envisioning a managed form of capitalism that served the interests of the nation-state. A deep preference for strong states ruled by elites who wield immense power is another area where these philosophies find common ground. Garvey’s ideal state is closer to Plato’s Republic or Singapore than to America. Additionally, to inculcate national pride, Garveyism and fascism rely on historical myths. Hence, it is unsurprising that Garvey often informed his followers that Africans were a creative race whose ideas were stolen by whites. Garvey’s eccentricity heightens when the parallels between Garveyism and Hitlerism are explored. Fascism is an identitarian, though not exclusively racist movement like Hitlerism. Hitler and Garvey implored their followers to espouse racial truths. Garvey preached that all issues should be assessed using a racial framework. He was so committed to race that he encouraged blacks to embellish facts for the benefit of the race, even lying was permitted. Paradoxically, Garvey admired the Jews but nevertheless argued that they were tribal people who could not be trusted. Despite antisemitic sentiments, Garvey criticized how they were treated by Hitler. Notwithstanding his distrust of Jews, Garvey theorized that anti-Jewish hatred was premised on envy. Indeed, he was a complicated character though it must be noted that Garvey never recanted his affinity for the generic ideas of Mussolini and Hitler, he only lambasted them when it seemed that their projects were antithetical to blacks. Garvey himself was an imperialist with plans to colonize the 'primitive tribes' of Africa, he only disliked the thought of Hitler and Mussolini colonizing blacks. Particularly controversial were Garvey’s interactions with the Ku Klux Klan. While ostensibly his dialogues with the Klan were pragmatic—rooted in a shared belief in racial separatism—they alienated many black leaders. Garvey and Klan members were natural allies because they preferred racial homelands. Klan members appreciated that Garvey was a racial separatist who wanted blacks to reside in their own state. Furthermore, contrary to popular narratives, Garvey was not a civil rights activist in the mold of Martin Luther King, Jr. or W.E.B. Du Bois. He did not advocate for racial integration or equality under a shared national identity. Quite appropriately, Garvey argued that blacks should create alternatives to white institutions, instead of depending on their benevolence. When Jim Crow laws irritated other blacks, Garvey remarked that Americans’ transportation infrastructure was built by whites for their consumption. Garvey was a conservative philosopher in the Western tradition with racist worldviews and thinking otherwise indicates delusion. Garvey’s legacy is also marred by violence within his movement. Thomas Lennon’s research indicates that UNIA members frequently resorted to attacking critics. In 1922, Cincinnati UNIA leader William Ware and three associates assaulted black educator Samuel Saxon for opposing Garvey. In 1923, Garvey’s African Legion member Charles Linous was imprisoned for making death threats during the trial. UNIA members were also accused of killing Garvey’s rivals, including Reverend James Eason, who had intended to testify against him and Laura Coffey. Garveyism is laced with negativities, however his work contains positive elements. Garvey’s emphasis on economic empowerment, professional development, and anti-corrupt leadership remains deeply relevant. While his racialist views appear problematic, his moral vision and entrepreneurial spirit inspire admiration. Despite being a black nationalist, Garvey was never afraid to tell blacks that other groups would continue to outperform them unless they improved themselves. Neither did he refrain from chastising them for expecting to get rich overnight, when entrepreneurial success requires years of hard work. While his flirtations with fascism and racial separatism merit scrutiny, his pioneering advocacy for black self-reliance and economic independence continues to resonate. Garvey’s legacy offers a roadmap for empowerment, leadership, and self-determination when stripped of its contentious elements.

The Party Is Over – OpEd	The Trump administration, pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency and deployed by the Office of Personnel Management, has sent another email to all federal employees with a normal request to present five tasks accomplished in the last week. It’s an easy task. It takes 5 minutes. In the service industry, this is entirely normal, even routine. Taking inventory of the workforce is standard for any new management in the private sector. Oddly, absolute mania broke out among the pundit class. Government unions are preparing lawsuits. The panic and frenzy is palpable. As it turns out, no new president has ever done anything like this before, no Democrat who believes in good government and no Republican who supposedly distrusts bureaucracy. Something dramatic has hit Washington. It’s about more than Trump. The party now in control of the US executive branch is a third party built out of the corpses of two existing parties. It goes by the name Republican but this is nearly a historical accident. The GOP was a vessel that was least protected against invasion and occupation. It has now been nearly taken over by outsiders who had little or no influence within the party a decade ago. Nearly all the top people now in power – including Trump of course but also Musk, Gabbard, Kennedy, Lutnick, and so many more, to say nothing of the voters themselves – are refugees from the Democratic Party. Coalitions have dramatically changed. Voting blocs have migrated. And policy debates and priorities are nothing like they have been in any period since the end of the Great War. The occupiers left a Democratic Party that was and is busy consuming itself with Rousseauian frenzies on issues about which most people do not care or are otherwise completely opposed. The legacy establishment of the Republican Party, however, never welcomed them in. They were hated and resisted at every step. The Kennedy Migration To understand the remarkable speed and trajectory of this creation of a third party within the structure of two, consider that it was not even two years ago when Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was first contemplating running for president as a Democrat. The conditions were unique. He had gained an enormous following for his courage during Covid, standing up against the lockdowns, speaking out against the censorship and rights violations, and then decrying the imposition of shots that achieved nothing for public health. In 2023, President Biden was unpopular and not even credible as the chief executive, much less as a candidate for a second term. The thinking in the Kennedy camp at the time was that a run by Kennedy for the Democratic nomination would force an open primary and he could lead the party back to its roots, away from woke totalitarianism toward the political values of his father and uncle. In theory, all of this seemed plausible. His first rallies were crowded events, and the money poured in. Volunteers were signing up to work for the campaign. The first ads that appeared were nostalgic of a lost time, an America before the shattering of civic culture that came with the assassination of his uncle in 1963. The framing and even music of his campaign reflected such themes. If anyone could fix the Democrats, it was surely Kennedy with a lifetime of activism and experience in litigation against corporate capture of agencies, plus a recent campaign for human rights and free speech. The presumption here was that the Democrats had some base of support that still supported such values. And maybe that was right but his intentions ran headlong into the machinery of party leadership. His intention was to challenge Trump for the presidency, and the basis of the challenge was rather obvious. It was, after all, under Trump’s watch that the lockdowns began and the legal apparatus that led to the dangerous shots was deployed. It was Trump who kicked off the economic crisis with wave after wave of stimulus payments plus monetary expansion. As an empirical matter, he had presided over the worst invasion of rights of any president in history. That’s where matters stood only two years ago. When it became obvious that there would be no open primary, Kennedy was tempted by the lure of an independent run. The most immediate problem of gaining ballot access hit hard. The system, after all, is set up for two parties only and they want no competition unless such an effort works as a spoiler. That was not obvious with Kennedy – he drew equally from both sides – so everyone with power wanted him excluded. The other problem traces to the undeniable logic of winner-take-all elections. Under Duverger’s law, such contests tend to default to two choices only. This logic applies not just to politics but to all systems of voting. If you offer guests at a party the chance to vote on dinner, but the majority will prevail over the minority, everyone will immediately shift from voting for what they like toward voting against the food they hate the most. For some reason, this pattern of strategic voting is hardly mentioned in polite company but it is a reality in US politics. Voters select against the candidate they fear the most and for the person they believe can win to forestall the worst possible outcome. In the Kennedy case, then, it meant that no matter how much people loved him, they would end up supporting either Biden or Trump regardless. It so happened that over the summer, this logic was pressing itself heavily on the Kennedy campaign even as Trump faced astonishing levels of deep-state lawfare plus an assassination attempt, which conjured up deep family trauma in Kennedy. This provoked some discussions between the two that resulted in a historic realignment in politics. During these discussions, Trump was frank about what happened during the Covid period. He had been lied to by his bureaucracy, the experts who had been assigned to him to say that this virus was a bioweapon with possible cure in the form of a new vaccine. With great reluctance and only for a limited time did he approve what everyone, including family members and conservative pundits, was telling him to do. As for Warp Speed, Trump had always considered it to be an aggressive push for a solution. International and domestic sources named Hydroxychloroquine as a workable therapeutic, and so he ordered it for mass distribution. It was essentially inconceivable in those days that the deeper bureaucracy would not only remove it and other repurposed drugs from distribution but even generate fake studies warning against them, all in an effort to push the new pharmaceutical product. Trump was surely astonished to see these events unfold in a manner that he could not control. In that connection, both Trump and RFK, Jr. agreed on the dangers to American health from a variety of sources, including that emanating from the overuse of pharmaceuticals. Trump learned from Kennedy’s expertise on this matter, and they experienced a meeting of minds. And not only on this but on the evils of captured agencies, censorship, and deep state manipulation of public culture in general. They would never agree on issues of oil and gas, of course, but on that topic too Kennedy had been moved by the Covid years to reconsider the supposed science behind climate change, especially that which recommended more human suffering as a means of solving a supposed existential threat. We may never know the fullness of what took place over those two days but the discussions changed history, bringing together two mighty forces in American culture that had long been separated by party label and tribal identity: bourgeois nationalism vs. the haut bourgeois crunchy liberalism of the Whole Foods set. As it turned out, they had a common enemy. Now Kennedy is the new head of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which is now undertaking the largest attempt at routing the DC establishment since Andrew Jackson. His goal is to turn around the whole ship of state, industry, and science, away from fakery and industrial corruption emanating from a single focus on infectious disease toward a new focus on chronic disease with science-based and natural solutions. That is a herculean task. The Musk Migration Elon Musk is the third force within this leadership triumvirate of the new party. Before 2020, he was a politically conventional investor and entrepreneur. Mostly he associated with the default party of the elites, the Democrats. Then lockdowns came. He was the only major corporate leader in the US and probably anywhere in the industrialized world who publicly stood up in protest. He said he would sooner sleep on the floor of his factory than close it. He refused vaccine mandates in all his companies. He pulled Tesla out of California and moved it to Texas. He moved all his corporate registrations out of Delaware. By 2023, he was a changed man, newly aware of the threat of Leviathan, and did a deep dive into anti-statist literature. He faced his own family battles over woke ideology, and this made his intellectual transformation complete. He entered the political season with a new consciousness. Whereas he once regarded the bureaucracy as annoyingly necessary, he increasingly viewed it as the source of unchecked tyranny. At one level, the meetup of Trump and Musk – like the meetup of Trump and Kennedy – was completely implausible. Musk regarded his greatest achievement as a businessman as having made the most mighty contribution to clean energy yet, having broken up the automotive monopoly and mass-produced the first commercially viable electric car. Trump, on the other hand, had sworn to smash electric car subsidies and called for deregulation of oil and gas. To link up with Trump meant having to put at risk even the tax break for consumers of EVs. But he was ready for that simply because, like Kennedy, he became convinced that Western civilization itself was at risk from a woke Leviathan that had shown its teeth in the most brutal way during the Covid years. His reason for purchasing Twitter for $44 billion was to bust up the censorship cartel that was constructed to enforce lockdowns and promote the vaccine. Once having taken over, he discovered the extent of government control, uprooted it, and unleashed free speech on the US. Here again, Musk shared this concern with Kennedy and Trump. All three linked up on the crucial issues: the desperate need to curb and crush the power and reach of the administrative state. This is an issue that crosses left and right, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, and all other traditional categories. The Gabbard Migration In this connection, there was also the national security angle in which decades of neoconservative 'forever wars' had bred resentment and failure abroad, thus bringing over the articulate Tulsi Gabbard from the Democrats to Trump’s side, together with other influencers like Pete Hegseth who saw traditional military concerns having given way to woke ideology that Musk despised and Kennedy found to be deeply corrupting of traditional liberal concerns. Their interests dovetailed with the revolt against globalism generally, which had taken the form of endless unwinnable wars, unchecked spigots of foreign aid, taxpayer pillaging in the form of subsidies to international syndicates of NGOs and agencies, plus the cruel deployment of immigration as a tool of electoral manipulation. It was the immigration point that triggered the populist push for the new nationalism that gathered in new refugees from the antiwar sectors of the left and right. Donald Trump himself has undergone his own migration. An industrial mercantilist from his earliest public statements, he gradually absorbed a de facto anti-statism once his ill-fated first term was subverted from within and then he faced unprecedented lawfare and even assassination attempts to stop his second term. When he told the Libertarian Party that this lawfare made him a libertarian in spirit, he was being truthful. Once it became personal, the new head of state effectively turned against the state and all its works. These are all circuitous paths but they reached the point of having huge influence over the public mind in the wake of the Covid years that discredited existing elites and prepared the way for a completely new way of going about government and public life. Given the meme culture of our time, this new party went by various names, first MAGA and then MAHA and then DOGE (in homage to the meme coin that started as a joke and then became real). MAGA/MAHA/DOGE is not exactly the catchiest name for the new ruling party but it is far more accurate than Republican, much less Democrat. It is a new party formed out of the discredited shells of the two existing parties that lost public trust over decades of misrule culminating in an ill-fated attempt to master the exigencies of the microbial kingdom. In a Kuhnian sense, the collapse of the orthodox paradigm (rule by administrative agencies informed by captured science) was complete by 2023, preparing the way for the pre-paradigmatic coalition of these fascinating characters, backed by popular movements that are mirrored in many lands, and generally sailing under the flag of populism. And here is the crucial fact: these leaders have their reach, influence, and power because the causes they represent have come of age with a population completely fed up with misrule by experts. These are new and highly promising times, as the old undergoes a merciful dismantling and something entirely new takes its place. We find the roots of the ideology of the administrative state in the works of Woodrow Wilson, and it takes only a few minutes of reading his deluded fantasies of how science and compulsion would forge a better world to see that it was only a matter of time before the whole experiment was in tatters. It took more than a century but that day is finally here. The paradigm has shifted. For all the messiness and frenzy – including the chaos, confusion, and betrayals – our times at least present opportunity to reassert a foundational principle of the Enlightenment; namely that the people themselves should have some fluid and influential role in shaping the workings of the regime under which they are forced to live.

Now Is The Time For L.A. To End Single-Family Zoning – OpEd	By David Youngberg Los Angeles needs more housing. Now, more than ever. The fires that roared through the city in January 2025 were nothing short of devastating, with over 16,000 structures destroyed and an estimated 150,000 people displaced. In the wake of the disaster, victims scoured the still-hot wreckage for scraps of their former lives. The immensity of their loss was only dwarfed by its suddenness. And then there’s the rent. The mass destruction of homes exacerbated L.A.’s already pricey housing market. Rents substantially shot up, sometimes more than doubling. As is often the case in the aftermath of disaster, the public demanded that the government freeze prices. Disasters create the political will necessary to enact sweeping reforms, but rent control is the wrong approach because it discourages construction and causes more harm than good. Fortunately the city has not (yet) gone down this route. The California Coastal Commission is also waiving permit requirements to rebuild lost homes. But that will only return L.A. to the terrible housing market before the fires. The city should instead end single-family zoning so a better, more affordable city can rise out of the ashes. Supply and Demand Determine the Price of Housing Most people don’t know how the housing market works. The same people who understand that more cars will cut car prices and more grain will cut grain prices will flatly deny that more housing will cut housing prices. As Michael Munger once wrote, 'The mind…boggles.' It’s not as if landlords suddenly discovered money is good at precisely the same time a bunch of homes were destroyed. As 'price gougers' can 'take advantage' of people because there are so few options, they would have trouble 'getting away' with 'jacking up prices' if there were more options. If mass destruction increases the price of housing, mass creation will reduce it. The question becomes: How can L.A. radically increase its housing stock? Zoning Laws Choke Off Availability Even before the fires, Los Angeles was not a cheap place to live, with an average home price of just shy of a million dollars. Most of the price tag came from the land the house was on. This is how homes less than a thousand square feet can go for over half a million dollars. Multiple households on the same lot assuage the land cost burden. A 20-unit building on land worth half a million means each unit’s price goes up by $25,000. That’s not a trivial amount of money, but it’s far less than the unit’s construction costs. Unfortunately, in most of the places people want to live, it’s illegal for multiple households to live on the same land. Single-family zoning—one house per lot—means one family has to pay the entire price tag for the land, and the housing price is thus also high. Single-family zoning forces people to waste precious land. Single-family zoning is dreadfully common. Like in many places in the United States, areas where it’s illegal to build affordable housing dominate—an astonishing 75% of L.A.’s residential land is zoned for single-family homes. Before burnt-out housing drove up rents, unbuilt housing was the culprit. Single-family zoning isn’t the only reason there are so few places to live—parking requirements, historic districts, permitting processes, minimum lot sizes, and other barriers make it all worse—but ending single-family zoning is a great place to start rethinking the housing market. Chicago Rebuilt Better Destruction is terrible, but if you have to rebuild, rebuild thoughtfully. This is exactly what Chicago did after the Great Fire of 1871. Much like the L.A. fires, extremely dry weather and strong winds transformed a small flame into a city-consuming inferno. Chicago’s fire raged for 30 hours, destroying over 17,000 buildings and leaving a third of the population homeless. As in L.A., it was fueled by a forest of wooden homes. Chicago was too well-located to abandon, and investment poured in. Under new regulations that we’d consider common sense, the Great Rebuilding remade the Windy City. It’s no coincidence Chicago soon became home to the world’s first skyscraper, with its unburnable metal frame and massive windows (more sunlight meant fewer candles). More followed. The city rose like a phoenix, far surpassing its previous population and earning fame for its cutting-edge architecture. Los Angeles Can, Too As Chicago recognized it had too few regulations, L.A. should recognize it has too many. Now is a perfect opportunity to unmoor its residents from a system that drives up housing prices. Greater density may be a hard pill for Angelenos to swallow, but even the widespread adoption of the humble duplex would drastically increase the number of units without any increase in fire danger. Greater affordability will help combat homelessness and the fires that come with it. Los Angeles doesn’t have to take a radical position to make major progress. As L.A. residents rebuild and recover, let us hope they don’t miss the lesson: as mass destruction brought rents up, mass construction will bring rents down.

Iran: Factional Infighting Grips Regime As Economic Crisis Deepen...	With the expansion of protests in Iran and the social repercussions of the dire increase in prices and unsolvable imbalances, the regime’s internal crisis has reached a new stage. Regime president Masoud Pezeshkian, describing the dispute between the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Oil, referred to the proverb of a hard ground and butting bulls, saying: 'These ministers of ours sometimes fall short in the oil, electricity, and gas sectors, so they blame each other. We are really facing problems in electricity and gas supply right now. Reserves have also decreased; one won’t give, and the other won’t send reserves. And there’s no way to send reserves at all. The ground is hard; we can’t plow it, so we butt heads with each other' (state-run TV, February 13, 2025). The first days of Esfand (the last month in the Iranian calendar, corresponds to February 20 – March 20) and Bahman 30 (February 18) saw two consecutive sessions of the regime’s parliament (Majlis), where regime officials expressed fear of a 'revolution of the hungry' and the sinking of the regime’s ship. MP Qasem Ravanbakhsh, while admitting to the smoldering embers of poverty in society, said, 'These days, the bones of the people, especially the poor, are being crushed under the wheels of the government’s economic adjustment. In previous administrations, when the exchange rate increased, the government and parliament would think of a solution, but now that the dollar has reached over 900,000 rials and gold coins are over 70 million rials, and medicine, rice, legumes, meat, and essential goods have skyrocketed, no action is seen from the government to control it.' Javad Nikbin, another member of the parliament, while expressing concern about the explosive state of society and 'the events that are happening,' addressed the regime’s president, saying: 'These events happening in the country are not the result of sanctions but the result of your wrong decisions in foreign policy, elections, appointments, and all these areas… Twelve hours of motor-pump shutdowns a day means the farmer is ruined. Twelve hours of shutdowns a day means millions of farmers across the country are unemployed… Friends know, government officials know, Minister of Oil, Minister of Energy, know that the price of oil, gas, and electricity has increased by more than 1,500 percent from Mehr (September/October) to today…' MP Ahad Beitoteh, while warning about the deadly effects of the livelihood crisis for the regime, said, 'People are tired of empty promises… Unfortunately, in recent months, we have witnessed an unreasonable and uncontrollable increase in the prices of essential goods, especially items that have the greatest impact on people’s livelihoods… Minister of Economy! Mr. [Abdolnaser] Hemmati! You said that we would raise the Nima dollar (a subsidized exchange rate for importers) to lower the free market dollar price, but you broke the record for the speed of the dollar’s increase. After three months, you have made gold and foreign currency more than 50 percent more expensive. Medicine and essential goods have become more expensive; in less than three months, you have reduced people’s purchasing power by 50 percent…' Amid the factional infighting, Kamran Ghazanfari, a member of the parliament’s Internal Affairs Committee, announced that members of parliament had filed complaints against Pezeshkian and Mohammad Javad Zarif, Pezeshkian’s Vice President for Strategic Affairs, in the Administrative Justice Court and the Supreme Court of the regime. A significant number of members of parliament also demanded the impeachment of Pezeshkian’s Minister of Economy, Hemmati. MP Hamid Rasaee went a step further, saying, 'Do not impeach Mr. Hemmati. Prosecute him. This is the only way if you want to be honorable before history, before the people, prosecute Mr. Hemmati.' Finally, on February 19, Ahmad Naderi, a member of the parliament’s presiding board, said, 'The impeachment of the Minister of Economy has been submitted to the presiding board by the Economic Commission after necessary reviews, and therefore, with 91 signatures, it has been declared received, and the chairman of the session (Hamidreza Haji Babaei) announced March 2 as the day of impeachment.' In the same session, MP Mohammad Reza Sabaghian set aside politeness and, while warning about the sinking of the entire regime in the swamp of crises, said, 'What is the council of the heads of the three branches doing for critical issues?… Mr. Pezeshkian, you are also clinging to branches and leaves; you will also stop at the same station where previous governments stopped. Dear ones! Let’s not be polite; this ship is sinking. We will realize it when it goes underwater!'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ-6mFSNniVz8	2025-02-24T16:06:08-08:00	
Gaza’s Reconstruction Roadblock: The Unresolved Role Of Hamas – A...	By Kabir Taneja Gulf powers in the Middle East are locked in a sprint towards coming up with a viable plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and upkeep as President Donald Trump takes charge in Washington, and mobilises pressureby threatening a take-over of the strip by the US. Trump’s plan includes a 'relocation and resettlement of the population in Gaza to safer, neighbouring nations' such as Egypt and Jordan, and in return subsequently transforming the contentious piece of land into a 'riviera of the Middle East'. Trump’s quintessential take—viewing Gaza more as a real-estate problem than a deep-rooted geopolitical crisis, especially at the nucleus of many Middle Eastern fissures— has, if nothing else, forced Arab powers into an urgent huddle. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait recently met in Riyadh to try and reinvigorate an Arab-led blueprint for the Palestinian crisis as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza continues. How serious Trump is regarding his view of the displacement and reinstatement of a population is up for debate. But the relatively casual tone of narratives flowing in from the White House has certainly ruffled enough feathers to mobilise regional powers, ahead of the emergency Arab Summit in Cairo, Egypt on 4 March 2025, to further discuss Gaza’s reconstruction plan. However, the core issue in the Gaza context today is not simply reconstruction and rebuilding, but also the political future of the strip and the Palestinian cause. Questions about the political leadership of the Palestinians, beyond Hamas, remain critical. Currently, there is neither clarity, direction nor any movement to address this core conundrum. While Hamas has been dealt multiple blows over the past year and a half, including the planned assassination of its top leadership, it seems to be holding on to its influence despite Israel’s stated vision of eliminating the group. This is only coupled with the fact that any potential replacement of Hamas, at least in a public forum, has not been seriously discussed regionally. Replacing Hamas as both a political and military influence in Gaza will not be a simple endeavour even though the militant group itself is responsible for much of Gaza’s suffering. While Israel’s heavy-handedness in using disproportionate force since October 2023 has flattened Gaza into a nearly unrecognisable geography, Hamas is still quite functional. It recently clocked Public Relations (PR) wins on the sidelines of prisoner exchanges as part of the ceasefire agreement and a broader distinction of the idea of ‘resistance’ from ‘terror’ in many sections of public discourse. Its other sibling, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) during a recent visit to Iran added to the complexities as PIJ’s Chief Ziad al-Nakhala reaffirmed his commitment towards the 'path of resistance'. For the Arab powers, the path forward is undeniably fraught. The financial practicality behind Gaza’s reconstruction, in injecting both political and economic sponsorships, is not as difficult for several of these cash-rich states. However, to remould Palestinian politics to future-proof it against a military-first posture and simultaneously be cognizant of Israel’s security interests has multiple layers attached to it. The path forward would ideally demand both compromises and clarity from all parties involved, a task easier said than done. To begin with, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE may need to leverage their access with Iran in an institutional manner, aiming to ease Tehran’s support for Hamas, PIJ, and Hezbollah. Thereafter, Israel would have to be brought in, and at the very basic, its sovereignty-led security needs would have to be realistically addressed. Whether this translates into a two-state solution or not, remains the fundamental question. On paper, no other outcomes exist, and any other disruption in the status quo in all likeliness will not be a solution, but a bandaid at best. The underlying question now remains, whether a solution should be sought, or is the status-quo consolidating benefits to only a few, the preferred choice. The regional competition, which has benefited from the Palestinian flux, by working in a both short-term favourable capacity and often against regional players, including Arab states, will also have to deal with big power competition. This is an added spanner in the proverbial peace wheel. China has already thrown its support behind an Arab-led pro-Palestine two-state solution. Russia, however, is on the ropes. The overnight collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria not only dented Moscow’s political clout, but geographically, has also pushed it to the peripheries of the region whilst mediating with the new regime of Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus to regain control of its lost military bases on the country’s Mediterranean coast. Simultaneously, a Donald Trump–Vladimir Putin détente is not only putting Europe on the edge but Iran as well. Such a speculation is driven by Iran’s well-defined fears that its long-standing ally in Moscow could give America concessions for long-term strategic gain in the European continent in exchange for leverage over Tehran, particularly at the United Nations Security Council. In all the aforementioned kerfuffle, the future of Palestinian politics rests in a grey zone. Any attempt to dismantle the grip of Hamas Gaza would have to be a long-winded process. Militarily, an outright elimination may not be possible. Politically, subsuming Hamas into a broader Palestinian process is perhaps an even graver challenge, with the group’s penchant to fight even within the Palestinian systems to ensure its hegemony remains undeterred. Finally, the Arab world finds itself in a spot of bother. It ideally wants Hamas gone, but equally expects to not be held responsible for any long-term or even permanent displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza. This is not only because of what may be the right thing to do from an Arab perspective, but also because any perception of their collusion over such an act could become a direct challenge to the leader’s authority, especially if the issue galvanises the street and public sentiment beyond a point. Envisioning the next four years, Trump is now imploring Europeans to think more deeply about their own security viz-a-viz Russia, and Arabs to take more responsibility for regional dynamics viz-a-viz Israel and Palestine. This disruption in particular, may not be entirely detrimental in the long run.

Centrist Coalition, More Debt: Merz Rushes To Lock In A Deal	By Jonathan Packroff and Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- Fresh off his election win, Friedrich Merz wasted no time on Monday, pushing to form a government with the Social Democrats that could unlock new security spending even before a new coalition is officially sealed. Merz’s Christian Democrats won Sunday’s German election with a big lead, but must now find a coalition partner. As expected beforehand, the party’s lead candidate quickly turned to the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of the incumbent Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, as his preferred partner. 'We will now be holding talks [with the SPD] over the next few days,' Merz told journalists at the CDU headquarters in Berlin on Monday, naming foreign and security policy, managing migration, and boosting Germany's industry as priority topics. Merz was due to talk to Lars Klingbeil, the SPD’s co-leader, the same day and added he would also speak to Scholz to coordinate during the transition. Klingbeil, who is by some accounts the party’s new figurehead as Scholz announced his imminent departure, played hard to get on Monday, saying it was not a given that the SPD would join a coalition. But he also added: 'We're ready to hold talks.' The election result leaves few other options for a stable, centrist government, as the centre was squeezed in Sunday’s ballot. The seat share of parties on the centre-left and centre-right dropped by a third compared to the last election in 2021. A coalition of the Greens and the CDU falls short of a majority, while the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) failed to re-enter parliament. The centre-right bloc would have a majority with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), but Merz again ruled out formal cooperation on Sunday. The centre's losses created an even more pressing headache for Merz regarding delivering on his Sunday night promise to bolster Germany’s defence and help make Europe independent of US protection and the erratic new president, Donald Trump. The necessary investment will be hard to fund within the boundaries of Germany’s strict constitutional debt rules. To reach NATO’s spending target of 2% alone, €95 billion annually would be needed as of 2028, according to Munich-based Ifo Institute – almost double the current defence budget. For a potential 3% target, €140 billion would be needed. But to change the constitution, a two-thirds majority is needed in the German parliament, which the centrist parties CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens narrowly failed to reach. Old rules are changing With the clock ticking, Berlin scrambled on Monday to avoid tying the hands of the new government before it takes office, which could usher in a rare and controversial move. The Greens suggested calling a snap Bundestag meeting within the next 30 days, while the parliament is officially still in session within the bounds of its previous composition, to allow for new debt and defence investment. Both Merz and Scholz signalled they were open to the approach. One option would be to agree to reform the ‘debt brake’, a constitutional deficit limit, that would increase fiscal leeway, including for defence. The debt brake, introduced in 2009, restricts structural public deficits to 0.35% of GDP, but has come under fire recently for stifling investment into infrastructure and Germany’s defence. Alternatively, the government could create an extra-budgetary special fund outside the limits of the debt brake, that can be adopted via a two-thirds majority. Such a special fund of €100 billion was created after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but will have dried up by 2027. Officially, the CDU aims to maintain the debt limit, but Merz signalled openness for reform during the campaign. The SPD, meanwhile, is in favour of reform, arguing previously that higher defence spending should not come at the expense of pensioners, the welfare state, or other public investment. Notably, Markus Söder, the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), echoed those talking points on Monday, saying, 'It won't be possible to organise our defence by just cutting back everything' and causing 'social tension.' Merz could also opt for difficult negotiations with The Left in the new parliament. The far-left party has left the door open to jointly reform the debt brake but opposes higher defence spending. But given the perceived urgency of the situation and the squeeze of the centre, the old rules seem to be changing rapidly. Merz said his priority was to end the state of crisis in Germany and win back trust after a difficult three-year period. 'Some of you will share the view that this term could be one of the last chances to achieve this,' he told journalists.

The World Bank And IMF Await Elon Musk – OpEd	I think that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have been misinformed. I don’t disagree with their shutting down USAID, but I think it’s rather small fry. There are much, much bigger fish to fry if you want to really save U.S. government money that is being wasted in programs that are mischievously justified as aid to the poor people of the world. Elon, hear me out: if you walk northwest from your headquarters at the Eisenhower Executive Building along Pennsylvania Avenue, you’ll come after one long block upon two ugly buildings squatting beside each other. One is the World Bank. The other is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). You can actually just walk in and demand to look at their books since they are extensions of the U.S. government. And you would have a very good reason to do so, since these are two of the most questionable and controversial institutions directly or indirectly funded with U.S. taxpayers’ money. Let me start with the World Bank, which is located at 1818 H St NW. This institution has so-called development projects throughout the Global South, otherwise known as developing countries. This agency says that its mission is to end poverty in the developing world. To fulfill this goal, its lending has risen from nearly $55 billion in 2015 to $117.5 billion in 2024. Yet, despite this massive increase, the Bank admits that global poverty reduction 'has slowed to a near standstill, with 2020-2030 set to be a lost decade.' Some 3.5 billion people, or 44 percent of the globe, remain poor, after decades of massive World Bank lending. And a major part of the reason is that World Bank programs have created poverty instead of alleviating it. Living in Luxury While 'Fighting Poverty' To manage its operations, the Bank’s full-time staff rose from nearly 12,000 in 2015 to over 13,000 in 2023. These figures are just the tip of the iceberg. If one includes all employees—permanent, non-permanent, contractual, part-time—throughout the world, the Bank employs close to 41,000 people. The vast majority, 26,000, or 63 percent, work out of the World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC, and only 3,200 are located in Africa, where most people in extreme poverty live. The Bank’s economists and top administrators are among the highest paid financial functionaries in the world, which explains the reason why the Bank is a major cause of the brain drain from developing countries: a great number of highly trained economists from developing countries prefer to work at the Bank instead of their home countries, with some going straight from Ivy League or British graduate schools to Washington, DC. Many within the Bank and the International Monetary Fund complain about the 'South Asian Mafia' that they claim controls employment opportunities for economists and higher-level staff in the two organizations. The World Bank has come under fire for the billions it has spent supporting fossil-fuel projects throughout the Third World that have contributed to global warming and to mega-dam projects that have displaced millions. The Bank, along with the Fund, has also gained notoriety for imposing 'structural adjustment' programs guided by the radical principles of the 'Washington Consensus' that are designed to promote globalization but have, instead, increased poverty and deepened inequality. The reason World Bank projects and programs don’t work or create exactly the opposite of their intended goals is because they are based on questionable propositions built on little or no empirical evidence. An assessment made a few years ago by an all-star team of renowned economists led by Princeton’s Angus Deaton, a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economics, was damning: [The] panel had substantial criticisms of the way that the research was used to proselytize on behalf of Bank policy, often without taking a balanced view, and without expressing appropriate skepticism. Internal research that is favorable to Bank positions was given great prominence, and unfavorable research ignored. In these cases, we believe that there was a serious failure of checks and balances that should have separated advocacy and research. The panel endorses the right of the Bank to strongly defend and advocate its own policies. But when the Bank leadership selectively appeals to relatively new and untested research as hard evidence that thes preferred policies work, it lends unwarranted confidence to the Bank’s prescriptions. Placing fragile selected new research results on a pedestal invites later recrimination that undermines the credibility and usefulness of all Bank research. The Bank’s refusal to acknowledge real-world refutations of its pro-globalization advocacy and its unbalanced, one-sided research led to justifiable rejection of its advice by the people who were suffering from the policies it was implementing, confessed Paul Collier, head of the Bank’s Research Development Department of the Bank from 1998 to 2003: The profession has been unprofessional, fearful that any criticism would strengthen populism, so that little work has been done on the downsides of these different processes [of globalization]. Yet the downsides were apparent to ordinary citizens, and the effect of economists appearing to dismiss them has resulted in widespread refusal of people to listen to 'experts.' For my profession to re-establish credibility we must provide a more balanced analysis, in which the downsides are acknowledged and properly evaluated with a view to designing policy responses that address them. The profession may be better served by mea culpa than by further indignant defenses of globalization. Despite the high rate of failure of its lending programs acknowledged in internal World Bank assessments, the World Bank administrative budget that supports the high salaries of its economists and other high-level staff just keeps growing. The World Bank (IBRD/IDA) administrative budget was approved at $3.5 billion for FY25, a sizable rise from the $3.1 billion authorized for FY 2024, with no convincing reason at all. The IMF and the Art of Worsening Financial Crises The International Monetary Fund, whose address is 700 19th St NW, is the World Bank’s sister agency. It has a full-time staff of 3,100, supported by a budget of $1.5 billion. The IMF’s economists are paid even higher than those at the World Bank, and they evoke more fear, hatred, and contempt than the Bank. The IMF has an equally controversial history. It has a record of coming in to supposedly assist developing economies in crisis, only to make things worse. Its greatest debacle and scandal was its performance during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, when the so-called 'tiger economies 'of the East and Southeast Asia were destabilized by the massive inflows and outflows of foreign portfolio investment. The Fund was heavily criticized on three counts. First, it had encouraged the governments of the region to eliminate capital controls, thus provoking uncontrolled capital flows. Second, it assembled multi-billion dollar 'rescue packages' that went to rescue not the people suffering from the crisis but to compensate the foreign financial speculators that had lost millions in dubious speculative ventures, thus encouraging 'moral hazard,' or irresponsible investing. Third, its measures to stabilize the damaged economies intensified the crisis, since instead of encouraging government spending to counteract the collapse of private sector, it told the governments to radically cut spending, leading to a 'procyclical' negative synergy that ended in deep recession. In just a few weeks, one million people in Thailand and 22 million in Indonesia fell below the poverty line. The only country that contained the crisis was Malaysia, which refused to follow the Fund’s dictates and imposed capital and currency controls So disastrous were the IMF’s interventions that George Schultz, President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of the Treasury, called for its abolition for encouraging moral hazard, and prominent economists like Jagdish Bhagwati and Jeffrey Sachs accused it of provoking global macroeconomic instability. Indeed, a rare conservative-liberal alliance in the U.S. Congress came within a hair’s breath of denying the IMF a $14.5 billion replenishment. Eventually, the Fund was forced to admit that the 'thrust of fiscal policy…turned out to be substantially different…because the original assumptions for economic growth, capital flows, and exchange rates…were proved drastically wrong.' But things were never the same again. The IMF was so reviled for its performance that Asian governments developed IMF-phobia, swearing never again to ask the IMF for rescue even in the most dire circumstances. For instance, after paying off what Thailand owed the IMF, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared the country 'liberated' from the Fund in 2004. Instead of learning from its debacle during the Asian Financial Crisis, the IMF stumbled into another fiasco more than a decade later, during the Global Financial Crisis. It allowed itself to be hijacked by Germany, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank to provide billions of public money to rescue German financial institutions and investors that had engaged in an orgy of irresponsible lending to Greece to the tune of 25 billion euros. To get the so-called rescue funds, the Greek government, like the Asian governments previously, was forced to adopt severe austerity measures that drove unemployment up to 28 percent and condemned the Greek economy to permanent stagnation, only to turn the money it was ostensibly receiving over to the German banks. Not surprisingly, so long as the IMF is there, the big international banks will assume that they will be bailed out for making irresponsible loans. The U.S. and the Bretton Woods Twins: Fiction and Fact There is a fiction that the IMF and World Bank are multilateral institutions that are owned by their many member governments. The reality is that the United States controls both institutions, with a 17.4 percent share of total quotas at the Fund and 15.8 per cent share of voting power at the Bank. These shares give the U.S. government a veto power over any policy change. But the truth is that U.S. power is not limited to its being able to veto policy decisions it does not like. No country would dare oppose a move by the United States to radically cut the administrative budgets (by, say, 75 percent initially) and the number of personnel in the two organizations (to 600 personnel each, as in the case of USAID) if it wanted to do so. All it needs to do to get its way is to threaten to withhold its contributions to the two organizations. I can guarantee that immediately the interest rate at which the Bank borrows in international capital markets would leap upward, paralyzing its lending operations. The IMF and the World Bank are monuments to misguided economic thinking and policies that have brought much misery to the peoples of the Global South. They are institutions that no longer serve any purpose except to perpetuate and enlarge themselves. If Elon Musk and Donald Trump are really serious about radically downsizing bloated bureaucracies, they could not have better targets than the Bretton Woods twins.

Trump Says Putin Ready To Accept European Peacekeepers	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to accept European peacekeepers ahead of talks with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on ways to end the war in Ukraine. 'I have specifically asked him that question. He has no problem it,' Trump said, when asked by a reporter about Putin's position on the matter. Macron said European countries 'are ready and willing to provide' Ukraine with security guarantees 'which could perhaps include troops.' The French leader said any European forces sent to Ukraine would be there to 'maintain peace' and would not be placed along the front lines or become part of the conflict. Macron's visit to Washington comes on the third anniversary of the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion. He and Trump attended a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) economies to discuss the war in Ukraine prior to holding one-on-one talks. The trip to Washington comes on a day of high-stakes diplomacy, where Macron's visit, along with a summit in Kyiv and a showdown over diplomatic language at the United Nations over how to refer to the war have laid bare Western divisions over how to end the war in Ukraine. Ahead of his trip, Macron said he would present a European action plan to help achieve a durable peace deal with solid security guarantees for Ukraine. During a press conference streamed on social media before departing for Washington, he said he would also present the case to Trump that how he handles Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine will either dissuade or embolden China, the United States' largest geopolitical competitor. 'You can't be weak in the face of President Putin. It's not you, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest,' Macron said, outlining the argument he plans to make to the U.S. president. 'How can you then be credible in the face of China if you're weak in the face of Putin?' Addressing G7 leaders virtually, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hoped to finish the war 'this year' as he appealed to Trump for continued U.S. support and argued for allowing Ukraine to join NATO, which the Trump administration opposes. 'If Ukraine remains outside NATO, it will be a much more expensive and complicated path for everyone because NATO provides the simplest and most cost-effective security guarantees,' the Ukrainian president said. Zelenskyy added that Kyiv is working 'productively' on an economic deal with Washington amid ongoing tense talks over U.S. access to Ukrainian mineral resources in exchange for continued aid.Trump has roiled America's traditional allies in Europe with his readiness to restart diplomatic ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, raising concerns that Europe -- and even Kyiv itself -- will be sidelined in the process.Macron's trip comes after Zelenskyy met with at least 13 foreign officials in Kyiv on February 24 -- with another two dozen or more joining online -- to discuss support for Ukraine in the face of questions over U.S. assistance. Those concerns -- which have expanded since U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia last week -- were borne out in comments from European governments at a summit in Kyiv where leaders looked to reaffirm their support for Ukraine. 'It is Russia that started this war,' German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said via video link. 'Russia may have gained an open ear in the White House but they have not gained an inch of legitimacy.' During the summit in Kyiv, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to 'speed up the delivery of weapons and ammunition' to Ukraine and announced 3.5 billion euros in new aid. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also promised 1 billion euros in new military support and equipment, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would contribute new military support and donate frozen Russian funds to Kyiv.The European Union also announced a new sanctions package against Russia and von der Leyen said Ukraine could join the bloc before 2030 if the country continues its reforms at their current speed and quality. 'President Trump has changed the global conversation over the last few weeks, and it has created an opportunity,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told world leaders over video connection. 'If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table, and any settlement must be based on a sovereign Ukraine backed up with strong security guarantees.' The prospect of a normalization of ties between Russia and the United States, Trump's stated desire to quickly end the war, and a public war of words between the U.S. president and Zelenskyy have worried European leaders and launched a wave of outreach to Washington. 'If you look at the messages that come from the U.S., then it's clear that the Russian narrative is there, very strongly represented,' Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told reporters in Brussels. She is scheduled to travel to Washington on February 25 and meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Kallas will follow Macron in visiting Washington, and Starmer is also set to meet with Trump on February 27 at the White House. Polish President Andrzej Duda also met with Trump over the weekend. During a trip to Turkey on the war's anniversary, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow remains open to negotiations but its military campaign will only stop if the outcome is satisfactory to Russia. Lavrov added he believes many countries have become more 'realistic' in their position around the war and that the recent meeting in Saudi Arabia raised hopes of having normal dialogue between Moscow and Washington. Alongside Lavrov, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Turkey -- a NATO member that has previously helped broker agreements between Moscow and Kyiv -- was ready to host future peace talks on ending the war in Ukraine.In addition to unfolding Western divisions at the G7, a diplomatic battle over Ukraine is also taking place at the United Nations in New York City, where the United States has proposed a draft resolution that uses less critical language of Russia's full-scale invasion than a draft resolution put forward by the EU and Ukraine. The United States abstained during a vote at 193-member UN General Assembly on February 24, allowing the body to reaffirm Ukraine's territorial integrity and adopt a strongly worded resolution condemning Russia's invasion. But Washington also joined Russia in voting against a UN resolution from Ukraine and European countries that refers to 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation' and demanded that Russia immediately withdraw its forces.The 15-member UN Security Council is also set to vote on the same U.S. text. In order to be adopted, a council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by its permanent mebers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, or France.In contrast, the General Assembly has no vetoes and despite being closely watched a way to gauge world opinion, its reoslutions are legally non-binding -- unlike those adopted by the Security Council.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQzxQzcghq1AP	2025-02-24T15:54:00-08:00	
US Threat To Cut Off Military Aid To Egypt And Jordan May Provoke...	President Donald Trump’s threat to cut off military aid to Egypt and Jordan—if they refuse to provide sanctuary to Palestinians removed from Gaza—is most likely to trigger protests from the US military-industrial complex, one of the most powerful lobbies in the US. Currently, Egypt and Jordan, along with Israel, are three of the major recipients of US military aid, including some of the world’s most advanced weapons systems, in the Middle East. This includes Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) and Excess Defense Articles (EDA). The EDA offers second-hand military equipment at reduced or at no cost to US allies. According to the State Department, U.S. assistance to Egypt has played a central role in Egypt’s economic and military development and in furthering the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership and regional stability. Since 1978, the United States has provided Egypt with over $50 billion in military and $30 billion in economic assistance. Egypt is also a major security partner of the US and one of the largest recipients of US military aid in the region; it has the status of a 'Major Non-NATO Ally,' a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation, according to the State Department. Meanwhile, since 2015, the US has provided Jordan with $2.155 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which makes Jordan the third largest global recipient of FMF funds over that time period. In addition, the Department of Defense (DoD) has provided $327 million to the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) under its '333 Authority', since 2018, making Jordan one of the largest recipients of this funding. Further, the United States has supported the Jordan Border Security Program, an integrated border security surveillance, detection, and interdiction system along 350 miles of Jordan’s land borders since 2009, at a cost of over $234 million, according to the State Department. Dr. Natalie J. Goldring, who represents the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy in her work at the United Nations on conventional weapons and arms trade issues, told IDN one factor that has been given insufficient attention is the extent to which US defense contractors benefit from these military aid programs. For example, she pointed out, Egypt is required to use its military aid to buy weapons and services from US defense contractors. President Trump can threaten to cut off military aid to countries that don’t agree to accept large number of Palestinians who are removed from Gaza. 'It’s not clear that he can legally cut off military aid that has been appropriated by Congress. But even if he can, that would put him in direct conflict with US defense contractors, whose profits would be decreased as a result of these cuts,' Dr Goldring said. She said its’s difficult to know which of President Trump’s claims and threats are sincere. Is he sincere when he claims that the United States will take over Gaza and develop it? Is it mere rhetoric when he claims that Egypt and Jordan will take in the Palestinians whose homes were in the Gaza Strip? Or is this simply more of the bluster for which he is known? 'But in any case, his claims ignore the human rights of the Palestinian people – he consistently treats them as objects, rather than human beings with individual and collective rights. These proposals would also eliminate or at best severely undermine the prospects for a two-state solution for Palestinians and Israelis.' 'President Trump talks about Gaza as a real estate developer more than as a president. He emphasizes its desirable location, and describes its current condition as a ‘demolition site’. He never mentions that it’s the Israeli government that has reduced Gaza to rubble, and that US weapons have been and continue to be critically important in producing that devastation.' 'One enormous open question is what will happen with US foreign aid going forward. When Secretary of State Rubio described the US aid freeze (whose legality has not been established) he exempted military assistance to Israel and Egypt, but not Jordan,' said Dr Goldring. According to the State Department, total bilateral trade in goods between the United States and Egypt stood at $9.1 billion in 2021, the highest level ever. Egypt is the United States’ largest export market in Africa. U.S. exports to Egypt include wheat and corn, mineral fuel and oil, machinery, aircraft, and iron and steel products. U.S. imports from Egypt include apparel, natural gas and oil, fertilizers, textiles, and agricultural products. Under the Qualifying Industrial Zone agreement, the United States waives duties on imports from Egypt if the value includes 10.5% Israeli content; this program promotes stronger ties between the region’s peace partners. American firms are active in most sectors of the Egyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy technologies, financial services, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications and information technology, and the restaurant and hospitality industry. As for Jordan, the US has $4.47 billion in active government-to-government sales cases with Jordan under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, according to the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. FMS sales notified to Congress and recent and significant prior sales include: F-16 Air Combat Training Center; UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter and related equipment; 700 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems; F-16 weapons, munitions, ground vehicles, jet engines, and logistics support; High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), and other multiple rocket launch systems; 37 Meter Coastal Patrol Boats; as well as AMRAAM air-to-air and Javelin anti-tank missiles. Since 2016, the United States has also authorized the permanent export of over $697 million in defense articles to Jordan via the Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) process. The top categories of DCS to Jordan include: aircraft, fire control/night vision, and military electronics. Jordan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally in 1996, which provides Jordan with a number of benefits reserved to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and allied nations, including potential participation in cooperative research and development, priority delivery for Excess Defense Articles (EDA), and reciprocally-funded cooperative training. Since 2014, Jordan was authorized to receive three C-130H aircraft, MEI-23E Hawk missiles, cargo trucks, and one Intermediate Level Support Equipment Test Station via the EDA program.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQy6vLuj96nsM	2025-02-24T15:51:13-08:00	
China Conducts Live Fire Drills In Tonkin Gulf As Vietnam Draws S...	The Chinese military has announced a live-fire exercise in an area in the Gulf of Tonkin from Monday to Thursday this week, warning ships not to enter the zone. The warning came as Vietnam issued a formal map defining the baseline to demarcate its territory in the gulf. Though neither side linked their action to that of the other, it was unlikely to be a coincidence, some observers said. China’s exercise comes amid the latest wrangle between the neighbors over Vietnam’s island building in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea. A baseline under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, is the line that runs along the coast of a country, from which the extent of the territorial sea and other maritime zones is measured. In March 2024 China released its baseline in the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin, deemed by analysts as 'excessive.' Radio Free Asia was the first media outlet to report in April 2024 that Vietnam was considering its own baseline amid concern that China may seek to expand its maritime zones. The Chinese baseline at some points encroaches about 50 nautical miles (93 kilometers) into international waters, according to analysts. The U.S. military, which promotes freedom of navigation across the world, criticized China’s baseline, saying it may provide a pretext for China to 'unlawfully impede navigational rights and freedoms guaranteed to all nations, including transit passage through the Hainan Strait.' Chinese drills not ‘a pure coincidence’ 'The establishment of the baseline in the Gulf of Tonkin aims to uphold Vietnam’s rights and obligations,' the Vietnamese foreign ministry said in a statement, 'It provides a robust legal basis for safeguarding and exercising Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.' China has yet to comment on its neighbor’s announcement but some Vietnam watchers said China’s live-fire drills appeared to be a response to Vietnam’s baseline. 'Although the exercise area off northwest Hainan island is relatively far from Vietnam’s waters, the timing seems too close to be a pure coincidence,' said Song Phan, a maritime researcher. The new baseline that runs along Vietnam’s coast 'conforms strictly to UNCLOS unlike the Chinese baseline,' he said. Hanoi and Beijing in 2000 signed a Delimitation Agreement to demarcate their shares of the gulf from the mainland of Vietnam and China in the North to the mouth of the gulf in the South. The two countries, however, have yet to renegotiate a joint fishery cooperation agreement in the Gulf of Tonkin after the old one expired in 2020.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ5udE0KpbDHJ	2025-02-24T15:49:01-08:00	
Japan, Philippines Strengthen Defense Ties Amid ‘Increasingly Sev...	By Jason Gutierrez and Jojo Riñoza The defense chiefs of Japan and the Philippines agreed to boost bilateral military ties over mutual concerns driven by an 'increasingly severe' security situation in their respective territorial disputes with China. The two officials met amid a flurry of visits to Manila in recent days by foreign allies and new partners in broadened military cooperation with the Philippines. These included a visit by Adm. Samuel Paparo, the top U.S. military officer in the Pacific, and a port-of-call by the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and its carrier group. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani arrived in Manila over the weekend, two months after the Philippine Senate ratified a new defense treaty with Tokyo, whose military forces had occupied the Philippines during World War II.'[Philippine Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr.] and I firmly concurred that the security environment surrounding us is becoming increasingly severe and that it is necessary for the two countries as strategic partners to further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration in order to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific amid such a situation,' Nakatani said during a joint press conference with Teodoro in Manila on Monday. Both Manila and Tokyo should 'deepen bilateral cooperation' with a sense of expediency, Nakatani said. Teodoro said Nakatani’s two-day trip was meant to advance bilateral defense engagements after the Philippines ratified the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA). It allows for larger-scale joint military drills and paves the way for military personnel to take part in security operations, including coordinated security patrols. The pact, however, still has to be ratified by the Japanese parliament before both nations 'get to the ground running at full speed,' Teodoro said. 'This meeting was an exchange of views on regional security issues on the Indo-Pacific, the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and most importantly on our shared initiatives moving forward, not only on bilateral security enhancements, but also in promoting a sustainable, economically beneficial and defense-sustained defense industry partnership,' Teodoro said. Both Manila and Tokyo agreed to boost operational cooperation, start a strategic dialogue between 'high-level operational action officers' and deepen information sharing, Nakatani said. 'We also agreed to commence discussion between defense authorities on military information protection mechanisms,' he also said. Nakatani visited two key Philippine military sites in the north of Luzon, the main Philippine island, including Basa Air Base. Basa is one of the nine Philippine military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between Manila and its long-time defense ally, Washington. First signed in 2014, the EDCA allows the U.S. military to build and operate facilities inside Philippine bases for use by American and Filipino forces. While the United States is barred from establishing permanent bases here, analysts said the pact has allowed some flexibility in cooperation – including the hosting of the Typhon mid-range missile system – raising strong protests from China. The EDCA supplemented the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, which provides legal cover for large-scale joint military drills in the Philippines between the two long-time allies. Regional security concerns The Japanese minister’s trip to Manila came after the unprecedented visit of France’s lone nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and accompanying warships last week after the French navy ships took part in combat drills with Filipino forces in the South China Sea. The Charles De Gaulle, accompanied by three destroyers and an oil tanker, docked in Manila and in Subic Bay. In 2016, France and the Philippines signed a defense and security cooperation agreement, and have been building on it since. Adm. Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific command based in Hawaii, meanwhile met with Philippine officials in Manila last week. He was there to discuss regional security issues and underscore Washington’s commitment to the Philippine military 'to enhance maritime domain awareness and capacity building in order to counter illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities,' according to a statement from his office on Sunday. ‘Very timely juncture’ 'The visit by the Japanese defense minister is very important, coming at a very timely juncture, when the Philippines is engaged in outreach to like-minded partners,' said Don McLain Gill, a geopolitical analyst and lecturer at De La Salle University in Manila. 'The timing in fact is very important, especially after a series of provocations by China within the West Philippine Sea,' he told BenarNews, using Manila’s name for South China Sea waters within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. 'This is not just symbolic, but an opportunity to deepen or broaden the already strengthening Philippine-Japan security partnership.' Japan’s strategy is to signal its emergence as a 'major power broker' in the region, security analyst Chester Cabalza told BenarNews. 'Tokyo has felt the intensity of Beijing’s impounding presence in its own coastlines, and one way of reducing the tension is to ally with nations experiencing similar strategic territorial dilemmas with China,' said Cabalza, who heads International Development and Security Cooperation, a think-tank in Manila. Japan, unlike the Philippines, does not have territorial claims that overlap with China’s expansive ones in the South China Sea. But Tokyo has a separate dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) in the East China Sea. 'Japan has to ink pacts with other middle powers in the region,' Cabalza said. 'By this way, China will be reprimanded to follow maritime rules-based order in the South China Sea.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ_hwhj6GpDnW	2025-02-24T15:47:15-08:00	
Ralph Nader: Stop Repeating The Vast Undercount Of Gazan Deaths; ...	Enough already of the media’s lazy indifference to the vast undercount of the Palestinian death toll from Netanyahu’s genocidal daily bombing and shelling of Gaza’s defenseless civilian population. I’m referring to all the media – the corporate media, the public media, and the independent media. They all stick with the Hamas Ministry of Health’s (MOH) count of named victims whose corpses have been identified by hospitals and mortuaries. For months there have been no operating hospitals and mortuaries to send their grisly data to the Health Ministry. The official Hamas count that all sides like to cite is now over 48,000 deaths. As American doctors back from Gaza before the Rafah closing last year said—just about everybody surviving in Gaza is sick, injured, or dying. They put the death estimate almost a year ago at a minimum of 95,000, not counting tens of thousands of families buried under the rubble when Israeli F-16s blew up entire apartment buildings. Why would all sides to this one-sided Israeli war of extermination rely on Hamas’ figures? Well, Hamas has an interest in low-balling the number of deaths to limit the rage of its inhabitants and allies abroad for not protecting the people of Gaza and not providing them with shelters. The Israeli super-hawks want to keep the undercount low to dampen down the international rage, boycotts, and demand for more sanctions and ICC prosecutions. The Biden administration and now the Trump regime also benefit from a low number. Here is the Washington Post’s esteemed foreign affairs editor Karen DeYoung’s reply on September 6, 2024 to my inquiry: 'We use the Gaza MOH [Ministry of Health] figures – as does the United Nations, World Health Organization and virtually every other humanitarian organization – while noting that independent media are not allowed to enter Gaza and the casualty counts are most certainly underreported… The Lancet [British Medical Journal] report notes that based on other ‘recent conflicts…it is not implausible to estimate’ that four times as many have died than those listed by the MOH…The time will come, I believe, when an independent accounting can be done.' But six months later the time still hasn’t come. The Biden State Department had a much higher estimate of deaths but refused to release their analysis, obstructing our Freedom of Information request filed last May 24, 2024. All kinds of estimates and projections by reputable universities, specialists, global health groups and UN agencies point to a much higher death and overall casualty toll. But the State Department won’t come forward with a reasonably estimated number that can replace Hamas’ statistical immolation. For example, in late 2023, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh—Professor Devi Sridhar—said that if the destruction continues, half a million Palestinians would die in 2024. The devastation has gotten worse—the bombings, the genocidal denial of 'food, water, medicine, electricity, fuel' in the omnicidal words of the high Israeli military officials, the spread of diseases, untreated injuries, babies born into the rubble, infants starved, lack of potable water, sick elderly without critical medicines, and more. This is the result of 110 thousand tons of bombs (Israeli admission) daily tank shelling and precise destructions. Yet neither she nor most other experts who have projected continuing mayhem have offered a number. Interestingly, the media has no trouble estimating the Syrian deaths at the hands of dictator Assad (500,000) nor the deaths in the wars in Sudan or Ukraine. Only the Palestinians, who are not allowed to live, don’t get the respect of having their deaths accurately estimated. One team of Gazan undertakers said they buried 17,000 bodies in mass graves by February 2024, including 800 in one day. Were the shoe on the other foot, Congress would not only have had intense public hearings: it would have declared war against Hamas. With total U.S. co-belligerency – from huge weapons supplies to the veto at the UN, Netanyahu gets away with blocking Israeli and all other reporters from going freely into Gaza, and shuts up those conscience-stricken Israeli soldiers who are sickened by what they were ordered to destroy. One of them said, 'I felt like, like, like a Nazi … it looked exactly like we were actually the Nazis and they were the Jews.' Some columnists in the U.S. like Charles Lane and Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and Netanyahu’s mouthpiece, Bret Stephens of the New York Times, do not believe the Israeli military consciously targets civilians and civilian infrastructure. Israelis scoff at such naivete; many want more annihilation of all Palestinians whom they regard as 'subhuman,' 'vermin,' 'snakes,' or 'animals' (racist words from high Israeli politicians over the decades). Some 45 years ago, former UN Ambassador and Foreign Minister Abba Eban —under then Prime Minister Menachem Begin—wrote that Israel 'is wantonly inflicting every possible measure of death and anguish on civilian populations in a mood reminiscent of regimes which neither Mr. Begin nor I would dare to mention by name.' In August 2024, based on available historical, empirical, and clinical records, we estimated about 300,000 Palestinians had been killed. (See the August/September 2024 issue of the Capitol Hill Citizen). By now it is over 400,000. Yet the media still uses the figure by Hamas and ignores the lives blown apart under the killing fields in Gaza. At 400,000 and growing, far more Palestinians have been killed in Gaza than the combined total of deaths from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Dresden in World War II. This week, Netanyahu dropped leaflets in Arabic signaling a forthcoming violent exclusion of Gaza’s trapped, unsheltered Palestinians from their homeland. More accurately estimated civilian casualties matters morally and for the intensity of the political, diplomatic, and civic resistance when the world learns the truer toll of death and injuries in this tiny enclave the geographical size of Philadelphia. To remind the world of the daily Israeli violations of settled international law inflicted on Gazans (also in the West Bank and Lebanon), international law practitioner Bruce Fein compiled this concise list: ISRAEL’S TEN VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IN GAZA Genocide Count I. Killing Palestinians in Gaza. Genocide Count II. Deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Genocide Count III. Destroying hospitals and maternal care necessities intended to prevent births by Palestinian women in Gaza. Crimes against humanity. Extermination and persecution of 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza as part of a systematic attack directed at Palestinian civilians. Deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property for destruction. Failing to provide for the security and welfare of the inhabitants occupied by the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. Impeding delivery of humanitarian assistance. Forcible relocation of civilian population. Use of military force causing civilian casualties vastly disproportionate to the importance of any legitimate military objective. War of aggression against Gaza Palestinians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ-JoQqQNI1GC	2025-02-24T15:45:31-08:00	
Pakistan: Terror Thrives In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On February 23, 2025, Security Forces (SFs) killed seven Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in two separate operations carried out in Daraban and Maddi areas of Dera Ismail Khan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). On February 21, 2025, six TTP terrorists were killed after SFs carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Karak District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). On February 17, 2025, SFs killed 30 terrorists during an IBO in Sararogha area of South Waziristan District, KP. A statement issued on February 18 from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. On February 17, 2025, four soldiers were killed and five sustained injuries when the convoy of the Commandant of the Kurram Militia, Frontier Corps, was ambushed by unidentified armed attackers in the Manduri area of Kurram District, KP. On February 13, 2025, five terrorists including 'commander' Kharji Shah Gul alias Rohani were killed during an IBO conducted by SFs in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan District, KP. On February 13, 2025, five terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire during IBOs in the Dosali and Tappi areas of North Waziristan District, KP. On February 12, 2025, at least five terrorists were killed in SF's projectile strike, quadcopter, in Draban area of Dera Ismail Khan District in KP. On February 10, 2025, SFs killed five TTP terrorists during a late-night operation in Mir Kakam Banda area of Banda Daud Shah town in Karak District of KP. On February 6, 2025, at least 12 terrorists and one Army soldier were killed in an IBO in the Hassan Khel area of North Waziristan District, KP. On February 4, 2025, at least five SF personnel were killed while another six sustained injuries in a militant attack on the Raghzai security post in the Shaktoi area of North Waziristan District, KP. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), 346 terrorism-related fatalities, including 22 civilians, 63 SF personnel and 261 terrorists, have been reported in the current year, thus far (data till February 23, 2025) in KP. During the corresponding period of 2024, the province recorded 142 fatalities (41 civilians, 53 SF personnel and 48 terrorists). KP recorded a total of 1,363 fatalities (288 civilians, 421 SF personnel and 654 terrorists) in 487 incidents of killing in 2024, as against 941 such fatalities (205 civilians, 329 SF personnel, and 407 terrorists) in 312 such incidents in 2023, registering an increase of 44.84 per cent in overall fatalities. On year-on-year basis, overall fatalities have been on a continuous rise since 2020, with an increase from 130 (30 civilians, 69 SF personnel, and 31 terrorists) in 2019 to 216 (61 civilians, 57 SF personnel, and 98 terrorists) in 2020, 301 (72 civilians, 108 SF personnel, and 121 terrorists) in 2021 and further, to 527 (119 civilians, 173 SF personnel, and 235 terrorists) in 2022. Significantly, overall fatalities declined between 2014 and 2019, barring 2018, when they increased to 167, from 129 in 2017. Fatalities had fallen from 946 in 2013 to 607 in 2014, 298 in 2015, and 215 in 2016. Overall fatalities in 2024, at 1,363, are the highest in a year since 2009, when 5,883 fatalities were recorded in the province. Other parameters of violence also underlined a worsening security situation in the province in 2024. Total terrorism-linked incidents jumped sharply from 472 in 2023 to 702 in 2024, the highest since 2009, when there were 1,432 such incidents. The number of major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) increased from 84 in 2023 to 140 in 2024, the highest since 2009, when there were 341 such incidents; the resultant fatalities in such attacks also increased from 586 in 2023 to 891 in 2024. Similarly, KP accounted for an increased number of explosions, from 110 in 2023 to 142 in 2024 (the highest since 2013, when there were 198 such incidents), however, the resulting fatalities decreased from 296 to 207. Similarly, the province recorded a decreased number of suicide attacks from 28 in 2023 to 15 in 2024, the resultant fatalities in such attacks also decreased from 254 in 2023 to 93 in 2024. In the worst attack, on November 19, 2024, 12 SF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive laden vehicle into the Mali Khel Check Post in the Bannu District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Six terrorists were also killed in the subsequent SF retaliation. Jabha Ansar al-Mahdi, a sub-group of Hafiz Gul Bahadur's faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. Of 38 Districts in KP, 28 recorded terrorism-related violence in 2024, as against 22 Districts in 2023, according to the SATP database. Of 38 Districts, 16 Districts registered terrorism-related incidents in 2022; 21 Districts in 2021; and19 Districts in 2020. The most violent District in 2024 was North Waziristan, with 271 fatalities, followed by South Waziristan (163 fatalities), Khyber (137 fatalities) and Kurram (126 fatalities). In 2023 as well, North Waziristan was the most violent District, with 151 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (122), Dera Ismail Khan (109) and South Waziristan (107). In 2022, again, North Waziristan District accounted for 177 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (87), Bannu (60) and Dera Ismail Khan (43). In 2021 again, Waziristan recorded the maximum of 106 fatalities, followed by South Waziristan (51), Peshawar (25) and Bajaur (22). In 2020, North Waziristan recorded 110 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (27) and South Waziristan (21). Compounding the rising trend in terrorism, is the flare-up of sectarian violence in Kurram District. Though sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslim groups is not a new phenomenon in Kurram District, but the renewed skirmishing in the district, commencing November 21, 2024, has so far taken over a hundred lives and drastically affected the day-to-day life of the region. On November 21, terrorists opened fire on a passenger convoy, in the Kurram District killing at least 43 persons and injuring 11. The convoy of around 200 vehicles, carrying Shia passengers between Peshawar and Parachinar, came under heavy gunfire in the densely populated Bagan town. Soon after the terrorist attack, clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram. The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23, resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 persons injured. Among the deceased, 16 were Sunni, while 66 belonged to the Shia community. By the time a ceasefire was imposed on December 1, a total 130 people had been killed and another 186 sustained injuries. The actual fatalities figure could be much higher, as media movement was strictly limited due to the imposition of a curfew by the Government. Despite the curfew and ceasefire, sporadic violence continues. The KP Government disclosed, on January 1, 2025, that both warring Shia and Sunni tribes in Kurram Districts finally signed a peace agreement after more than three weeks of efforts to broker a ceasefire. The seven-page peace agreement has 14 points to which both parties assented, along with the Grand Jirga members. The document stated that, keeping in view the post-merger realities, members of the Kurram Peace Committee and both sides would be bound to uphold the Muree Agreement of 2008 and all other agreements, for the benefit of locals and the establishment of peace. The Muree Agreement was brokered by the Government and signed by all the tribes on October 16, 2008, to stop the violent clashes during 2007-08. Under the agreement, the rival tribes deposited PKR 20 million with the local authorities as a guarantee that they would refrain from fighting. But the five-point Agreement, which covered all major issues, was never implemented. Tribesmen blamed a lack of interest on the part of the Government for this. Further, during the 2011 sectarian clash, an Aman Jirga (peace conclave) between Sunni and Shia tribes on February 3, 2011, signed an accord, known as 'Kurram accord' to end bloodshed between the two sects. The Kurram Accord is little more than a collection of recommendations and appeals to the Government of Pakistan, with no corresponding guarantees from the Government's side. The Accord appeals to the Government of Pakistan for support and necessary action for the repatriation of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and implementation of the Muree Agreement; and for approval of a special development package for Kurram to compensate for the losses the agency had suffered in violent clashes since 2007. It 'urged' both Shias and Sunnis to 'show restraint' and cooperate with the Government for peace, and called on the political administration and Security Forces to play their due roles to re-establish their writ in Kurram. However, despite the peace agreement, the warring groups never ceased their exchanges of fire. On January 16, 2025, 10 persons, including six drivers, two passengers and two soldiers, were killed in an attack on an aid convoy carrying essential goods to the sectarian violence-marred Kurram District, near the Bagan area of Kurram District. Six terrorists were killed in SF retaliation. At least 10 terrorists and four SF personnel also sustained injuries during the clash. On February 17, 2025, nine persons, including five SF personnel, a truck driver, a passer-by and two attackers, were killed, while another 15, including four drivers and one Police officer were injured, when an aid convoy, consisting of 64 vehicles, en-route to Parachinar, were attacked by unidentified terrorists in the Char Khail, Uchit Baghan and Mandori areas of Kurram District. The trucks were carrying food and other supplies under the supervision of SFs. Following the assault, more than 35 vehicles were trapped in the area, though nine vehicles reached Alizai safely, while 20 were sent back to Tull, with most of them stripped of their cargo. Though the Government and security agencies have been saying that the violence is between two warring sectarian groups over land disputes, there is a terrorist angel as well. Quoting the local people of Kurram, journalist Mushtaq Yousufzai noted, on December 30, 2024, that terrorists were targeting locals, not any religious group. 'They say militants are in the region,' he stated on the Aaj News programme News Insight with Amir Zia, 'When Peshawar-Parachinar Road was closed, upper Kurram peoples used the Afghanistan route or mountains tracks route. But now it seems they are besieged for more than 80 days.' When asked if the Government would be able to disarm people and shut down bunkers, the journalist added that the task was difficult, as the religious groups 'doubted' the government's intention. They believed that surrendering arms, which they insist were for their own defence, would make them more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Local people's apprehensions of terrorist attacks in Kurram are not unfounded, as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) affiliated Al-Azaim Media's 35th 'Voice of Khorasan' (Pashto, 125 pages) editorial on December 14, 2024, called for Sunni youth to target Shias, criticizing the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Taliban for failing to defend Sunni Muslims in Kurram. It reiterated a call for lone wolf attacks, urging ISKP loyalists and others to act on its behalf in Kurram and beyond, while condemning the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), TTP, and the Taliban for 'abandoning' jihad, and for ties with the United Nations (UN). The surge in terrorism-related violence in the province can be attributed to three principal factors. First, the United States (US)-Western withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan. Second, the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 14, 2021. And finally, the collapse of 'official talks' between the Pakistan Government and the TTP on November 28, 2022. The spike in violence in KP in 2023 was foreseeable, when TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali, in the wake of the collapse of peace-talks, asked his fighters to resume attacks. When the US pulled its forces out from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind around USD 7 billion worth of military equipment and weapons, including firearms, communications gear, and even armoured vehicles. The Afghan Taliban seized these weapons during the chaotic US withdrawal. On January 29, 2025, the Pakistan Foreign Office asserted that these advanced weapons have been an issue of profound concern for the safety and security of Pakistan and its citizens. The Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan issued a statement declaring, 'These weapons, left behind in the aftermath of the withdrawal of its troops in August 2021, have been used by terrorist organisations, including the TTP [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan], to carry out terrorist attacks in Pakistan,' and further, that Pakistan has been 'repeatedly calling upon the de facto authorities in Kabul to take all necessary measures to ensure that these weapons do not fall into the wrong hands.' The FO statement came after US President Donald Trump's pledge to take back military equipment left behind in Afghanistan during troop withdrawal in 2021. However, the Taliban has reportedly refused to return any of the military equipment and urged the US to provide them with more advanced weapons to fight Daesh. On February 15, 2025, the 35th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted to the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) revealed that the Afghan Taliban's continued support to TTP, despite Islamabad's increasing pressure to end backing of the outfit, was fuelling the group's escalating attacks in Pakistan. The scale of TTP's attacks in Pakistan has increased significantly, according to the report by the UNSC-formed monitoring team. The report, covering the period from July 1 to Dec 13, 2024, stated that the 'status and strength of TTP in Afghanistan had not changed', while the group intensified its assaults on Pakistan, conducting over 600 attacks during the reporting period, many launched from Afghan territory. It underscored that the Taliban continued to provide the outlawed TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support, bolstering the group's capacity to sustain its activities. Earlier on December 16, 2024, the KP Chief Minister (CM) Ali Amin Gandapur claimed that between 22,000 and 24,000 TTP members, had found safe haven in Afghanistan. Gandapur also claimed that an additional 16,000 to 18,000 TTP fighters were operating inside Pakistan. He acknowledged that Pakistan lacked the capacity to maintain law and order along its extensive border with Afghanistan. While the Afghan Taliban denied harbouring TTP members in Afghanistan, insisting they do not support the group, Gandapur argued that international legal constraints prevented Pakistan from pursuing TTP fighters across the Afghan border. He called on the Federal Government to engage in negotiations with the Afghan Taliban, adding that initiating talks was beyond the jurisdiction of his provincial administration. 'I am obligated to express my concerns about the deteriorating law-and-order situation because the people of my province are being killed by terrorism,' Gandapur stated. While the terrorists operating in the province were equipped with modern sophisticated weapons, including sniper rifles and thermal sensors, the provincial Police forces who stand on the first line of defence, remain ill-equipped. On October 1, 2024, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a high-level meeting in Peshawar to discuss peace and security in the province, particularly in the merged Districts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and southern KP. To enhance the capabilities of the Police, 122 bulletproof vehicles were allocated to former FATA Districts, PKR 7 billion was provided for the Police in the merged districts, and PKR 1 billion was released for the purchase of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs). Additionally, 1,300 Police positions were announced for the Tank and Lakki Marwat Districts in Southern KP. Further on December 1, Chief Minister Gandapur announced a slew of measures to strengthen the Police's Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) to fight off surging incidents of terrorism in the province. 'We are fighting an enemy that is better equipped and we have to level up at least to be able to overcome one of the biggest challenges of our lives,' Gandapur told a news conference soon after attending a detailed briefing at the CTD Headquarters at Police Lines in Peshawar. The package, totalling PKR one billion, included the purchase of high-tech drones, sniper rifles with thermal and night vision capabilities, high-tech kits and bombproof vehicles. Quoting the KP Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on December 31, 2024, The Express Tribune reported that the majority of terrorist attacks had been carried out in the southern Districts of the province, including Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Tank, Kohat, North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Khyber, Bajaur and Peshawar. The Express Tribune's sources within the KP CTD revealed that the Police had nearly abandoned the practice of patrolling outside the Police Stations after sunset in the southern Districts, where terrorist activities against both civilians and armed personnel were on the rise. Commenting on the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the province and tribal areas, Dr. Khurram Iqbal, an expert in security affairs and a PhD in Counter-Terrorism and Security from Australia, while talking to The Express Tribune, stated, The tug of war between the Federal and Provincial Governments had destabilized the maintenance of peace in the southern Districts of KP. In order to deal with the problem of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's cross-border sanctuaries, both the Federal and Provincial Governments must take a united stand vis-a-vis Afghanistan for ensuring lasting peace'. Despite the Provincial Government's efforts, terrorism continues to thrive due to the lack of cooperation from both the Federal and Afghanistan Governments. Advocating dialogue to settle disputes on January 20, 2025, KP Chief Minister Gandapur declared that he would send a delegation to Afghanistan within two weeks to seek solutions to Pakistan-Afghan issues. 'The federal government talked about negotiations with Afghanistan over bilateral issues, but there's no success. Now, the dialogue with Kabul will be held at the provincial level. A delegation of our [KP] government will meet Afghan officials within two weeks.' However, Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam asserted, on February 1, 2025, that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government's jurisdiction. While TTP and its affiliated groups wreak havoc in the province from Afghanistan, the failure of the Governments at the Centre and province, confer a degree of impunity on the terrorists, and can only further worsen the situation in KP in the days to come.

India: Troubled Borders In Arunachal Pradesh – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum On January 15, 2025, Police arrested one operative of United Tani Army (UTA) identified as Tana Hasi from Itanagar in Papum Pare District, for his suspected role in carrying out recruitment of operatives for the outfit. Inspector General of Police (IGP) (Law & Order) Chukhu Apa stated that Hasi, along with the self-styled 'chairman' of UTA, Anthony Doke, had been carrying out recruitment of youth for UTA using various platforms, including social media. On January 9, 2025, a gun battle erupted between Security Forces (SFs) and militants of the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K-YA), at Longka village in the Changlang District. No casualties were reported from either side. On January 6, 2025, suspected NSCN-K-YA militants abducted two male workers from an illegal timber camp at the Longvi village of Changlang District, near the Indo-Myanmar border. The abduction of the two workers is believed to be related to ongoing extortion demands. These three insurgency-related incidents have been recorded in the State in 2025, thus far (data till February 23, 2025) According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), a single fatality was recorded in 2024 (data till February 23, 2025), where a cadre of NSCN-K-YA, identified as 'major' Gangjun Gangsa, was killed in a clash with the Assam Rifles in Longding District, on October 25. The NSCN-K-YA initiated the attack by firing at Assam Rifles personnel while they were moving from Wakka towards the Indo-Myanmar Border. In 2023, five (three terrorists, one civilian and one SF trooper) were killed in four separate incidents. Among the insurgents killed, one each belonged to the United Liberation Front of Asom - Independent (ULFA-I), the Niki Sumi-led faction of NSCN-K (NSCN-K-NS) and NSCN-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data, a total of 245 fatalities (176 insurgents, 38 SFs and 31 civilians) have been recorded in the State. In 2025, one incident of arrest has been recorded, in which a UTA cadre (of January 15, above) was arrested in Papum Pare District. In 2024, a total of 23 insurgents were arrested in 11 separate incidents - NSCN-IM, 12; ULFA-I; eight and one each from NSCN-K-YA, NSCN-Unification (NSCN-U) and NSCN-K. In 2023, 39 insurgents were arrested in the State in 26 separate incidents -NSCN-K-YA, 20; ULFA-I, eight; NSCN-IM, six; NSCN-Reformation (NSCN-R) and NSCN-K, two each; NSCN-K-NS, one. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 749 insurgents have been arrested in the State. Four militants surrendered in 2024 in three separate incidents, including two from NSCN-U in Changlang District and one each from NSCN-K and ULFA-I in Tirap and Changlang Districts, respectively. In 2023, 24 insurgents surrendered in nine separate incidents: Eastern Naga National Government (ENNG), 15; NSCN-IM and ULFA-I, two each; and NSCN-K-YA, NSCN-R, NSCN-K, Eastern Naga National Organisation (ENNO) and NSCN-K-NS, one each. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 214 insurgents have surrendered in the State. As usual, the abduction and extortion campaign of militants, principally by NSCN-K-YA, in the state continued in 2024. Some of the incidents of such activities included: As reported on December 3, NSCN-K-YA issued a demand of INR 2 million from Oil India Limited (OIL), a prominent petroleum company operating in the Manabhum Reserve Forest in the Lohit District of Arunachal Pradesh. The extortion note was delivered to the company's office in the Manabhum Reserve Forest by a self-styled 'major' of NSCN-K-YA, identified as Tha Aung, and set a deadline of December 10, 2024, for the payment. OIL Spokesperson Prankush Malla Buzarbaruah accepted that the company had received the extortion note from the outfit. On November 24, two civilians, Vignesh Kumar Jha and Bishnu Chetry, were abducted by a 10-member heavily armed group of NSCN-K-YA from a bridge construction site located between the Pongchau and Konnu villages in Longding District. The group was led by NSCN-K-YA 'leader' Akham Konyak. On February 18, ten workers employed at the Finboro Coal Mine in Changlang District, were abducted because of the failure to comply to an extortion demand by suspected militants of NSCN-K-YA and ULFA-I. A group of seven armed militants held the workers at gunpoint and transported them in a dumper truck towards Old Longtoi, a remote location within Arunachal Pradesh. SFs later rescued seven out of 10 coal miners. ULFA-I, later, released the remaining three, identified as Gyan Thapa, Lekhan Bora and Chandan Narzari, on March 22, at Lalpul near Longvi in Nampong in Changlang District, which was disclosed by ULFA-I's 'spokesperson' Rumel Asom. The 'overflow' of insurgency in three districts, Tirap, Changlang, and Longding (TCL) located along the Indo-Myanmar border remains a concern. SAIRnoted, earlier, that the TCL region served as the 'axis' of conflict in the State. Activities of insurgent groups from other States, primarily Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, affect the TCL Districts of the State - all lying on the Indo-Myanmar border. Further, SAIR noted earlier, Arunachal Pradesh continues to be used as a transit route by various militant groups, whose camps are situated in the Sagaing Region of Myanmar. The TCL region recorded 189 fatalities (133 terrorists, 29 SF personnel and 27 civilians) out of the 245 fatalities in the State since March 2000. The nine districts which recorded fatalities since March 2000 are: Tirap (110 fatalities: 76 terrorists, 18 SF personnel and 16 civilians), Changlang (50 fatalities: 32 terrorists, 10 SF personnel, and eight civilians), Lohit (39 fatalities: 35 terrorists, three civilians and one trooper), Longding (29 fatalities: 25 terrorists, three civilians and one trooper), West Kameng (five SF personnel), Anjaw (one terrorist), Papum Pare (one civilian), Kurung Kumey (one SF trooper) and Namsai (one SF trooper). Meanwhile, Naga nationalism and the demand for a Naga sovereign State, Nagalim, which includes the Naga inhabited areas of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and some portions of Myanmar, play an important role in the Naga armed movement in Arunachal Pradesh. Significantly, on January 27, 2024, ENNG merged with NSCN-IM after a request by the 'president' of ENNG, Tosham Mossang, and its 'general secretary' Sompai Pongha, to NSCN-IM, on January 21, 2024. After the merger, on January 28, 2024, NSCN-IM's 'ministry of information and publicity' stated, In approaching the NSCN for merger, the ENNG 'president' and 'general secretary' stated that they sincerely support the Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015, signed on the basis of giving recognition to the sovereign right of Nagalim. With this merger they believe it will motivate the people of Tirap, Changlang and Longding (TCL) in Arunachal and allow them to get more involved and active towards the Naga national movement. Not surprisingly, on September 25, 2024, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) issued a notification under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) that the act has been extended for another six months in several regions of Arunachal Pradesh. The UMHA notification observed, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of Namsai, Mahadevpur and Chowkham police stations in Namsai district of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the State of Assam, are declared as 'disturbed area' under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, for a period of six months with effect from 01.10.2024, unless withdrawn earlier. In reviewing the security situation in the TCL region on February 17, 2025, Lieutenant General (Retd.) K.T. Parnaik, Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, emphasized the Government's responsibility and commitment to maintain peace in the TCL region. He also warned that any anti-national elements in the region would face 'severe consequences', and reiterated that citizens of the State would be protected from 'outside influence and intimidation.' Further, he highlighted the strategic significance of border security and the initiation of necessary steps to protect the interests of the nation and welfare of citizens residing in the border areas. At the end of 2024, a new insurgent outfit, the United Tani Army (UTA), released several videos of its training camps, which was made available by its 'chairman' Anthony Doke (the 'chief' of the short-lived National Socialist Council of Taniland) on December 31. The videos demonstrated the presence of weapons and operatives in the camps, though the location of the camps remained unknown. In an interview, Doke alleged that the Government of India did not care about the areas inhabited by the Tani tribes and that he would later present a 'detailed plan' for his group. An unnamed official disclosed that Doke was based in Myanmar, and that 'the camps shown in the videos look likely to be that of the NSCN (K-YA). He is trying to revive the UTA with the help of Naga militants.' On January 17, 2025, after the arrest of UTA cadre and main recruiter Tana Hasi, on January 15, 2025, the Arunachal Police asked the UTA cadres to return to the mainstream. The Police stated, Return voluntarily to your families and communities. No legal action will be taken against you if you come forward on your own. We understand that many of you may have been misled or pressured into joining. If you step back now, we will provide you with support to reintegrate into society and pursue a better future. The immediate response of Government agencies has undermined the emergence of new insurgent group in the State. However, constant disturbances by banned organisations operating in India's Northeast remain a challenge in Arunachal State. Given the State's strategic location for insurgent groups operating in the region along the Indo-Myanmar border, militant groups continue to exploit the region's vulnerabilities in pursuit of their goals and agendas.

Hegseth Welcomes Saudi Defense Minister To Pentagon, Underscores ...	By Matthew Olay US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Monday highlighted the importance of the partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia while hosting that country's defense minister during a bilateral engagement at the Pentagon. After formally welcoming Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud and his delegation, both men delivered prepared remarks in the secretary's office. 'As you know, [President Donald J. Trump has] made clear in his administration [that] we're going to pursue peace through strength and put America first,' Hegseth said. 'But that does not mean ignoring partnerships; and, in fact, it requires greater attention to the ones that matter most,' he continued, adding that the U.S. partnership with Saudi Arabia 'matters a great deal.' Referencing the cooperation that took place between the countries during Trump's first administration, Hegseth pointed out that both nations worked together to pursue security and stability in the Middle East, as well as to combat terrorism in the region and increase mutual prosperity. He also highlighted the long-standing cooperation between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, noting that it dates back 80 years to when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Saudi King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud on the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Quincy. 'Since then, we've worked to take on terrorism and all its manifestations today, with groups like the Houthis,' Hegseth said. 'Today, our relationship is a critical center of gravity in a very turbulent world,' he added. Stating that ending the war in Ukraine is one of the president's top priorities, Hegseth said he wanted to thank the Saudi Kingdom for hosting conversations between top U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, Feb. 18, 2025. 'And I also want to continue deepening and strengthening our partnership to pursue security and prosperity for both Americans and Saudis. So, I'm very much looking forward to a great discussion,' Hegseth said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ0US5weGHdGT	2025-02-24T15:38:30-08:00	
Gloominess And Magical Thinking: The Comical, Frightening Mike Bu...	Never allow intelligence chiefs to speak publicly. Their prerogative lies in lying, their reassurance, cool deception. While the attractions of transparency are powerful, the result of a garrulous spook is always going to be unreliable. In Australia, a comically looking individual by the name of Mike Burgess terrorises and terrifies the local populace as head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the domestic spy agency. It will surprise no one familiar with this approach that it resembles several that have come before. Keep them frightened, soften them for the next encroaching round, and await ever larger budgets for the already fattened calf known as the national security state. In his 2025 threat assessment, the chief tries to be bracingly calm and reassuring, even as he delivers the frightening blows. 'Fortunately, I was born with the glass-half-full gene.' He tells us the agency is 'always looking ahead', which is encouraging. Prior to making that point, he says that he had 'focused on past and present threats.' With pointless contradiction assured, the theme is set for clotting clichés, grammatical torments and trying formulations. 'This year’s Assessment is future focused. And I think it’s fair to say it’s the most significant, serious and sober address so far.' Those wishing to waste their unrecoverable time listening to the address then realise that the agency has become a victim of public relations capture and trend shopping. Sections have been created that would make your run of the mill moronic university manager sigh. There is, for instance, a 'Futures Team' (think 'Future Fellows' or 'Deans of the Future' – their reality is never the now but always deferred) that supposedly 'pours over classified intelligence, reviews open source information, consults experts and uses structured analytical techniques to develop in-depth assessments about future trajectories and vulnerabilities.' The only thing missing from this froth is the use of artificial intelligence (appropriate for ASIO), which is bound to do the job as competently as any in the 'Futures Team'. For all we know, this is already being done, the machine component triumphant, the human minds lazily tempted. The predictable banalities follow in the Burgess show. 'Australia has entered a period of strategic surprise and security fragility.' If so, Australia has been entering for a very lengthy period, given the number of addresses Burgess has given. Like an academic who rises to the top on the strength of one idea and one paper eternally rewritten, the director can be relied upon to bore with ideas that have come before, ribboned and stringed for effect. 'Over the next five years, a complex, challenging and changing security environment will become more dynamic, more diverse and more degraded.' The Australian public, it would seem, is not playing along with the authorities. How dare they question and debate the norms they have been told are so sacred to servile stability? 'Social cohesion' – a vacuous term – is apparently eroding. Institutions are no longer trusted, while intolerance grows. Truth is being assailed (Burgess is a true comic as spy chief), 'undermined by conspiracy, mis- and disinformation.' For an entity that specialises in all three, this is fabulously funny. The terrifying world, it would seem, is replete with 'multifaceted, merging, intersecting, concurrent and cascading threats.' He is concerned 'about young Australians being caught up in webs of hate, both religiously and ideologically motivated'. There is a sense that individuals are seeking 'hybrid beliefs', cherry-picked from a garden of tempting varieties. Environmentalists of the left commune with Hitler in their beliefs. Islamic State propaganda converses with neo-Nazi dogma. Students of history will hardly find these couplings odd, but looking ahead will do that to you. In terms of concrete threats, one is singled out as numinous. One can only cringe at the identification of what Burgess calls 'the A-team'. This mysterious 'Australia team' is supposedly dedicated to combing 'professional networking sites for Australians with access to privileged information, and then use false, anglicised personas to approach their targets.' Their targets are offered 'consulting opportunities' and generous sums for reporting on Australian trade, politics, economics, foreign policy, defence and security. This does really sound like money poorly spent by the 'A-team', but who are we to judge? Some people are evidently living it up. Magical thinking also figures in domestic spy land. We find that questioning the imbecilic foreign policy decision by Australian governments to purchase and construct fantasy nuclear-propelled submarines as servitors of the US empire is bound to be the product of 'foreign interference'. The agency 'has identified foreign services seeking to target AUKUS to position themselves to collect the capabilities, how Australia intends to use them, and to undermine the confidence of our allies.' In his 2024 address, Burgess quotes the words of Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley to the Australian Parliament after establishing ASIO: 'It is not usual to discuss the detailed activities of a security service. Much of the value of such a service lies in the fact that it works quietly. Members of the organisation should not be unduly prominent at cocktail parties, but should devote themselves to the tasks allotted to them.' Burgess, ever the funny man, then takes a stab at humour, claiming to be more permissive than the former Australian PM: 'given the work my people do, I would never begrudge them the odd cocktail party now and then'. If only his agents, and Burgess, spent more time at such events and less time babbling on the stage, we would all be better off.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ7CcQg_Pp1zJ	2025-02-24T15:35:45-08:00	
Kremlin’s Militarization Of Russia’s Youngest Has Far-Reaching Co...	Russian educational institutions, especially kindergartens and early childhood education, have been militarized since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The regular use of army songs, posters, and guns in the curriculum to promote military values and the employment of returning veterans as instructors now dominate the kindergartens and early grades of Russian schools (Govorit Nemoskva, February 17). Many Russian parents and outside observers dismiss this as a passing phase. They believe that children who are now being subject to pro-war propaganda in kindergartens and the early grades will not be affected for very long and will adopt different positions when they grow older. Aleksandra Arkhipova, an independent Russian anthropologist, however, argues that a landmark study of the impact of anti-Semitic propaganda in Nazi-era German schools suggests otherwise (Voigtländer, Nico and Hans-Joachim Voth, 'Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,' PNASVol. 112, No. 26 (June 2015): 7931-7036). Arkhipova believes that what is happening in Russian early childhood educational institutions now is likely to cast a dark shadow on the future. The children now passing through these schools are disposed to support militarism and aggression long into the future, serving as an important base of support for those in the Kremlin now and decades hence who want to pursue such policies (Telegram/anthro_fun, reposted at Echo fm, February 7; Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7, reposted at Echo fm, February 8). The German study to which Arkhipova refers found through the use of surveys that Germans who were subjected to anti-Semitic messaging in schools during Nazi times were far more likely to remain anti-Semitic decades later than those born either earlier or later and not having had that experience (Voigtländer, Nico and Hans-Joachim Voth, 'Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,' PNAS Vol. 112, No. 26 (June 2015):7931-7036). This finding strongly suggests, Arkhipova continues, that the same pattern will hold with Russian children who are now being subjected to pro-war propaganda and are likely to remain more pro-war than those older or younger and thus form an important reservoir of support for aggressive and pro-war Kremlin policymakers long into the future. Unsurprisingly, Arkhipova’s posts have attracted widespread attention among Russians in particular because they challenge the assumptions and hopes many in that country have about a post-Putin Russia. Additionally, unlike in the case of Germany, there is virtually no chance that Russia will suffer the overwhelming defeat and occupation that transformed German society after 1945. This transformation helped to reduce to a minimum the ideas promoted by the Nazis in kindergartens and schools. Some Russians fear, although may seldom feel free to say, that if there is no such imposed transformation in Russia, the militarist and aggressive policies Putin has implemented will continue. These policies will enjoy the support of the rising generation, in whom many placed their hopes to create a better Russia. One Russian observer who has given particular attention to Arkhipova’s argument and the evolving state of Russian national identity is Vladimir Pastukhov, a Russian scholar now based in London. In a telegram channel post picked up by Russian internet portals, Pastukhov says that Arkhipova’s argument has prompted him to think 'about the evolution that Russian society has undergone over the forty years of post-communism … from ‘new Russians’ to ‘other Russians’' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8, reposted at Echo fm, February 9). Pastukhov’s argument extends the one posited by Arkhipova by expecting a very different Russia than the one others like him have lived through or hoped for since the end of the Soviet system. Since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Pastukhov says, many commentators have focused on the way in which the war has become an important part of the genesis of a new Ukrainian nation. Few, however, have focused on how it is playing an analogous function for the Russian nation (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). He continues that for the reasons Arkhipova proposes as well as broader ones, it seems almost certain that 'a completely different Russian society will emerge from the war than the one which entered it' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). Russia’s war against Ukraine marks 'the end of the history of post-communism with its ‘new Russians’ and the beginning of a fundamentally different era … the main character of which will be ‘the other Russian’' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). This represents, Pastukhov says, the latest round of nation-building in Russia, extending the argument of others that the tragedy of Russia is that the country became an empire before the people became a nation (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). Therefore, it has little chance to become a nation-state and every chance to remain a people defined by the retention and pursuit of empire (Asia Russia Daily, January 12, 2015; Gorod 812, December 14, 2020; Svoboda, March 2, 2024). It is a contested issue, with the opposition hoping for one kind of Russian nation and the Kremlin hoping for a very different one. This struggle has not, however, attracted as much attention as it deserves, the London-based Russian analyst says. While many in Russia and the West are more than willing to suggest that Ukraine does not exist as a nation, very few are prepared to recognize that Russia is not a nation, in the modern sense. Russia’s attachment to the state and the idea of imperial expansion reflects that reality (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). According to Pastukhov, the Kremlin has a better understanding of this reality than its opponents (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). It is actively working to institutionalize itself by shaping the youngest members of society as Arkhipova suggests, anticipating to 'mold golems from ‘the inhabitants’ in the hope of sitting out ‘behind the battlements’ for the time required for the golems to begin to speak' (Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7). In the meantime, this rising generation will be far more likely to speak positively of the Kremlin than promote the formation of a democratic Russian nation at peace with itself and its neighbors. The danger of that negative outcome, again as Arkhipova indicates, is likely to remain in place far longer than Putin himself (Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7).

Twenty Five Years Of Vladimir Putin – Analysis	By Ajay Kamalakaran On the evening of December 31, 1999, few in Russia knew what its first president was going to say in a recorded televised speech. The country, which was still in the financial doldrums because of its debt default, watched as Boris Yeltsin resigned. 'We are creating a vital precedent of a civilized and voluntary transfer of presidential power to a newly elected president,' Yeltsin said[1]. And yet, I have taken a different decision: I am leaving before the end of my term.' He added, 'In accordance with the Constitution, I have signed a decree giving the powers of president of Russia to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. He will be the head of state for three months, after which presidential elections will be held, also in accordance with the Constitution.' From the beginning of the new millennium, Putin has been Russia’s undisputed leader, serving as president for the entire period, except from 2008 to 2012, when he was prime minister to avoid violating the then two-term constitutional limit for the country’s highest office. In 1999, when Putin was handed over the reins of power, the country’s GDP was $1,331[2] per capita. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook estimates[3] that in 2025, this number will touch $16,077 or, and $48,957 on a PPP basis. For Russia watchers who have been living in and observing the country for the last two decades, it is hard not to notice the incredible changes that it has witnessed in this time period. At the beginning of Putin’s presidency, Russia looked like a former empire in decline – crumbling infrastructure, rampant alcoholism, street crime, often violent, extremist political movements and general disenchantment. In the Putin era, Russian cities have undergone a dramatic revival, turning into clean, restored, efficient and beautified urban spaces with expanded and safe multi-modal public transport. The development has spread far beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg. For instance, the East Asian city of Vladivostok was chosen as the host[4] of the APEC Summit. Two new suspension bridges were built to link the city to outlying areas, and its main university was expanded to accommodate a growing number of foreign students from countries such as India. Sochi, the Black Sea resort city, got a much-needed makeover in time for the 2014 Winter Olympics[5]. Foreign media was quick to point out flaws in Russia’s organisation of the sporting event, prompting Putin to take personal care to ensure that the 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosted across Russian cities, became the gold standard. It was during this event that football fans from across the world got a chance to see – and fall in love with – contemporary Russia. The urban revival has stretched to second and third tier, distant cities that for decades lacked Moscow’s attention. One such is Astrakhan[6], which is close to the Caspian Sea and an important part of the International North South Transport Corridor. The rural areas of Russia have not witnessed the kind of large-scale transformation as have its cities. Nearly a quarter of the population[7] of the country lives in rural areas. Over the last decade, the government has increasingly shifted its focus on the countryside, given the growing need for food security in a sanctioned world. In 2024, $144 million was allotted[8] by the government for preferential lending programs aimed at improving housing, transportation and living standards in rural Russia. However, inequality in Russia is relatively low: Russia’s Gini coefficient, a measure that represents income, wealth and consumption inequality in 2021 was 35.1[9], suggesting a moderate level of inequality. On foreign policy, the early years of Putin’s presidency were marked with attempts to build trust and ties with the West. His personal friendship with then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder paved the way for the construction of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The Russian President also enjoyed warm ties with George W. Bush, who was one of 50 heads of state at the World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. Bush was joined by French President Jacques Chirac, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and India’s Manmohan Singh. In the early 2000s, Russia and NATO were increasingly looking at boosting cooperation, forming the NATO-Russia Council[10] in 2002. This was termed 'a consultation, consensus-building, cooperation, joint decision making and joint action,' where individual NATO member states and Russia worked 'as equal partners on a wide spectrum of security issues of common interest.' Russia’s critical interests were attacked during the Barack Obama administration when American officials aggressively pursued a regime-change in Kiev. In 2013, the US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland openly admitted[11] at the US-Ukraine Foundation Conference that Washington was sponsoring the events at the Maidan in Kiev that would eventually lead to a coup and the installation of a US-friendly regime[12]. Washington’s increased interference in Ukraine after the 2014 coup, and persistent meddling in other former Soviet republics like Georgia killed any hopes of this Council achieving any of the goals it had set out. While reaching out to the West, Putin made it a cornerstone of his foreign policy to simultaneously revive sagging ties with India and to remove mistrust with China. It was under the leadership of Putin and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that India and Russia signed the Declaration[13] of Strategic Partnership, and began the exercise of holding annual summits. Top-level meetings are also held annually under the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Commission (IRIGC) mechanism. One of Putin’s greatest foreign policy successes was the final settlement of the Russia-China boundary dispute. In 2004, the countries signed the Complementary Agreement[14] on the Eastern Section of the Russia-China Boundary. As a part of the agreement, Russia handed over half of the Tarabarov (Yinlong) Island, as well as the Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island and a few islets on the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers. The countries, which share a 4,209-kilometre border, now have more than 160 functional border crossings. The relationships built by Putin with China and India were crucial for the balanced positions the countries took when Crimea became a part of Russia. The Asian giants also refused to join Western sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis. While the country’s isolation from the West has been irksome for some members of the political, bureaucratic and business elite, Moscow has offset this partially with its growing ties with Asia through setups like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and other emerging powers through BRICS and BRICS-plus. In an ideal world, Russia would enjoy the kind of relations with the West it did in May 2005, when Moscow hosted world leaders for the 60th anniversary of World War II Victory Day. But its critical security interests have been challenged by the West, making it difficult. The Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia to end the war in Ukraine, may help mend strained ties. Despite concerns over the Ukraine crisis prolonging and inflationary pressures at home, Putin’s approval rating[15] hovers over 80 per cent. As with most countries, it’s about the economy; life and living standards have improved drastically over the last 25 years. Most Russians would not trade this away for the instability and crises of the Yeltsin era. Opponents propped up the West are seen as those ready to take Russia back to the 1990s when food and housing were scarce. One of Russia’s greatest successes in the Putin era was the revival of agriculture. In 2005 the Russian government identified agriculture as a national priority area. From being an importer of food grains in the late 1990s, Russia went on to become a major global supplier, with exports of grain and processed grain products touching 83.5 million tonnes[16] in 2024, according to Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor. Another factor in Putin’s popularity at home has been his constant support for what is accepted as 'traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.' An official presidential decree[17] to this extent was issued in 2022. 'Traditional values ​​include life, dignity, human rights and freedoms, patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland and responsibility for its fate, high moral ideals, a strong family, creative work, the priority of the spiritual over the material, humanism, mercy, justice, collectivism, mutual assistance and mutual respect, historical memory and continuity of generations, the unity of the peoples of Russia,' the decree said. The 2022 presidential decree stressed the importance of religion for the country: 'Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions, which are an integral part of the Russian historical and spiritual heritage, have had a significant impact on the formation of traditional values ​​common to believers and non-believers. Orthodoxy plays a special role in the formation and strengthening of traditional values.' In Putin’s era, Russian Orthodox monasteries and churches have been revived across the country and programs on state television have promoted a return to religion. State support has also been extended to mosques and Buddhist monasteries. For instance, the old Cathedral Mosque was demolished in 2011 to make way for a new modern structure that houses 10,000 worshippers. For the opening ceremony of the new building in 2015, Putin was joined by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This emphasis on traditional values has also extended to making it easier for those who want to migrate to Russia. A 2024 presidential decree[18] grants even those who are not proficient in the Russian language or history temporary resident permits. It specifically invites those foreigners who reject 'the policies implemented by countries that impose destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes that contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.' This could be a simultaneous way of building goodwill with people of foreign countries, while addressing the demographic needs. A quarter of a century after Putin became Russia’s president, a large number of Russians see this as an era of revival and regeneration after a decline that began from the days of Perestroika.

Getting Ready For Tomorrow’s Myanmar – Analysis	By Nicholas Farrelly Myanmar’s top generals have had another bad year. Under relentless attack, their subordinates have surrendered regional military command headquarters, draconian conscription regulations were introduced to bolster the dwindling rank-and-file, and in the north, east and west, rebel armies are strangling access to valuable resources. Old certainties on the battlefields have been overturned by the proliferation of armed groups, including nimble guerrilla squads in central Myanmar and the widespread use, by all sides, of new combat technologies, including drones. The economy, under these conditions, is spluttering — with the national currency, the kyat, now worth only a quarter of its pre-COVID-19 value. Regime officials have imposed price controls on essentials like rice, cooking oil, eggs, fish and meat. Even middle-class families struggle to survive, and flows of desperate migrants are continuing to flee to Thailand and Malaysia. The junta is also clamping down in the digital sphere, limiting access to information and networks through the Internet. The top generals’ devastating misjudgement of the public mood in early 2021 means monitoring and coercing the population is a bigger job than ever. In response, Myanmar’s democrats, ethnic separatists and sundry revolutionaries are steadily undermining the coherence of the dictatorship. While the wars in Myanmar, and the resistance that exists in every town and city, receive only scant media or policy attention, the realities on the ground have shifted, quite profoundly, against the military regime. In terms of the economy, territorial fragmentation, combat capacity, international reputation and diplomatic energy, the regime is faltering. The generals in Naypyitaw could hobble on in this fashion, potentially for years. The history of mismanaged military dictatorship in Myanmar suggests that this is a highly plausible scenario. In 2025, or perhaps 2026, the generals also want to hold an election to try to rebuild their authority and create some greater legitimacy, including for diplomacy through ASEAN. Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, for a start, would certainly welcome such rehabilitation, but the fact is that any such regime-endorsed election would also be immediately dismissed as flawed and undemocratic. It is increasingly clear that Myanmar’s people, and interested outsiders, need to consider what other future the country might face as the present regime continues its downward slide. With Aung San Suu Kyi still locked up, there is no unifying figure for the resistance. The National Unity Government inevitably struggles to draw all of the different fighting forces together. Some local examples help to illustrate the precarious conditions for ’day-after’ scenario planning. The Arakan Army now controls almost everything of note in the western state of Rakhine. In northernmost Myanmar, the Kachin Independence Army is increasingly dominant. Yet, in both areas, there are other political actors, including armed groups, who feel they have claims to specific territory and resources. The Shan State remains highly contested and has been where the Myanmar army has suffered particular setbacks in the past year, including the loss of strategic military bases. Myanmar’s jumbled geographical mandates are nothing new; throughout its history, Myanmar has remained a patchwork of different territorial claims. At times, the central government has, through ceasefires and other agreements, managed to create a somewhat unified national condition. Ideologies of ‘national race’ inclusion that developed over generations, remain a key part of the regime’s response to these fraught political conditions. What has changed is the strongest ethnic minorities’ tolerance for a system that defines their inclusion on Bamar Buddhist terms. Might the mess eventually lead to formal fragmentation? If there are future negotiations about the shape of a federalised Myanmar state, the armies that have fought to secure their own territories will not simply turn over security and economic decision-making to a central government. They will want to control local resources, with extra influence over educational, linguistic, social and cultural outcomes. Balkanisation, however defined, is a part of today’s and tomorrow’s realities. Within ASEAN, chaired in 2025 by Malaysia, there is deepening concern that Myanmar’s internal problems are far too big to ignore. 2021’s Five-Point Consensus clearly failed to change regime behaviour, but the path to a new mechanism for engagement is also far from clear. China has much to lose if Myanmar descends further into the quagmire. But it is not apparent it would contribute to a grand negotiation if that implied contributions from regional competitors like India, Japan or Australia. Russia, limping through its invasion of Ukraine, still keeps Myanmar stocked with sophisticated military equipment. The fall of the half-century Assad regime in Syria, after the rapid withdrawal of Russian backing, naturally heartened Myanmar’s resistance. Closer to home, they also watched the implosion of Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh, with the former prime minister forced to seek sanctuary abroad. These examples have no doubt buoyed Myanmar’s resistance fighters and offer reminders that supposedly settled conditions do sometimes tip quickly. There is little sense, however, that Myanmar has caught US President Donald Trump’s attention. But an unpredicted intervention cannot be completely ruled out. There are Republican figureswith a long-term eye on Myanmar’s democratic prospects and its possible role in thwarting Chinese designs in the wider region. With more bloodshed and turbulence inevitable, questions about how regional and global powers might find common ground to help the Myanmar people shape their own destinies are not going away.

Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs Of Trade Destruction – Analysis	At the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, investor Warren Buffett warned of derivatives as weapons of financial mass destruction. President Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' could have a similar impact on world trade. Last week, President Trump tasked his economic team with devising plans for 'reciprocal tariffs' on every country taxing US imports. Designed in part as bargaining leverage with other countries, they are ramping up prospects for a global trade war with both American allies and adversaries. As Trump put it, 'I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less.' Since Trump did not impose new tariffs yet, Wall Street sighed in relief. Though the prime financiers of the Trump campaign, U.S. financial institutions are increasingly concerned that the administration’s new tariffs are broadening trade war, penalizing consumer and business confidence and risking accelerated inflation in America. The financial institutions should be concerned. The only reason that Trump did not impose fresh tariffs was that he initiated investigations that could ignite a far worse global trade war toward the late spring. Trump's tariff war with the world The US deficits first emerged in the early 1970s; decades before offshoring, the rise of China and other large emerging economies. Since the mid-2000s, China and the large emerging economies have driven global growth prospects. In the process, U.S. goods and services deficit has soared to $918 billion in 2024, up $134 billion from the previous year. Today, the world factory is not in the US, but in China. The US doesn’t benefit from trade surplus; it suffers from a huge deficit. Similarly, in the past eight decades, US dollar’s share of global payments has halved to less than 50% of the total. Thanks to the past Trump and Biden administrations, US trade deficit has more than doubled from $40 billion per month to about $90-$100 billion monthly. On February 1, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs and 10% duties on energy products on Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on China. The three countries are America’s greatest trade partners and the US has a trade deficit with each. Together with Germany and Japan, these five countries account for more than half of all US imports. They and all the rest will be next in the firing line. This week Trump suggested 25% tariffs on autos, pharma and semiconductors, which could 'go very substantially higher over a course of a year.' A (very) broad definition of reciprocal tariffs Starting with countries with the biggest trade surpluses and highest tariff rates first, the aim is to offset not just tariffs but also non-tariff measures, including vehicle safety rules. The same goes for value-added taxes (VAT), even though VATs are faced by both US and other international companies in different countries. VATs create no advantage for European firms and no disadvantage for US firms because they are neutral with respect to trade. Thanks to the new tariffs and non-tariff measures the Trump administration is also on a collision course with its major allies, the European Union and Japan. The idea is also to go after what the Trump administration deems as 'burdensome' regulations, harmful 'government subsidies' and flawed exchange rate policies. In the Trump world, all these measures erect unwarranted costs and barriers to US products in foreign markets. The Commerce Department and the US trade representative are expected to prepare their plans to achieve 'reciprocal trading status' by April 1 – perhaps appropriately on April Fools’ Day. Penalizing emerging and developing economies Should this trade war materialize, it could prove far costlier to the emerging and developing economies, and it might push several fragile economies over the edge. Ironically, export-led growth, the development doctrine that fueled the rise of many East and Southeast countries, could now hit the wall. In the postwar decades, the so-called Asian tigers – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea – were lucky enough to industrialize during increasing global integration. The more they still rely on export-led growth and a US trade surplus, the more they will find themselves in tricky waters with the Trump White House. The successors of these countries – particularly the large emerging economies and many of the BRICS, including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico - that rely on international trade and US trade surpluses would also have to reassess their growth models. Things are likely to get even more heated with those countries that trade oil and gas or other commodities in local currencies. Reiterating his longstanding threat, Trump said last week that US 'if [the BRICS] want to play games with the dollar' and 'if any trading gets through, it'll be 100% tariff, at least.' However, big trading economies like China, which have diversified economies and can divert their trade into the Global South, will be better insulated from US economic coercion. If the expansive BRICS can unite their forces, their collective leverage will prove formidable, even vis-à-vis the US and other G7 economies. By the early 2020s. China alone used its currency to settle half of its foreign trade and investment transactions. Overall, the emerging world will face elevated uncertainty surrounding US trade policy that can defer investment decisions and impact emerging economies linked to countries targeted by US tariffs. Undermining the WTO In a short order, Trump has tried to decimate the US aid agency (USAID), withdraw the US from the UN refugee relief agency in the Middle East (UNRWA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), while sanctioning the International Criminal Court (ICC). If completed, reciprocal tariffs would increase duties on many trading partners, while violating decades of normative trade policies by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trump’s attacks against the WTO began in the first term, when he put the global trade body into sleep by blocking judges from its top dispute-settlement panel. Instead of correcting the wrong, the Biden administration continued it. Now the Trump administration is eager to destabilize the WTO’s principle of 'most favored nation' (MFN) status. The MFN requires member nations to ensure equal tariff and regulatory treatment to other members unless they have free-trade agreements in place. The idea of applying different tariff rates to different countries violates the WTO principle of non-discrimination among its members. As Trump’s elevated tariff rates exceed the maximum rate negotiated with other WTO members, trading rules are violated. Expressing the views of many WTO members, China condemned these 'tariff shocks' that could upend the global trading system. Ironically, Trump is purposely undermining the 'rules-based trading world' that US claims to have fostered since the 1950s. Effectively, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs would mean a fatal rupture from the WTO. It could effectively endanger the very role of the trading body, the US role in the organization and the world’s trading system itself – for the first time in 75 years. Positioning for talks with China With an eye on his legacy, Trump wants a 'deal of a century' in China. He knows it needs to be a deal that can benefit both the US and China. His neoconservative hawks – Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sinophobe trade counselor Peter Navarro – will oppose any Chinese investment in the US. Yet, it is advisers like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; and tech billionaire Elon Musk who he will listen. In the Middle East and Ukraine, Trump has used his special convoy Steve Witkoff to get things done (and override neocon mutinies). With China, he could do the same. But this time around, Chinese policy authorities are more wary. Trump’s interest in a 'deal of a century' with China is an opportunity. But he is seen as a risk amplifier. The stakes are too high for policy mistakes. This is an abbreviated version of the commentary published by China-US Focus on Feb 21, 2025	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7oHRyY6yUCqE	2025-02-23T17:07:10-08:00	
Why The Bureaucracy Keeps Getting Bigger – OpEd	By Murray N. Rothbard Bureaucracy is necessarily hierarchical, first because of the Iron Law of Oligarchy, and secondly because bureaucracy grows by adding more subordinate layers. Since, lacking a market, there is no genuine test of 'merit' in government’s service to consumers, in a rule-bound bureaucracy seniority is often blithely adopted as a proxy for merit. Increasing seniority, then, leads to promotion to higher ranks, while expanding budgets take the form of multiplying the levels of ranks under you, and expanding your income and power. Bureaucratic growth occurs, then, by multiplying levels of bureaucracy. The theory of hierarchical government bureaucracy is that information is collected in the lowest ranks of the organization, and that at each successive higher rank, the manager culls the most important information from his subordinates, separates the wheat from the chaff, and passes the culled information higher up, so that, in the end, the President, for example, dealing with intelligence operations, receives a two-page memo distilling the most important information gathered and culled from hundreds of thousands of intelligence agents. The President, then, knows more than anyone else, say, about foreign affairs. One problem with this rosy model, as Professor Gordon Tullock points out in his illuminating book, The Politics of Bureaucracy,1 is that the model doesn’t ask whether or not each bureaucrat has the incentive to pass the best distillate of truth on to his superiors. The problem is that bureaucratic favor, especially at the higher levels, depends on pleasing one’s superiors, and pleasing them largely rests on telling the President and the higher bureaucrats what they want to hear. One of the great truths of human history is that one tends to shoot, or at least react badly, to the bearer of bad news. 'Sire, your policy is working badly in Croatia,' is not the sort of message that the President, say, wants to hear from his envoy, and, while the outcome in Croatia remains in doubt, the President and his aides want to continue to believe that their policy is doing well. Hence, the dissident is set down as a trouble-maker if not a subversive, and his career in the hierarchy is side-tracked, often permanently. In the meanwhile, the envoys or foreign service people who assure the President 'things are going very well in Croatia,' are hailed as perceptive fellows and their careers are advanced. And then, if years later, the dissident is proved correct, and the Croatian policy lies in shambles, is the president or any other ruler likely to turn in warm gratitude to the former dissident? Not hardly. Instead, he will still remember the dissident as a troublemaker, and he will not blame his aides, who, along with himself, have been proved wrong. For after all, didn’t the great mainstream of experts make the same error? How common is sincere soul-searching and repentance for past errors among Presidents or other rulers? Those bureaucrats who are shrewd analysts of human nature, then, and who understand the way rulers operate, will, if they see that the cherished policy of their President is in grave error, tend to keep their mouths shut, and let some other sucker be the messenger of bad news and get shot down. Every human activity and institution will tend to reward those who are most able to adapt to the best route to success in that activity. Successful market entrepreneurs will be those who can best anticipate, and satisfy, consumer demands. Success in the bureaucracy on the contrary, will go to those who are most apt at (a) employing propaganda to persuade their superiors, the legislators, or the public about their great merits; and therefore (b) at understanding that the way to rise is to tell the President and the top bureaucrats what they want to hear. Hence, the higher the ranks of the bureaucracy, the more yes-men and time-servers there will tend to be. The President will often know less about what is going on than those in the lower ranks. Hence, for example, the phenomenon of President Nixon, thinking he knew more than anyone else about the Vietnam War and yet actually knowing less than the astute reader of the New York Times. For the CIA and other intelligence warnings of what was going on, developed by many of the lower officers, were screened out by the higher-ups, for being contrary to the President’s preferred line, i.e., that all was going well.2 The standard explanation of why government grows is that, as time goes on, there is more work for government to do, and that therefore the public’s 'demand for government' rises. Far more accurate is the view that there is a case of an inverted Say’s Law, where supply — or rather the suppliers of government 'services,' the bureaucracy — themselves constitute the 'demand' for their own services, and that they engineer the consent of their superiors, or of the legislature, to provide the wherewithal in the form of increased taxation. Contrast the hilariously satirical, but all too perceptive account of 'Parkinson’s Law' of bureaucracy. Thus, Professor Parkinson asserted that, in a government bureaucracy, 'there need be little or no relationship between the work to be done and the size of the staff to which it may be assigned.'3 The continuing rise in the total of government employees 'would be much the same whether the volume of the work were to increase, diminish, or even disappear.'4 Parkinson identifies two 'axiomatic' underlying forces responsible for this growth: (1) 'An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals'; and (2) 'Officials make work for each other.' Parkinson begins his 'model' with an official who feels himself overworked. The official could resign, but that is unthinkable; besides, he would lose his pension rights. To ask to divide his work in half with a new colleague on his own level is equally unthinkable; for his status would be cut, and he would bring in a dangerous rival for the job of his own boss when the latter retires. He could ask for one assistant under him; but that would be dangerous, because the new man might achieve something like equal status with himself. No, his preferred route is to ask for two assistants, who could then compete with each other for his favor; pretty soon, each of these new assistants will complain of overwork, and each one of these will get two assistants. The original bureaucrat now has the satisfaction of having six men under him, and he is now ready for a promotion and a substantial raise in pay. But how about the work to be done? Won’t the original quantity of work be divided into seven parts, and won’t each man now be absurdly and manifestly idle and underworked? No — and here is one of Parkinson’s scintillating insights into the theory of bureaucracy — for one aspect of Parkinson’s Law is that 'work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.' Or, as Parkinson also puts it: 'The thing to be done swells in importance and complexity in direct ratio with the time to be spent.'5 Here enters the second aspect of Parkinson’s Law of Growth: that 'officials make work for each other.' For, says Parkinson, 'these seven make so much work for each other that all are fully occupied,' and the original man 'is actually working harder than ever.' Documents have to be sent to each man in turn, each has to comment on the document and send the comments to everyone else, they all have to confer on the document and the various amendments proposed, and the original man is now also wrapped up in problems of inter-personal relations between himself and his staff, and of each of his staff amongst the others. Finally, after a lengthy process of interaction, writes Parkinson, the original official produces the same reply to the document that he would have written if all his subordinates 'had never been born.' 'Far more people,' Parkinson concludes, 'have taken far longer to produce the same result. No one has been idle. All have done their best.'6 Parkinson then illustrates his law with delightful examples from the British Royal Navy. From 1914 to 1928, the number of ships in the Navy fell by 68 percent; the number of officers and men fell by 32 percent. And yet, during the same period, the number of dockyard officials and clerks in the Navy increased by 40 percent, while, even more outrageously, the number of Admiralty officials increased by over 78 percent. The annual rate of increase in the number of Admiralty officials, with little variation, was 5.6 percent. Parkinson takes another example from the British Colonial Office, from 1935 to 1954. In that period, the area and population of colonial territories remained about the same from 1935 to 1939, fell during the war until 1943, rose again until 1947, and then steadily decreased as Britain shed its Empire. And yet, in each of these two decades, the Colonial Office bureaucracy rose steadily in number by about 5.9 percent per year, regardless of what was happening in the scope of the alleged work to be done. Considering then the rate of increase each year in the Admiralty, and averaging the rates of increase of Admiralty and colonial officials, which is not, after all, more outlandish than many other statistical procedures, Parkinson triumphantly concludes that the number of officials will increase by an average of 5.75 percent per year, 'irrespective of any variation in the amount of work (if any) to be done.'7 A similar analysis was set forth earlier, in 1950, in a grievously neglected book by Connecticut attorney and farmer Thomas H. Barber, based on years of inquiry into government and on his observations of Washington bureaucracy during World War II. Barber writes that 'there are two requisites for a bureaucrat’s promotion, the first, the ability to get and hold votes, the second, the number of subordinates he is able to keep busy.' Barber goes on: … in the Federal Government the pay of a bureaucrat executive is proportioned by Civil Service law to the number of his subordinates. This leads to the rivalry in Washington as each bureaucratic chief tries to increase his 'empire.' Generally, in order to keep his subordinates busy the boss assumes an air of great importance and affects to be very hurried and under great pressure. He is very punctual at the office and insists that everyone else be. He then deliberately begins to multiply paperwork, calling for reports on any subject connected with his job. He issues enormously complicated orders and memoranda for the organization of his office, requiring that all papers be so routed round that almost every scrap has to be read by everyone in the office and discussed by a number of interlocking committees before it is acted upon. He requires that no paper be thrown away, but all shall be cross-indexed and filed. He has anybody who can be tagged, interviewed, a stenographic report made of the interview and typed (often he has them mimeographed), and circulated to be read and initialed. By these methods it is quite easy to take an amount of work that could be done easily and efficiently by three men and two stenographers, and blow it up so that it can keep from fifty to two hundred people extremely busy, and yet fall far behind in its execution. Thus the uncompleted work gives him an apparently sound excuse for more clerks, who increase his prestige and his pay.8 Barber then goes on to relate a delightful example of bureaucracy in action that he had observed during World War II. He notes that there existed a department whose work, 'supposing it was worth doing, which is doubtful,' could have been done competently by about twenty people. It was run, as he puts it, 'by a man with a bureaucratic soul.' This man asked for written opinions from everyone on all sorts of subjects and had every one read and initial them: He was always intensely busy himself, even at night; and he kept constantly increasing his department till he got it up to two hundred men and women. This made him very important. All the two hundred were so busy carrying out his regulations that they were in a constant sweat and confusion, had no time to think, and the essential work in support of the war effort — supposing it was essential — suffered dreadfully. He was rewarded and translated to a more important job. His successor, Barber related, was a different kind of person; an old gentleman with little ambition and little regard for the taxpayer, but whose objective was to do the essential work, and keep himself and everyone else at the workplace contented. In contrast to the twelve hours a day spent in the office by his predecessor, this man spent only one-half an hour at work each morning. The rest of the day, he walked around the office, talking and joking with the employees, and played golf in the late afternoon. At the end of the first week, says Barber, 'he fired about fifty of the two hundred people, apparently at random.' As a result, 'the work lessened considerably for the remaining ones.' There was naturally a lot of discussion of this action, and 'it was generally decided that he had fired the fifty he was sure he did not like.' 'Not a very scientific way of eliminating surplus help,' adds Barber, 'but it did lighten the work.' The following week, the new boss fired fifty more people, this time apparently dismissing those 'he thought he did not like.' In consequence, 'the work for the remainder lightened enormously, though some of the essential work of those dismissed was apportioned around silently by those that remained.' A few days later, another fifty people were dismissed, these being the people 'he was not sure he did like.' Barber notes: 'With three-quarters of the force eliminated there was practically nothing left but the ‘essential work’, such as it was, to do.' This work was done effectively in about half of each day by the fifty people remaining, 'far more efficiently than it had been done by the original two hundred. The fifty did their stuff and devoted the time remaining — about half of it — to their own concerns.' Barber concludes that 'the old gentleman, being now surrounded only by those he knew he liked, felt he had done enough.' He was in the office about an hour a day, and then he evaporated. 'The ‘work’ was far better done than it had been, people had time to think and were not in each other’s way.' Barber adds that the work probably could have been done by half again of those remaining, but that then the half would 'have had to work about as hard as the original two hundred had worked and there would have been no benefit to anyone but the taxpayers.'9 In addition to this keen treatment of bureaucracy, Thomas Barber was perhaps the first person to arrive at the essence of what is now called 'public choice' analysis in the economics profession. Barber notes the 'constant tendency for all governments to grow both in size and in authority.' Why? Barber answers: because the advantage of a big, powerful government, from the point of view of the bureaucrats, is personal, clear and ever-present to their eyes; and because the cost of it, not only in money but in freedom, which is lost by giving authority to officials, is vague and nebulous in the minds of the citizens whose attention is not focused on the government at all…. Therefore, since the bureaucrats know exactly what they want and are working for their own immediate interest, and since the other citizens do not realize what they are giving up, and, in fact, have not their attention on the matter at all, it is obvious which group will prevail.10 What public choicer has put it better? About the author: This article is adapted from 'Bureaucracy and the Civil Service in the United States.' Murray Rothbard was born March 2, 1926, the son of David and Rae Rothbard. He was a brilliant student even as a young child; and his academic record at Columbia University, where he majored in mathematics and economics, was stellar. In the Columbia economics department, Rothbard did not receive any instruction in Austrian economics, and Mises was no more than a name to him. In a course on price theory given by George Stigler, however, he encountered arguments against such then popular measures as price and rent control. These arguments greatly appealed to him; and he wrote to the publisher of a pamphlet that Stigler and Milton Friedman had written on rent control.

Uneven Prosperity Mapping India’s Poverty Struggles – OpEd	A glaring and varied picture of economic inequality in India is presented by the data on poverty levels in the various Indian states. The problem of poverty has long plagued India, and some areas are still severely affected even after years of efforts. In addition to showing the extent of poverty, the percentages on the map also highlight regional disparities in wealth distribution. One of the most populous states in India, Uttar Pradesh, has terrible conditions, with 32.1% of its people living on US$ 3.20 (? 270 approx.) or less per day. Although Uttar Pradesh is an important agricultural and industrial centre for India, a sizable section of its people live in poverty. This can be ascribed to inadequate social services, bad governance, and a lack of infrastructure. A cycle of poverty has been sustained, particularly in rural areas, by slow agricultural growth and restricted access to healthcare and education. Likewise, 23.3% of people in Bihar, another state with a large population, live in poverty. Despite advancements in areas like agriculture and education, Bihar has long been one of the poorest states in India. However, the state's overall economic growth has not been sufficient to lift a sizable section of its population out of poverty. Bihar's low productivity in agriculture and lack of industrialisation are the main causes of the state's high poverty. Moreover, the state's yearly vulnerability to floods and other natural disasters makes matters worse and forces millions of people into ever-deeper poverty. At 27%, poverty is also a significant problem in Odisha. Despite having an abundance of natural resources and minerals, Odisha has had difficulty transforming its wealth into widespread prosperity. Much of Odisha's population, like that of Bihar, depends on the still-underdeveloped agricultural sector. The industrial and mining sectors have not been inclusive enough to help the economically vulnerable despite their contribution to the state's GDP. Tribal areas of the state, which have been neglected in terms of development for decades, also contribute to the high rates of poverty. Surprisingly, 34.9% of the people in Maharashtra, one of India's economic superpowers, live on ? 270 or less per day. This number is concerning because Maharashtra is home to some of India's most advanced cities, such as Mumbai, the nation's financial hub. Here, we see the sharp contrast between rural poverty and urban wealth. Although much wealth has been created in metropolitan areas like Mumbai, most is concentrated among a small percentage of the population. Maharashtra's rural areas, where agriculture is still the primary source of income, are still plagued by poverty, droughts, and a lack of infrastructure investment. West Bengal is another state with a high population density, where 35.2% of people live below the poverty line. Even though the state has improved healthcare and education, its economic development still lags behind other states. Poverty has persisted partly due to the slow rate of industrialisation and the demise of traditional industries like jute. There is now a division between the countryside and urban areas like Kolkata because rural areas, especially those in the state's north and west, have been left behind in the drive for development. Like many other agrarian states, 26.4% of Rajasthan's population lives below the poverty line. Even with recent improvements in infrastructure and tourism, Rajasthan is still heavily reliant on agriculture, which is regularly impacted by unpredictable monsoon rains. Droughts, poor soil quality, and water scarcity are persistent problems in the desert state that exacerbate its economic difficulties. The state's advancements in other areas, such as urbanisation and renewable energy, have not had enough impact to lift the poverty many rural residents face. However, states like Tamil Nadu (5.7%) and Kerala (16%) show how progressive social welfare, healthcare, and education policies can dramatically lower poverty. Kerala has a robust healthcare system and high literacy rates and has continuously done well on several human development indices. Its poverty rates are low compared to other states, emphasising how crucial a robust welfare state is to combating poverty. The success of Tamil Nadu, which has the lowest poverty rate at 5.8%, further emphasises how important good governance and industrialisation are in generating jobs and services that help people escape poverty. The development models presented by both states strongly emphasise using human capital to combat inequality and poverty. Gujarat is a mixed case with a 21.8% share. The state is well-known for its quick economic expansion and industrialisation and has done an excellent job promoting entrepreneurship and creating jobs. However, poverty still exists in some places, especially in rural areas and among marginalised communities, which suggests that growth's advantages have not been shared fairly. Gujarat's emphasis on business and industry has occasionally come at the expense of social development initiatives that could significantly lower poverty. Relatively lower poverty rates in Delhi and Haryana (14% and 15.7%, respectively) demonstrate the advantages of northern India's urbanisation and economic expansion. As the nation's capital, Delhi has witnessed tremendous advancements in healthcare, education, and infrastructure, all of which have contributed to a decline in poverty. However, there are still problems with income inequality, especially between the wealthy and the less fortunate groups, such as slum dwellers and migrant workers, who find it challenging to make ends meet. Haryana has also profited from economic growth because of its proximity to Delhi and robust agricultural base, but inequalities still exist, especially in rural areas. An intriguing example is the northeastern states, like Nagaland (12.6%). These states have historically had greater rates of poverty because of their remote locations, inadequate infrastructure, and constrained economic prospects. However, targeted development initiatives, especially through central government programs and heightened focus on regional sectors like tourism and handicrafts, have contributed to a decrease in poverty in recent years. Nagaland's comparatively lower poverty rate demonstrates that focused interventions can make a significant difference even in historically underprivileged areas. On the other hand, the union territory of Lakshadweep provides an example of how poverty can be virtually eradicated with small, homogeneous populations and well-distributed resources, as evidenced by its remarkably low poverty rate of 0.3%. Due to the territory's small population, steady government assistance, and investments in regional businesses like tourism and fishing, there is little poverty and a high standard of living. The disparity in poverty rates among these states highlights how difficult it is to combat poverty in a nation with India's diversity. Geographical features, natural resources, governance, and historical development are all important determinants of each state's economic success. Poverty has decreased more successfully in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Gujarat, which have prioritised infrastructure development, industrialisation, and human capital investment. While this is going on, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha have had difficulty pulling sizable segments of their populations out of poverty due to their inadequate infrastructure, restricted access to healthcare and education, and excessive reliance on agriculture. Therefore, India's strategies for reducing poverty must be customised to meet each state's unique requirements and difficulties. This could entail concentrating on raising agricultural productivity, funding rural infrastructure, and expanding access to healthcare and education for states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In more developed states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the emphasis may need to change to tackle income inequality and ensure that economic expansion's advantages are shared more fairly. Furthermore, the fact that many states continue to have high rates of rural poverty emphasises the necessity of giving rural development more attention. The majority of India's population still lives in the rural hinterlands, which are neglected, while urban centres continue to expand and draw investment. The deep-seated poverty in these areas must be addressed through policies that enhance rural infrastructure, increase agricultural productivity, and generate non-farm employment opportunities. Furthermore, the differences in poverty levels highlight the significance of governance. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala that have made significant investments in welfare programs have seen a notable decrease in poverty. This implies that although economic expansion is crucial, social policies that guarantee growth advantages are distributed fairly must also be implemented. Social security, healthcare, and education are essential for enabling people to escape poverty and should be prioritised by all national governments. Finally, India's poverty map illustrates the country's uneven development. While some states have achieved notable progress in lowering poverty, others are still caught in a vicious cycle of hardship. A comprehensive strategy that considers each state's particular difficulties is needed to combat poverty in India. The way forward is obvious, ranging from boosting social welfare programs and addressing income inequality to increasing agricultural productivity and rural infrastructure. Combining inclusive social policies and economic growth is essential to bringing millions of Indians out of poverty and guaranteeing a more equitable future for everybody.

Ending The Russia–Ukraine War On Trump’s Terms – OpEd	By Dave Patterson The hands of the Russia-Ukraine war clock have ticked past 1,000 days. President Donald Trump is determined to end the conflict and stop the carnage. The Biden administration and Ukraine’s European neighbors were helpless in bringing the Russian invaders and their victims in Ukraine to the negotiating table for meaningful discussions, and Trump has potentially done that with two phone calls. Following Trump’s Feb. 12 conversations, one with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the other with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the stage was set for substantive talks aimed at ending three years of misery that began with the Kremlin’s unprovoked invasion Feb. 24, 2022. Peace Talks Begin The peace talks began on Feb. 18 in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh at the Diriyah Palace. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff represented the United States. They were joined by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the perennial face of the Kremlin’s foreign policy team, and Aide to the President Yuri Ushakov. A US State Department readout explained that 'President Trump wants to stop the killing; the United States wants peace and is using its strength in the world to bring countries together.' The statement continued with the observation that Trump 'is the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree' to a peace pact. Regardless of who is at fault for the aggression, neither of the two belligerents trusts the other. Buildling trust between Washington and Moscow will be a steep hill to climb, so it makes sense to take on this challenge first. To that end, the talks resulted in four trust-building steps. The US negotiators announced that they had decided to: 'Establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions. 'Appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides. 'Lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine. '[P]ledge to remain engaged to make sure the process moves forward in a timely and productive manner.' The State Department was clear in setting appropriate expectations for any rapid, permanent end to the destruction and bloodshed in Ukraine. 'One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace. We must take action, and today, we took an important step forward.' Soon after the meeting concluded, the US contingent met with journalists from CNN News and the Associated Press. A question posed was about how the Ukrainians and Europeans 'feel' shut out of the peace process as it has unfolded. In response, Rubio offered a dose of reality absent from the previous administration’s relationship with the Kyiv government and European leaders: 'Well, the comment I would have on that is that for three and a half years while this conflict has raged … no one else has been able to bring something together like what we saw today because Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that can. So, no one is being sidelined here.' Ukraine and Europeans Worried About Being Left Out To assuage the fears of the Europeans and Ukraine that they are not represented, Waltz offered, 'Look, it’s common sense. If you’re going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.' However, for the first meeting to establish confidence, having diplomats by the score, all pushing their country’s particular agenda, would have been a waste of time. Furthermore, candid and transparent, 'Rubio said a negotiation process had not begun in earnest, and if talks advanced, the Ukrainians and other Europeans would be brought in the fold,' Reuters reported. A key player with the most skin in the game is not convinced. RealClearPolitics quotedZelensky in a Meet the Press interview about assurances that Ukraine’s position would be protected. He declared, 'So, I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. And our people, never.' His passion is understandable — the Ukrainians have lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens to a brutal Russian war machine. Nonetheless, never say never. When it comes to bringing peace to Ukraine, if not the United States, who? If not now, when? The previous administration and European leaders presided over a protracted conflict with no end in sight. It’s time for something different. The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate. About the author: National Security Correspondent at LibertyNation.Com.

China Advances To Second Place In Global Soft Power Ranking – OpE...	China has overtaken the UK to secure 2nd place globally, advancing one position from the previous year ... in the Global Soft Power Index 2025. The latest report of the Global Soft Power Index for 2025 by influential brand valuation consultancy, Brand Finance, highlights the remarkable progress of China in its index ranking the extent of power and influence in world politics and international relations wielded by countries of the world. It now sits at second place behind the US which, although ranking first, has seen its soft power standing undermined by global concerns of its political stability, reputation and governance. The Global Soft Power Index report is based primarily on key indicators in economics and business. It also measures attributes related to culture and heritage, media and communication, education and science and sustainability. These together are increasingly seen as the other more influential and effective side of the power coin as compared with the flip side of hard power associated with military power and intervention, coercive diplomacy and economic sanction. The report notes that China retains first place globally for ‘ease to do business in and with’ and ‘future growth potential’ attributes for the last four years consecutively. This is a picture quite different to the one of ‘China collapsing’ and ‘China in economic crisis’ regularly featured in western mainstream media and reproduced by supporting Asian media. What is also notable is that China has soared to 7th place in the ranking of ‘culture and heritage’ and ‘media and communication’ attributes. This trend is strengthening with the further opening up of the country to foreign visitors and the global impact of the movie, Ne Zhe2 (NZ2) and Deep Seek, the artificial intelligence app. The impact of NZ2 and Deep Seek in their respective fields has been such that western media leaders such as CNN, BBC and New York Times that regularly engage in anti-China reporting, as well as have ignored or marginalized Chinese achievements, have been reluctantly aroused to run stories on them, albeit with their mandatory negative comments. Meanwhile, missing from the mainstream media coverage is India’s decline from the 29th position in 2024 to its current 30th position in 2025. Ne Zha2 Global Movie Megahit Ne Zha2 (NZ2), the latest China produced animation film hit with its story line of family, friendship, loyalty and sacrifice encapsulated within a framework of Chinese mythology and techno wizardry has captivated movie audiences wherever it has been shown and is expected to generate more than US$2 billion in box office takings. This will make it the highest ranking box office animated film in the world. What's appealing to movie fans, especially American audiences viewing it in the small number of cinemas it is showing - 300 of 9595 movie theatres - are not just the universal themes of courage and resilience but also the absence of messages relating to wokeness, political correctness, and attitude. Unlike in the West, where cultural dominance has been tied to colonial conquest and expansion, religion and political dominance, this example of film making and cultural influence is different. In today's high-tech era, films like NZ2 demonstrate how technology, storytelling and cultural heritage can converge to create a new filmmaking and culture dissemination model rooted in non ideological equality and dialogue rather than the legacy western model with its message of white, Christian and ideological goodness, superiority and supremacy. Movie audiences are no strangers to mythology-based storytelling. However, Chinese and other non-western mythology and story lines have been underexplored in the global entertainment world despite their rich history and universal themes. This is not only due to cultural and historical differences. It is more importantly an outcome of American dominance in the development of the movie industry since the early 20th century. Hollywood - with US government support - has dominated the world box office for more than a century and helped to shape how audiences in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America view the US and the world. Whilst this continues today, the success of Ne Zha and its sequel should encourage small countries in their cultural confidence and ability to tell their own stories. This will impact their soft power influence and ranking among the countries of the world. Deep Seek: Sputnik Moment and Bombshell Impact NZ2 comes on the heels of Deep Seek with the latter emerging like a bombshell in app stores around the world. As the most downloaded AI app, replacing Chat GPT, the Chinese AI model has significantly impacted the global tech industry by its cost-effective low budget development. This has caused major tech stocks to plummet and raised questions about the shifting power dynamics in the AI market. Many now see China as a major player in AI development that can challenge western AI apps presently dominating the market and tech giants such as Microsoft and Google. What’s important to the estimated 5 billion smartphone users in the world - they account for over 60% of the world’s population - is not that it is a Chinese app but that it is free. For those using it, Deep Seek has pioneered and opened the door to an open source app that can be used and modified easily and without the need to pay a fee or royalty. Deep Seek and NZ2 are not the only examples of China's growing soft power in the world. They follow Huawei, BYD, TikTok, Red Note and other recent China innovations and products developed entirely or mainly with homegrown talent whose ripple effects are affecting and undermining US and western domination of the existing world order. How will Trump’s MAGA Impact Global Power Balance Perhaps the greatest asset to China’s influence in the world for now comes from an unlikely source - President Donald Trump. As the world’s greatest political influencer and news maker, Trump in his mission to make America great again has embarked on a foreign policy campaign that has made allies of the US realize that their client status makes it inevitable that their interests will be placed on the sacrificial table if they stand in the way of Trump’s redefinition of American hard and soft power, and the ensuing relations with Russia, China or any other adversary. This, combined with China’s burgeoning soft power achievements, and Belt and Road Initiative with its emphasis on economic development and regional connectivity to bring about shared prosperity, will result in the more rapid remaking of the current world order to a more equitable and inclusive multipolar one.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7iUZlNZE-2vR	2025-02-23T16:50:57-08:00	
Germany Swings Right As Merz’s Christian Democrats Projected To W...	By Jonathan Packroff and Nick Alipour and Owen Morgan and Victoria Becker (EurActiv) -- Germany’s centre-right recorded a clear victory in Sunday’s national elections, according to early projections, heralding a substantial political shift in Europe’s largest country and clearing the way for Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats, to become Germany’s next chancellor, replacing Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats. Early projections put Merz‘s centre-right bloc, which also includes the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), at 29%, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 21 % and the Social Democrats (SPD) at 17%. The Greens won about 12%, the Left 9%, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) 4.5%, and the leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance 4.9%, according to the projections. The preliminary result signaled a substantial shift to the right in Germany's electorate since 2021, with the centre-right bloc and AfD recording a collective 48.5%, a massive jump from 34.5%. Given that Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, however, the prospect of a coalition between the two is slim. It was unclear late on Sunday whether the BSW would make it past the electoral threshold of 5%, which is required to gain parliamentary representation. Barring a substantial shift in the results, the process of crafting a coalition promises to be fraught, with the early returns suggesting Merz may need two partners to build a majority in parliament, most likely with the SPD and the Greens. 'It's now about creating a government that is capable of acting as soon as possible with a solid parliamentary majority,' Merz said. 'The world out there isn't waiting for Germany, and it isn't waiting for long-winding coalition talks in negotiations.' 'Rambo zambo' If confirmed, the results would be worst in the SPD's more than 100-year history, while also marking the first time since the World War Two that the Christian Democrats and SPD did not take the first two places in a national election. The projected centre-right win marks dramatic personal victory for Merz, who had all but abandoned his aspirations of becoming chancellor more than 20 years ago after his then-rival, Angela Merkel, outmanoeuvered him for the party leadership. Much to Merkel's chagrin, Merz returned to the head of the party in 2022 after two unsuccessful bids for the party leadership in 2018 and 2021. 'Now is the time for rambo zambo at the Adenauer House,' a triumphant Merz told supporters at the Adenauer House, the Christian Democrats party headquarters in Berlin. 'Tonight we'll celebrate, and from tomorrow we'll get to work.' For Scholz, there was little to celebrate. The chancellor and former finance minister, whose ascent other the chancellorship in 2021 suprised many, led the party to its worst national election result since 1887. He proved incapable of reining his fractious three-party coalition, however, and was ultimately forced to trigger its collapse in November, a year before the end off its term. 'This is a bitter result for the Social Democratic party, it is also a defeat – it needs to be said loud and clear,' said Scholz, who signalled he would step away from the limelight. Supporters were dead silent in the party’s headquarters when the SPD result was announced. 'A win for Europe' Merz said during the election night Elefantenrunde roundtable talkshow of top candidates that he hoped to form a new government by Easter, and that he wants to talk 'properly' to the Social Democrats after a tough exchange of blows on the campaign trail. On multiple occasions, he ruled out entering into a coalition with the AfD. As majorities remained uncertain, officials feared that prolonged negotiations over a future government could spell trouble for Europe amid global upheaval. 'The world is not waiting for us. Europe is waiting for us, for Germany, to take on a stronger leadership role again,' Merz said. Merz, who is a keen transatlanticist, added that Europe should prioritise agreeing on a united position on the US's negotiations with Russia on Ukraine. 'For me, it will be an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,' he stressed, noting that 'the Americans, at least this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.' The CDU's leader in the European Parliament, Daniel Caspary, hailed the victory as a win for Europe. 'The largest European country, in the heart of Europe, is now back on track,' Caspary told Euractiv. Christian Lindner, the former finance minister whose departure from government hastened the collapse of Scholz's coalition government, announced his resignation after the FDP failed to reach the 5% minimum threshold for seats in parliament. Asked if his Greens would approach the CDU over a possible coalition, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck suggested it was Merz's prerogative to initiate those discussions. But he also made clear the Greens were willing to join a coalition. 'This is the only possibility,' Habeck told ZDF public television. 'One has to let it sink in what this result means: We are in a very difficult situation.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7jwEB3BCQvc6	2025-02-23T16:46:09-08:00	
Zelenskyy Willing To Step Down As President To Secure Ukraine Pea...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is ready to give up his position to bring peace, saying it could be in exchange for his country joining NATO. Zelenskyy was speaking on the eve of the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, amid mounting pressure from Washington to engage in peace talks. 'If there is peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready.... I can exchange it for NATO,' Zelenskyy told a press conference in Kyiv, adding he would depart 'immediately' if necessary. Following a bruising week in which he had a public rift with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, Zelenskyy also said he wanted Trump to visit Ukraine and that he was 'grateful' for American support during the war. 'I want very much mutual understanding with Trump,' Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' However, Zelenskyy also questioned a figure of $500 billion in U.S. support quoted by Trump, saying the real figure was closer to $100 billion. He said he would not recognize previous U.S. grants as loans. Transatlantic Cracks His comments come amid concerns of cracks in the transatlantic alliance as Washington held high-level direct talks with Moscow. In the past week, U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Zelenskyy and suggested he was responsible for starting the conflict -- although he later walked back these comments in an interview on Fox News radio, stating Zelenskyy should not have allowed Russia to attack. Zelenskyy, for his part, had caused anger in Washington by stating that Trump lived in 'a disinformation bubble.' Trump has also suggested Zelenskyy might not be needed in peace talks and called for access to Ukrainian mineral wealth as compensation for U.S. aid provided so far. Trump aide Steve Witkoff told CNN on February 23 that he expected the deal to be signed this week. Zelenskyy said it needed to include security guarantees for Ukraine, and that a deployment of U.S. troops in his country would be logical. European Diplomacy European leaders have joined Zelenskyy in voicing fears over the dangers of Western disunity -- and of their countries being left out of talks on ending the war. While other Western leaders head to Kyiv on February 24, French President Emmanuel Macron will fly in the opposite direction for talks with Trump in Washington. He'll be followed later in the week by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Both men will seek to find common ground with Trump on next steps. 'Nobody wants the bloodshed to continue. Nobody, least of all the Ukrainians,' Starmer told a party conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on February 23. 'But after everything that they have suffered, after everything that they have fought for, there could be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term secure future.' Starmer repeated his pledge that Britain would be prepared to provide boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders have held hastily convened discussions on the subject in recent days in another reflection of their concern that Washington is cooling on further support. In a further sign of support for Kyiv, British Foreign Secretary Daniel Lammy said on February 23 that his country would announce its largest package of sanctions on Russia to coincide with the three-year anniversary. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke in messianic terms to justify his invasion of Ukraine, on the eve of the third anniversary of his forces' full-scale assault. 'Fate willed it so, God willed it so,' he said at an event in Moscow on February 23 with soldiers who fought in Ukraine. This is not the first time Putin has used such language to justify Russia's aggression against Ukraine. In 2014, he defended his country's illegal seizure of Crimea by saying the peninsula had a 'sacred meaning' for Russia, comparing it to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities reported their country had come under its largest-ever drone attack from Russia overnight on February 22-23. Reports of casualties were gradually coming in from across the nation. The attacks further underlined Ukraine's vulnerabilities as well as its reliance on U.S. military assistance. Speaking to Current Time in recent days, military analysts said air defense was a key area where Kyiv relied on Washington. 'All other [military supplies] can be found in Europe. In some way, European help can replace American help. But air defense -- this is the key area,' said Oleksiy Alshanskiy from Conflict Intelligence Team.

Hezbollah Can Rebuild And It Will Be Disastrous For Lebanon – Ana...	By Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib As expected, Israel refused to fully withdraw from Lebanon on Feb. 18, leaving its forces in five border areas. Maintaining the occupation in this way is exactly the breath of life Hezbollah needs to revive itself.On Feb. 23, Hezbollah held the funeral of its secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27 last year. The funeral was an occasion for the group to show it still commanded strong support among the Shiite community.Wafiq Safa, the official in charge of the group’s coordination and liaison unit, said a few weeks ago that Hezbollah would emerge stronger than it was before. He could be right. It was born out of the grievances caused by the Israeli invasion in 1982. Now, Israel has created enough hatred and pain to give the group exactly the boost it needs to rebuild itself.Prior to withdrawing from the areas they did leave, Israeli forces made sure to burn the houses they had not already destroyed. Towns close to the border, such as Kfar Kela, were razed to the ground.Southern Lebanon is an agrarian society; the people there make a living from the crops they farm. Israel bombed the south with phosphorus bombs to ensure those people would no longer be able to cultivate their land.Israeli authorities are attempting to create an undeclared 'no-man’s land,' a buffer zone along the border with Lebanon. They hope that because of all the destruction, people will be discouraged from returning home. Through this buffer zone and control of five strategic points along the border, Israel thinks it can guarantee the security of its settlements in Galilee.In addition, the Israelis think that their presence within Lebanese borders means they will be able to move freely there and target anyone they want. A few days ago, for example, Israeli forces carried out a drone attack in Saida in which they assassinated a Hamas operative. Their reconnaissance and surveillance drones and planes can breach and roam Lebanese airspace as they please. From time to time, they fly at low altitude and break the sound barrier, creating fear and anxiety among the Lebanese people.Why would they not? Israeli authorities see no restrictions on their actions. They can do whatever they want. They broke all international laws in Gaza and faced no repercussions, so why not in Lebanon?However, the Israelis underestimate the urge this is fueling among the Lebanese to fight back, especially among Shiites, whose homes and land have been devastated. This is something Hezbollah, weakened as it is, can use to its advantage.To fully understand the group’s fall, one should understand its rise. Hezbollah was created out of a need to fight an Israeli occupation. It evolved from small, random groups into a formidable, well-organized guerrilla force that could spread fear among the generals in Tel Aviv. Of course, its creation came three years after the Iranian revolution, and directly after the Israeli invasion of Beirut. The rise of Hezbollah was considered the first export of Iran’s revolution to the Arab world and it was successful mainly because of the indigenous need to fight the Israeli occupation. After Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah lost its raison d’etre as a resistance organization. Following the withdrawal of Syrian forces in 2005, the group entered politics. Its members felt they had to because they had lost their Syrian sponsor. Political power represented a tool with which to protect their arms; they did not want a government in place they could not control, which might ask them to disarm in compliance with 2004’s UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and the 1989 Taif Agreement that ended the civil war in Lebanon.In 2008, Hezbollah tightened its grip on the government through the Doha agreement, signed on May 21 that year, which was designed to end an 18-month political crisis during which the weapons the group had been pointing at the Israelis were turned on their fellow Lebanese.On May 7, 2008, Hezbollah had taken Beirut by force. It became part of the country’s corrupt political structure. The arms that had been protecting Lebanon from Israeli aggression were now the main protectors of the political elite and their corruption.The more the group’s legitimacy was eroded, the more brutal it became, domestically. It suppressed dissent, whether through assassinations or by crushing the public protests that erupted in 2019, demanding the dismantling of a corrupt political system.The group had morphed from a clean resistance organization comprising a tight-knit group of dedicated people to a more mafia-like structure. It became involved in drug production and trafficking along with the Assad family. It started to become a conglomerate inside Lebanon. It owned a bank and various businesses. Somehow it began to mimic the corrupt Lebanese political system, and became its main patron.As it expanded in the region, however, Hezbollah made too many enemies. While the group enjoyed some degree of Arab acquiescence while fighting Israel, it lost whatever legitimacy it had in the Arab world when it entered Syria and acted like a proxy of Iran as part of the latter’s quest for regional domination.The Israeli attack on Hezbollah last year using booby-trapped pagers and other communication devices, and the wider recent war on Lebanon, were a wake-up call for the group and its surviving leaders. They realized they had overstretched themselves by interfering in other countries in the region.The only way for Hezbollah to rebuild itself, then, is to return to its origins as an armed resistance to an Israeli occupation. The grievances in southern Lebanon are strong enough to fuel this project.Wafiq Safa was not entirely wrong, therefore, when he predicted that Hezbollah would eventually emerge stronger than it was before. However, this would be a very dangerous development as it would lead to another war. The authorities in Israel at present are unhinged, buttressed by a permissive administration in the US. This means that if any resistance does arise, the response from the Israelis will be extremely destructive to Lebanon.The US should be wise enough to realize that the continuing presence of Israeli forces in Lebanon, and their operations there with the aim of killing every member of Hezbollah, will only strengthen the group in the long run.For the sake of stability, Israel must withdraw and the Lebanese state must be strengthened. If this is done, Hezbollah will eventually be decommissioned as an armed movement. • Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib is a specialist in US-Arab relations with a focus on lobbying.

Washington, Kyiv Headed Toward Deal For Ukrainian ‘Critical Miner...	The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are 'making progress' in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed. Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal and said he wants better financial terms. 'I don’t want something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,' he said. The war hits the three-year mark on Monday. The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week. Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement. Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding. Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made 'no sense' to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015. Zelenskyy said, 'I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan.' Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to 'understand' his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion. 'I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,' Zelenskyy said at his news conference, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to. 'If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,' Zelenskyy said. 'I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately.' The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading. 'I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,' Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House. 'They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,' Trump said of Ukraine. Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'in total alignment with the way we see things.' Witkoff said the war 'wouldn’t have had to happen' if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war. Witkoff said that eventually 'you’ll see concessions signed by both sides' in a peace deal. Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories,' Peskov said. 'That's the most important thing.' A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Peskov told state TV. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as 'aerial terror.' Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country. Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7kx3cU0zDwjT	2025-02-23T16:29:43-08:00	
Freedom For Secular Thought Still Eludes Bangladesh, A Decade Aft...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury The climate for freedom of secular thought in Bangladesh remains bleak a decade after religious zealots murdered blogger Avijit Roy as he left a literary festival in Dhaka, family members, researchers and human rights advocates said. The killing of the Bangladeshi-born American citizen in February 2015 was the first in a spate of murders of secular writers and intellectuals at the hands of Muslim extremists that year and in 2016. 'The current atmosphere for secular thought in Bangladesh is absent. Ten years ago, the condition for secular thoughts was very bad,' Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq, a retired professor at Dhaka University, told BenarNews. 'Blogger Avijit Roy was killed for promoting secular thoughts, my son Dipan was killed for publishing his book. What fault did they have,' Kashem said, referring to his son, Faisal Arefin Dipan, who was fatally attacked in October 2015. Ten years on, the South Asian country is still unsafe for the secular community because the threat from violent extremism remains alive despite last year’s fall of the authoritarian government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, according to observers. It had cracked down hard on Islamic militants by launching a deadly counter-terrorism campaign in July 2016, in the wake of an overnight siege of the Holey Artisan café in Dhaka, where 24 people, many of them foreigners, were slaughtered by Muslim extremists. But the Hasina government executed a 'wrong' policy of countering militancy and terrorism that did not root out the problem, according to one researcher. 'During Sheikh Hasina’s rule, the law enforcement agencies conducted operations to kill militants and extremists to get applause, cash incentives and awards from the government,' Abul Kalam Azad told BenarNews. Since Bangladesh’s independence in the early 1970s, some leftist politicians and controversial intellectuals had attacked faith-based parties through anti-religion books and comments while propagating secularism, making the term 'secular' controversial, according to Kashem, Dipan’s father. 'Their anti-religion postures put the faith-based parties in existential threat. As a means of survival, those parties propagated secularism as anti-religion,' Kashem said. He noted that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father who was Bangladesh’s founding leader and had led the independence movement to break away from Pakistan, defined secularism as a system where the state would not be a party to any religion. 'But the idea was not popularized,' Kashem said. 'Now, pro-Islamic parties dominate the political landscape,' he said. ‘Situation has deteriorated further’ On the night of Feb. 26, 2015, extremists who were later sentenced to death, fatally hacked with machetes Roy as he was exiting the Ekushey Book Fair in Dhaka. Roy had written books about freedom of secular thoughts and freedom of expression. His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, was seriously injured in the attack. On Oct. 31, 2015, extremists killed Dipan, owner of the publishing house Jagriti where Roy’s books were printed. 'Definitely, the previous atmosphere was not conducive to freedom of secular thought and freedom of expression. But the situation has deteriorated further and now it has reached a dangerous level,' Anujit Roy, Avijit’s brother, told BenarNews. Anujit Roy said he did not know if any organization would mark the 10th anniversary because of security concerns. 'If not, then we the family members will observe his death anniversary at our house,' he said, noting that fears of violence had intensified since Hasina lost power. No support for secularism Maulana Mohiuddin Rabbani, a vice president of Hefazat-e-Islam, a conservative Islamic group, told BenarNews that religion was needed in Bangladesh. 'Secularism was imported to Bangladesh from India. But we don’t support or promote secularism. We believe that as the majority of Bangladesh are Muslims, the state religion must be Islam,' he said. 'But people from all religions can practice their respective religions as guaranteed by Islam,' Rabbani said. In recent months since an interim government took office in Bangladesh, religious zealots have obstructed several traditional cultural activities across the country. In late January, Islamists vandalized the venue hosting a female football match in Tilakpur, a sub-district in northern Joypurhat. Islamists were blamed for vandalizing a book stall on Feb. 10, during the month-long Ekushey Book Fair, for displaying a book of exiled Bangladeshi secular writer Taslima Nasrin. The Islamists alleged the book promoted atheism. Three days later, Sohel Hasan Galib was arrested and sent to jail for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through his poetry. On Feb. 12, zealots forced organizers to postpone the death anniversary of mystic poet Lalon in Modhupur, in Tangail district. A group in Bhuapur, in the same district, vandalized shops selling flowers for a spring festival on Feb. 15, leading organizers to scrap a scheduled kite festival in adjacent Gopalpur subdistrict. How Hasina handled militants Kalam Azad, the researcher and co-author of the first book on female militants in Bangladesh, said that the government under Hasina had wrongly accused many people of militancy. 'In my research, I found at least 50% of the alleged male and one-third of female militants were innocent victims. They were falsely implicated in terrorism charges with ill motives,' he told BenarNews. 'After Hasina’s fall, some groups have been trying to propagate that all alleged militants and extremists were innocent. But this is also not true,' Azad said. The researcher noted that people were panicking. 'I think the atmosphere for freedom of expression, freedom of thought and secular thought is not conducive right now due to existing bad political conditions,' he said. A former police inspector-general noted that the strategy for countering terrorism and violent extremism was flawed during Hasina’s tenure. 'The alleged militants were killed or arrested and imprisoned indefinitely without following proper judicial procedure,' Nur Mohammad told BenarNews. 'After the fall of her government, alleged militants or extremists were released,' he said. 'Now the question is whether we are free from the threat of violent extremism. The answer is, if there is no patronization, the idea will meet a natural death.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said there was no room for violent extremism, adding that the government had anti-terrorism, counter terrorism, transnational crime units and other agencies working to counter violent extremism. 'We believe Bangladesh must have an atmosphere where both secular or non-secular people can express their opinion without any fear or persecution. At present, people can express their views without any fear. We want to establish a truly inclusive society free from fear and prejudice,' Shafiqul Alam told BenarNews.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7k3v2dZmQm4T	2025-02-23T16:26:19-08:00	
Pentagon Tells Gold Star Families: We’ll Find Loved Ones, Bring T...	By C. Todd Lopez In Sacramento, California, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency on Saturday held the largest-ever family member update in its history. More than 500 Gold Star families attended to learn how the agency is proceeding in efforts to repatriate the remains of service members who never returned home from the Vietnam War, the Korean War or World War II. Around the nation, the DPAA holds several family updates each year so the families of service members who went missing in action can meet with officials one-on-one to discuss the details of their cases. Since 1995, DPAA has conducted these family updates, reaching more than 31,000 family members through face-to-face meetings. Nearly 82,000 service members still remain unaccounted for from conflicts dating back to World War II. According to DPAA, 71,981 service members are missing from World War II, 7,444 are missing from the Korean War, 1,573 are missing from the Vietnam War, and 126 are missing from the Cold War. Finding those service members and bringing them home is the sacred duty of the DPAA, said Fern Sumpter Winbush, the principal deputy director of DPAA. 'Not only is this mission a sacred obligation, but it's a moral imperative,' she told families. 'The agency exists because there are unaccounted for ... there are men and women who gave their ultimate all. We serve the families because you are the ones that are still here. You are relying on us because we're the only ones that are doing this mission. We'll continue to put [the] mission first. We're not going to accept defeat. We'll never quit, and we're never going to leave a comrade behind.' Winbush told family members that the DPAA mission would take recovery operations to 33 territories and countries this year. The ability to do that requires building relationships with nations around the world to earn the trust needed to gain access. It's something she said the agency will continue to work on. Right now, she said, there are 10 ongoing missions in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. Winbush also stressed to families in attendance the importance of getting family member DNA on file. 'We can't make an identification unless we have something to compare it to,' she said. 'For many of the unaccounted-for, we don't have the proper family reference samples on file. This is one way we work to collect them.' Also, she noted the number of young people attending the family member update and stressed how important it is that families keep other family members aware that a family member who served overseas never returned home and that the DPAA is still looking for them. 'We need third, fourth, and even fifth-generation families to stay on top of their loved one's loss,' Winbush said. 'We don't forget ... we have all of the records. But it's critically important that you stay on top of it so that the story can continue to be told.' She said it's common for DPAA to call families with a notification that a loved one has been found, only to find that some families were unaware or don't believe what they are being told. 'They don't know this mission exists,' she said. 'They don't believe that we're still searching for their great, great uncle [or] father ... from World War II,' she said. 'We've got to keep all of the families involved.' As part of the family member update, the DPAA also unveiled its annual poster, which will be used later this year to commemorate National POW/MIA Recognition Day, Sept. 19, 2025. This year's poster was created by artist Jeannie Huffman, the daughter of Navy Cmdr. Edward James Jacobs Jr., a Vietnam War pilot who never came home. He went missing Aug. 25, 1967, while piloting an RA-3B Skywarrior aircraft over the Gulf of Tonkin in North Vietnam. When her father left for Vietnam, Huffman was only two weeks old. She was just five months old when her mother learned her father went missing. She said her father had been able to hold her as an infant before he deployed for the war, but there's no record of that for her to look at today. 'One thing that kind of bothers me ... I have no photos of that,' she said. 'I wish I had a picture of him and me, and I don't.' Back in 2018, Huffman attended her first DPAA family member update in Greensboro, North Carolina. There was not a lot of information then about recovery efforts for her father, and this was because her father had been put into a non-recoverable status. Huffman's husband, Dave, explained what had happened. 'In 1993, when previous iterations of what's now the DPAA [were] charged with the mission, there was an order that came out to try to touch as many sites as possible,' he said. 'They got in a boat and went out to the grid coordinates of the last known location of the airplane and said there's no visible wreckage.' That finding resulted in Jacobs and the crewmen he was with being deemed unrecoverable — which stood until January 2024. However, the two did their own research and were later able to convince DPAA to begin anew in an effort to find Jeannie Huffman's father. 'We had a meeting with the DPAA in Washington, D.C., and we presented our research and investigation to them in November of 2023, and they revisited his case, and now his case and the two crewmen that were with him have all been changed from non-recoverable to active pursuit,' Dave Huffman said. This year's DPAA annual poster is not Jeannie Huffman's first for the agency. However, it is the first time one of her works will be used as part of the agency's official National POW/MIA Recognition Day commemoration. On the poster are five service members — four men and one woman — representing each service and the conflicts from which there remain service members who have not come home. 'It was important to capture all the conflicts of the POW/MIAs,' she said. Another aspect of the poster is that each individual photographed, representing each service and each conflict, is wearing period uniforms and gear. 'I believe that each of our missing is still seeking their way home, and they expect that our nation's promise will be kept, which is to bring them home,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7oN6RhcI9w8F	2025-02-23T16:23:12-08:00	
Iranian Officials Meet Lebanon’s President In Beirut	The parliament speaker and the foreign minister of Iran had a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun in Beirut on Sunday. Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi have traveled to Beirut to take part in the funeral of the late leaders of Hezbollah, Seyed Hassan Nasrallah and Seyed Hashem Safieddine. The two Iranian officials held a meeting with Lebanese President Aoun and Foreign Minister Youssef Rajji at Baabda Palace, the official residence of the president of Lebanon, on Sunday morning. Lebanon is holding the funeral of former Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli air strike. The event is held at the Camille Chamoun sports stadium on the outskirts of Beirut. He will then be buried at a dedicated site nearby. Nasrallah was killed on September 27 in an Israeli air strike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The funeral also honors Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah for one week after Nasrallah’s death before he was also killed in an Israeli attack. He will be buried separately in the south on Monday	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7v3axTY5jW56	2025-02-23T16:18:07-08:00	
Indonesia’s Secret Weapon For Korean Peace: Lessons From Cambodia...	Indonesia has long been recognized for its diplomatic finesse and commitment to non-alignment principles that have shaped its foreign policy since independence. With a 'Free Active' approach Indonesia has consistently advocated for peaceful conflict and resolution earning neutrality credibility on the international stage. The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most geopolitical persistent conflicts in modern history marked by divisions ideological military tensions and nuclear proliferation concerns. Although Indonesia is not primarily a mediator, its balanced diplomatic engagement in multilateral forums and its historical experience in peace facilitation position it as a promising facilitator of peace. This essay argues that Indonesia’s diplomatic engagement has informed Cambodians about a model of dialogue, which includes the China-South China Sea approach to building confidence measures. This model offers a viable path for fostering reconciliation and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Indonesia has maintained diplomatic relations with North Korea since 1964 and with South Korea since 1973. This dual engagement allows Indonesia to facilitate open channels of communication between both nations. Unlike major global powers that often take a more partisan stance, Indonesia's neutrality allows it to be perceived as an honest broker. This balanced approach aligns with the Cambodian conflict model of resolution where reconciliation was achieved through inclusive dialogue involving multiple factions. The Cambodian model emphasizes the integration of adversarial actors into a structured peace process that Indonesia could advocate for Koreans in negotiations. Indonesia has played an active role in multilateral diplomacy, particularly within ASEAN. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) serves as a platform for regional dialogue, with North Korea participating in its discussions. The 2023 ASEAN Summit highlighted security concerns, indirectly addressing the stability of the Korean Peninsula. ASEAN’s approach to dispute resolution, especially in the South China Sea, offers a useful model for Indonesia's role regarding Korea. The Sea China model is a confidence measures reduction risk and strategies engagement that could be applied to the Korean peninsula. The development of a security multilateral mechanism similar to ASEAN initiatives in the China-South Sea facilitates sustained engagement between North and South Korea. Indonesia also supports the United Nations resolutions for denuclearization, promoting peace, and encouraging solutions. Although Indonesia has not directly been involved in peacekeeping efforts on the Korean Peninsula its broader commitment to international security aligns with UN objectives leveraging these multilateral platforms Indonesia can promote dialogue and de-escalation efforts. Economic and cultural diplomacy are also critical components of Indonesia's approach. While Indonesia is a major economic partner of South Korea, its minimal trade with North Korea enables it to maintain a neutral stance. Rather than exerting economic pressure, Indonesia focuses on engagement policies. Track II diplomacy, including academic collaborations and cultural exchanges, fosters informal connections that contribute to long-term trust-building. Scholarships for North Korean students and academic exchanges foster connections among individuals, similar to the grassroots reconciliation efforts observed in the Cambodian model. Historically Indonesia has demonstrated its ability to host international dialogues such as the 1955 Conference Bandung and Jakarta Informal Meetings. These suggest precedents in Indonesia that served as neutral venues for Korean peace talks. In Cambodia, neutral venues played a significant role in ensuring inclusive participation among conflicting parties. Applying this strategy to Korea and Indonesia could create an environment in the North where South Korea can engage in direct discussions and influence the majority of global powers. Despite potential Indonesia significantly faces challenges facilitating peace on the Korean Peninsula as follows: 1. Geopolitical Complexities: The Korean Peninsula is heavily influenced by global superpowers particularly the United States and China. Both nations have strategic interests in the region and their involvement complicates independence diplomatic efforts. Indonesia must navigate geopolitical intricacies carefully to maintain neutrality encouraging constructive dialogue. 2 . North Korea’s Isolation: North Korea remains highly isolated economically and sanctions self-reliance. While Indonesia maintains diplomatic ties with Pyongyang the Korean North leadership's reluctance to engage externally in dialogue poses significant barriers. 3. Lack of Leverage: China, unlike the U.S., lacks direct economic or military leverage over the two Koreas. Its influence is primarily diplomatic, which may limit its ability to advocate for substantial policy changes. 4. Concerns about Security Trust and Deficit: Both Koreas have deep distrust rooted toward external mediators. While Indonesia's neutrality is an asset, engaging North and South Korea in Indonesia-led initiatives remains challenging. Additionally, regional security concerns, such as North Korea's nuclear program, complicate the situation further. To address these challenges, Indonesia must integrate strategies modeled after those of Cambodia and the South China Sea : 1. Establishing a Neutral Dialogue Platform: Drawing from the Cambodian model, Indonesia could advocate for an inclusive dialogue mechanism in which regional stakeholders and international players participate in structured negotiations. 2. Confidence Expanding-Building Measures: Inspired by the South Sea China model Indonesia could push for ASEAN-led initiatives such as joint crisis communication hotlines security systems and risk reduction exercises between North and South Korea. 3. Track Strengthening II Diplomacy: Expanding cultural exchanges, joint economic initiatives and educational programs gradually lay the groundwork for reconciliation. Trust Building through societal engagement will formally complement efforts diplomatic. 4. Utilizing Multilateral Leverage: Indonesia should continue leveraging the role of ASEAN and the UN to encourage sustained diplomatic efforts on the Korean Peninsula. Supporting regional security frameworks advocating peace for talks in international forums will enhance Indonesia's credibility. Indonesia’s nuanced approach to diplomacy is rooted in its'Free and Active' policies, which establish it as a credible facilitator for peace on the Korean Peninsula. By drawing on the lessons of the Cambodian model—which emphasizes dialogue inclusive—and the China South Sea model—which focuses on confidence building—Indonesia can contribute to conflict resolution efforts. While geopolitical challenges and North Korea's isolation pose security concerns and obstacles to Indonesia's diplomatic engagement and multilateral influence, Indonesia's historical role as a neutral mediator provides a solid foundation for peace efforts. Though Indonesia is not a primary mediator, its strategic engagement with ASEAN and experience in dialogue facilitation with the UN make it a key player in promoting stability and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. By integrating proven diplomatic frameworks, Indonesia can help bridge trust, foster collaboration, and contribute to a long-term resolution of one of the world's enduring conflicts.

Friendship Or Foreign Meddling? Trump’s $21 Million Bombshell Exp...	It began as vintage Trump: red-meat rhetoric, swaggering boasts, the electric thrum of a comeback tour. But in a single incendiary swipe, the former president detonated a geopolitical grenade. Speaking at a rally last week, Trump alleged that USAID—the U.S. government’s global aid arm—had quietly funnelled $21 million to India’s election machinery under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his self-proclaimed 'friend.' The claim, precise and pointed, ripped the lid off a Pandora’s box long sealed by diplomatic decorum. For the first time, Trump tethered Modi’s name to America’s shadowy election-finance labyrinth, casting Washington not as a watchdog of democracy but as an alleged architect of its manipulation. As outrage erupted across continents, the revelation laid bare a chilling paradox: in an age where foreign interference is a political death sentence, the U.S. now stands accused of pulling the strings—and Trump, the disruptor-in-chief, is holding the knife that slit the secrets open. The Forensic Breakdown: Trump’s Words, Modi’s Silence Trump’s statement, delivered at the Governor’s Working Association meeting, was not a mere off-the-cuff remark. It was a calculated disclosure, one that thrust Modi’s government into an unwelcome spotlight. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) called the claims 'deeply troubling.' The opposition Congress Party demanded a white paper detailing all USAID funds received under Modi’s tenure. Yet, Modi himself—India’s master orator, a leader who thrives on control over his image—has chosen to remain silent. Instead, the BJP and its media ecosystem scrambled to spin the narrative. First, they claimed vindication—that Trump’s comments proved foreign powers had conspired to meddle in India’s 2024 general election, a frequent BJP talking point. But Trump’s follow-up remarks shredded that defense. The money, he clarified, went to Modi. That revelation turned the tables, forcing Modi’s government into damage-control mode. A Pattern of Political Convenience This moment is not happening in isolation. The Modi government has repeatedly painted itself as a bulwark against Western influence, framing any external criticism as a neo-colonial attack on India’s sovereignty. Yet, it has gladly courted U.S. and European support when it suits its agenda—whether in trade, defense, or, as Trump’s comments suggest, electoral strategy. The USAID funding, as per Trump’s disclosure, was part of a broader $486 million package meant for 'election strengthening' worldwide. India’s $21 million slice was ostensibly aimed at increasing voter turnout—an anodyne phrase that now demands forensic scrutiny. Which voters? In which regions? And crucially, under whose directives? The Opposition Strikes Back The Congress Party, long accused by the BJP of appeasing the West, has seized on this scandal as proof of the Modi government’s double standards. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera framed it with brutal clarity: 'This is a matter between two ‘friends.’ But one ‘friend’ has betrayed another. Modiji, you owe a response to the country. Did you or did you not take $21 million from the U.S. to influence the elections in India?' This is not just rhetorical posturing. The implications are seismic. If U.S. funding was leveraged to influence voter behavior in India, it raises ethical and legal questions of staggering proportions. It also punctures the BJP’s long-standing claim of being the sole custodian of India’s nationalistic pride. USAID: A Benevolent Front or a Political Tool? For decades, USAID has positioned itself as an instrument of democracy-building. But the realpolitik of foreign aid is rarely that simple. Governments receiving aid often direct those funds toward programs that solidify their own political standing. And donor governments—especially the United States—have long wielded aid as a tool of influence, ensuring that recipient regimes remain aligned with their strategic interests. In this case, the 'voter turnout' initiative may well have been crafted with the noblest democratic intentions. But democracy promotion becomes suspect when it is selectively beneficial to one ruling party over another. This is precisely the charge now haunting Modi’s government. The Deafening Silence in Washington and Delhi Trump’s comments have forced both governments into an uneasy quiet. The Trump administration has refrained from commenting, wary of stepping into a controversy that could affect U.S.-India relations. In India, the silence from the ruling party is even more telling. For a leader who rarely misses an opportunity to shape the public discourse, Modi’s refusal to address the allegations suggests a crisis his government is still struggling to contain. Meanwhile, investigative reports have begun surfacing, suggesting that the $21 million in question may have actually been allocated for election-related programs in Bangladesh, not India. This raises a separate, but equally troubling, question: Was Trump misinformed, or was he deliberately misleading his audience? If the latter, what was his motive? Was this an attempt to entangle Modi in controversy as an implicit bargaining chip for future negotiations? The Real Stakes: India’s Democratic Integrity At its core, this controversy is about far more than just one funding allocation. It’s about the integrity of India’s democracy. If the Modi government knowingly accepted external funds for election-related activities, it shatters the myth that India’s electoral process is invulnerable to foreign influence. If the funds were used to engineer favorable voter turnout, it amounts to nothing less than a manipulation of democratic will. The opposition’s demand for a white paper is not just political theatre—it’s a necessary step toward transparency. India’s voters deserve to know whether their democracy was subtly, insidiously, influenced by external forces. They also deserve to know why their prime minister has refused to confront this issue head-on. The Final Reckoning Trump’s remarks have ignited a fire that neither Washington nor New Delhi can easily extinguish. The Modi government, which has built its brand on self-reliance and nationalist pride, now faces a credibility crisis of its own making. The BJP’s silence will not hold forever. Sooner or later, Modi will have to answer: Did he or did he not benefit from $21 million in U.S. funding for voter turnout? For now, the silence is deafening. But in politics, silence is rarely a sign of strength. More often, it is the prelude to a reckoning.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7iiSojihFiHN	2025-02-23T16:02:39-08:00	
Before The Storm: How Microgrids Can Future-Proof Our Power Suppl...	When you want to buy an apartment, you are very concerned about the quality of tiles on the floor, the quality of plumbing, the quality of fixtures in the bathrooms, the quality of the appliances in the kitchen. But how many people ask whether this building adheres to the latest seismic safety codes?,' notes Kamal Kishore, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General (SRSG) for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). His point is clear: we often overlook critical resilience factors in infrastructure planning, yet as climate change drives more frequent and severe disasters, the consequences of such oversight are becoming increasingly dire. Recent findings from the UNDRR's Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction indicate a dramatic surge in the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters over the past two decades. Between 2000 and 2021, 83% of major power outages in the U.S. were due to extreme weather events, while globally, economic losses from disasters reached $2.97 trillion between 2010 and 2019. Moreover, extreme weather-related power disruptions increased by 78% between 2011 and 2021, underscoring the urgent need for resilient infrastructure. 'Extreme weather events that used to occur once in a century now happen every 20 years, and in a number of major disasters such as cyclones and earthquakes, we have seen that 40% of infrastructure damage is in the power sector, in the energy systems,' Kishore highlights. As the current power grid is not designed to withstand the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather 'we have to come up with plausible worst-case scenarios and develop preparedness planning according to those scenarios. This means that if you invest in infrastructure, you must also put aside money for its maintenance. If you don't do so, it comes back to haunt you'. In the event of extreme events such as cyclones or earthquakes, maintaining power supply is critical for emergency response and recovery efforts. According to Saeed Manshadi, Associate Professor at the College of Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the San Diego State University, renewable energy sources and microgrids are already playing a crucial role in ensuring energy supply during natural disasters. 'Given that renewable energy sources are locally available, we can install local battery and solar as distributed energy resources to energize microgrids as building blocks for the future smart grid. Under national disaster scenarios, while most of the time distribution and transmission lines are down, microgrids enable self-sufficient and self-healing capabilities for the local grid.' Compared to traditional centralised grids, new generation microgrids are particularly effective in disaster-prone regions. 'Microgrids enable grids to locally supply mission-critical facilities under blackout conditions. If they are self-sustainable, meaning they have enough battery storage and renewable energy resources available, they can maintain essential services,' explains Manshadi. In areas vulnerable to hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, microgrids can prevent catastrophic power outages and allow communities to function autonomously until the main grid is restored. 'Think of a situation where you’re in a very hot zone, flooded with Wi-Fi disruptions, or hit by a hurricane, and the main grid fails. Microgrids provide localised control, allowing essential infrastructure — like hospitals and emergency shelters — to continue operating'. However, in order to fully exploit the potential of green microgrids as useful tools in disaster resilience, a number of technical obstacles must be overcome. The major is to deal with a century-old energy delivery system, based on AC (alternative current), while in order to maximise yield and not waste energy and money, renewable energy based microgrids must operate through DC (direct current). One of the most promising advances in resilient energy solutions is the development of hybrid microgrids, which integrate renewable energy sources with advanced power management technologies. Eduardo Garcia-Martinez, Technical Director of Tigon, a European project aimed at enhancing the reliability and resilience of decentralised renewables-based power systems, explains: 'If there is an issue with the external AC grid, our microgrid can operate autonomously by shutting down the AC connection. With integrated battery storage and renewable energy generation, it ensures continuity of supply even in case of a blackout'. A key breakthrough of this project is the implementation of a 3,000-volt DC voltage level. 'Most DC microgrids today operate from 700V to 1,500V. We are pushing the limits with 3,000V, which allows us to transfer more power with lower current, increasing efficiency while reducing material costs and the need for extensive copper wiring,' he highlights. Another solution developed within this EU-funded project is the integration of solid-state transformers (SST), which facilitate seamless energy conversion. 'The SSTs enable DC generation and DC loads to be integrated more efficiently, avoiding unnecessary AC-DC-AC conversions that waste energy,' García explains. This approach enhances grid efficiency and resilience by minimising energy loss and stabilizing decentralised networks— an essential step in mitigating disaster-induced power failures. 'We’ve already achieved the main milestone of generating 3,000V. Now we need to integrate photovoltaic generation, batteries, and interconnections with other DC microgrids to prove feasibility,' García notes. If successful, this could pave the way for widespread adoption of hybrid microgrids useful in climate disaster prevention. Kamal Kishore, who has been observing and addressing issues related with catastrophic events around the world for 30 years, adds: 'A microgrid is great in terms of its modularity, and hence, less interconnection. This modularity is a source of resilience, so investing in microgrids is essentially investing in local resilience'. Manshadi agrees: 'Microgrids can supply their own community within the boundaries and supply mission critical facilities under the blackout. Especially if they are self-sustainable'. But the benefits of microgrids extend beyond resilience. As Kishore points out, they also contribute to energy affordability: 'Green power generated by microgrids brings costs down. While technical challenges remain — such as storage capacity — over the lifecycle of energy infrastructure, the investment in renewables and decentralized grids makes eminent sense. A very attractive proposition, particularly in the context of renewables, where you produce energy locally, and you consume it locally'. Despite the promise of microgrids, major policy and financial hurdles remain. 'We need more policies supporting distributed energy resources,' Manshadi stresses. 'Utilities are already overwhelmed with disaster risk and decarbonisation mandates. Policymakers need to enable third-party entities to take part in the expansion of distributed energy solutions'. Kamal Kishore echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the need for long-term investment in resilience: 'We need greater public awareness, not just for efficient post-disaster responses, but to prevent risks from emerging in the first place'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7lHkdhQaoqJq	2025-02-23T15:59:53-08:00	
Democratic Republic Of Congo: Locals Call For Prayer As 70 Bodies...	By Sabrine Amboka Locals at a village in the embattled North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are appealing for prayers after approximately 70 bodies were found inside a church building in the village. Local sources contacted by Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) International said the killings took place between Feb. 12 and Feb. 15 in Maiba, a village in the eastern region of the DRC. In a report that ACN published on Feb. 21, the sources said that on Feb. 12, rebels from an Islamist terrorist group, originally from Uganda, entered the village and took approximately 100 people hostage. The sources recounted that on Feb. 15, about 70 bodies were discovered inside a Protestant church. 'Many of them had been bound and some beheaded. Among the victims were women, children, and the elderly,' said the source, which ACN did not identify for fear of reprisals from the many armed groups that operate in the region. 'It is likely that these victims were unable to resist or endure the forced march, because when the rebels take hostages, they make them travel with them, either as reinforcements for their group or as forced labor for the war effort,' the source is quoted as telling ACN. According to the source, abductors force people to carry the loot after raiding villages. 'If you get tired on the way, you’re done,' the source told ACN. 'I believe that is what happened to these 70 people.' According to the same sources, the Maiba massacre was carried out by the armed Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which operates in Uganda and the DRC and has terrorized the local population for over a decade. 'The Islamic groups have stepped up their attacks and raids in remote villages, killing thousands of Congolese civilians. Before they used to be in other areas, but now it is Lubero which is being attacked,' the local source told ACN. The source shared that fear has gripped the village because the residents believe that the terrorists have local collaborators who facilitate their operations. This Maiba massacre comes at a very delicate time for the region, given the worsening of the humanitarian situation in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, which have seen heavy terrorization by another armed group, the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels. Reportedly supported by neighboring Rwanda and the Congolese armed forces, the M23 has taken important cities and outposts in the region, including Goma and Bukavu, amid heavy fighting. ACN’s local sources have expressed fear that over the next few days, M23 will take Butembo, North Kivu’s second-largest city, as it did Goma and Bukavu. 'We are living through very, very difficult times. We are expecting the rebels to enter the city any moment now, as they are only 70 kilometers [about 44 miles] away from here. There is a lot of psychological suffering in Butembo, because the war is literally at our door. We have seen how other regions were overrun by chaos, and now it seems it is our turn,' the source is quoted as saying. The source concluded with a call for prayers, imploring: 'Let us pray. Prayer is what keeps our hope alive amidst this situation we are living through.' This story was first published by ACI Africa, CNA's news partner in Africa, and has been adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7qvOC380oLRX	2025-02-23T15:56:15-08:00	
Why GPT Can’t Think Like Us	Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models like GPT-4, has shown impressive performance on reasoning tasks. But does AI truly understand abstract concepts, or is it just mimicking patterns? A new study from the University of Amsterdam and the Santa Fe Institute reveals that while GPT models perform well on some analogy tasks, they fall short when the problems are altered, highlighting key weaknesses in AI’s reasoning capabilities. Analogical reasoning is the ability to draw a comparison between two different things based on their similarities in certain aspects. It is one of the most common methods by which human beings try to understand the world and make decisions. An example of analogical reasoning: cup is to coffee as soup is to ??? (the answer being: bowl) Large language models like GPT-4 perform well on various tests, including those requiring analogical reasoning. But can AI models truly engage in general, robust reasoning or do they over-rely on patterns from their training data? This study by language and AI experts Martha Lewis (Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam) and Melanie Mitchell (Santa Fe Institute) examined whether GPT models are as flexible and robust as humans in making analogies. ‘This is crucial, as AI is increasingly used for decision-making and problem-solving in the real world’, explains Lewis. Comparing AI models to human performance Lewis and Mitchell compared the performance of humans and GPT models on three different types of analogy problems: Letter sequences – Identifying patterns in letter sequences and completing them correctly. Digit matrices – Analyzing number patterns and determining the missing numbers. Story analogies – Understanding which of two stories best corresponds to a given example story. A system that truly understands analogies should maintain high performance even on variations In addition to testing whether GPT models could solve the original problems, the study examined how well they performed when the problems were subtly modified. ‘A system that truly understands analogies should maintain high performance even on these variations’, state the authors in their article. GPT models struggle with robustness Humans maintained high performance on most modified versions of the problems, but GPT models, while performing well on standard analogy problems, struggled with variations. ‘This suggests that AI models often reason less flexibly than humans and their reasoning is less about true abstract understanding and more about pattern matching’, explains Lewis. In digit matrices, GPT models showed a significant drop in performance when the position of the missing number changed. Humans had no difficulty with this. In story analogies, GPT-4 tended to select the first given answer as correct more often, whereas humans were not influenced by answer order. Additionally, GPT-4 struggled more than humans when key elements of a story were reworded, suggesting a reliance on surface-level similarities rather than deeper causal reasoning. On simpler analogy tasks, GPT models showed a decline in performance decline when tested on modified versions, while humans remained consistent. However, for more complex analogical reasoning tasks, both humans and AI struggled. Weaker than human cognition This research challenges the widespread assumption that AI models like GPT-4 can reason in the same way humans do. ‘While AI models demonstrate impressive capabilities, this does not mean they truly understand what they are doing’, conclude Lewis and Mitchell. ‘Their ability to generalize across variations is still significantly weaker than human cognition. GPT models often rely on superficial patterns rather than deep comprehension.’ This is a critical warning for the use of AI in important decision-making areas such as education, law, and healthcare. AI can be a powerful tool, but it is not yet a replacement for human thinking and reasoning.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7nLDoD_XO2aE	2025-02-23T15:52:43-08:00	
The Transformation Of Ukraine’s Arms Industry Amid War With Russi...	By Kateryna Kuzmuk and Lorenzo Scarazzato Three years on from Russia’s escalation of its war on Ukraine with the full-scale invasion, Ukraine faces mounting military challenges. At the same time, there is growing uncertainty about future military assistance from the United States under the Trump administration. This makes the question of Ukraine’s ability to supply its own military needs and its reliance on aid all the more pertinent. Since February 2022, Ukraine has relied heavily on foreign military aid for its defence against Russia. Its domestic arms industry has also been able to increase production and develop its capabilities significantly. In 2023 Ukraine’s largest arms producer, Joint-Stock Company Ukrainian Defense Industry (formerly UkrOboronProm), achieved a 69 per cent year-on-year increase in arms revenues to $2.2 billion—the fastest increase and highest revenues the company has ever recorded. As Ukraine seeks to rapidly strengthen and modernize its military capabilities amid the conflict, numerous smaller producers have appeared, along with emerging joint ventures with foreign companies, creating a more vibrant, diverse and innovative sector. This topical backgrounder examines how Ukraine’s arms industry has transformed during the Russia-Ukraine war. From the Soviet legacy to specialization Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited around 30 per cent of the Soviet arms industry, including both production capacity and research and development facilities. This legacy comprised around 700 enterprises with over 1 million employees, making it the most capable part of the newly independent Ukraine’s manufacturing sector. Ukraine’s inherited production base was particularly strong in manufacturing missiles, transport aircraft, tanks, surface ships, and both marine and aero engines. It also included facilities for the production of munitions, explosives, radar systems, communications equipment and military optical devices. Notable examples of arms producers included Pivdenmash, the producer of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles, and Antonov, the company behind the An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya, formerly the largest transport aircraft in the world. Despite this, Ukraine did not have anything approaching self-sufficiency in arms production. Before 1991, Ukraine’s arms industries had been integrated into a network spanning all Soviet republics, with the overwhelming majority of final arms production concentrated in Russia. Developing the missing capabilities within Ukraine would have required costly restructuring and investment, which the country, caught in a severe economic crisis, could not afford. At the same time, the shifting military-political environment made arms production less of a priority. Following the end of the cold war, many countries reduced their military expenditure and started converting parts of their military industrial capacity to civilian production, and Ukraine followed suit. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear missile capabilities and significantly reduce its arsenal of conventional weapons. Most of its military budget went to the basic upkeep of the armed forces, with only a small portion allocated to the maintenance and development of the arms industry. As a result, the number of arms-producing enterprises in Ukraine had already fallen by nearly two thirds to reach 267 by mid 1993, and continued to decline in the following years. With limited domestic investment and procurement budgets, Ukrainian arms producers turned to the export of modernized Soviet-era equipment, technology transfers and joint ventures. This approach helped the industry to maintain a degree of economic viability and to preserve some technological capabilities. Competitive pricing and the proven durability of its systems enabled Ukraine to secure new export markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. As a result, for nearly two decades after 1993, Ukraine nearly always ranked among the world’s top 15 arms exporters. The wake-up call of 2014 Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas region in 2014, there was an urgent need to strengthen Ukraine’s defensive capabilities. In response, the government began steadily increasing military spending. Where the military procurement budget in 2014 was $62 million, by 2021 it had increased 13 times over, reaching $836 million. While much of the procurement budget was spent on imports, a surge in domestic orders fueled an expansion of the Ukrainian arms industry. The industry was, however, still plagued by a culture of secrecy, clientelism and corruption—another legacy of Soviet times—which even after 2014 not only weakened Ukraine’s military capabilities and delayed the development of critical military systems but also deterred Western investors. These problems were especially prevalent within UkrOboronProm, the conglomerate that oversaw more than 100 state-owned companies and served as the primary supplier to Ukraine’s armed forces. It was not until 2020, under pressure from civil society and foreign governments and also driven by a growing willingness for political intervention, that Ukraine began reforming its arms industry to address widespread corruption and inefficiency. The reforms included the creation of a new Ministry of Strategic Industries, the introduction of more transparent arms procurement procedures, an overhaul of leadership in state institutions and state-owned arms companies, and the corporatization of enterpriseswithin UkrOboronProm. Despite some progress, particularly in leadership changes, many of the reforms stalled or remained unimplemented due to funding constraints and bureaucratic inertia. Problems in the state-owned industries also led to the rise of private arms companies, which often surpassed their state-owned competitors in production efficiency, innovation and adaptability to the military’s needs. In 2015, 25 per cent of state orders went to private companies. By 2020 this share had more than doubled to 54 per cent, whereas state enterprises received 36 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent were imports. The expansion of Ukraine’s arms industry after 2014, along with reform efforts and the rising role of the private sector, laid the groundwork for increased arms production and technological innovation in the years that followed. Adapting under fire Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 presented Ukraine’s evolving arms industry with a new set of challenges. Proximity to active combat zones and targeted attacks severely disrupted production at many factories. In the first two years of active hostilities, major arms producers suffered significant losses. According to a report by the Kyiv School of Economics assessing damage during the first two years of the war, engine manufacturer Motor Sich and aircraft producer Antonov alone reported damage amounting to a combined $601 million in industrial assets. As a result, companies were forced to adapt by relocating and restructuring production. Nevertheless, Ukraine’s arms industrial capacity recovered quickly as the country shifted to a wartime economy. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has allocated more than 50 per cent of government expenditures to the military, significantly increasing funding for its arms industry. By 2023, government spending on arms and dual-use goods surged to 20 times the 2021 level, reaching $30.8 billion. Although a substantial portion of the procurement budget went into purchasing weapons from abroad, Ukrainian arms companies were able to restore and even expand their production capabilities. By 2024, approximately 500 arms producers were reported to be operational in Ukraine, collectively employing nearly 300 000 people. In the past three years, Ukraine’s arms production capacity has grown not only in terms of volume but also of the range of military hardware that can be produced. This growth has been largely driven by the development of new technologies, as the scale and nature of the war have created a demand for military innovation. One of the most notable advancements has been in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), with Ukraine significantly increasing the number of domestically produced UAV models. Technological progress has been further accelerated by government initiatives, such as Brave1, a state-led platform that provides assistance to military technology developers and fosters collaboration between industry stakeholders. In just under two years since its launch, Brave1 has grown to support over 1500 military technology start-ups. Resilient but still reliant Thanks to coordinated efforts by Ukraine’s government, private sector and civil society, the Ukrainian arms industry has been able to rapidly modernize and grow in response to the war. Despite this, the industry is still hampered by outdated technology, financial constraints and inefficient spending. The Ukrainian war effort remains highly dependent on Western arms, whether provided as aid or imported on commercial terms. Since 2022 Ukraine has managed to start domestic production of certain types of weaponry that it has received hitherto from abroad, such as globally scarce artillery and tank ammunition. However, it is still a long way from being able to produce alternatives to all the imported systems it uses on the battlefield. A significant portion of procurement funds are thus spent on purchasing weapons from abroad, which does not facilitate the development of the domestic industry. To address this, Ukraine is striving to implement new production technologies through cooperation with partners. Arms producers from the United States and Europe have been increasing their presence in Ukraine, with companies such as Rheinmetall, KNDS and AeroVironment opening production facilities and forming joint ventures with Ukrainian producers. These collaborations not only help in the modernization of Ukraine’s arms industry but also accelerate the standardization of Ukrainian-made armaments to NATO requirements, advancing the country’s long-standing ambition of Euro-Atlantic integration. To further stimulate the development of its arms industry, Ukraine has managed to engage Western partners through special programmes aimed at financing its domestic arms production. While it is still short of its $10 billion objective, by 2024 Ukraine had raised over $1.5 billion for investment in its domestic arms industry from nine Western donor countries under a new programme called Zbroyari (armourers) Manufacturing Freedom. Partnerships with Western companies have also catalysed long-overdue reforms, with partners urging Ukraine to address corruption and inefficiency in its arms companies. A notable example is the ongoing corporatization of UkrOboronProm, including its transformation from a state conglomerate into a joint-stock company. The transformation includes a plan to introduce Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) corporate governance standards across the numerous state-run arms companies under its control, to enforce transparent management practices and make them increasingly attractive to foreign investments. The steps mentioned above are undoubtedly helping to develop and expand the Ukrainian arms industry, and thus to increase the country’s ability to supply its own military needs. However, at least in the short term, Ukraine will remain heavily reliant on military aid for its defence, making it vulnerable to the whims of its partners. In an unpredictable geopolitical landscape, Ukraine needs to reduce this reliance and build a resilient arms industry sector that can serve as much of the country’s military needs as possible. Recent developments seem to be heading in the right direction to achieve those ends: prioritizing innovation and technological advancement along with fostering a competitive, transparent market should help to create an environment that is more attractive to sustained foreign investment, ensuring that the industry is economically viable in the longer term.

How ASEAN Nations Shape South China Sea Policies Around China – A...	Tensions between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea have been making more headlines in 2025 after escalating alarmingly last year. Some other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), meanwhile, are trying to maintain good relations with their big neighbor to the north, whose economic and political influence is only growing in importance, while protecting their interests in the disputed waterway. Reporters from RFA and BenarNews look at how three countries in the South China Sea are approaching relations with China. INDONESIA: Growing openness toward China In November 2024, Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto stunned South China Sea watchers with a sentence in a joint statement issued in China on his first overseas trip since becoming president. The seemingly innocuous line explained that Jakarta and Beijing had reached an 'important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims' in the South China Sea. But analysts were quick to point out that by acknowledging overlapping maritime boundaries, Prabowo and his officials had effectively acknowledged the legitimacy of China’s claims, something Indonesia had never done before. Indonesia had always insisted that China’s so-called nine-dash line, which it uses on its maps to claim historic rights over most of the South China Sea, has no legal basis, as seen in a note verbale to the United Nations in May 2020. Indonesia realized the mistake and issued a correction two days later, saying mutual recognition of differences and disputes does not equal accepting the other side’s legitimacy and China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea still lacked legal basis. Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta said that nevertheless, there has been 'a shift toward a closer relationship that could reduce Jakarta’s assertiveness in the South China Sea under President Prabowo Subianto.' China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner and one of its biggest sources of foreign direct investment, and expanding economic ties have been a major factor in Jakarta’s decision-making. This year, Indonesia became the first Southeast Asia member of the BRICS bloc led by China. Raden Mokhamad Luthfi, a defense analyst at Al Azhar University Indonesia said that there was growing openness toward China, not just in trade and investment but also in security cooperation. Prabowo’s dominant role in foreign policy appears to have sidelined Indonesia’s ministry of foreign affairs, he said. 'I am concerned that under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesian diplomats may have less space to provide input and guidance on how the country’s foreign policy should be shaped,' Luthfi said. Waffaa noted a sense that 'Indonesia is increasingly practicing self-censorship when dealing with China.' 'One possible explanation is China’s proactive diplomatic approach, which includes strong responses, or even retaliatory measures, against criticism,' he said. 'This makes Indonesia more cautious, possibly fearing economic repercussions and as a result, it has become difficult to openly address concerns over sovereignty and international law.' Indonesia is one of the founding members of ASEAN and long served as its de facto leader, playing a crucial role in mediating regional crises. Analysts warned that its leadership in the group on the South China Sea issue would wane if it stopped championing international legal norms. Indonesia has repeatedly said it is not a party to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. But its law enforcement agencies have had to deal with encroachment and illegal fishing, including by Chinese vessels in the waters off the Natuna islands. A major question now is whether warming relations will keep encroachments at bay. MALAYSIA: Aligning with China’s preferences? Malaysia’s leaders have always seen China as an important neighbor and partner with which they have to navigate a complex relationship. The two countries established a comprehensive partnership in 2013 and China is Malaysia’s top economic partner, with trade worth more than U.S. $200 billion in 2022. In comparison, Malaysia-U.S. trade was $73 billion in the same year. Since coming to power in 2022, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has made it clear that fostering good ties with China is one of his priorities. Regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Malaysia’s long-standing policy has been to protect its sovereignty via international law. Malaysia has never recognized China’s nine-dash line and even ordered the removal of a scene from an animated movie that showed it. Yet some of the prime minister’s comments have stirred controversy. In March 2024, in a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra, Anwar said that countries needed to put themselves in China’s shoes and that trying to block its economic and technological advancement would only bring grievances. In November, after meeting President Xi Jinping in Beijing, Anwar said that Malaysia was 'ready to negotiate' on the South China Sea, suggesting bilateral negotiations over conflicting claims in the waters off the coast of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in January, once again the Malaysian leader stated that China should not be singled out for the tensions in the South China Sea, striking a clear pro-Beijing tone. 'Malaysia’s desire to exclude other countries, such as Australia, Japan and the United States, from South China Sea disputes aligns with China’s preferences,' wrote Euan Graham, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. 'It also helps China’s behind-the-scenes efforts to influence negotiations with ASEAN on a code of conduct for the South China Sea,' Graham added. China and ASEAN have been discussing the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea for years but have yet to reach a final agreement. In February, during a trip to Brunei, Anwar called for the code to be completed 'as soon as possible' to address escalating tensions in the waterway. Malaysia is the ASEAN chair this year. 'I believe Malaysia prefers to settle the issue among the stakeholders through dialogue and engagement without any intervention from outside,' said Lee Pei May, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the International Islamic University Malaysia. 'If there is intervention from outside powers, I believe the situation would be chaotic,' Lee said. 'The U.S., U.K. and other powers, they are not directly related to the dispute so they are considered outside powers.' The U.S. and its regional allies, for their part, argue that they are also Pacific nations, and have an interest in a free and open Indo-Pacific. Some analysts said that the Anwar administration, despite being criticized for its seemingly pro-Beijing stance, had not compromised Malaysia’s claims in the South China Sea. 'To be sure, Malaysia has adopted a very different approach to the South China Sea dispute than either Vietnam or the Philippines,' said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. Anwar’s policy still 'allows Malaysia to maintain close ties with China while asserting its territorial claims and protecting its sovereign rights,' he said. VIETNAM: A balancing act On Feb. 19, Beijing for the first time officially and publicly denounced Vietnam’s island-building activities in the South China Sea. Foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said that China opposed construction on 'illegally occupied islands and reefs,' referring to the features that Vietnam began reclaiming in the 2020s. It is not a secret that Vietnam wants to strengthen defenses against China’s dominance in the Spratly islands and the island-building activities have received strong support from the Vietnamese public as the sign of a refusal to compromise on sovereignty. 'If you listen to leaders’ speeches on both sides, Vietnam-China relations appear to be warm and flourishing,' said Dinh Kim Phuc, a South China Sea researcher. 'But Hanoi’s developments in the South China Sea show that they don’t really trust each other very much.' With China’s first public protest against the island building, it seems that an 'informal understanding' with Vietnam is over, noted Bill Hayton, an associate fellow at the British think-tank Chatham House. This tacit compromise meant that for a few years, Vietnam did not look for oil and gas inside China’s nine-dash line and China said nothing about Vietnam’s island-building activities, Hayton said. There may be several explanations for China’s objection but analysts believe Vietnam’s expanding ties with the United States is a major factor. Looking at overseas trips by Vietnam’s leaders, including the new Communist Party chief To Lam, Vietnam also seems to 'emphasize the values of ASEAN and the West' in its strategic thinking, according to Phuc. Vietnam has been reported as wanting to elevate ties with fellow ASEAN members Indonesia and Singapore to comprehensive strategic partnerships, the highest level of bilateral relations, this year. But that doesn’t mean that a decoupling from China would happen any time soon, analysts say, as Vietnam’s economy depends greatly on Chinese trade and investment. On the same day that China criticized Vietnam’s 'illegal occupation' in the South China Sea, Vietnam’s parliament approved a multi-billion-dollar railway running from the Chinese border to the South China Sea. Part of the funding is expected to come from China, despite some public unease about the potential debt. Gestures by General Secretary To and other leaders that can be seen as 'pro-West' or 'anti-China' are deemed as 'merely populist' by Dang Dinh Manh, a Vietnamese dissident lawyer now living in the U.S. 'They need to appease the general domestic public, which is increasingly nationalistic,' Manh said, adding that in his opinion the Hanoi leadership needed to appease China, too, and how to strike a balance can be 'a serious task', especially when it comes to sovereignty in the South China Sea.

The Case For Carbon Taxes In Southeast Asia – Analysis	By Subhramit Das Southeast Asia’s climate crisis is hardly a new phenomenon, with extreme weather events disproportionately affecting its populations and economies. But as public support for carbon taxes grows, governments in the region have a rare opportunity to implement effective carbon pricing policies that curb emissions while addressing economic and social concerns. The Asian Development Bank’s 2024 climate change perception survey of 14 Asian economies found that there is widespread public support for introducing carbon taxes as a measure to limit emissions. Another 2024 survey by the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute indicated that over 70 per cent of the respondents from across Southeast Asia supported a national carbon tax, and 93 per cent of that segment were willing to bear the personal costs that might arise from a carbon tax. These survey results lend urgency to Asian governments to explore the effectiveness of carbon taxes. The ‘polluter pays’ principle in economics argues that those responsible for creating pollution are responsible for managing it. Greenhouse gas emissions are a by-product of economic activity that impact society as they contribute to climate change, reduce quality of life and can be lethal, causing an estimated 4.2 million associated deaths worldwide in 2019. By imposing a price on emissions through a carbon tax, polluters are forced to internalise this cost. The key benefit of a carbon tax is that it provides businesses with a predictable path for controlling emissions, which helps them plan their shift to low-carbon technologies. In 2025, Singapore’s carbon tax rate is S$25 (US$18.4) per tonne of emissions. This will increase to between S$50–80 (US$37–59) per tonne by 2030. Singapore’s polluters are paying a low price initially while they develop and implement low-carbon technologies. The primary objection to a carbon tax regime has been its regressive nature — it disproportionately impacts lower-income households. Some countries have tried to get around this by introducing tax breaks, credits and targeted public spending that make the carbon tax revenue neutral. Canada’s British Columbia province introduced a carbon tax in 2008 and has been distributing the revenues as tax benefits for low-income households, as well as introducing tax cuts for small businesses to ensure they are not disproportionately affected by the carbon tax. Norway’s carbon tax revenue goes toward its Government Pension Fund Global. As of 2024, 39 countries have implemented a carbon tax. Most of the Nordic countries have had carbon taxation in place since the early 1990s. Carbon tax has directly caused a reduction in emissions in these countries. In 2015, Sweden reported a 30 per cent drop in emissions as a direct result of the tax scheme. The United Kingdom introduced a carbon tax on the power sector in 2013, which reduced electricity-related emissions by 26 per cent in just three years. Asia is facing headwinds from the European Union with the imposition of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 2026, which puts a price on carbon emitted during production of goods that enter the European Union. As the European Union is the ASEAN region’s third largest trading partner, it is imperative for the region’s governments to implement carbon pricing. But Asian policymakers must tread carefully as introducing any new tax is often a political minefield. The failure of carbon taxes in Australia is a cautionary tale, but there are ways to counterpublic dissatisfaction. Phasing in carbon taxes, as seen in Singapore, lets the public experience the costs and benefits of the taxation without being immediately onerous. Spending the tax revenues on initiatives that mitigate climate change seems to increase support for a carbon tax among voters. Japan — the first Asian country to implement a carbon tax — uses the revenues to support renewable energy projects and develop energy-saving technologies. Redistributing carbon tax revenue to support those disproportionately affected, especially as the taxes ramp up over time, will also help soften the blow. A 2022 study by the German Institute of Development and Sustainability estimated that a carbon tax of US$50 per tonne of emissions would increase poverty by 20 per cent in South Asia without revenue redistribution. But through revenue redistribution, carbon tax could alleviate poverty and reduce inequality worldwide. The key to winning support for carbon taxes is effective communication with stakeholders well ahead of implementation through public consultations. Governments should focus on the benefits of carbon taxes for society at large, such as improved atmospheric visibility and quality of life, neutralising the effects on low-income households and the overall economic impact of the green transition. While countries have the option of achieving carbon pricing through an emissions trading system, a carbon tax regime yields the greatest benefits for developing countries in Asia. To ensure enforcement, governments should impose the carbon tax upstream on fossil fuels. Developing nations typically have large informal sectors with limited enforcement capacity, so an upstream carbon tax is a necessary safeguard. With greater institutional knowledge and experience in carbon pricing, developing countries can move toward a hybrid approach with carbon taxes for some sectors and emissions trading systems for others. CBAM is a wake-up call for governments in the ASEAN region to urgently review incoming external carbon pricing mechanisms and counter their economic impacts. Developing nations are disproportionately impacted by extreme weather events, so their populations know well how important it is to rein in emissions. Given the region’s broad support for a carbon tax, this might be an opportune time to test its feasibility.

Nazism, Fascism, And Communism: Warring Sons To A Common Father –...	By Amirhossein Ojaqfaqihi What if two of history’s most infamous ideologies—Nazism and Fascism—shared more in common fundamentally with Communism than we often recognize? Recently, a chairwoman of a German political party controversially claimed that Hitler was a communist. While this assertion is incorrect, much of the criticism it drew focused only on the visible differences between Hitler and Communists, leaving their deeper ideological similarities unexamined. By revisiting the words of Hitler and Mussolini, it becomes clear that their rivalry with Communism was less about rejecting its principles and more about promoting competing visions of collectivism. It is now the duty of classical liberals, who fundamentally diverge from both communists and fascists, to seize the opportunity and reveal the shared collectivist roots of these ideologies. As a classical liberal, I have always been skeptical of my ideology being grouped on the same 'side' as the Nazis, given the stark philosophical differences. The disproportionate attention drawn to the rivalries between various forms of collectivism hinders thorough political discourse and leaves the core question of individualism versus collectivism inadequately explored. Mussolini: From Marxist to Nationalist Collectivist 'If the 19th century was the century of the individual, we are free to believe that this is the ‘collective’ century,' wrote Benito Mussolini. He began his career as an ardent Marxist, even editing a socialist magazine. However, World War I and his perceived failure of Communist internationalism to galvanize workers led him to reconsider. Rather than abandoning collectivism, he sought a unifying force stronger than class: nationalism. In The Doctrine of Fascism, he argued that 'the nation has not disappeared,' emphasizing that class distinctions obstruct true unity: 'Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests, but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and a race; it is a spiritual community.' Mussolini criticized socialism, not for its collectivist nature, but for its inability to unify all segments of society. He describedFascism as an ideology that subsumed the individual into the state: Liberalism denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts The rights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual…. The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. For Mussolini, the individual had meaning only as part of the collective, bound by traditions, culture, and duty: Fascism sees in the world not only those superficial, material aspects in which man appears as an individual, standing by himself…but the nation and the country; individuals and generations bound together by a moral law…founded on duty. Hitler’s Vision: Sacrificing the Individual for the Race The Nazis developed a slogan that can be read in a May 1, 1934 New York Times article title: 'The Common Good Before the Good of the Individual.' This Nazi slogan encapsulates Hitler’s collectivist ethos. While he diverged from socialism in practice, he acknowledged the collectivist appeal of its goals. In Mein Kampf, he states: 'I had no feelings of antipathy towards the actual policy of the Social Democrats. That its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the working classes…' However, Hitler’s break with socialism stemmed from its perceived failure to preserve national unity and identity. He viewed socialism’s internationalism as a threat to German identity: 'But the features that contributed most to estrange me from the Social Democratic movement was its hostile attitude towards the struggle for the conservation of Germanism in Austria…' What set Hitler apart was his emphasis on race. His core concept of racial superiority was fundamentally rooted in collectivism, seeing the Aryan race as embodying the ideal of self-sacrifice for the community: The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual powers, but rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the service of the community…. for the Ayran willingly subordinates his own ego to the common weal and when necessity calls he will even sacrifice his own life for the community. Compare this to Marx’s assertion that 'all previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority.' Both philosophies promoted visions of collective good, differing only in the identity—class or race—that served as the unifying force. For Hitler, the individual existed to serve the collective, with the state as the enforcer of this vision: '...the State is looked upon only as a means to an end and this end is the conservation of the racial characteristics of mankind.' While he opposed Marxism’s internationalism, he saw it more as a rival than a fundamentally different philosophy: Only when the international idea, politically organized by Marxism, is confronted by the folk idea, equally well organized in a systematic way and equally well led--only then will the fighting energy in the one camp be able to meet that of the other on an equal footing; and victory will be found on the side of eternal truth. Language Matters Although sophisticated exploration of these subjects in the literature is important, what benefit would it bring if these ideas don’t reach the masses? How can we serve our passion for liberty if we fail to assert it daily through its most powerful tool—language? Should we tolerate the perception that our ideology is just a matter of degrees from Nazism and Fascism? Meanwhile, the most impactful irony is that these ideologies are often categorized as being on the 'right!' Are we unaware of the implications of this neglect? Or, if we are aware, have we been passionate enough to address it? What we need is an abundance of daily discourse that blends factuality with simplicity—one that consistently reinforces its implications through language until it becomes widely accepted. Conclusion The debate over whether Hitler and Nazism belong to the left obscures a deeper truth: their collectivist roots align them more closely with Communism than with individualism, classical liberalism, or libertarianism. The qualities of Hitler and Mussolini differed significantly; their denial of individualism was philosophical, whereas their resentment of Communism was more of a passionate rivalry. By highlighting the shared foundations of these ideologies through promoting alternative political categorizations, we should incorporate these facts into everyday political discourse and reestablish their significance as the only truly distinctive ideology. Recognizing these less-explored, but fundamental, common features would help societies to have a broader perspective towards political relations and avoid falling for runaway collectivist movements simply because they offer a new leading identity—whether defined by class, nation, race, or gender. Classical liberalism has played a groundbreaking role in shaping the modern world—a world that, despite its flaws, is far removed from the hardships of earlier times. It should now become the mission of classical liberals to uncover the truth.

What Policymakers Should Prioritize On Ukraine – OpEd	Russia’s war against Ukraine will soon enter its fourth year. Since February 2022, violations of the laws of war have led to needless civilian death, suffering, and devastation with more than 12,456 Ukrainian civilians killed and 28,382 injured, at least 6.8 million having left the country, and millions more internally displaced. Thousands of homes, hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed. As this dreadful anniversary nears, the Trump administration is rapidly moving towards negotiations with the Kremlin. Civilian protection and justice need to be central to any negotiations. One immediate issue is the need to release Ukrainian civilians from Russian custody. These include thousands unlawfully detained and held by Russia in occupied areas of Ukraine and those forcibly transferred to detention facilities in Russia. A United Nations body recently concluded that Russian authorities torture Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) 'as a crime against humanity.' While the Geneva Conventions require the prompt release and repatriation of POWs at the end of active hostilities, negotiations offer an opportunity to highlight the urgency of achieving this. Russia continues to be an occupier in parts of Ukraine where millions live and is bound by the law on occupation. Investigations should continue into Russia’s violations of its obligations as the occupying force for example, by coercing residents to serve in the Russian military, imposing Russian citizenship, forcibly transferring civilians to other areas, imposing the Russian state curriculum in schools and other educational institutions, and politically indoctrinating school children in order to deny them the right to know and express their Ukrainian identity. Justice cannot be negotiated away. The perpetrators of war crimes, including widespread, indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians and civilian infrastructure, torture and ill-treatment in occupied areas and Russian prisons, and the torture and executions of POWs, must be held accountable. Investigations and prosecutions need to be supported and well-resourced. The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and five other high-ranking officials must be honored and ICC member countries should oppose the Trump administration’s sanctions on the court and forcefully support the court’s crucial role. Trump’s recent, incendiary and factually untrue statements and controversies around potential negotiations should not distract from urgent concerns for the rights of people in Ukraine’s occupied areas. The release of civilian detainees and repatriation of POWs should be a priority and victims of atrocities should receive justice and reparations for the harm they have suffered.

India’s Language Debate: Unity Or Identity? – OpEd	India’s linguistic scenery is as vibrant and complex as its cultural history. With over 120 major languages and thousands of dialects, the country’s diversity is both a source of pride and a battleground for political and cultural identity. At the heart of this struggle lies a decades-old debate: Should India prioritise a three-language policy—promoting Hindi, English, and regional languages—or embrace a two-language approach that sidelines Hindi in favour of regional tongues and English? This question has resurfaced with renewed intensity in recent years and months, fuelled by educational reforms, protests, and the ever-present tension between national unity and regional pride and identity. The roots of this conflict trace back to India’s post-independence era. In 1968, the Three-Language Formula was introduced to balance linguistic diversity with national cohesion. It encouraged states to teach the regional language, Hindi, and English. While Hindi-speaking northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar adopted this model, southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala resisted. For them, Hindi represented not unity but cultural domination by the North. Instead, they championed a two-language system, focusing on their native languages—Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada—and English, which they saw as a neutral bridge to the wider world. This historical friction reignited in 2020 with the Modi government’s National Education Policy (NEP), which urged non-Hindi states to teach Hindi 'wherever possible.' Though framed as a suggestion, critics argued it was a backdoor tactic to impose Hindi, linking federal funding to compliance. Tamil Nadu, with its long history of anti-Hindi sentiment dating back to violent protests in 1965, erupted in outrage. 'They call Hindi the ‘national language,’ but India has no national language. This is about erasing our identity,' said Ganesh, a student protester in Chennai. The NEP’s ambiguity felt like a betrayal to many, echoing fears of linguistic homogenisation. By 2023, the flames of dissent spread to Karnataka. When the state government proposed making Hindi compulsory in schools, Bengaluru saw massive protests. Activists and opposition parties accused the ruling BJP of undermining Kannada, the state’s native language. 'Hindi is not our culture; it is a political agenda,' declared Kannada writer Vasudha Krishnamurthy. In Tamil Nadu, activists took symbolic action, stripping Hindi signage from metro stations and shops—a defiant rejection of what they termed 'linguistic colonialism.' Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M.K. Stalin framed the resistance as a fight for Dravidian heritage: 'We will not let Hindi bulldoze our history.' Proponents of Hindi, however, paint a different picture. Leaders like Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath argue that Hindi is essential for national integration: 'It unites us all. Those opposing it are dividing the nation.' Economically, Hindi’s prevalence, spoken by 43 percent of Indians, offers practical advantages, opening doors to jobs in northern markets. Yet, for non-Hindi speakers, this logic rings hollow. 'Language is not just communication—it is memory, history, and resistance,' asserts Tamil scholar Ram. The debate also exposes stark class and caste divides. Rural India, where 65 percent of the population resides, relies heavily on state-language education. Without fluency in English or Hindi, students here face limited opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Urban elites, meanwhile, flock to English-medium private schools, cementing a divide between those who can navigate global markets and those left behind. The caste dimension adds another layer: Historically, upper castes monopolised Sanskrit and English, while lower castes were marginalised. Today, promoting Hindi as the 'people’s language' risks sidelining non-Hindi communities, reinforcing what Dalit activist Anand Teltumbde calls 'upper-caste dominance.' Technology has emerged as a new frontier in this battle. Government apps like Aarogya Setu, which initially lacked Tamil and Kannada options, sparked accusations of digital exclusion. Social media campaigns like #StopHindiImposition trend regularly, reflecting grassroots resistance. Yet tech also offers hope. Apps like Duolingo and AI-driven tools can democratise language learning, empowering users to bridge gaps without top-down mandates. The path forward may lie in flexible federalism. States like Kerala offer a model: teaching Malayalam, English, and Hindi but allowing students to choose between Hindi and Sanskrit post-primary school. This balances practicality with cultural choice. Decentralising language policy, investing in teacher training, and promoting regional languages in tech and media could preserve diversity while fostering unity. India’s linguistic struggle is ultimately a referendum on its identity. Can a nation of such staggering diversity thrive without imposing uniformity? The answer, perhaps, lies in embracing coexistence over coercion. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen reminds us, 'India’s plurality is its identity. To destroy that is to destroy India itself.' The Tamil farmer’s pride in his language and the Hindi clerk’s aspirations need not clash. In respecting both, India’s many voices can harmonise into a chorus that celebrates difference without discord. In a democracy as vast and varied as India’s, linguistic justice is not merely policy—it is a promise. A promise that every language, like every citizen, has a place in the nation’s story. The challenge is not to choose between Hindi and English, North and South, but to weave a tapestry where every thread strengthens the whole. Only then can India truly speak as one.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFqzt6PV9P9Tx7	2025-02-21T17:14:08-08:00	
Executive Orders Are Not A Panacea For America – OpEd	Many conservatives are exuberant that Donald Trump has won another term in the White House. And from a conservative perspective, there are undoubtedly reasons to celebrate Trump’s return to power, especially when compared with the Kamala Harris alternative: the abrupt termination of the US government’s profoundly discriminatory 'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion' programmes; a commitment to end government-sponsored censorship of Americans’ speech; a promise to cut government spending; the much-needed shake-up of the US’s pharmaceutical, health, and food regulatory establishment; and withdrawal from a WHO compromised by glaring conflicts of interest such as support from Pharma investors like Bill Gates. You do not need to be a front-row MAGA fan to be happy about these sorts of changes or see that they are far more sensible than what Kamala Harris was offering to the American people. However, I have the sense that some people are so caught up in the excitement of the moment that they are losing sight of the bigger picture. The bigger picture is this: The United States is an increasingly polarised society, divided between people who identify as 'progressives' and/or Democrats, and people who identify as 'conservatives' or libertarians and/or Republicans. This polarisation has translated into a divisive and acrimonious competition for federal power, that reaches its climax when both sides vie for the presidential office every four years. Federal power, whether over public finance and spending, the monetary system, the healthcare system, education, banking, commerce, or public health and hygiene, has grown to such an extent that people’s everyday lives are at the mercy of the person who ends up in the White House or the makeup of the US Supreme Court. This puts people’s freedom and prosperity on a very precarious footing indeed. Yet this has come to be widely accepted as the norm. And implicitly, it has come to be embraced by those who treat the president as a sort of messianic figure, who will either protect the 'little American' against Big Money, or 'make America great again,' and fight an epic, batman-like battle against the allies of Big Pharma, Big Bureaucracy, and Big Taxes. Don’t get me wrong. If you live in a centralised political system, it is rational to want the best candidate, or the least damaging candidate, to get into the White House. And you might be right in wanting a big shakeup of a corrupt oligarchic system, even if it takes a bit of a 'Batman' figure to pull it off. If I was Argentinian, for example, I would be happy that a country crippled by debt and cronyism was being shaken up by a powerful figure like Milei. One might wistfully hope that the rise of a Trump or Milei to power would somehow spark far-reaching reforms that ultimately returned power to the people. But that does not seem at all likely, given that the path to political reform in both cases is not grassroots change, but sweeping uses of executive power. If anything, there is a strong possibility that both Milei and Trump will further strengthen the executive office and make the national government even more powerful than before by showing the world how it can be effectively leveraged by a powerful president. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that the man currently occupying the White House is a sensible, wise man who can restore 'common sense' in the national government and introduce policies that favour freedom and economic growth, without allowing the national government to become too intrusive or domineering. Even assuming that this is the case, this individual will not occupy the White House forever. The chances are, especially in a politically and culturally polarised country like the United States, that a very different candidate will come along, in four, eight, or twelve years, and win enough votes to get into office and reverse his or her predecessor’s reforms. For example, if an executive order can undo DEI policies, stop government collusion with Big Tech censorship, or weaken the hold of Big Pharma over the healthcare complex, then a future executive order can reinstate DEI policies, restore government-sponsored censorship of 'misinformation,' and put Big Pharma and Big Food cronies in charge of the national food, drug, and healthcare regulatory apparatus. This means that political reform, however dramatic and exciting to behold, is inherently unstable in a centralised system with a strong executive office, particularly in a society that is deeply divided over the proper ends of the national government and over the values that represent the country at its best. So those who care about the long-term health and stability of the United States should favour more far-reaching structural reforms, that weaken both Congress and the presidential office, and return power to the State and local levels of government. This way, many highly divisive political disputes can be removed from the national stage and returned to the State and local levels, where different solutions can be developed that are tailored to local needs and local sensibilities. If people don’t like the results, they can 'vote with their feet,' and seek out a State more to their liking.

Congress Is (Unfortunately) Key To DOGE’s Success – OpEd	Most Americans have suspected that the federal government is riddled with wasteful spending. In the last few weeks, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has begun to pull back the curtain and expose the misuse of money. Examples include $32 million for a Civil Society Centre in Prague, $14 million for 'improving public procurement' in Serbia, and $373 million for DEI training grants. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the early poster child for government waste, fraud and abuse. Some of its wacky spending includes $70,000 for production of a 'DEI musical' in Ireland, $32,000 for a 'transgender comic book' in Peru, and $2 million for sex changes in Guatemala. Nearly all staff for the USAID were placed on administrative leave as the Trump administration ponders the future of the agency. Considering that the federal government spent $1.8 trillion more than it took in last year, the waste of funds strikes working Americans as verging on criminality. At a minimum, it is gross negligence by our elected leaders. President Donald Trump imposed a funding pause on all USAID money while his administration decided how to go forward. A federal judge, however, has ordered the president to temporarily lift the freeze on USAID spending. So just how far can Trump go in righting the wrongs of Congress and prior administrations? In constitutional parlance, Trump’s refusal to spend money appropriated by Congress is known as impoundment. Throughout American history, presidents have declined to spend appropriated funds. For example, in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson declined to spend $50,000 Congress had appropriated for gunboats in anticipation of a conflict with France. Jefferson’s negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase rendered military conflict unlikely, and Congress supported Jefferson’s impoundment decision. During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt impounded millions in congressionally appropriated funds when addressing various economic dislocations tied to the Great Depression and the war. Significant controversy over impoundment occurred during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, who impounded 17-20% of congressional appropriations. Nixon used impoundment to curtail domestic programs with which he disagreed. Crippled by the Watergate scandal and just a month before resigning, Nixon signed the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 into law. At base, the statute requires the president to report impoundments to Congress and to abide by a congressional decision on the matter. If Congress takes no action to review the impoundment, the president must spend the money. The Supreme Court has never addressed the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act. Advocates of executive power argue that the statute infringes upon the president’s inherent powers, while proponents of congressional power contend impoundment gives the executive an extra-constitutional veto on congressional actions. How about the termination of federal agencies such as USAID? While President John F. Kennedy established USAID through an executive order in 1961, Congress in 1998 designated USAID as an 'independent establishment' outside of the State Department. Because of the congressional legislation, it is doubtful that Trump can abolish the entity. Had Congress not acted in 1998 and USAID was still a creature of a JFK executive order, the situation would be different (but still subject to wrangling in the courts over whether the presidential decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act). Americans cheering DOGE and Trump should focus their energy on Congress. For better or worse, the Constitution’s Article I vests 'all legislative Powers herein granted . . . in a Congress of the United States.' The president cannot submit legislation to abolish USAID, but Congress can. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has introduced a bill (H.R. 1123) to halt all taxpayer funding to USAID and to claw back funds not yet distributed. In light of the DOGE discoveries and the anger of Americans at USAID’s malfeasance, if H.R. 1123 can’t pass with significant majorities in the House and Senate, there is no hope to ever Make America Great Again. H.R. 1123 presents Congress with, to borrow a phrase from Elon Musk, a fork in the road: continue to bankrupt the country by funding Guatemalan sex changes and other foolishness or take a stand for fiscal sanity. Absent a concerted effort in Congress to act on DOGE findings, Trump’s impoundments and employee furloughs will be caught up in the federal courts for months or years. While law geeks drool over the thought of the Supreme Court hearing arguments on the Impoundment Control Act, in the meantime, waste, fraud and abuse will continue in a business-as-usual manner. It’s time for the people supportive of DOGE to burn up the Capitol Hill switchboard.

Can The US And Russia Impose A Peace Deal On Ukraine? – Analysis	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- A whirlwind week that has seen two emergency summits in Europe and worried comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy underlines the gnawing fear in capitals from Kyiv to London. Namely, that Washington and Moscow could try to make their own deal on the future of Ukraine without Kyiv and U.S. allies in Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the angst with his post on Truth Social, accusing Zelenskyy of being a dictator and saying 'we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.' U.S. officials have denied they wish to exclude anyone from the process. But U.S. suggestions that Europe would not be at the negotiating table has caused widespread alarm, and the positive vibes from U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh on February 18 also set nerves on edge. At this stage, there are two key questions: would Washington and Moscow even be able to agree on a mutually acceptable settlement to end the war in Ukraine, and if they did, what could anyone else do about it? The White House clearly wants peace. It’s not clear that Moscow does. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on February 19 just hours after overnight Russian strikes pounded Ukraine. Some 250,000 people were left without power in subzero temperatures in the port city of Odesa. In Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the State Duma that 'the crisis should not be resolved with a cease-fire.' If the Kremlin is ready for a deal, it looks ready to push for a hard bargain. The nightmare scenario for Ukraine and its European allies is that Washington will agree to one. U.S. officials have said that both sides in the conflict will need to make concessions but have not provided detail of what Russia’s might be. Asked about this at the Munich Security Conference on February 15, Kellogg said: 'There’s going to have to be territorial concessions,' and 'it could be the renouncement of the use of force.' Skeptics have warned that the United States is giving away too much, too early, in search of a quick and easy diplomatic win. But if there is a deal that Ukraine and Europe do not accept, what then? There has been a string of strong statements. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was asked at Munich what Kyiv’s 'non-acceptance' of a bad deal would look like? 'We know how to resist. We proved this, on the battlefield,' he said. But without ongoing U.S. support, Ukrainian defiance is going to be difficult. So far, Europe has provided more aid to Kyiv than the United States, according to figuresfrom the Kiel Institute of the World Economy. The figures cover military, financial, and humanitarian aid. But Washington is the largest provider of military support, underlining the scale of the challenge Ukraine would face without U.S. backing. To make up the shortfall, Europe would have to nearly double its overall support to Kyiv. European leaders have repeated a mantra that they will provide assistance to Ukraine for 'as long as it takes.' But this does not address the question of whether they would massively increase this assistance to fill the gap. Even talk of a European peace-keeping force, which would be deployed in Ukraine after a potential cease-fire or peace deal, has been with the caveat that it would require U.S. involvement and support. Given fiscal limitations and political divisions, it’s unclear whether Europe would step up. So far, every step of the way, it has needed America to hold its hand.

Why Donald Trump’s Obsession With Greenland Is All About China – ...	By Joshua Frank In early January, Donald Trump Jr.’s private plane landed on a snowy airfield in Greenland. There was little fanfare upon his arrival, but his 14 million social-media fans were certainly tagging along. 'Greenland coming in hot…well, actually really really cold!!!' President Trump’s eldest son captioned a video he posted on X. It was shot from the cockpit of the plane, where a 'Trumpinator' bobblehead (a figurine of his father as the Terminator) rattled on the aircraft’s dashboard as it descended over icy blue seas. It was a stunt of MAGA proportions. Don Jr. was arriving in Greenland on behalf of his father who, along with his new buddy Elon Musk, had announced a desire to seize that vast Arctic landmass from Denmark through strong will or even, potentially, by force. There’s been plenty of speculation as to why Trump wants to make Greenland, the largest island on this planet, a new territory of the United States. And yes, his inflated ego is undoubtedly part of the reason, but an urge for geopolitical dominance also drives Trump’s ambitions. His fascination with Greenland can be traced back to his first administration when, in late 2019, he signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act establishing the US Space Force. 'There are grave threats to our national security,' he said shortly after signing the bill. 'American superiority in space is absolutely vital. The Space Force will help us deter aggression and control the ultimate high ground.' The following year, the US government renamed Greenland’s Thule Air Base, the Department of Defense’s northernmost outpost since 1951, Pituffik Space Base. According to the official United States Space Force Website, the 'Top of the World vantage point enables Space Superiority … Pituffik SB supports Missile Warning, Missile Defense, and Space Surveillance missions.' As such, it’s a key military asset for NATO and the United States. Denmark, a founding member of NATO and the country that has long controlled Greenland, had no problem with Trump’s Space Force operation taking root on that island’s soil. Some have argued that Trump’s obsession is related to the Pituffik Space Base and Greenland’s strategic importance for US power, given its proximity both to Europe and to the melting Arctic. Yet, given that the US Space Force already operates there with NATO’s and Denmark’s blessing, it’s hard to understand why this would be the case. So, what gives? Do you wonder whether Trump has his sights set on exploiting Greenland’s natural resources? A few small problems there: it has no accessible oil. Tapping its sizable natural gas reserves — mostly parked beneath massive sheets of glacial ice — would be challenging, if not impossible, and certainly not profitable. Even pipelines and other infrastructure would be difficult to build and maintain in its icy climate. Besides, the US already has the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves. Let’s assume that Trump’s fascination with Greenland is unrelated to fossil fuels or military installations. If so, that leaves one other obvious possibility: Greenland’s expansive reservoir of minerals, deposits crucial to making the gadgets we use and producing the green technologies that Trump appears to oppose. Trump’s green energy paradox As soon as President Trump took office, his administration began issuing executive orders in hopes of dismantling and disrupting environmental initiatives put in place by the Biden administration. One of its first actions included canceling Biden’s electric vehicle mandate, which requested that 50% of all autos sold in the US be electric by 2030 (though it wasn’t binding). 'We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers,' Trump boasted during his inaugural address. 'In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.' Of course, from their batteries to their engines, Biden’s push for electric vehicles would require a plethora of critical minerals, ranging from copper to graphite, cobalt to lithium. So, too, would other clean energy projects the Biden administration supported, from home energy storage systems to the deployment of solar panels. Given Donald Trump’s battle over electric vehicles, you might assume he would prefer to keep such minerals in the ground. Yet, like much of Trump’s bombast, his ploy to reverse Biden’s mandate had ulterior motives. Like Biden’s executive order, Trump’s doesn’t automatically change existing regulations. All emissions policies remain in place, and no rules have been altered that would require congressional approval. In many instances, such executive orders are essentially aspirational. Tax credits for electric vehicles remain active, but the federal government, as under Biden, doesn’t require automakers to sell a certain number of electric cars. This isn’t to say that Trump doesn’t want to alter such standards. However, doing so would require outfits like the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to propose changes and then provide time for public feedback. Bureaucracy can run slow, so during Trump’s first term, such changes took over two years to implement. Moreover, despite his war on electric vehicles, Trump has shown no sign of any eagerness to slow the mining of critical minerals on federal lands. In fact, his advisers want to do away with nettlesome environmental reviews that have gotten in the way of such mining. He is going all in, looking to ramp up not just oil, coal and natural gas production but also uranium and critical minerals. After taking office, one of his first actions was to sign an executive order declaring a 'National Energy Emergency,' which specifically called for expanding critical mineral development. 'The energy and critical minerals … identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs,' reads the order. 'We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.' Energy experts disagree. The US is not experiencing an energy emergency and hasn’t for decades. Gas prices are at a three-year low, and the country remains the world’s largest oil producer and natural gas exporter. In reality, Joe Biden’s oil and gas approvals outpacedthose in Trump’s first term, even if he also halted some further oil and gas exploration on public lands. After initial excitement from oil and gas companies, insiders admit that Trump’s emergency declaration isn’t going to cause a production ramp-up anytime soon. Those companies are, of course, in it to make money, and overproduction would lead to significant price drops, resulting in lower profits for shareholders and company executives. If that’s the situation for fossil fuels, when it comes to critical and rare earth minerals, Trump wants to hamper renewables’ growth while increasing the domestic production of those minerals. If that seems incongruous, that’s because it is. He wants to boost US mining of critical minerals because he knows that China, his archnemesis, is leading the global charge for their acquisition. Trump doesn’t seem to understand that it’s hard to stimulate investment in critical minerals if the future appetite for the technologies they support remains uncertain. As a result of his battle against electric vehicles, manufacturing expectations are already being slashed. While he may not comprehend how contradictory that is or even care, he certainly understands that the US depends on China for many of the critical minerals it consumes. Around 60% of the metals required for renewable technologies come directly from China or Chinese companies. Trump’s tariffs on China have even worried his buddy (and electric car producer) Elon Musk, who’s been workingbehind the scenes to block additional tariffs on graphite imports. Chinese graphite, an essential component of the lithium-ion batteries in his Teslas, may face new tariffs of as high as — and no, this is not a misprint — 920%. Such pandemonium around imports of critical minerals from China may be the true factor driving Trump’s impetus to steal Greenland from the clutches of Denmark. Trump and Musk also know critical minerals are big business. In 2022 alone, the top 40 producers brought in $711 billion. Total revenue grew 6.1% between 2022 and 2023, exceeding $2.15 trillion. That number is set to jump to $2.78 trillion by 2027. Eco-colonialism Greenland’s Indigenous Inuit people, the Kalaallit, account for 88% of that island’s population of 56,000. They have endured vicious forms of colonization for centuries. In the 12th century, Norwegians first landed in Greenland and built early colonies that lasted 200 years before they retreated to Iceland. By the 1700s, they returned to take ownership of that vast island, a territory that would be transferred to Denmark in 1814. In 1953, the Kalaallit were granted Danish citizenship, which involved a process of forced assimilation in which they were removed from their homes and sent to Demark for reeducation. Recently uncovered documents show that, in the 1960s, Danish authorities forcibly inserted intrauterine devices (IUDs) in Kalaallit women, including children, which post-colonial scholars describe as a 'silenced genocide.' In other words, the colonization of Greenland, like that of the United States, was rooted in violence and still thrives today through ongoing systemic oppression. The Kalaallit want out. In 2016, 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark, and today, 85% oppose Trump’s neocolonial efforts to steal the territory. 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale,' said the island’s prime minister, Múte Egede, who leads the democratic socialist Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which won 80% of the votes in the last general election. Even though Greenlanders are Danish citizens, the territory is self-governing. This brings us back to what this imperialist struggle is all about. The island is loaded with critical minerals, including rare earth minerals, lithium, graphite, copper, nickel, zinc and other materials used in green technologies. Some estimates suggest that Greenland has six million tons of graphite, 106 kilotons of copper, and 235 kilotons of lithium. It holds 25 of the 34 minerals in the European Union’s official list of critical raw materials, all of which exist along its rocky coastline, generally accessible for mining operations. Unsurprisingly, such enormous mineral wealth has made Greenland of interest to China, Russia and — yep — President Trump, too. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Right now, in this geopolitical chess game, graphite might be the most valuable of all the precious minerals Greenland has to offer. The Amitsoq graphite project in the Nanortalik region of southern Greenland could be the most significant prize of all. Considered to be pure, the 'spherical' graphite deposit at the mine there may prove to be the most profitable one in the world. Right now, GreenRoc Mining, based in London, is trying to fast-track work there, hoping to undercut China’s interest in Greenland’s resources to feed Europe’s green energy boom. The profits from that mine could exceed $2 billion. Currently, spherical graphite is only mined in China and is the graphite of choice for the anodes (a polarized electrical device) crucial to lithium-ion battery production. 'This is not a joke.' Despite President Trump’s attempt to put the brakes on EV growth in the US, sales are soaring across the planet. In 2024, EV sales rose 40%in China and 25% globally. Such growth comes with obstacles for manufacturers, which will need a steady stream of minerals like graphite to keep the assembly lines moving. It’s estimated that 100 new graphite mines alone will need to come online by 2035 to meet current demand. Such a reality is, no doubt, well understood by Elon Musk, the co-founder and CEO of Tesla. Musk benefits from his very close relationship with Donald Trump, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (which isn’t an actual department but an office inside the White House) and would certainly benefit if the US came to control Greenland. 'If the people of Greenland want to be part of America, which I hope they do, they would be most welcome!' Musk recently wrote on his platform X. Musk is not the only one with potential interests in Greenland. Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has a financial stake in the territory, though he’s promised to divest. Lutnick’s investment firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, backs Critical Metals Corporation, which is set to start mining in Greenland for rare earth minerals as soon as 2026. Like Musk, Lutnick will significantly influence Trump’s approach to the island, even if he officially divests. Trump has also dispatched Ken Howery, a billionaire tech investor, co-founder of PayPal, and buddy of Musk, to be the next US ambassador to Denmark. Howery has told friends he’s excited about his post and the possibility of brokering a deal for the US to acquire Greenland. Marco Rubio, the new secretary of state, insists that Trump isn’t bullshitting when it comes to Greenland. 'This is not a joke,' he said. 'This is not about acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land. This is in our national interest and it needs to be solved.' Greenland and its resources are merely the latest potential casualty of Trump’s quest for global domination and his fear of China’s economic power. His interest in the green energy sector does not signify a change of heart regarding the dangers of climate chaos or the value of renewables but rather a drive for global financial supremacy. Like the billionaires around him, he desires it all — the oil, the gas and the critical minerals essential for the global energy transition, while China is pushed aside. Regarding the Kalaallits and their aspirations, he could care less. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Four Scenarios For Securing Peace In Ukraine – Analysis	By Tatiana Vorozhko U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year full-scale war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war. Maximum pressure strategy A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled 'How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,' calls for 'a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.' It proposes that the U.S. and its allies: 'Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.' 'Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.' CEPA says that 'Ukraine and Europe' must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support 'a European-led coalition of the willing' to enforce any 'ceasefire line with an international force,' and that 'European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.' One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having 'equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means' and using its toughest 'diplomatic tools.' She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. 'To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,' Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia 'veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.' Negotiating tactics Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration. Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict. Among them: 'Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.' 'Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.' 'Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.' Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine 'to the hilt'; giving it 'all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets'; making Europe 'pay more for weapons' and provide 100,000 troops as 'peacekeepers'; enabling 'American companies to rebuild Ukraine'; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept 'reasonable' peace deal terms. Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers. '[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.' Touting economic benefits In a report titled 'Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,' Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe. Among the report’s conclusions: 'Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.' 'A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.' 'Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.' In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine. A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said. 'They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,' he predicted. He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions. Middle road approach The Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project' includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road. Among Project 2025’s recommendations: 'With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.' 'Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.' 'The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.' James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. 'For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq38nZZPlAOx6	2025-02-21T16:52:28-08:00	
Musk’s Buddy Javier Milei Tangos With Crypto Scam – OpEd	Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who has won high praise from Elon Musk, was caught in the middle of crypto scam in the country, that may have cost investors close to $5 million. The story is that Milei used his huge following on social media to promote a new crypto coin called the $LIBRA. Milei told his followers that the $LIBRA would stimulate the economy and help small businesses grow. This post sent the value of the $LIBRA soaring. However, as people began to investigate the coin, they became suspicious that it was a scam. The price began to crumble, and Milei took down his post. The coin quickly lost more than 90 percent of its value. Milei then said that he didn’t know anything about the coin and took no responsibility for his actions. Meanwhile, a number of people bought the coin near its peak, allowing the originators of the scam to cash out with big gains and leaving them with big loses. In the scheme of things, a $5 million dollar scam is not a big deal even in Argentina. But it does say a great deal about the way things work in the Trump-Milei world. Like Trump, Milei has taken big pride in disrupting Argentina’s government and economy. He also fired large numbers of civil servants and cut back government spending in many areas. In fairness, Milei did have more to complain about. The country was suffering from double-digit inflation, and the economy was in a recession. Nonetheless, it is not clear that Milei’s wrecking ball approach is likely to be a step forward. The poverty rate soared to over 50 percent as the recession became far steeper and the unemployment rate jumped. Part of Milei’s agenda, like Trump’s, is promoting cryptocurrency. As with Trump, Milei has never suggested a serious use for crypto. In Argentina, as in the U.S., the only known use for crypto is facilitating illegal transactions like drug dealing and ransom payments. Nonetheless, both presidents express a strong fondness for it. Donald Trump and Melanie Trump even have put out their own crypto currency, likely pocketing close to $100 million from it. It is a bit ironic seeing the Milei venture, and possibly the Trump coins, referred to as 'crypto scams.' That is a bit like fake counterfeit currency. But apart from the philosophical issue, there is the point about the extraordinary ability of a president to use the power of the government for their own personal gain. While past presidents may not have been squeaky clean, we have never seen a president so willing to openly use their power to line their pocket as Donald Trump. At this point it is not even news because Trump is so open about it. In that sense the Milei clown show is interesting in that, at least in Argentina, this sort of sleaze is still a scandal. Argentina generally has not ranked very high on most people’s lists for good governance, but for now, it stands well above the United States.

Europe Braces For A ‘New’ Germany	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- The most attentive spectators at Germany’s many pre-election party conferences were easy to miss. While leaders courted the cameras on stage, European diplomats discreetly mingled with the crowds that gathered in the Berlin area on successive weekends to rubber-stamp lead candidates and manifestos. One week, observers might have spotted the British ambassador to Berlin at the City Cube conference centre talking to the lead MP on foreign policy of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The next, they may have stumbled across a representative of the Portuguese embassy queuing for coffee at the Green Party conference at the same venue. Europe has been nervously watching the election campaign of the continent’s biggest economy, whose importance at a time of global upheaval can hardly be overstated. 'The world doesn’t stop spinning with everything that is going on in America, the first 100 days of Trump, and even the European budget,' one European diplomat told Euractiv. 'Europe needs to have someone to engage with in Germany.' For Germany’s neighbours, it may be reassuring that the country’s officials seem to be aware of their responsibility to Europe, with the four leading parties all campaigning on distinct visions for Germany’s future role in the European Union. The most likely outcome of Sunday’s ballot would see Berlin play a more muscular role on the European stage – if at the risk of stepping on some toes. It would certainly be a contrast to the last three years. German observers have watched in horror as the country went from purportedly ‘leading the free world’ under Angela Merkel to becoming an also-ran under Scholz. If the chancellor ever made a splash in Brussels, it was because of a botched relationshipwith Emmanuel Macron – the other half of the EU’s Franco-German ‘engine’ – and unilateral measures in moments of crisis. At other times, his unruly three-party coalition has been so hopelessly divided that it derailed the EU's legislative process, or failed to agree on any position at all in Brussels – the infamous ‘German vote'. Ending Germany’s ‘speechlessness' Frustration over this is rife among Scholz's rivals, especially his coalition partners, the Greens, who have often been blamed by extension for what they see as the chancellor's failures. At the start of the campaign, when journalists at a background briefing pressed Robert Habeck, the lead candidate of the Greens, on the central narrative of his campaign, his answer was clear: a strong focus on Europe. Scholz’s mixed record on Europe was also a preferred campaign target of election frontrunner Friedrich Merz, a former MEP, who has vowed to introduce a proactive leadership style that prioritises coordination and ends Germany's 'European speechlessness'. While the campaign was hardly more Europe-focused than usual, Merz and Habeck notably tried to set themselves apart from Scholz on Germany's leadership in the EU, noted Johannes Lindner, director of the Jacques Delors Centre. European topics gained slightly more traction with Donald Trump’s moves on Ukraine and tariffs, and a swelling debate over irregular migration and national border controls, he said.This has yielded four distinct scenarios for Germany’s future role in Europe. On one side of the spectrum, Habeck has advocated for federalist leadership that would make Germany’s vast resources available to Europe, including openness to new common debt and funding. On the other side, Alice Weidel, the leading candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the second-most popular party, has promised to take Germany out of the EU and the Euro. Between the two, Merz promises a new, pan-European leadership style, but explicitly defends national policy interests. Meanwhile, Scholz stands for a status quo, in which the EU is hardly front and centre. 'He didn’t even mention the EU once,' said one European diplomat after the chancellor’s keynote speech at the SPD’s election conference in January. In voters’ hands But the choice – and Europe’s fate – ultimately lie in the hands of German voters. As usual, the EU was low on the list of the most pressing issues for the electorate, with only 1% seeing it as a priority matter, according to a recent YouGov poll. Yet they are mostly aligned with the vision of the likely winner, Merz. According to a survey commissioned by the European Movement Germany (EBD), most voters back Germany's EU membership and want the bloc to do more, rather than less, to boost Europe’s defence, border security, and competitiveness. Unlike Habeck, however, they do not want Germany to lend more of its spending power to the bloc and are divided about further enlargement. Merz's Christian Democrats are cautious about both. Merz’s promise is that his government will bring new European momentum to areas like security and competitiveness, through stronger European cooperation and a strengthened single market, said Lindner. 'Merz has underlined his appetite for leadership,' he noted. Whether he will succeed will depend on his ability to form a stable, two-party coalition at home and to coordinate closely with EU allies, Lindner added. The flip side That is not a given: Merz's appetite can translate into a lack of consideration. On migration, Merz has championed a 'Germany first' policy that involves permanent border controls and the rejection of all asylum-seekers that enter from neighbouring countries, which would all but undermine Europe's cooperation on borders and migration. His opponents have compared this unilateral approach to 'Clint Eastwood' (Habeck) and 'Viktor Orbán' (Scholz), with the chancellor accusing Merz of 'burying Europe'. Not to mention that some EU allies dreaded the prolonged period of German dominance under Angela Merkel during the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s. But for now, Germany's neighbours seem satisfied that Merz has namechecked their priorities. 'There are signs that the key players in Germany are prioritising the right issues, such as security and competitiveness,' said Sweden’s ambassador to Berlin, Veronika Wand-Danielson. Above all, she cares that Germany will regain its footing soon. 'We hope that a new government will be formed as quickly as possible,' she told Euractiv. 'We have so many common interests and so many common challenges and no time to wait.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq78ond_4ajfq	2025-02-21T16:39:43-08:00	
India’s Growing US Ties And Its Impact On China Relations – OpEd	India's growing closeness with the United States has significant implications for its relationship with China, shaping the geopolitical landscape of Asia and beyond. As New Delhi strengthens its ties with Washington, concerns arise regarding the potential for increased tensions with Beijing. This dynamic is influenced by various factors, including military cooperation, economic strategies, and regional security considerations. Military Cooperation and Strategic Alignments The deepening military cooperation between India and the U.S. is a central element of their burgeoning partnership. This includes joint military exercises, defense technology transfers, and intelligence sharing, which enhance India's capabilities to counter Chinese assertiveness in the region. The U.S. has positioned itself as a reliable partner for India, especially in times of crisis, as demonstrated during recent border tensions with China. This support has bolstered India's confidence in confronting Chinese aggression, leading to a more assertive stance along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). However, this military alignment also provokes a strong reaction from China. Beijing perceives the U.S.-India partnership as a direct threat to its regional influence and security interests. Chinese analysts have expressed concerns that India's increasing military capabilities, supported by the U.S., could lead to a strategic encirclement of China. Consequently, China may respond by enhancing its military presence along its borders with India and increasing its support for Pakistan, further complicating the security dynamics in South Asia. Economic Implications Economically, India's alignment with the U.S. presents both opportunities and challenges in its relationship with China. The U.S. seeks to diversify supply chains away from China, and India is positioned as a potential alternative manufacturing hub. This shift could benefit India's economy by attracting foreign investment and creating jobs. However, it also risks exacerbating tensions with China, which may view these developments as an attempt to undermine its economic standing. China has historically leveraged its economic influence in South Asia through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has strengthened its ties with neighboring countries. As India aligns more closely with the U.S., it may find itself at odds with these Chinese-led initiatives, leading to further economic competition between the two nations. Technology and Supply Chain Dynamics The U.S.-India partnership emphasizes technology cooperation, particularly in sectors like defense and cybersecurity. As India seeks to attract American investment in technology sectors such as semiconductors, it faces the challenge of competing against China's established supply chains. The potential for U.S.-India collaboration in critical technologies could bolster India's position but may also lead to increased competition with China in global markets. Beijing is likely to respond by enhancing its own technological capabilities and seeking alternative partnerships. The Role of Global Actors The evolving dynamic between India, the U.S., and China is not isolated; it affects other global actors as well. For instance, Russia has historically maintained strong ties with both India and China. As India aligns more closely with the U.S., Moscow may seek to leverage its relationships to maintain influence in South Asia while also benefiting from China's economic growth. This triadic relationship complicates India's strategic calculations as it navigates its partnerships while being mindful of Russia's interests. Regional Security Dynamics The strategic rivalry between India and China is further complicated by regional security dynamics. China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean poses a direct challenge to India's traditional dominance in the region. The U.S.-India partnership aims to counterbalance China's maritime ambitions through initiatives like the Quad—a strategic alliance involving Japan and Australia focused on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. This increased collaboration among Quad members signals a collective effort to address shared concerns about China's assertiveness. However, it may also provoke Beijing to intensify its own maritime activities, leading to heightened tensions in contested waters. The potential for miscalculations or confrontations in these areas underscores the fragility of peace in the region. Diplomatic Maneuvering Despite these tensions, both India and China have expressed interest in managing their bilateral relations amid their respective alignments with the U.S. However, this balancing act is precarious; any significant warming of relations between India and the U.S. could prompt China to adopt a more aggressive posture towards India. Moreover, India's historical ties with Russia complicate this dynamic further. As India navigates its relationship with the U.S., it must also consider its longstanding partnership with Moscow, which remains critical for defense procurement and energy supplies. The interplay between these relationships will shape India's foreign policy choices moving forward. In conclusion, India's growing closeness with the United States significantly impacts its relationship with China across military, economic, and diplomatic dimensions. While this partnership enhances India's capabilities and positions it as a key player in countering Chinese influence in Asia, it also invites greater scrutiny and potential retaliation from Beijing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq71DST6wfYfo	2025-02-21T16:35:30-08:00	
More Reports Of Russian Mercenary And FAMA Attacks On Civilians	Members of the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa) and Russian mercenaries now known as Africa Corps are accused of killing nine people, including women and children, in an attack on a vehicle in Mali’s Segou region in January. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, spokesperson for the coalition of Tuareg groups in northern Mali, told Reuters that the victims were headed to a refugee camp in Mauritania when they were attacked. It was the latest in a series of atrocities committed by FAMa and Russian mercenaries since the United Nations peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, left the country more than a year ago. Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara also have been active since MINUSMA left. The terror groups killed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands between June and December 2024, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). JNIM burned more than 1,000 homes, looted thousands of livestock, and increased attacks on civilians and security forces. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) reported that attacks on Malian civilians have increased 38% since MINUSMA left, with the battles and attacks spreading to new areas in northern Mali. ACLED said the Malian Army and Russian mercenaries commit 'torture, summary executions, beheadings, ejection of prisoners from aircrafts and the booby-trapping of corpses.' According to ACLED, Malian military and allied forces carried out 255 operations, killing 1,063 civilians between January 1 and the end of October 2024. During the same period in 2023, these forces conducted 216 operations that killed 912 civilians. A recent HRW report included interviews with witnesses to some of the atrocities. In search of ethnic Fulani men accused of supporting JNIM, Malian forces and Russian mercenaries on May 8 killed two men and a boy in Barikoro, a village controlled by the terror group. They arrived on motorcycles and about 10 military vehicles, including armored cars. A mechanic said that he advised a Fulani man to leave his garage when he heard the forces were coming. After the man left, the mechanic heard several gunshots. 'I found my cousin’s body on the west side of the village with eight gunshots: in the forehead, the head, the back, and the legs,' a survivor told HRW. 'Meters away we found the bodies of two Fulani men also riddled by bullets, so we dug three holes and covered them with sand.' Malian and Russian forces on August 16 raided the village of Dounkala, where JNIM regularly attacks security forces. Witnesses said the forces went door to door and rounded up all men and interrogated them outside a mosque, where they killed a 19-year-old. 'His mother told me that when Wagner [fighters] ordered him to go to the mosque, he refused and called them ‘kuffar’ [nonbelievers],' a witness told HRW. 'So, a Wagner [fighter] shot him. I saw the body with a bullet wound in the chest.' Forces conducted similar operations on August 15 in the village of Toulé, killing seven men and torching dozens of homes. A farmer said he hid in an irrigation canal in his rice field. He heard people shouting and saw flames coming from the village. 'The following day, I returned to Toulé and found the bodies of seven villagers, their hands tied up behind their backs, blindfolded, and with their throats slit,' he said. A 52-year-old man said three of his sons were among the 21 civilians reportedly killed in Tinzawaten, where 47 FAMa soldiers and 84 Russian mercenaries were killed in July during a fierce three-day battle with JNIM. Two of the man’s sons were younger than 18. 'I heard the two strikes, and the fear of a third one prevented me from rushing to the scene,' the man told HRW. 'So, the bodies of my children remained there until the early evening when I finally saw them, all hit by shrapnel. … We buried them in a single hole without taking off their clothes, just 900 meters from the place of the strike.' Dozens of Malian soldiers and about 10 Russian fighters attacked the village of Ndorgollé on October 8. Witnesses said uniformed soldiers arrived at 8 a.m. in more than 20 military vehicles, including two armored cars. They surrounded the village, killed two men and arrested three others. 'They asked an older man where his son was,' a herder said. 'He replied he didn’t know. So, one soldier shot him in the chest point-blank. After that, his son came out and was shot in the head.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq4W4WFYz0z9d	2025-02-21T16:31:56-08:00	
New HHS Secretary Curtails US Government Role As Drug Promoter – ...	It has been commonplace for so long that most Americans cannot remember a time before the United States government was out running public relations campaigns urging Americans to take this or that vaccine or other pharmaceutical industry product. Now, an early action by new US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. suggests this practice may be coming to an end. Helen Branswell reported Thursday at STAT News that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 'was ordered to shelve promotions it developed for a variety of vaccines, including a ‘Wild to Mild’ advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against flu' and that the CDC was informed that Kennedy 'wanted advertisements that promote the idea of ‘informed consent’ in vaccine decision-making instead.' What a major change — a transition from being a pharmaceutical company product promoter to being a promoter of, as Branswell describes informed consent in her article, 'the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any drug they are prescribed.' This is a good early step by Kennedy. It clarifies a new orientation placing focus on advancing information and choice instead of pushing product. If Kennedy continues on this course, he can accomplish major advancement for health and freedom in America as his appointment suggested would be possible.

Sudanese Refugees Imprisoned And Impoverished By Ethiopian Visa P...	By Augustine Passilly Sudanese refugees living in Ethiopian cities are being driven deeper into poverty because of government-imposed visa fees that are beyond their means, and some have even been arrested for failing to pay the monthly charges and arrears. Ethiopia requires Sudanese who want refugee status to live in designated camps—where they don’t have to pay visa fees – but had previously offered visa exemptions to those who decided to live in urban areas where there is less insecurity. However, these exemptions were halted last October, forcing thousands of refugees living outside the camps to start paying $100 every month to renew their visas, and an additional $10 per day in fines if they miss the payment. 'The police regularly arrest Sudanese people and throw them in jail because they haven’t paid the monthly fees,' one refugee*, who hasn’t been able to pay the charge since entering Ethiopia last July, told The New Humanitarian. A high school teacher in Sudan, the refugee said she relies on her son in France to pay for the modest hotel room she shares with her daughter. Since hearing about the monthly fees, she said she avoids going outside. Sudan’s war—which pits the paramilitary-turned-rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) against the regular army—erupted in April 2023, and has produced the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. According to the UN, more than 12.3 million people have been uprooted by the violence, of whom 3.5 million have crossed borders into neighbouring countries, mainly Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan. Since the beginning of the war, some 163,000 people from Sudan—including 85,000 Sudanese nationals—have arrived in Ethiopia, which is home to the second-largest refugee population in Africa, hosting over a million people. 'They won’t have access to essential services like healthcare, education, or work opportunities, and may be vulnerable to exploitation.' Ethiopia has been widely commended for allowing so many refugees into the country, yet it has several policies that are harmful to the refugee population, and it is also embroiled itself in a number of destructive and deadly internal conflicts. Sudanese refugees in camps have faced dire humanitarian and security conditions, especially in the Amhara region, where local militias have subjected them to attacks, abductions, and rapes. Some refugee settlements have closed as a result. Meanwhile, many of the urban Sudanese refugees, who are thought to number around 15,000, lack protections that would have been afforded to them if they had refugee status. 'Sudanese nationals who don’t register as refugees may lack legal protection and face deportation or detention,' said Tarik Argaz, a communications officer for UNHCR in Ethiopia. 'They won’t have access to essential services like healthcare, education, or work opportunities and may be vulnerable to exploitation.' 'I try to feed myself. That is my only concern' Sudanese wanting to apply for asylum are supposed to register on arrival in the Ethiopian border towns of Metemma and Assosa. Once registered, they are then required to settle in UN-run camps allocated by local authorities. Those wishing to live outside the camps can request a permit from the government’s Refugees and Returnees Service, yet these can be hard to obtain because applicants must have a local sponsor or prove their ability to support themselves. Many of the urban Sudanese refugees therefore don’t have refugee status nor the hard-to-obtain residence permits. That means they are required to constantly renew their visas, even though few can actually afford it. A 25-year-old homeless Sudanese refugee who has been living in Addis Ababa since last April said he can only focus on his daily survival out on the streets and is terrified of encountering the Ethiopian security services. When he arrived in Ethiopia, he was working for a design company that wanted to fly him to its offices in Mauritania. But he said he was robbed last year of his phone and laptop, which stopped him from working and resulted in his contract being terminated. A single mother who crossed the Ethiopian border with her four children in June 2023 said she is also unable to pay the visa fees because she is focused on more essential things. 'I try to feed myself. That is my only concern,' she told The New Humanitarian. 'I haven’t paid my rent in two months, but the landlord knows I’ll repay him when I have the money,' she added. A makeup artist in Sudan, the woman said she does small informal jobs to feed her children, from henna hand art to serving tea and snacks in the courtyard of a restaurant run by a Sudanese-Ethiopian couple. A Sudanese mathematics professor who has sought refuge in Addis Ababa said he owes so much money to the Ethiopian government that he cannot afford to travel to another country, which is trapping him in a vicious cycle. The professor said many Sudanese refugees in the capital are facing a tough time, with some youth even turning to crime to make ends meet. 'They are willing to do anything in exchange for a meal or a small sum of money,' he said. Detained refugees Arrests of Sudanese who have not renewed their visas are common, according to Hassan Tawakol, a Sudanese academic who is raising funds in Addis Ababa to pay for the bail of detainees. Tawakol sent The New Humanitarian a list of 12 Sudanese refugees he said have been detained since the beginning of February, all of them incarcerated in the capital. A diplomatic source in Addis Ababa, who asked not to be named to speak freely, said Sudanese embassy officials had requested an extension to the original visa fee exemption and that the Ethiopian authorities had promised to grant one. The official said they were unsure if the government had fulfilled its pledge because of 'a lack of will' or for political reasons, which could be linked to Ethiopia’s fractious recent relations with Sudanese authorities. A Sudanese journalist in Addis Ababa said he was stopped last year by security services in civilian clothing and was imprisoned for two months because he hadn’t reviewed his visa for more than half a year. The journalist said he shared a cell with around 40 detainees, including seven Sudanese refugees who all owed money to the Ethiopian government’s Immigration and Citizenship Services agency. He said he was released but has arrears amounting to $1,200 and fears being arrested again. 'There is no logic in asking us to pay such amounts when we fled a war,' he said. 'The Ethiopian government is simply looking for money.' A second Sudanese refugee journalist said the visa fees are supposed to be paid in dollars, which complicates matters further for those who already cannot afford to pay. 'To obtain dollars, I must go through the black market, which is by definition illegal,' the journalist said. 'The police can arrest me if they find dollars or any other hard currency in my pocket.' Fears of returning Despite the difficult situation they are facing – and recent advances by the Sudanese army against the RSF – the refugees who spoke to The New Humanitarian said they are not considering returning to Sudan anytime soon. 'I abandoned my home in Khartoum,' said the single mother living in Addis Ababa with her daughter. 'I have nowhere else to live. Moreover, rents have become exorbitant in cities controlled by the army.' The young man living on the streets said his family members in Sudan are internally displaced and facing dire conditions he would not want to experience. 'My father lost his teaching job because schools are closed,' he said. 'There is no work, no services, no network, no electricity there. And as a young man, it would be very dangerous for me to return to Sudan. I could be forced to take up arms.' *The names of all refugees are being withheld given the risks they face. The writer is a freelance journalist based in Ethiopia, and previously in Sudan. This article is part of The New Humanitarian’s wider body of reporting on abuses against Sudanese refugees in Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan.

Who Flew A Reconnaissance Drone Into Kazakhstan?	(Eurasianet) -- Kazakhstan is finding itself caught up in the Russia-Ukraine war after an unidentified drone crashed in the Bokeyorda District of the West Kazakhstan region, not far from the Russian city of Volgograd. Russian officials are trying to pin the incident on Ukraine, while Ukrainian experts have offered evidence that the drone was a Russian vehicle. Kazakh sensitivities have been heightened by a February 17 drone attack carried out against a vital pumping station in Russia operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), part of a pipeline that connects Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. The CPC pipeline is the main route used for Kazakh oil exports; the destruction caused during the attack will allegedly reduce the pipeline’s export capacity by roughly one-third for several months, according to Russian officials. Ukrainian officials acknowledged the attack on the CPC facility in Krasnodar Krai and say attacks on Russian energy infrastructure will continue. 'They not only support Russia’s military by supplying fuel to enemy forces but also play a crucial role in financing the war through oil profits,' the Kyiv Post quoted a Ukrainian Security Services source as saying. The Kremlin reportedly wants members of the CPC consortium to shoulder the repair and upgrade costs for the damaged pumping station, including advanced firefighting equipment. The American oil giant Chevron and the Kazakh government-controlled energy entity KazMunayGaz are among the largest CPC shareholders. The drone discovery in West Kazakhstan occurred the day after the CPC attack, according to Kazakh media reports. The crash site is situated in the vicinity of a Russian military training ground, Kapustin Yar. Soon after Kazakh reports of a downed drone began circulating, Russian Telegram channels and web information portals began spreading unsubstantiated claims that the drone in question was a reconnaissance vehicle on a mission to coordinate a Ukrainian 'kamikaze' drone attack on CPC infrastructure in Kazakh territory. Russian media described the drone as a French-made UAV used by the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian Military Center, a Kyiv-based public organization with strong ties to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, accused Russia of trying to stoke 'an international provocation,' adding that the photo of the downed drone published by Kazakh media bears no resemblance to the design of the French-made drone that Russian sources say it is. The Ukrainian Military Center also posted visual evidence that indicates the vehicle is Russian-made, saying 'the characteristic shape of the hull, fuselage elements and the drone’s camera unequivocally confirm that it was the Orlan-10 drone that went down in Kazakhstan.' According to Kazakh media reports, the drone is now being analyzed by Kazakh military experts at a facility in the regional capital Uralsk. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry announced it will seek discussions with Ukrainian officials about drone attacks. 'This is a very important issue for the economy of Kazakhstan, and we will certainly discuss this situation with our Ukrainian partners through diplomatic channels,' the official Kazinform news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying. Kazakh officials at the same time are downplaying the impact of the February 17 attack on the CPC pumping station, saying it 'will not pose risks to the transportation of Kazakh oil,' according to the Kazinform report. Export data raises questions about the reliability of Russian damage estimates to the CPC pumping station. The Reuters news agency reported that Kazakhstan pumped a record high volume of oil on February 19, two days after the Ukrainian drone attack on the pumping station. 'It was not immediately clear how Kazakhstan had been able to pump record volumes given output increases need to correspond with export pipeline capacity,' the Reuters report states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFqz8NOjERTJH6	2025-02-21T16:18:50-08:00	
British Court Confirms Vatican Was Defrauded In London Real Estat...	By Victoria Cardiel A ruling by the High Court of England and Wales published Feb. 21 has confirmed that the Vatican Secretariat of State was deceived by Italian financier Raffaele Mincione in the irregular purchase of a London building. For this transaction that ended in fraud Mincione was sentenced in December 2023 by a Vatican lower court to five years and six months in prison for financial crimes related to the case. In addition, he was ordered to forfeit 200.5 million euros (about $210 million), one of the largest financial penalties ever imposed in the Vatican courts. In that trial, Cardinal Angelo Becciu was also sentenced to five and a half years in prison for embezzlement of public funds. According to the ruling, Becciu arranged the acquisition of property located on Sloane Avenue when he was deputy secretary of state from 2011 to 2018. To do so, he used a third of the reserved funds of the Secretariat of State: that is, $200 million that was paid between 2013 and 2014 at the request of Becciu. This amount was used to buy shares through a fund managed by the Italian intermediary Mincione, who was also convicted along with Becciu by the Vatican lower court for money laundering, embezzlement, and corruption. Following the sentence, Mincione filed a lawsuit against the Vatican Secretariat of State in British court in June 2020, and the court published its ruling Feb. 21. The Italian financier’s aim was to obtain a series of legal declarations in his favor regarding his handling of the buying and selling of the Sloane Avenue building. Mincione argued that his conduct in the transaction had been transparent and in accordance with the standards of good faith. However, the British court rejected his allegations, confirming that the Vatican had reasons to consider itself the victim of a damaging financial scheme. According to Judge Robin Knowles’ 50-page ruling, Mincione and his companies withheld key information and misrepresented the value of the London property, causing significant harm to the Vatican. The court found that Mincione made 'unrealistic' statements, inflating the price of the property and taking advantage of the Vatican’s lack of experience in such investments. Much of the lengthy summary of the verdict focuses on the reconstruction of the irregular transaction.The British court made it clear that the Vatican Secretariat of State was deceived, which coincides with the primary thesis of the Vatican court, which had previously convicted Mincione of money laundering, embezzlement, and corruption. As a lower court ruling, Mincione has the possibility of appealing the decision. For the Vatican, the ruling 'has important implications not only for Mincione but also for future cases involving the financial operations of the Holy See,' according to a Vatican News editorial on the subject. According to Vatican journalist Andrea Tornielli, the ruling 'establishes an important precedent by recognizing that the Vatican was the victim of financial fraud in one of its most important real estate investments.' He also confirmed that according to the Vatican 'the lack of transparency and ethics with which Mincione and his entourage operated could influence other ongoing judicial proceedings.' The sentence reinforces, Tornielli said, 'the conclusions of the Vatican tribunal, which had already convicted Mincione for crimes related to fraudulent investments of funds of the Holy See.' Tornielli also referenced a statement by the Vatican promoter of justice, Alessandro Diddi, expressing his satisfaction with the British court’s ruling against Mincione. 'The British judges have shared the view of the Vatican tribunal and have confirmed that Raffaele Mincione did not act in good faith as required in this type of transaction. With this ruling, it is clear that the Vatican court acted correctly in its assessment of the case,' Diddi said. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

What We Can Learn From Burckhardt’s Writings – Analysis	By Dr. Badran Al-Honaihen Johann Ludwig Burckhardt was a prominent Swiss traveler, historian and orientalist who visited the Arabian Peninsula in the early 19th century. He is known for his accurate and fair observations. Burckhardt studied Islamic religion and the Arabic language in Britain before embarking on a journey with a pilgrimage caravan to Makkah during the era of the First Saudi State. His writings are considered a significant contemporary source of historical information. He relied on his personal observations and social analysis of the society at that time, in addition to oral narratives and a limited number of written sources, and he produced remarkable works about the period following the founding of the First Saudi State. How can the concept of the state accommodate the population of the Arabian Peninsula, the majority of whom are composed of nomadic tribes? How can the concept of exploitation and plunder through influence and power, which involves seizing the spoils from the weaker, be eradicated so that the populace can develop the vision of a state founded on integrity, Islamic principles, security, and peace? Burckhardt addressed these inquiries, conveying a detailed historical account through the pages of his books. Judicial reform Burkhardt presented an orientalist vision from outside the Arabian Peninsula, which articulated the existence of state values that the inhabitants had not previously recognized. This perspective imposed upon them, as individuals accountable to the state, the concepts of stability and peace, which had been absent for centuries in the region. It also addressed the management of tribal relations and governance, the importance of respecting the judiciary for the first time in centuries, and the prohibition of the use of force and weaponry. This wisdom represented a novel vision and direction for the residents of the Arabian Peninsula, emphasizing that the state bears responsibility for their welfare. The judiciary was the authority to which all tribes turned for arbitration, and it represented one of the most significant outcomes of the state’s legal framework, originating from Diriyah, the capital, and extending beyond it through individuals known for their integrity. The state directly allocated funds as a new legal system, replacing the traditional customs that had been prevalent among the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula in previous centuries, where expenses were incurred by the disputing parties to discuss and resolve their cases. In the judicial system, the right to appeal a decision was also guaranteed under the First Saudi State across all its regions, specifically through the review process in Diriyah, to consider the appeal of the decision, representing a new development in a judicial system that differs from previous practices in the region’s history. Security for all Burckhardt also discussed how the early Saudis approached the concepts of security and peace for all inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. The state entrusted the complete responsibility for investigating thefts occurring within their territories to tribal leaders and local rulers. They were penalized with fines equivalent to the value of the livestock or property that had been stolen. The leaders of the regions and the chiefs of the tribes were thus tasked with protecting their neighbors and travelers just as they would safeguard their own properties. Consequently, there was a cessation of thefts and acts of plunder that had previously occurred. This level of order following the establishment of the state had not been experienced by the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula since the time of the Prophet and the era of the rightly guided caliphs. Burckhardt noted that a merchant could traverse the Arabian Peninsula alone with complete safety, and that the Bedouins slept without fear of nighttime thieves targeting their livestock and possessions. Burckhardt wrote about the personal guards of the imam, known as the Munqiya, who were recognized as some of the bravest knights of the Arabian Peninsula and formidable warriors. They were permanently stationed in Diriyah and served as a regular force for the state. To join this elite group, one needed to be a distinguished knight with a notable reputation among his people before gaining recognition from others. Each member was provided with a suitable horse or camel from the royal stables, received a salary, and was equipped to the highest standards. The horses or camels were outfitted with gear made from wool covered with felt, which offered significant protection against swords and spears. State protocols In Burckhardt’s writings, there is a notable emphasis on the social details pertaining to the state, particularly highlighting the era of Imam Saud bin Abdulaziz. This historical account is rarely found among local historians, who express admiration for the imam’s elegance and his keen attention to his appearance and pleasant demeanor. Additionally, it is noted that he took great care in grooming his mustache and beard, distinguishing himself from others primarily through the opulence and cleanliness of his attire, as well as the fragrances emanating from his headscarf. Burkhardt elaborated on intricate details of royal etiquette. He discussed the protocol of the Salwa Palace, located in the At-Turaif District, which was home to Imam Saud, and the manner in which princes from various countries and tribal leaders were received. Additionally, he described the palace’s engagement in hosting guests, including the provision of lunch and dinner, as well as the care for horses and camels of the visiting dignitaries. The majlis’s reception times were designated for three specific periods: early morning after dawn; after the afternoon prayer until sunset; and again after the evening prayer late into the night. This latter time was often reserved for the family of the imam and his descendants who happened to be present in Diriyah. Anyone wishing to meet the imam could simply approach the majlis. The common titles used by the public to address the imam included Saud, Abu Abdullah, and Abu al-Shawarib. The majlis was always enriched with the recitation of the Qur’an, discussions of Hadith, interpretations, and cultural insights from the scholars of the court. Imam Saud would conclude the session by addressing the book intended for explanation, followed by a serious discussion among the scholars regarding its contents and a thoughtful exchange of perspectives. According to Burkhardt’s testimony, Imam Saud excelled over others in his profound cultural knowledge, dialogue, and persuasive abilities. This was evident in his high-level writings that demonstrated his skill in persuasion. His eloquence and melodious voice particularly sparked curiosity and admiration, enabling his words to resonate deeply with the hearts of the Arabs around him. The generosity of the imam and his hospitality toward his guests astonished this orientalist, particularly in his description of the stable housing 2,000 Arabian horses. Additionally, he noted the presence of 500 family members and attendants, all of whom were provided with ample food, including rice, bulgur, dates, and lamb, sufficient to accommodate both them and the palace guests. The imam as a father Burkhardt illustrates the imam’s dedication to the upbringing of his children, particularly his son Abdullah, who would later become an imam himself. At the age of five, he was taught to ride horses, allowing him to experience the thrill of galloping. Additionally, the imam is said to have closely observed his children’s behavior and imparted wisdom and sound advice to them. His fondness for fatherhood is evident to anyone who visits the At-Turaif District, where the proximity of the imam’s palace to his sons’ residences is apparent. Imam Saud exemplified wisdom and the ability to address issues swiftly. He was highly educated, possessing a profound understanding of politics. He garnered significant popularity among the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. His military engagements began at the age of 12. One of the most emotionally significant family moments for Imam Saud occurred during his pilgrimage when he stood before the Kaaba as the people of Saudi Arabia were adorning it with a new covering from Al-Ahsa. While he was preoccupied with observing the pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba, his son Fahd’s wife approached him, cradling her child in her arms. She had come to fulfill the fifth pillar of Islam and was eager for Imam Saud to meet his grandson, whom he had never seen before. In a tender moment witnessed by all the pilgrims, the imam took the child into his arms, embracing and kissing him affectionately for an extended period. I appreciated Burkhardt’s awareness of social details and the sincerity of his expression; this is what distinguishes a writer from any nation when viewed from an external perspective with a different Western lens. He captures intricate details that may have seemed insignificant to people at the time, which later became a vital source for studying the history of the era. Thank you, Burkhardt, for that account which transported us to the First Saudi State with remarkable detail and precision. Dr. Badran Al-Honaihen is the special projects executive director at the Diriyah Gate Development Authority.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq19R-LfGYFIe	2025-02-21T16:08:16-08:00	
Rebuilding Myanmar: A Needs-Based Approach To Post-Conflict Trans...	By Harry Myo Lin As Myanmar likely will move toward a post-coup transition in 2025, rebuilding the nation requires a comprehensive and strategic approach. The country’s deep-seated divisions, economic instability, and social fragmentation call for a framework that addresses immediate humanitarian concerns and long-term peacebuilding. By applying Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to conflict transformation, this article provides policymakers and stakeholders with a structured understanding of how unmet needs fuel conflict and how fulfilling them can foster reconciliation and stability. Drawing from successful post-conflict examples in Aceh, South Africa, and Colombia, we outline practical applications that can guide Myanmar’s path to sustainable peace. From economic justice and governance reforms to interfaith dialogue and trauma healing, this article highlights how a needs-based approach can rebuild trust, empower communities, and ensure a democratic and inclusive Myanmar. Theoretical Framework: Maslow’s Hierarchy and Conflict Dynamics Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Conflict transformation, a process aimed at addressing the root causes of violence and fostering sustainable peace, requires a deep understanding of human motivation and needs. Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a seminal psychological theory, provides a structured framework to analyze how unmet needs perpetuate conflict and how fulfilling them can promote reconciliation. By bridging psychological principles with peacebuilding methodologies, addressing physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs can dismantle cycles of violence and empower individuals and communities. Maslow’s theory posits that human needs are arranged hierarchically, with basic physiological and safety needs forming the foundation, followed by social belonging, esteem, and self-actualization (Maslow, p. 370–96). Lower-level 'deficiency needs' (D-needs) must be 'more or less' met before higher 'growth needs' (B-needs) become salient (Maslow, p. 69). However, Maslow later acknowledged flexibility in the hierarchy, noting that needs can overlap or reorder based on individual and cultural contexts (Maslow, p. 68). Figure 1: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Source: Wikimedia Commons. Linking Unmet Needs to Conflict Structural conflicts, such as colonialism, patriarchy, or economic exploitation, often arise from systemic deprivation of basic needs. The Dependency-Power-Violence (DPV) Triangle illustrates this: involuntary dependency on dominant groups creates power imbalances, which, when sustained, justify violence as a means to fulfill unmet needs (Arai, p. 30). For instance, marginalized communities deprived of physiological needs (food, shelter) or safety (employment, healthcare) may resort to violence to reclaim agency (Arai, p. 30). Similarly, dehumanization—a key conflict dynamic—stems from polarised groups denying each other’s humanity, often due to perceived threats to their safety or esteem (Conflict Dynamics, p. 1). Figure 2: The DPV Triangle. Source: Arai (Adapted from Lederach, 2005). Conflict Transformation Through a Needs-Based Lens Conflict transformation strategies must address both immediate needs and structural inequities. Johan Galtung’s concept of structural violence—systemic harm caused by unjust institutions—aligns with Maslow’s emphasis on deficiency needs (Galtung, 2010, p. 157–188). By ensuring access to resources (physiological/safety), fostering inclusive communities (belonging), and empowering marginalized voices (esteem/self-actualization), practitioners can dismantle cycles of violence. Practical Applications for Myanmar Transitioning from Theory to Practice Applying Maslow’s hierarchy to Myanmar’s post-coup transition requires a needs-based approach to rebuilding the nation after the military is defeated. Myanmar will face a reconstruction period, requiring a careful strategy to address the economic, social, and psychological scars of military rule. By looking at successful post-conflict models from Aceh, South Africa, and Colombia, we can propose practical steps for Myanmar’s transformation. 1. Addressing Physiological and Safety Needs: Economic Justice and Stability Land Rights and Economic Redistribution: Myanmar’s history of land dispossession and economic control by the military must be addressed through comprehensive land reforms. Inspired by South Africa’s post-apartheid land restitution program, Myanmar can implement policies that return land to displaced ethnic minorities and provide economic opportunities to former resistance fighters and war-affected populations. Employment and Financial Stability: A post-conflict Myanmar will need economic stabilization programs similar to Aceh’s reintegration projects for ex-combatants. These programs can provide former resistance fighters with vocational training and employment opportunities, reducing their reliance on armed struggle. Microfinance programs, modeled after Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, can be extended to rural Myanmar to empower women and local businesses. 2. Building Belonging and Esteem: Social Reconciliation and Healing Interfaith and Ethnic Dialogue: Religious and ethnic divisions fueled by military propaganda will require structured reconciliation efforts. In Colombia, interfaith dialogue and truth commissions were crucial in rebuilding community trust. Myanmar could create community dialogue forums in the different potential federal unit areas where religious and community leaders engage in trust-building initiatives, learning from South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Education and Media Reform: To dismantle ethnic and religious prejudices, education reform is essential. Curriculums should be redesigned to promote pluralism, civic education, and human rights awareness, following Rwanda’s model of post-genocide education reform. Media regulations must ensure that hate speech is countered, similar to Germany’s strict anti-hate speech laws, preventing extremist ideologies from resurfacing. 3. Empowering Self-Actualization: Grassroots Leadership and Civic Engagement Decentralization and Local Governance: A post-coup Myanmar should avoid over-centralization of power. The governance model can be inspired by Indonesia’s post-Suharto decentralization, where local communities were given greater control over governance. Local councils, led by former resistance leaders and civil society actors, can provide a sense of ownership in rebuilding Myanmar. Arts-Based Peacebuilding: Creative expression is a powerful tool for social healing. Sri Lanka’s Butterfly Peace Garden demonstrated how art, theater, and storytelling help trauma-affected youth reconcile with past conflicts. Myanmar’s traditional cultural arts (e.g., Zat performances, poetry, songs, animations, movies, murals, etc) can be used to create shared narratives of unity and national renewal. Challenges and Considerations Cultural and Contextual Adaptation: Maslow’s hierarchy, developed in Western individualistic contexts, may not fully align with Myanmar’s collectivist society. Efforts must respect communal identities while ensuring individual agency. Power Asymmetry and Structural Barriers: While symbolically powerful, women’s inclusion in peace talks may remain tokenistic unless patriarchal norms are actively challenged. Quotas for female participation, modeled after Liberia’s post-war governance reforms, can help address systemic barriers. Psychological and Trauma Considerations: A conflict-affected society like Myanmar will have profound psychological wounds. Addressing trauma healing and mental health services is essential to preventing cycles of violence. Programs modeled after Bosnia’s post-war psychosocial interventions could help address collective trauma and ensure sustainable reconciliation. Balancing Immediate Needs and Long-Term Goals: Simultaneously addressing urgent survival needs and long-term democratic restructuring will be critical. Myanmar’s transition must prioritize stability and justice, ensuring that governance structures do not replicate past inequalities. Conclusion A needs-based approach provides a holistic framework for Myanmar’s post-coup transition. By addressing economic justice, social reconciliation, and grassroots leadership, Myanmar can lay the groundwork for sustainable and inclusive peace. Learning from global post-conflict transformations, Myanmar’s future must be shaped by policies that bridge psychological well-being with structural reforms, ensuring a resilient and democratic society. Policymakers and all stakeholders must work collectively to achieve this vision of national renewal.

External Revenue Or Protectionism: A Tariff Can’t Be Both – Analy...	By Tate Fegley One of President Trump’s proposals for his new term is to abolish the federal income tax and replace it with tariffs as the primary revenue source for the US federal government. In a brilliant rhetorical move, he suggests implementing this through abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and replacing it with the 'External Revenue Service,' claiming that the tariffs collected by this new agency would be financed by foreigners rather than Americans. This sure sounds like a good deal. Trump has claimed that 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the English language, even more so than 'love.' Perhaps it would be if it were a device by which one could costlessly extract funds from foreigners. But is a tariff capable of doing such a thing? Standard microeconomic analysis tells us that the economic 'incidence' of a tax (that is, who really pays what portion of it) is not necessarily who statutorily collects it. In other words, just because sales tax is collected by the seller who then pays it to the tax man, this doesn’t mean that it is the seller paying the whole tax. Rather, the incidence of the tax depends on the relative elasticities of the buyer’s demand and the seller’s supply. A greater portion of the tax will be borne by the party whose demand (or supply) is relatively inelastic, as shown in the figure below. So is AOC right when she says the recently threatened tariffs on Colombian exports to the US will be paid by Americans? Not if she means that the tax will be exclusively paid for by Americans, but yes, if she means to say that at least some will be. The US is a big market for Colombian exporters—it is unlikely that Colombian coffee producers, for example, could halt all their exports to the US, attempt to sell it all elsewhere, and receive the same amount of revenue. In other words, the supply curve of Colombian for exports to the US is upward sloping, rather than flat. However, unless that supply curve is vertical (in which case, the quantity of Colombian coffee supplied to the US would be completely unresponsive to changes in price), at least some of the incidence of a tariff on Colombian coffee exported to the US would be borne by US consumers. The only other possible way that the tariff would be fully paid by Colombian exporters is if the demand curve of US consumers for Colombian coffee is horizontal, which would mean that any increase in price would lead to Americans not buying any Colombian coffee at all. As such, any tariff would have to be fully paid by Colombian exporters. To reiterate: there are only two (unlikely and perhaps even impossible) circumstances under which the incidence of tariffs would fall fully upon foreigners: The supply curve of the foreign exporter is vertical (perfectly inelastic) The demand curve of US consumers for a particular country’s exports is horizontal (perfectly elastic) A far more plausible scenario in the realm of international trade is a relatively elastic supply curve. Indeed, a model commonly presented in international trade textbooks analyzes the effect of a tariff in a 'small' country, which is assumed to lack the heft to sway world markets through its citizens’ decisions to buy or abstain from buying, and thus faces a horizontal world supply curve: In this case, the reason the importing country faces a horizontal supply curve at PFT is because consumers in the importing country have to compete with the rest of the world’s consumers, and if they aren’t willing to pay at least PFT, exporters can find plenty of other consumers who are willing to pay that price. As such, if the importing country’s government imposes tariffs on this good, the full burden of the tax will be on domestic consumers because the only way exporters are willing to sell in that country is if they receive at least PFT. Something you’ll also find in a typical international trade textbook is a model analyzing the effects of tariffs in a 'large' country, meaning that demand in that market is large enough such that exporters cannot find just as many willing buyers elsewhere. Under such circumstances (and if supply and demand curves are drawn in a certain way), in this model it’s possible for the large country to 'benefit' on net from tariffs—that is, the total dollar value of deadweight losses from the tariff in terms of losses in consumer welfare and production inefficiencies is outweighed by a sufficient amount of the tax falling on exporters. (However, this net 'benefit' treats taxpayer dollars in the hands of the government as just as valuable as taxpayers being able to keep their money.) But even in this optimistic scenario (in the real world we could not even determine whether such an 'optimal tariff' had been achieved), it is still the case that tariffs are being at least partially paid by domestic consumers. There is no free lunch. One further thing to emphasize (as noted by Robert Murphy in a recent episode of The Human Action Podcast) is that there is a conflict between the goals of having a tariff protect domestic producers on the one hand and be revenue-generating on the other hand. In the former case, the end of having a protective tariff is making imports sufficiently expensive that domestic consumers will choose to buy from a domestic producer. The more successful the tariff is in this regard, the fewer imports there are and, therefore, the less tariff revenue there is. If it is 100 percent successful and no imports are purchased, then there is no tariff revenue. Gary North agreed with Trump that 'tariff' sounds better than 'sales tax': The politicians of the national state come before the voters and propose sales taxes on goods that cross into the nation from abroad. The politicians are careful not to describe these sales taxes as sales taxes. Too many voters are tired of paying the existing level of taxes, let alone a new tax. So, the politicians call these sales taxes by a new name: tariffs. But there is nothing magical about tariffs. They are taxes and they are paid by you.

Khamenei Admits Defeat In Battle For Public Trust Among Iran’s Pe...	In a speech on February 17, 2025, Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei once again revealed his deep fear about the unstable state of the regime and the inevitable prospect of its overthrow. He acknowledged the sequential desertions and demoralization among the regime’s rank and file and dispirited forces with the phrase 'doubts about the pillars of the state!' and, to boost their morale, resorted to empty boasting. 'Today, in terms of hard defense, in terms of the enemy’s hard threat, we have no worries or problems. Today, thank God, we ourselves know, our friends know, and our enemies know that Islamic Iran, in terms of its ability to deal with hard threats, is at a high level, and the people feel secure in this regard. Therefore, our issue today is not the enemy’s hard threats,' Khamenei said. If Khamenei’s problem is not a hard threat, then what is it? Acknowledgment of Feeling Danger from Inside the Country In this speech, Khamenei said: 'Today, our enemies admit that they have come to the conclusion that if they want to overcome the Iranian nation, if they want to push the Islamic Republic back from its powerful positions, the way is to create problems inside the country, inside the nation, and inflict the people with problems and soft threats.' These words indicate that the most important priority for the Supreme Leader, as always, is to preserve the regime against the danger of being overthrown by the people and their fiery uprising. Unlike in the past, when Khamenei used foreign threats as an excuse to justify internal repression, he now explicitly admits that the real threat comes from inside the country and from within the Iranian people. His statements can also be interpreted from the angle that street repression can no longer control the deep social and political crises. The regime’s main enemy is not Khamenei’s delusions about foreign conspiracies, but the Iranian people; people who, according to him, are the subject of a 'soft threat!' due to their increasing and escalating awareness of political and social issues, and each of them, by organizing a base of revolution in their homes, streets, and workplaces, can ignite the matches ready for an uprising. Filling the Empty Bag with Government-Staged Shows In this speech, Khamenei once again tried to promote the street carnival and the exposed show of government-organized crowd-making on the anniversary of the anti-monarchical revolution as evidence of his regime’s legitimacy. He claimed that these marches show that the people still support the regime. The reality is that such shows are organized with huge expenses, forced mobilization, and threats to employees and students, and have nothing to do with the real demands of the people. Khamenei is making these statements while the claim of Jamshid Amouzegar, the then Prime Minister of the Shah, on April 10, 1978, about the gathering of 400,000 people in Tabriz is still in the collective memory of the Iranian people. The Shah regime was busy making fake crowds by bringing the army, police, and SAVAK [Shah’s secret police] onto the scene in the guise of plainclothes agents while the officials and leaders of the regime were competing with each other in buying real estate in California to flee the country. Khamenei’s main challenge is that people no longer trust official narratives. In today’s world, with the expansion of social networks, the truths behind these shows are revealed. Scenes of empty streets, pre-determined slogans, and carrying government placards can no longer deceive society. Confession to Failure with the Phrase 'Soft Threat' Khamenei admitted that the issue for his government today is not the enemy’s hard threat, but the soft threat. He defined this threat: 'What is a soft threat? A soft threat means manipulating people’s public opinion, creating discord, creating doubt about the pillars of the Islamic Revolution; this is a software threat. A soft threat means creating doubt about resistance against the enemy; this is what they are doing.' This confession is proof of the fact that the regime has become powerless in the face of people’s awareness. Khamenei knows that the Iranian people have risen up to confront the regime’s lies by relying on information, awareness, and social networks. The mentality of society can no longer be changed with censorship, filtering, and government propaganda. In order to survive, the regime is trying to keep people in ignorance and unawareness. But people are becoming more aware day by day and are no longer deceived by government shows. The widespread protests of students, workers, teachers, and other dissatisfied groups in Iran show an increase in the level of public awareness. This has terrified the regime. By carefully examining the content of his statements, it can be understood that it is not the people who have fallen into doubt about the 'pillars of the regime' (i.e., the rule of clergy and the policy of repression and export of terrorism). The people’s stance towards this regime has been clear for years. Khamenei’s reference is to the regime’s crumbling base of loyalists, which can no longer be preserved with the regime’s superficial and propagandistic slogans. A Futile Attempt to Justify the Regime’s Enemy-Making Khamenei continued his speech and tried to justify the regime’s enemy-making. He said: 'Some, in incomplete analyses, like to pretend that Iran itself creates enemies with its own hands, this is not the case.' Everyone knows that the regime’s aggressive and repressive policies are due to its fascist nature, and creating a fictitious enemy to justify these policies is an inherent characteristic of fascism. The mullahs’ regime is the main cause of enemy-making by suppressing the people, supporting terrorist groups in the region, and creating internal and external crises. The Iranian people know well that the real enemy is not outside the country, but within this oppressive regime. A Future Without the Mullahs’ Rule Khamenei’s statements reveal his fear of the future more than ever before. He knows that Iranian society no longer accepts the medieval and outdated system of the mullahs’ rule. Every day that passes, the foundations of his rule become shakier and the wave of public anger expands. As mentioned earlier, the real threat that Khamenei is talking about does not come from foreign enemies, but from within the streets of Iran and from among the people who no longer want to submit to the coercion and oppression of the absolute rule of the mullahs. This speech as a whole is an acknowledgment of the weakness, decline, and inevitable end of religious fascism. The Iranian people, more aware and determined than ever, are moving in the direction of overthrowing this dictatorship in line with the organized resistance and Resistance Units. A future without the mullahs’ rule is on the horizon.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj39xSmSumFuT	2025-02-20T16:50:48-08:00	
Speak Truth To Power…Or Irrelevance – OpEd	Back in July, in the immediate aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and that photograph of him rising phoenix-like from the floor with a bloodied ear and raised fist shouting the defiant ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’, J D Vance’s selection as Trump’s running mate caused a meltdown among those afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. On the Democratic left, because Vance was regarded as an apostate and the only befitting punishment for apostates is death. On the Republican right, because Vance, an Iraq veteran, was the symbol of the long-overdue end of the interventionist neoconservative movement addicted to forever wars. There was a third line of criticism, which still bubbles up occasionally, which attacked Vance as an opportunist who had turned from excoriating Trump to singing his praises. He had described himself as a Never Trumper and called Trump ‘an idiot,’ ‘noxious,’ ‘America’s Hitler,’ and ‘unfit for our nation’s highest office’ because he is ‘morally reprehensible.’ The thing is though, as Salena Zeto wrote in the Atlantic back in 2016, while Trump’s supporters took his candidacy seriously but didn’t take his rhetoric literally, opponents take his words literally but don’t take him seriously. Vance’s earlier views of Trump were of the latter variety. For those who have read Vance’s autobiographical Hillbilly Elegy (2016), however, there is a natural political-cum-philosophical affinity between him and Trump. He grew up an Appalachian hillbilly, overcame ‘white trash’ origins and a dysfunctional family, joined the Marines, and leveraged military service into degrees from Ohio State and Yale. His social, economic, and governing philosophies are the result of this hardscrabble backstory. His business and political success offer a lesson in redemption that is the very essence of the American dream. Writing in the Spectator Australia on 27 July, I said: ‘Other potential picks for a running mate (who alone of the senior advisers cannot be fired) might have better helped Trump to win the election, but 39-year-old J D Vance offers the best chance to entrench the MAGA revolution in and beyond a second Trump administration.’ Vance brought his compelling backstory to life in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Milwaukee on 17 July. The introduction of his previously drug-addled and serially partnered mother, clean and sober now for a decade, to the whole nation was a fitting culmination of his life story to date. His wife Usha Vance represents another stream in the American dream, of immigrants who come to America as the land of opportunity where education, talent, and hard work are rewarded. Indo-Americans have achieved success without victimhood and grievance. Vance is exceptionally attuned to the ravages of American deindustrialisation with US manufacturing hollowed out, jobs shipped overseas, and swathes of the homeland turned into a wasteland along the Rust Belt. As Vance said in his acceptance speech, China built its middle class on the backs of growing numbers of unemployed Americans. Vance similarly prioritises the health of the US economy above the health of the planet under the alleged threat from ‘global warming.’ The commitment to reversing this destructive trend rests equally powerfully on the recognition of the importance of dignity conferred on human beings by productive work and living wages and the role of well-paying jobs in sustaining stable family life. Like Trump, Vance’s instincts are not to flinch but to go all in to turn the American nightmare into the American dream once again. His youth will ensure a continuation of Trumpism after Trump by an articulate and thoughtful politician. In foreign policy, he could be expected to shy away from military adventurism but punch hard if and when necessary to defend American interests and values. In personal traits, he came without the crude vulgarities of his boss that millions of Americans are unable to get past in order to appreciate his policies and achievements. Vance is a champion of the post-liberal right. To decry him as isolationist betrays willful blindness. He represents realism and restraint alongside strength. He has remained steadfast in US support for Israel in its war with Hamas. He questions why Europe, comparable in wealth and population to America, cannot deal with Ukraine on its own. Its military underspending is ‘an implied tax on the American people to allow for the security of Europe,’ he wrote in the Financial Times a year ago. He holds Asia to be the key strategic battleground in the foreseeable future. Similarly, Vance is no more racist and anti-immigrant than Trump. Both welcome legal immigrants who share in and commit to core American values. Both oppose discrimination – positive and negative – based on faith and skin colour. Why wouldn’t Vance want equality of opportunity for his own children? In a triumph of hope over experience, I concluded my July article with the thought that ‘Australian conservatives could do with a Trump-Vance combination whose focus is on the wellbeing of productive workers on the farms and in the factories.’ Vice President Vance Delivering his acceptance speech to the nation on 5 November after winning the election, Trump said of his running mate: [J D Vance is] a feisty guy isn’t he? You know, I’ve said 'go into the enemy camp' and, you know, the enemy camp is certain networks and a lot of people don’t like it, they’re like 'Sir, do I have to do that?' He just goes 'Okay, which one? CNN? MSNBC?' He’ll say 'All right, thank you very much.' He actually is like the only guy I’ve ever, he really looks forward to it and then he just goes in and absolutely obliterates them… We had of course seen these traits in the course of the campaign in the calm and methodical manner in which Vance did indeed obliterate many hostile media interviewers with complete courtesy but a deadly command of his brief. Trump added: He’s turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was – I knew, I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets. And we love the family. Vance has grown into the office of Vice President. He is articulate, smart, knowledgeable and well-informed, intellectually agile, and able to marshal facts and evidence in support of the broader argument. He can respond with passion without losing his cool. A man of both gravitas and charm. Little wonder that he seems to have been given a national and international role of unique visibility and impact in the history of the office in my lifetime. The annual Munich Security Conference brings together the world’s top politicians, statesmen, generals, and corporate leaders to discuss the weighty issues currently on their mind. In a fiery address on 14 February that referenced Soviet-era language of misinformation and disinformation by the bad guys who censored dissidents, cancelled elections, and closed churches, Vance criticised Europeans for abandoning their roots as ‘defenders of democracy.’ He framed his attack along two axes, the retrenchment of free speech and the loss of border controls and national identity with mass immigration. The first is especially dear to my heart. Vance began by saying that the threat to Europe that most concerns him is not from Russia, China, or any external power but ‘the threat from within.’ The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values that are also American values. Romania’s elections annulled because EU commissioners didn’t like the outcome and warned the same could happen in Germany. Warning that ‘You can’t force people what to think, what to feel, or what to believe,’ he cited examples from across Europe of police action for online anti-feminist comments, judges saying that free speech doesn’t give people a ‘free pass’ to say things that offend a particular group with strongly held beliefs, the arrest, conviction, and fining of a man for praying silently 50 metres from an abortion clinic, and, most egregious of all, the Scottish government warning people that private prayers inside their own homes within ‘safe access zones’ could break the law. The next day, theTelegraph revealed that almost 300 people have been charged with online speech crimes under Britain’s controversial Online Safety Act. More than just talk about democratic values, ‘We must live them.’ He criticised the ban on populist elected parliamentarians from participating in the conference. It’s critical to engage in dialogue with everyone who represents an important constituency and not construct firewalls to quarantine the political system from being infected by their ideological disease. This has happened with Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Nigel Farage in the UK, and, before her election as prime minister, even Giorgia Meloni in Italy. You cannot run ‘in fear of your own voters,’ afraid of their voices, opinions, and conscience, he lectured his audience. You cannot govern effectively without a democratic mandate when difficult choices have to be made on energy and supply chain security and ‘You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail.’ After criticising the organisers for excluding the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Vance met its co-leader Alice Weidel outside the conference. Mass immigration is possibly the most urgent policy issue confronting Western democracies. On the eve of the Munich conference, a 28-year-old Afghan who lost his asylum application drove a Mini Cooper into a trade union demonstration in Munich, killing a young mother and baby and injuring 28. He was already known to police, which is another common thread in the recent spate of asylum seeker-related attacks across Europe and the UK. Many populist parties are riding the wave of public support on the back of promises to bring ‘an end to out of control migration.’ In a democracy, ‘the people have a voice’ and ‘leaders have a choice.’ Far from protecting democracy, ignoring people, ‘dismissing their concerns,…shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process …is the most surefire way to destroy democracy.’ I wonder how the Albanese government now feels about Australia’s recently toughened hate speech law? And the supposedly centre-right Coalition parties that voted with Labor to enact it? It was a courageous speech in front of an expectedly hostile audience that by the end was barely registering a smattering of strained applause. Chancellor Olaf Scholz responded at the conference that Vance’s interference in Germany’s election was unacceptable. It’s worth repeating that Vance was born into the very types of circumstances and conditions that liberal leaders profess to be most concerned about. He delivered many telling home truths on the need for states to serve the people as active participants in the political process. Far too many countries have morphed into hollowed-out zones of discontentment run by career politicians, technocrats, and oligarchs. Instead of a distant, technocratic, and coercive behemoth feared by the people, institutions must once again become responsive to citizen aspirations and apprehensions and work with them to achieve economic stability and restore cultural identity and national sovereignty. One can quibble with particular phrases and debate the details. It’s the broad thrust of Vance’s two-pronged argument that I found attractive. ‘Free speech, I fear, is in retreat,’ said Vance. He called EU commissioners ‘Commissars’ and warned that ‘in Britain and across Europe, free speech is in retreat.’ Heady stuff! It was a brutal public dressing down of European liberal smugness ever from a visiting American dignitary. Progressive leaders habitually scold others. They are not used to being at the receiving end of a tongue-lashing. Because the EU is a geopolitical lightweight, we cannot call it an example of speaking truth to power. Instead, we could describe it as an instance of power speaking truth to an audience courting irrelevance.

India’s Dalit Women: Silent Battles Against Sexual And Caste Abus...	The relationship between sexual violence and caste in India exposes ingrained social injustices that have persisted for decades despite the country's independence. Even though equality before the law is guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, people from marginalised communities—especially Dalits—often experience a very different reality. In India, caste has a significant influence on sexual violence and is not just a problem for one gender. The victim's caste often dictates the reaction of the legal system, public indignation, and media coverage. This piece examines the widespread problem of rape in India, emphasising the particular difficulties faced by Dalit women and how caste affects justice. India's caste system, though legally abolished, continues to govern social, economic, and political life. Caste determines one's status and opportunities. The caste system dictates an individual's standing and prospects, and Dalit women frequently experience dual oppression as members of a marginalised caste and as women. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) states that a crime against Dalits is committed every fifteen minutes and that six Dalit women are raped every day. In spite of these concerning figures, Dalit victims frequently do not garner the same level of attention or condemnation as women from higher castes, highlighting the systematic discrimination that exists in Indian society. There was a lot of public outrage, quick political responses, and media coverage of the upper-caste victim in the Bengal case. In contrast, the Bihar incident, in which a Dalit girl was the victim, received little attention from the media and generated little political or public outcry. The dearth of response in the Bihar case was partly caused by the victim's caste, underscoring the institutionalised prejudice in the way these cases are managed. There has long been a pattern of caste-based inequality in rape cases. A prime example of this inequality is the 2020 Hathras case, in which a young Dalit woman was brutally raped and killed. Government agents swiftly suppressed those pursuing justice, destroyed evidence, and dropped the case. The 2012 Nirbhaya case, on the other hand, involving a victim from the upper caste, caused a great deal of outrage, important legal changes, and even a special session of the Supreme Court. While the Nirbhaya case became emblematic of India's struggle against sexual violence, it also exposed the partiality of public and judicial support. Although frequently biased, the media plays a critical role in influencing public opinion and the administration of justice. Storylines about victims from the upper caste are more likely to be sensationalised and to be reported nonstop, but Dalit victims' cases are often disregarded, with the media emphasising the 'criminality' of the community rather than the suffering of the victims. Because of the selective reporting, Dalit voices are marginalised, and caste-based discrimination is perpetuated, allowing offenders to go unpunished. The way the Indian judiciary and law enforcement operate is also influenced by caste dynamics. Crimes against Dalit women frequently result in intimidation of the victims' families, delays in the investigation, and refusals to file First Information Reports (FIRs). However, when it comes to victims who are from higher castes, the authorities tend to move quickly and decisively. These obstacles in the court system for Dalit victims are glaringly evident in the Hathras case, where authorities keep protecting the offenders ahead of serving justice.Socio-economic factors make Dalit women especially susceptible to sexual violence. Dalit women frequently work in low-paying, unofficial jobs with little access to legal, medical, or educational resources. Since they lack the social and financial resources to defend themselves, their economic marginalisation makes them easy pickings for sexual assault. Due to the combination of economic disparity and caste, Dalit women are primarily dependent on upper-class employers or landlords who can take advantage of their weaknesses without worrying about the consequences. Although there is a strong legal framework in place to prevent sexual violence, caste prejudice frequently makes it difficult for these laws to be implemented. Law enforcement usually uses the Prevention of Atrocities Act insufficiently or ignores it, which reflects ingrained prejudices and the intention of shielding Dalits and Adivasis from caste-based violence. Victims of dominant caste abuse frequently have few choices because of the perpetrators' frequent use of social and political influence to evade justice. The social stigma attributed to Dalit women's gender and caste exacerbates the psychological effects of sexual violence against them. Knowing that they are more likely to be victims of violence and not get justice because of their caste exacerbates the trauma of rape. The widespread sense of helplessness and terror that accompanies this perception of Dalit women as second-class citizens contributes to long-term mental health problems, such as elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Dalit women and activists persist in resisting and fighting for justice in the face of these overwhelming obstacles. Dalit women's rights and legislative and policy changes have been spearheaded by groups such as the National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) and the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM). These organisations empower Dalit women by battling systematic discrimination, spreading awareness, and offering legal support. The community's tenacity and resolve to end caste-based oppression are demonstrated by the increasing visibility of Dalit voices in the campaign against sexual assault.

Bureaucrats Tossing Gold Bars Off The Titanic – OpEd	During its last four months in power, the Biden-Harris administration opened the U.S. government’s money spigots as wide as they could. Appointed officials and bureaucrats across the federal government frantically spent money at a rate never before seen outside of pandemics and wars. But there was no national emergency in these months. A very different motive drove their frantic spending. For the outgoing officials and the bureaucrats who supported them, it was their 'insurance policy' against losing power in Washington, D.C. That claim was made by a member of the Biden-Harris administration who served as a special adviser to the Environmental Protection Agency. It was captured in a undercover investigation by Project Veritas and reported nearly a month after former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election. After the report, the Biden-Harris EPA spokesman denied any wrongdoing. In the weeks and months that followed, the allegation was not confirmed. It seemed the story was at a dead end. Evidence Emerges of a Wild Spending Spree That changed on February 12, 2024. The new EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, confirmed in a video announcement that the EPA rushed large amounts of cash out the door in the Biden-Harris administration’s waning days. Here’s a transcript of the portion of the video directly addressing the allegation: One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse. An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic', rushing to get billions of your tax out the door before Inauguration Day. The 'gold bars' were tax dollars and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden Administration knew they were wasting it. Following this revelation, during my meetings with members of Congress, I made a very important commitment to them and to the American people, which I reiterated at my confirmation hearing that if confirmed, I would immediately get a full accounting. Fortunately, my awesome team at EPA has found the gold bars. Shockingly, roughly 20 billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. Even further, this pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency. Just under $7 billion was sent to one entity called the Climate United Fund. I’m sure you and I now have some of the same questions. How do these organizations decide how to allocate funding? How much money have they given out so far and to whom? Are there any former Biden EPA staff offers who are now working at these entities? Let me make one thing abundantly clear. At this point there is zero reason to suspect any wrongdoing by the bank. Here’s my position as EPA administrator. The financial agent agreement with the bank needs to be instantly terminated and the bank must immediately return all of the gold bars that the Biden Administration tossed off the Titanic. EPA needs to reassume responsibility for all of these funds. We will review every penny that has gone out the door. I will be referring this matter to the Inspector General’s office and will work with the Justice Department as well. The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over. The American public deserves a more transparent and accountable government than what transpired these past four years. We take our obligations under the law as seriously as it gets. I’ve directed my team to find your gold bars and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps. To get so much money out the door so quickly, Biden-Harris EPA officials circumvented safeguards intended to prevent government officials from wasting taxpayer money. They were indeed'throwing gold bars' off their 'sinking Titanic.' Their actions to short-cut these spending controls gave them away. Potential Criminal Dimensions In addition to circumventing the EPA’s accounting controls, the officials and bureaucrats may alsohave tripped over other laws restricting government employees from exploiting their positions for personal gain. For example, if any officials improperly moved taxpayer funds to groups where they later got jobs after leaving public service, that feather-nesting could represent a kind of embezzlement or racketeering. The Justice Department will very likely investigate that potential. I suppose the most amazing part about the story is the original claim made by the Biden-Harris special adviser to the EPA. Their brazenness following their election loss suggests they didn’t think they would ever face any consequences for their actions. It’s a remarkable dimension in the annals of bureaucrats behaving badly.

Trump ‘Very Frustrated’ With Zelenskyy, US National Security Advi...	By Merhat Sharipzhan and Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- The White House national security adviser said that U.S. President Donald Trump is 'obviously very frustrated' with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and urged the Ukrainian president to reach an agreement soon granting the United States access to Ukraine's critical minerals. The remarks from Michael Waltz came after Zelenskyy and Trump traded sharp criticism in recent days, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and suggesting he started the war with Russia -- comments that caused concern in Ukraine and Europe and prompted pushback from some senior U.S. Republican lawmakers. A day earlier, Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would reportedly hand the United States $500 billion in mineral wealth, including rare-earth elements, as a form of payment for U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion, which enters its fourth year next week. 'He needs to come back to the table,' Waltz said at a press conference at the White House on February 20. Zelenskyy has pointed out that U.S. wartime aid so far was far less than that amount and that the U.S. proposal did not offer concrete security guarantees. Trump's harshest criticism to date of Zelenskyy came after Zelenskyy charged that Trump was pushing 'a lot of information that is coming from Russia' and that the United States was helping Russia 'break out of years of isolation' by holding high-level talks in Riyadh on February 18 and moving toward normalizing relations. The bilateral U.S.-Russia talks, on the war in Ukraine and other issues, stoked worried in Ukraine and among some of its backers that Kyiv could be sidelined from negotiations and pressured to accept a cease-fire or peace deal that would favor Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron said he will travel to Washington, where he will urge Trump to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and try to convince him that the interests of the United States and Europe are in line with one another. 'I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of [Putin],' Macron said. The White House said that Trump will host Macron on February 24 and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on February 27. Zelenskyy struck a conciliatory tone following what he called a 'productive meeting' on February 20 with Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, who is on his first visit to Ukraine. The pair had 'a good discussion, [covering] many important details,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. 'I am grateful to the United States for all the assistance and bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.' 'Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the President of the United States,' he wrote, adding, 'Strong Ukraine-U.S. relations benefit the entire world.' However, a joint press conference by Zelenskyy and Kellogg was canceled, and there was no immediate comment from Kellogg after the meeting. Meanwhile, several senior U.S. Republican lawmakers have been pushing back against Trump's recent criticism of Zelenskyy. They worry that signaling a willingness to cut off support for Kyiv could embolden Putin. Trump's framing of Zelenskyy in negative terms stands in stark contrast to those Senate Republicans who view Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression. They voiced strong support for Ukraine on February 19 and warned against appeasing Moscow. Senator John Kennedy (Republican-Louisiana) did not mince words when addressing the threat posed by Putin, describing him as 'a gangster with a black heart...who makes Jeffrey Dahmer (a notorious serial killer) look like Mother Teresa.' 'It is Vladimir Putin who started the war.' Kennedy said. 'I also believe through bitter experience that Vladimir Putin is a gangster…. He has Stalin's taste for blood.' Senator Roger Wicker (Republican-Mississippi) echoed Kennedy's concerns, saying that talks to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be held with Ukrainians being involved while also taking account of European interests. 'Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed,' he said. At least seven people were killed and 30 injured over the past 24 hours due to Russian attacks, regional military officials said on February 20. Targets included residential areas, social infrastructure, and essential services. Children were among the injured. After Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' the head of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, said in an interview with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, that talk of elections in Ukraine only benefits Russia. 'This issue is being raised in order to undermine the legitimacy of the government in Ukraine, to weaken confidence in the government, to weaken support for Ukraine from international partners,' he said. Trump also wrote that 'we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.' He added that Zelenskyy 'better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Trump’s remarks came after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian 'disinformation bubble' and said he would like Trump’s team to be 'more truthful.' Senator Thom Tillis (Republican-North Carolina) disagreed with Trump's characterization of Zelenskyy as a 'dictator,' although he avoided directly criticizing Trump. 'It's not a word I would use,' he said, adding that there is 'no moral equivalency between Vladimir Putin and President Zelenskyy.' 'Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,' Tillis told reporters in Washington on February 19. 'His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war.' Senate Majority Leader John Thune (Republican-North Dakota) also declined to criticize Trump for his remarks. 'The president speaks for himself,' he told reporters. 'I think what I'm in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine… And I think right now, the administration, the president and his team are working to achieve that.' Although Zelenskyy's presidential mandate was due to expire in May 2024, the constitution bars elections under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion and has repeatedly extended.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj4TrlJ8myQaM	2025-02-20T16:34:24-08:00	
Afripol Announces 37 Arrests In East African Terrorism Sweep	In a sweeping operation that covered multiple East African countries, Afripol recently announced the arrest of 37 terrorism suspects and the destruction of weapons, including a missile and antitank armaments. The operation in November and December 2024 netted members of the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Shabaab, along with other foreign fighters. Working with Interpol, Afripol authorities made arrests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania. In the DRC, police arrested four alleged members of the Allied Democratic Forces and two associates. They also captured and destroyed a missile and antitank device abandoned by terrorists. In Kenya, authorities arrested 17 people, including two suspected IS members, several foreign fighters, and more people involved in terrorism financing, radicalization and propaganda. In Somalia, authorities arrested three people, including a suspected bombmaker for an intelligence unit of al-Shabaab, who had been planting improvised explosive devices to target law enforcement officers and Soldiers. Another suspect was an al-Shabaab operative believed to have attacked several police checkpoints with hand grenades. In Tanzania, police arrested an alleged member of IS-Mozambique and a Ugandan national who tried to join a terrorist group in Mozambique. In addition to the countries where arrests were made, Afripol worked with law enforcement authorities in Djibouti, Mozambique, South Africa and Uganda to capture the terrorism suspects. The arrests were part of a five-day border security operation that used Interpol databases to search for people suspected of major crimes, including fraud, money laundering and robbery. Jalel Chelba, acting executive director of Afripol, praised the international cooperation that enabled African law enforcement to take terrorists and organized crime operators off the streets. 'Tackling terrorism and organized crime demands a unified and forward-thinking strategy that addresses both immediate risks and the deeper vulnerabilities that enable them,' Chelba said in a statement. 'This operation highlights the critical role of international cooperation and the exchange of intelligence in disrupting criminal networks and curbing their reach.' Authorities said East Africa’s porous borders, political instability and economic challenges create a favorable environment for terrorism. 'These positive results demonstrate the power of international collaboration in the fight against terrorism,' Cyril Gout, Interpol’s acting executive director of police services, said in a statement. The East African counterterrorism operation came after a separate joint Afripol-Interpol investigation in September and October 2024 that resulted in the arrests of more than 1,000 people suspected of cybercrimes across 19 Sub-Saharan countries. Operation Serengeti broke up more than 134,000 scam operations that had stolen more than $193 million from victims worldwide. About the same time as Operation Serengeti, Afripol and Interpol worked with 12 Nigerian law enforcement agencies in Operation Eagles’ Nest to arrest 36 people involved in cybercrime and seized $3 million in illegal drugs, ammunition and vehicles. The Nigerian operation focused on several types of online scams, including: 'Romance baiting,' in which scammers cultivate online relationships to manipulate victims into investing or giving them money. Investment and cryptocurrency scams, in which scammers lure victims through fictitious financial schemes. Celebrity scams, in which scammers impersonate famous figures to steal money from fans. 'This landmark initiative in Nigeria not only strengthens national capacities but also exemplifies the collective resolve of African member states to combat evolving criminal threats,' Chelba said in a statement about the arrests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj1Hj-pCc6okS	2025-02-20T16:30:20-08:00	
After Assad: A New Dynamic – Iran, The Gulf Monarchies And Erdoğa...	The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria and the resurgence of Turkey as a regional 'player' offers a new dynamic in the Middle East — and not just for raw power but for political leadership of the Sunni Muslim umma. New alliances and a rapidly changing dynamic are remaking decades old geopolitics, which up to today had seemed intractable to Middle East observers. The resulting instability, grounded in religious strife and political division, has (since Sykes-Picot first drew the 'lines in the sand' and oil was first discovered at the turn of the 20th century) fostered conflicts throughout the region. Today, that seemingly endless struggle for power is being supplanted by a new and different type of strife. The multi-party tug of war illustrates the distorted reasoning behind Middle East power politics, as regional players adapt to altered perceptions of strength and weakness, friend and foe. Persia's ancient land of Parthia (today's Iran) is reassessing the region’s politics and its position in it. The mullahs understand that the escalating influence driven by Ankara’s ambitions is towards its creation of a caliphate – a new Ottoman Empire. As a foil against Turkey’s designs for greater influence, Tehran is making overtures towards better relations with the Arab League in general and the Gulf monarchies in particular. The status quo in the Middle East was disrupted with the fall of the Assad regime. Syria’s geographic location under the latter functioned as the means through which Tehran’s influence – especially the flow of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza was accomplished. With the collapse of Assad, Syria was left destabilized, leaving a void which Ankara seeks to fill. From incursions into northern Syria and encroachment in Libya and Somalia, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has sought to position Turkey as a strategic force in the region with which to reckon. Ankara has begun to initiate a more assertive foreign policy in the region – military, economic and sectarian initiatives are now employed to increase and even solidify its political footprint. Erdoğan’s rhetoric about Turkey as a 21st century Sunni (Ottoman) caliphate harkens back to Ankara's past of imperial designs. While it is disconcerting to his neighbors in the region, it strikes a chord of empathy within various corridors of domestic politics. Ankara’s ascendency, however, is not just about political influence; rather, it has revamped the struggle for leadership within the Sunni Muslim umma. Riyadh and its regional Gulf allies have historically exerted this authority – they view themselves as the caretakers of Islam’s most sacred sites and formidable economics. Turkey now imperils that leadership; it supports political Islam and regional actors such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Gulf states view as a threat to their regimes. This sectarian competition within Sunni Islam has furthered the geopolitical divide, as Gulf states now consider Ankara more than a rival; it has become a destabilizing force within the region. The competition between the 7 Gulf states and Ankara can be felt throughout various sectors in Africa. Libya is a perfect example of this rivalry in North Africa. Turkey provides military assistance and political cover to the Government of National Accord (Tripoli), while the UAE and Egypt support the forces of Khalifa Haftar (Benghazi). In Somalia (the easternmost country in continental Africa) which Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi consider critical to their own security interests, Ankara’s presence and influence continues to evolve concern from them. The cautious relationship between Ankara and the Gulf monarchs is evident through Turkey's previous (2017) rapid intervention in support of Qatar during the Gulf states sanctions on the latter. Over the last decade, Tehran’s attempts to have its political power respected in the region has put it at cross purposes (politically and militarily) with the Gulf states. Today, Iran is reassessing how it will pursue regional power to check Ankara's moves while mollifying the monarchs. It is cautiously reevaluating its way forward. It seems that Iran realizes the value of 'Realpolitik' (pragmatism) as it works its way through the political and sectarian minefields ever present when navigating between the Gulf states and Ankara. Pivotal to these efforts is the recent detente between Iran and Riyadh, revealing Tehran’s desire to mitigate tensions with its Gulf neighbors. Such actions between the two adversaries demonstrate their mutual concern with Ankara’s regional ambitions. Turkey’s more aggressive behavior in Syria and Libya could even precipitate the Gulf monarchies to seek 'arrangements' with Israel (like the Abraham Accords) or the US – especially now that a cease-fire with Gaza has occurred and Trump is in the White House. Relationships with Europe have proven, historically, to be of little value to regional stability. The Gulf states will attempt to balance the increasing concerns posed by Turkey while being vigilant against the problems of their historical nemesis, Iran. In particular they must strengthen political and military alliances if they are to maintain their relative positions within the region vis-a-vis Erdoğan’s ambitions. The U.S., for its part, appears to be pivoting towards Southeast Asia – the Pacific Rim. This creates an opportunity in the Middle East for regional powers like Turkey to magnify its role. At the same time, China and Russia are carefully insinuating themselves into this new regional hierarchy. Russia’s relationship with Iran and Turkey, while pragmatic, could encounter headwinds if their interests clash in the yet to be determined politics of Syria. China is strengthening relationships with both Iran and the Gulf states; it hopes to obtain much needed energy flows and expand its relatively 'no-strings-attached' infrastructure-development approach to its politics. As the dynamics between Iran, Turkey and the Gulf develop, one question presents itself: Will 'Realpolitik' prevail through innovative diplomatic discourse or will history (again) repeat itself – promises broken, alliances breached with renewed mistrust leading, inevitably, to further military interventions – and another status quo of instability?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj1nDZfY58bKN	2025-02-20T16:21:45-08:00	
Foreign Direct Investment Increased To A Record $41 Trillion – Op...	Global foreign direct investment grew again in 2023 after declining the previous year. Inward direct investment climbed $1.75 trillion, or 4.4 percent, reaching a record $41 trillion, according to the IMF’s latest Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, which provides detailed information on direct investment positions between countries. FDI rose in most regions, with Central and South Asia, Europe, and North and Central America contributing most. Direct investment between advanced economies grew by $880 billion, or 3.6 percent, while those from advanced economies to emerging market and developing economies rose by $538 billion, or 7.6 percent. As our Chart of the Week shows, the United States extended its lead as the top destination for direct investment. Singapore recorded the largest gain in 2023, with its position rising $307 billion, followed by $227 billion for the United States and $164 billion for Germany. Meanwhile, the Netherlands and Luxembourg posted the steepest declines but remained in the top five, alongside the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Strong growth was also seen in many emerging economies. Most notably, India, Mexico, and Brazil each saw their inward direct investment positions rise by around $130 billion or about 20 percent, marking the largest increase for these three economies in total since the survey began in 2009.

Russia-US Meeting In Riyadh More Than An Icebreaker – OpEd	By Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg The meeting held in Riyadh on Tuesday has turned out to be more than an icebreaker. It was already significant as the first high-level meeting between Russia and the US since January 2022, when former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Geneva, a few weeks before the war broke out, but they failed to avert it. By contrast the outcomes of the Riyadh meeting went beyond expectations. It took place in the offices of Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry and lasted more than four hours. The fact that it was held in the Kingdom showcases the country’s diplomatic credentials and its efforts to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine. In a statement issued earlier this month, Saudi Arabia recalled that those efforts began at the start of the Ukraine crisis. This was when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called both President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 3, 2022, to offer the Kingdom’s good offices to reach a political solution. After the Riyadh meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Kingdom was playing an 'indispensable role' by bringing the parties together, expressing hope that it would continue this effort. At the Tuesday meeting, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan facilitated the talks together with National Security Advisor Dr. Musaad Al-Aiban, the seasoned minister who is described as the man for difficult missions. On the US side there was also a high-powered team led by Rubio, a former senator, on his first trip to Saudi Arabia. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who is also a former lawmaker from Florida, was on the team. Probably the closest to President Donald Trump was his Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, a real estate magnate known for successful dealmaking. Outside of family, there is no one more trusted by Trump as Witkoff, CNN has reported. He was instrumental in getting the Israel-Hamas deal done even before Trump took office and his remit has now expanded to the Russia-Ukraine war. Lavrov, the veteran diplomat since the days of the USSR, led the Russian side, together with Kirill Dmitriev, who was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, studied at Harvard Business School, and began his career with stints at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company. He has managed large private equity funds and completed a series of landmark transactions for Russia. He now heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund and is a confidante of Putin. Following the meeting, Rubio said they agreed on four points. Firstly, to re-establish the 'functionality of our respective missions in Washington and in Moscow,' to facilitate progress. Secondly, the appointment of a high-level team to help negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine 'in a way that’s enduring and acceptable to all the parties engaged.' Thirdly, to begin to discuss both the geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine. Fourthly, they agreed to remain engaged at the same high level to 'make sure that it’s moving along in a productive way,' Rubio said. Waltz stressed the need for a permanent and quick end to the war, which has 'turned into a meat grinder of people on both sides,' revealing that as a 'practical reality,' there was going to be some discussion of territory, not ruling out possible concessions. Rubio indicated there would be sanctions relief. Witkoff described the talks as 'positive, upbeat, constructive … solution-based.' He added: 'We couldn’t have imagined a better result after this session. It was very, very solid.' The Riyadh meeting came just a week after Trump spoke to Putin telephonically. And Lavrov said after the talks the sides agreed to fast-track the appointment of new ambassadors and 'lifting artificial barriers to the work of the US and Russian embassies and other missions.' The two sides agreed to set up high-level working groups to begin exploring a negotiated end to the conflict. It was not immediately clear when these teams would first meet, but both said it would be soon. For the main objective of this effort — ending the war — a high-level team from the two countries will begin to engage with the Russian side on 'parameters of what an end to this conflict would look like.' On the idea of a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, Lavrov said Moscow would not accept any troops from NATO members, stressing that Ukraine’s bid to join the alliance was a major security issue. Lavrov said: 'We explained that the deployment of troops from the countries that are NATO members, even if they are deployed under the EU or national flags, will not change anything and will certainly be unacceptable for us.' But he seemed to imply the possibility of a UN force. The presence of Witkoff and Dmitriev at the Riyadh talks is indicative of the two sides’ ambition to move from the current crisis to a close economic relationship. Dmitriev told reporters that Russia and the US should develop joint energy and other ventures, including in the Arctic and other regions. And Rubio said that once the Ukraine conflict was brought to an end, it could open 'incredible opportunities' to partner with Russia 'on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.' Realistically, there could be difficult hurdles before these ambitious ideas materialize. First, the US needs to persuade Zelensky and its NATO and EU allies of the value of its diplomatic approach to the crisis. Aware of this need, Rubio said: 'There’s going to be engagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe, and others. He did not specify dates but remarked that Trump was 'not patient in terms of getting action. 'He drives. He drives hard. He wants to get things done. He’s been wanting to do this, and he’s moving very quickly.' - Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg is the GCC assistant secretary-general for political affairs and negotiation.

Eight Ways Trump Can Tank The Economy – OpEd	President Biden handed off the best economy to an incoming president since at least the 2001 handoff from Clinton to Bush II. In his last quarter in office, GDP grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate (final demand, which excludes inventory fluctuations, grew at a 3.2 percent rate). That brought the average growth rate for Biden’s presidency to 3.2 percent, the highest since Clinton’s second term. The unemployment rate fell to 4.0 percent in January, keeping it in the narrow band between 4.0 percent and 4.3 percent it has been in since last May. For Biden’s whole term the unemployment rate averaged 4.1 percent, the lowest since Johnson’s last term, more than half a century ago. Inflation is still slightly above the Fed’s 2.0 percent target, but it shows no clear trend. It’s worth noting in this respect that below 2.0 percent inflation rates were largely a post-Great Recession story. Prior to the Great Recession, inflation generally ran somewhat about 2.0 percent. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, was 3.4 percent in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration. In addition, productivity growth has been unexpectedly fast, running at close to a 2.0 percent rate in the last year. And these productivity gains are being passed on in rising real wages, with workers across the wage ladder getting their share of productivity growth. This translates into an extraordinarily good economic picture, but we know that Donald Trump has big plans for the economy. Given his bold pronouncements coming daily, or even hourly, he has many possible routes for ending the boom we have been seeing. Here are my eight favorite economy wreckers, in no particular order: 1.) Stock market crash, 2.) Mass deportation, 3.) Tariffs run wild, 4.) Pandemic wipe out, 5.) Global warming disasters, 6.) Splurge of spending cuts, 7.) Debt limit crisis, 8.) Messing with economic data. It is not entirely accurate for me to say there is no order. I do think a stock market crash is by far the likeliest way that the economy gets derailed. I should also say that a crash would not necessarily be Trump’s fault. If we have a bubble, as I strongly suspect, then it is likely something will burst it, even if we had competent people setting economic policy. However, after the prospect of a stock crash, my views on the likelihood of the other dangers changes by the hour, or even the minute, as some new craziness spews out of Donald Trump or Elon Musk’s mouth or social media feed. Rather than making an arbitrary, as of this minute, ordering, I’m just going to say that the other seven are equally likely. I’ll quickly go through each in turn. Stock Market Crash The story here is straightforward. The price-to-earnings ratios in the stock market are near their 1990s bubble peak, even as most projections are that real profits will grow slowly over the next decade. This implies that either the profit projections are grossly understated, that price-to-earnings ratio will go even higher, people are willing to invest in stocks for returns only slightly higher than what they can get from bonds, or the market is likely to crash. I’m inclined to think that the crash is the most plausible scenario, but I could be wrong. It is worth correcting an important error on this one. Clearly the highest PEs can be found on AI-related tech states, but the market as a whole is likely over-valued, even if it might be by a smaller amount. If we go back to the 1990s, people often referred to the soaring stock market as a tech bubble. The tech stocks were the ones that took the largest hits when the market did crash, but even the stock of companies like GM and McDonalds lost close to half its value. So, the bubble was much more broadly based than just the tech companies. I would speculate that there is a similar story today. The AI companies might well take the biggest hit in a stock market crash, but a much wider set of companies is likely to be affected. (For an especially pessimistic assessment of the prospects for AI and the tech companies listen to this On the Media segment.) A plunge in the stock market will have two effects. First, it can destroy tens of trillions of dollars of wealth. People who thought they had plenty of money in their 401(k)s for retirement suddenly find out otherwise. This is likely to lead to major cutbacks in spending, especially for those who are near retirement or have recently retired. The other effect is likely to be a hit to investment. The companies that are now throwing money indiscriminately at everything related to AI will suddenly be more careful to only spend in areas where they can reasonably expect to see a payback in the not-too-distant future. It is also worth correcting a common misunderstanding about the stock crash recession in 2001. From a GDP standpoint this looks like a very short and mild recession. We did not even see the traditional two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. However, we get an opposite picture from a labor market perspective. Employment peaked before the recession in February of 2021. We didn’t get back to this same level of employment for four full years. At the time, this was the longest period without job growth since the Great Depression. It is wrong to think of this as a short and mild recession. Mass Deportation Sends Prices Soaring The biggest uncertainty with mass deportation is whether we will actually see it. While the call for mass deportation was central to Trump’s campaign, the reality of recent immigration bears almost no resemblance to the tales of drug dealers, rapists, and murderers overrunning our borders, and many people around Trump know this. The simple fact is that the overwhelming majority of recent immigrants came here to work. They take physically demanding low-paying jobs that few native-born workers would want. If a large share of them were rounded up and thrown out of the country, we would see massive labor shortages in large sectors of the economy. This would be most apparent in agriculture, where estimates put the share of undocumented workers as high as 45 percent. However, a large share of workers in food processing, construction, and a number of other industries are undocumented. If we see mass deportations, it is a safe bet food prices will rise considerably, and construction will slow. This will mean a boost to inflation and a reduction in people’s purchasing power. If the Fed responds to higher inflation by raising rates, this will further weaken the housing sector and slow demand through other channels. It’s worth noting that even a Trump controlled Fed may not be able to keep long-term rates from rising, unless it is prepared to engage in highly unorthodox monetary policy. The end story here is that we get a recession. This again could be a long one, depending on how many people get deported, as the economy eventually adjusts to having a considerably smaller workforce. Tariffs Flow Like Water Donald Trump seems to really like tariffs and also have no idea what they are. As much as Trump likes to talk about imposing tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico or whatever other villain of the moment appears in his sights, he actually is imposing a tax on us, on the goods we import from these countries. We pay the tariff, not the bad actor in Trump’s tough guy warnings. Higher import taxes raise the price of imports in the same way that a tax on barrels of oil leads to higher gas prices at the pump. Depending on how many goods get subject to the tax, and the actual tax rate, we could end up paying out a lot of money to cover the cost of Trump’s tariffs. As a simple approximation, our goods imports come to roughly $4 trillion a year or 13 percent of GDP. If we imposed an import tax of 20 percent, we would be paying $800 billion a year ($6,000 a family) as a result of the tariffs. (This assumes no reduction in imports, which clearly would not be the case.) As with mass deportations, this would directly push inflation higher, in addition to pulling money out of our pockets. If the Fed raised rates in response, we again would face a serious risk of recession. Here also we get very mixed signals from the administration. He threatened 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but then walked the threat back before the tariffs actually took effect. However, he did go through with 20 percent tariffs on aluminum and steel. There are clearly people in the administration who know that major tariff hikes will be bad news for the economy, and even more immediately the stock market. It would take someone with more inside knowledge than me to know whether a tariff hungry Trump or a more reasonable advisor is likely to determine policy. It is also worth noting that running economic policy like a TV game show does have a cost. Businesses like predictability when they look to make investment decisions. If they are trying to decide on expanding their capacity, it matters hugely whether items coming in from Canada and Mexico are mostly tariff free, or whether the U.S. is imposing large taxes. At the very least, the TV game show approach to economic policy is likely to delay some investments as businesses try to determine the ultimate course Trump will take. Pandemic II This one is totally speculative both since I have very little knowledge of epidemiology and also because the future course of prospective pandemics would be guesswork by anyone. There are a couple of things we can say. First, there are always various diseases being spread among domesticated animals as well as wildlife. For the most part, these diseases pose little risk to humans, but that can always change as a result of new mutations. This raises the second point, the Trump-Musk team have eviscerated our public health agencies so that they will be far less prepared to deal with any major threats to humans that might arise. (They have already delayed the circulation of a report on the spread of bird flu for no obvious reason.) The economic consequences of this tampering with the public health agencies is most likely to take the form of higher prices for eggs, meat, and chicken. This would also mean somewhat higher inflation, but probably not the sort of stuff that leads to big interest rate hikes and a recession. There is the risk that these viruses will spread to people, as has already been the case to a limited extent. This is bad news from a public health perspective, but not likely a major economic calamity unless a strain proves to be both highly contagious and also to pose a severe health risk. Based on my very limited knowledge, that seems unlikely, but the risk is surely higher with Elon Musk’s 'super-high IQ' DOGE boys calling the shots instead of people who actually understand the issues involved. Global Warming Disaster or LA Fire Sequel We have been seeing many more extreme climate events in recent years as a result of global warming. Trump has doubled down on a commitment to do everything he can to advance global warming as much as possible. He wants to eliminate all the Biden and Obama programs to promote EVs and clean energy, and to subsidize the use of fossil fuels. This is horrible from the standpoint of saving the planet, but fortunately Chinaand much of the rest of the world are moving aggressively to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the immediate issue from the standpoint of the economy is the damage to the environment that is already baked into the cards from past emissions. This should require us to take steps towards both mitigating potential damage and enhanced emergency preparation for the increasingly intense hurricanes, floods, and wildfires that we will see. This is not going to happen, both because of Trump’s determination to pretend global warming is not real, and also because he is firing most of the people competent to lead this effort. His efforts to punish people who didn’t vote for him are also likely to increase the economic damage from global warming. In terms of mitigation, we should be discouraging people from building in areas that are especially prone to damage from floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. There are some efforts at the state level to do this, but it’s a safe bet the Trump administration will not be encouraging it. Also, it is actively trying to destroy the agencies that gather the information that would facilitate this process. Private insurers actually would assist in this process, if regulators allow them. This is not out of benevolence, it’s simply due to the fact that they don’t want to insure a home that is likely to be destroyed in a wildfire or hurricane. However, state regulators often impose rules that block insurers from charging premiums that reflect true risk. Anyhow, Trump’s efforts are likely to make the human toll and property damage from future disasters considerable worse. This is especially likely to be the case when he decides that he knows best what to do and prevents competent people from conducting sound disaster management and relief efforts. The disasters themselves will be a hit to the economy but are unlikely to be recession-causing stuff. We could see tens or even hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed, businesses put out of operation for weeks, or even months, and hundreds of thousands of workers possibly without jobs. However, relief efforts actually provide a short-term boost to the economy, unless Trump refuses to do them to punish blue areas. The bigger hit is likely to be the longer-term response to disasters. Insurers are not in business to lose money. When they see enough disasters in an area, they will simply pull out of selling policies as many have done in Florida and California. If they see the risk as growing and/or decide they can’t gage the risk adequately because Trump has shut down good data sources, they are likely to pull out of more areas. If people can’t get insurance on a home, they won’t be able to sell it, since banks all require insurance to issue a mortgage. We could see the housing market shut down in large parts of the country. This can be a very serious blow to the economy and financial markets. I won’t try to etch out details here, but let’s just say it is serious bad news. Splurge of Spending Cuts I won’t spend much time on this one, just because I consider it highly unlikely. The point here is simply that Elon Musk and his team seem to have no idea of how the economy works. When he initially set off with his DOGE team he was boasting about finding $2 trillion to cut from the annual budget, as in not over ten years. This would be a bit less than one-third of the budget and close to 7.0 percent of GDP. If Musk actually did cut spending by 7.0 percent of GDP it would lead to a Great Recession type recession. Fortunately, this seems off the table for now, as Musk has learned a little bit about where government money actually goes. The Trump-Republican team still seem intent on big cuts, but these look to be roughly an order of magnitude smaller. And they are likely to come with tax cuts to rich people, whose spending will largely offset the economic (not the human) impact of cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Debt Limit Crisis This is one that would appear on almost everyone’s list. The story is that Democrats refuse to provide any votes to raise the debt ceiling, and the small number of Republicans who actually care about the debt block passage of the necessary legislation. This would mean that the government would be unable to borrow, and at least for a period of time unable to pay all its bills. This would clearly shake financial markets. Whether it leads to a full-fledged economic meltdown is more questionable and likely depends on how long the standoff lasts. This issue also involves even more speculation than usual since its not clear Trump feels bound by the rule of law, so his actions, even if not legal, could mitigate the impact. In any case, this is likely to lead to higher interest rates, as investors attach greater risk to holding U.S. debt. That is a needless cost to the economy, but we are most likely talking about tenths of a percentage point, not whole percentage points. Messing with Economic Data This is probably not on most people’s Trump crises lists but should be. The story here is that we have top quality statistical agencies, most notably the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), that provide us accurate data on a regular basis untainted by political interference. Both parts of this are hugely underappreciated. We often hear complaints about large revisions to the data (I’ve made them myself), but this is due to the complexity of trying to measure a $30 trillion economy with 340 million people. The data are never perfect, but these agencies do the best they can, based on their own research, and work done by academic economists and statisticians around the country and the world. This brings up the second and more important part, the people putting together the unemployment statistics, the Consumer Price Index, and other data that we depend on to know the state of the economy, are professionals who are committed to the integrity of the data. They do not lower the unemployment rate to make the president look better or make inflation go away by cooking the numbers. The MAGA crew, starting with Trump, often complained about the numbers being manipulated under Biden and Obama. This was utter nonsense. Unfortunately, it never got the push back from the media, or even the Democrats, that it should have. Comments from Trump or other prominent Republicans saying the data was manipulated should have been treated as being equivalent to declaring the Earth is flat, they are that crazy. Anyhow, as the MAGA crew will tell us, the President has the unquestioned authority to make the unemployment rate or inflation rate whatever he wants it to be. If Trump’s tariffs or his inept handling of the bird flu pandemic push the year- over-year inflation in March to 4.0 percent, he can just order BLS to report the inflation rate as 2.0 percent. The top people there will quit, or be fired, but Trump can force them to publish whatever inflation rate he wants. The same applies to our GDP numbers. If Trump’s policies of not paying out money owed and laying off tens of thousands of government workers and contractors, cause GDP to slump in the first quarter, he can just instruct BEA to report strong 3.5 percent growth. This may sell on Fox News and other right-wing media outfits, but it will be a disaster on financial markets and for the longer-term health of the economy. We should expect interest rates to soar and the stock market to plummet, since investors will decide that they no longer have any idea of the true state of the U.S. economy. Over the longer term, we will see both domestic companies scaling back investment plans and foreign companies looking elsewhere. The United States will have declared itself an untrustworthy nation, where rules mean nothing and can be changed for convenience. Hopefully, Trump, or the people around him, will have enough sense to keep him from undermining the statistical agencies, but at this point, we can not take that for granted. Recipes for Disaster Okay folks, those are my MAGA eight, come up with your own stories for how Trump can crash the economy. Also, I welcome people who know these issues better than I do expanding on or correcting what I wrote. Anyhow, looks like we might have some exciting times ahead of us.

Milestone For Wyoming Uranium Operation	Uranium Energy Corp's Irigaray Central Processing Plant has produced its first dried and drummed uranium concentrates since the resumption of in-situ recovery operations at the company's Christensen Ranch project. The Irigaray plant, in Wyoming, is the central hub to 11 satellite in-situ recovery (ISR) projects across the Powder River Basin. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) took ownership of the plant and the orebodies through its 2021 acquisition of Uranium One Americas Inc from Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom. In January 2024 the company's board of directors approved the restart of the Christensen Ranch ISR operation, with recovered uranium to be processed at Irigaray, and in September the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality gave UEC the go-ahead to increase the plant's licensed production capacity from its current 2.5 million pounds U3O8 (96.2 tU) to 4.0 million pounds U3O8 per year. According to information from the US Energy Information Administration, Irigaray had last produced uranium in 2018. UEC President and CEO Amir Adnani said the milestone had been reached on schedule, six months into the phased ramp-up of its operations in Wyoming (operations at Christensen Ranch started in August last year). 'This marks the culmination of many years of planning and hard work from our entire team and is a testament to their expertise and dedication. UEC’s fully permitted ISR assets provide a cost-efficient foundation for sustainable growth, positioning UEC as a key player in the expanding nuclear energy sector,' he said. ISR - also known as in-situ leach, or ISL - recovers minerals by dissolving them from the orebody in the ground and pumping the resulting solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered at a processing plant. UEC has two ISR hub and spoke platforms in South Texas and Wyoming, where a central processing plant forms the 'hub' with several ISR uranium projects providing 'spokes'. The uranium concentrates produced at Irigaray will be transported to the ConverDyn Conversion Facility in Metropolis, Illinois, UEC said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wjybF3yDhowdq	2025-02-20T16:04:29-08:00	
Burning Questions Over Indonesia’s Cooking Transition – Analysis	By Data Avicenna and Intan Permata Sari Indonesia’s shift to cleaner cooking fuels has seen notable success, particularly through the 2007 ‘Zero Kero Program’ which reduced domestic kerosene use by 92 per cent in less than ten years by transitioning households’ cooking fuel to Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). While the program’s primary goal was reducing kerosene subsidy costs, it also resulted in positive health impactsthrough reduced indoor air pollution. But today, Indonesia faces a new set of challenges. With an annual LPG consumption of approximately eight million tons and a domestic production capacity of only 1.7 million tons, Indonesia’s reliance on LPG imports has driven the government’s LPG subsidy spending to as high as Rp 80 trillion (US$4.9 billion) per year. As President Prabowo Subianto’s administration looks toward achieving energy self-sufficiency, the current dependence on imported LPG and subsidies’ strain on government finances raise pressing questions about Indonesia’s path forward. Indonesia has taken some steps to address the financial burden of LPG subsidies. The Indonesian government aims to reduce imports of LPG to zero by 2030, partly by promoting electric cooking appliances, including induction stoves, in 700,000 households. Yet the adoption rate is currently low — only 0.76 per cent of Indonesian households in 2021 used induction stoves. The challenges of electric stove pilot projects in Denpasar and Semarang in 2022 came from low household electrical capacities which were unsuitable for high-wattage stoves. The push for induction stoves poses a trade-off — though it may reduce the financial burden of imported LPG, the country still depends heavily on fossil fuels for electricity. Unless there is a massive deployment of renewable energy, this shift could increase greenhouse gas emissions. For induction stoves to be an environmentally sustainable option, acceleration in the renewable energy transition is the first step. About 14 per cent of the country’s energy mix comes from renewable sources, much less than the 23 per cent target set for 2025. Expanding the renewable energy grid would also align with Prabowo’s broader goal of achieving energy independence. With an expanded renewable energy grid, the government could reallocate the LPG subsidies towards incentivising households that are ready to transition to induction stoves, addressing the financial burden of LPG subsidies while simultaneously promoting sustainable energy practices. Induction stoves can also be incentivised by implementing purchasing restrictions on subsidised LPG to ensure that it only reaches its intended beneficiaries — low-income households. These restrictions, combined with targeted incentives, could accelerate the adoption of induction stoves. In 2024, the government imposed limitations so that only registered, eligible people could purchase the subsidised 3-kilogram LPG tanks. While the implementation initially appeared inadequate due to subsidised LPG still being accessible to all consumers, the subsidy is largely reaching its intended beneficiaries — most subsidised LPG consumers come from the poorest 70 per cent of households. Higher demand for induction stoves could also promote domestic production by encouraging new manufacturers to enter the market and enabling existing producers to reduce per unit production costs through larger-scale production. Indonesia’s domestic production of induction stoves remains limited with only two manufacturers available and an annual production capacity of 317,000 units in 2022. To address the low electrical capacities of many Indonesian households, a possible initiative is to promote domestic production of lower-wattage models of induction stoves that are less costly and more compatible with household capacities. But there are costs and barriers associated with low-wattage stoves, including research and development costs and cultural barriers. Since low-wattage could mean slower cooking, Chinese-Indonesian dishes that rely on high-heat wok cooking might not be suitable, while the opposite applies for slow-cooking dishes like the West Sumatran ‘rendang’. Providing incentives in the form of lower costs to upgrade households’ electrical capacities can also be implemented. But some lower- to middle-income households might be more reluctant to adopt induction stoves due to higher electricity costs unless they receive continuous incentives such as electricity discounts. Ensuring that households upgrading their electrical capacities also adopt induction stoves — possibly through enforcement mechanisms — should also be factored into policy decisions to maximise the effectiveness of such incentives. The economic feasibility of switching to induction stoves also depends largely on the payback period — how long it takes households to recover their initial investment through energy cost savings. This investment includes not just the stove itself, but also new cookware compatible with electric cooking. Understanding these costs is crucial for policy design. Indonesia’s transition to induction stoves requires more than policy reforms and infrastructure improvements. It demands a fundamental transformation of the country’s energy mix. With renewable energy making up only 14 per cent of the current mix, sustainable adoption appears unlikely in the near future. Success hinges on a coordinated approach — expanding the renewable energy grid first, then gradually implementing household transitions and addressing infrastructure gaps while protecting vulnerable households. Only then can Indonesia achieve energy independence without compromising environmental objectives or household welfare.

South Korea And US Hold First Joint Aerial Exercise Of 2nd Trump ...	By Mok Yong Jae South Korea and the United States on Thursday conducted the first joint aerial drills of the current Trump administration, completing a 'simulated precision strike,' according the U.S. Air Force. The South Korean Ministry of Defense said that South Korean F-35 and F-15 fighter jets joined U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers and F-16 fighters, all of which took off from locations within South Korea. Four U.S. Marine F-35s launched from Japan also joined the exercise, the Air Force said in a report published on its website. 'This training was conducted to demonstrate the extended deterrence capabilities of the United States against North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats and to strengthen the interoperability of the South Korea-U.S. combined forces,' a South Korean Defense Ministry official told Radio Free Asia. He said that together the two countries would cooperate to deter and respond to North Korean threats. The B-1B was also part of trilateral joint exercises with the U.S.-South Korea and Japan in December. 'Advanced training like today’s event ensures we’re able to maintain the high levels of readiness necessary for our combined defense posture,' Lt. Gen. David Iverson, the U.S. Seventh Air Force commander said in the Air Force report. 'Each time our aircrew plan, execute and debrief together, we build proficiency in our tactics, techniques and procedures to defend the Alliance, if required,' he said. South Korea and the United States have expanded military cooperation over the past few years in response to North Korean threats. Joint drills with South Korea and three way drills with Japan have recently included more advanced technology including submarines, long-range bombers, and aircraft carriers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj9HLR7dNQCii	2025-02-20T16:00:33-08:00	
Russia: St. Petersburg To Use CCTV Cameras On Streets To Identify...	In order to fight crime and prevent the emergence of ethnic enclaves, St. Peterburg plans to upgrade its CCTV cameras on its streets so that the authorities can identify passersby by ethnicity, Oleg Kapitanov, head of the nationalities committee in the city’s government, has announced. This kind of ethnic profiling is notoriously inaccurate, but other Russian cities are likely to follow St. Petersburg’s lead, yet another example of Russia’s moves toward totalitarian control of its people ( Moves toward such totalitarian methods of control are taking place at enormous speed in Putin’s Russia now. At the same time that the use of CCTV cameras to determine ethnicity was announced, the Russian government announced new requirements for doctors to share information about their patients. As of March 1, all Russian doctors will be required to share information with the police on patients with mental disorders who are deemed 'a threat to others' (publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202407220010?index=1). Activists say this order may soon be expanded to include data on other parts of patients’ lives (theins.ru/history/278606). In the last decades of Soviet power, for example, the state required doctors to share information about drug use, homosexuality, and other characteristics that the regime deemed improper. What Moscow is now demanding opens the door to the restoration of such requirements and a further restriction of doctor-patient confidentiality. That is likely to mean both that doctors will turn in the information the state wants and the state will take action against those so identified and that those in high risk groups will now avoid going to doctors and getting the treatment they need lest the doctors providing the treatment send information about them to state institutions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wjwg9aBW5zSbZ	2025-02-20T15:58:51-08:00	
Uzbekistan: Torturers’ Impunity ‘Is Mockery Not Justice’ – Analys...	By Mushfig Bayram Officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 repeatedly tortured Muslim prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov during 2023 and 2024, including threatening him with death. On one occasion, prison officer Davr Sottiyev severely beat Astanov and told him that before he leaves, 'he [Sottiyev] will give Astanov an injection which will soon kill him', a local Muslim who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. As a result of Sottiyev's severe physical torture, prisoner of conscience Astanov was placed in the prison medical unit. Prisoner of conscience Astanov, who is now 53, made multiple complaints about the torture he experienced to the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Ombudsperson. Against the regime's legally-binding human rights obligations, officials have taken no action against prison officer Sottiyev or other suspect torturers. The regime's only response was to send an alleged forensic medical 'expert' to examine Astanov and then claimed there were 'no traces of wounds or bruises'. The Muslim commented: 'This is mockery not justice' (see below). In January 2025, Prison Governor Farrukh Ismatov, head of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1, called relatives of prisoner of conscience Astanov. He claimed to them that Astanov is fine and that they have no need to complain to the authorities about his situation. The relatives understood that they were being threatened with punishment if they lodge complaints (see below). Various officials of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the regime-appointed Human Rights Commissioner or Ombudsperson's Office have refused to answer Forum 18's questions about the multiple cases of torture inflicted on prisoner of conscience Astanov (see below). The regime tries to stop its Muslim prisoners from praying the namaz, and frequently tortures those who do meet other Muslims for prayer. If prison authorities detect groups of Muslims praying together, they will put them in punishment cells for several days, Muslims who Forum 18 has talked to from October 2024 onwards have stated. Prison authorities may not detect or punish individual prisoners praying the namaz alone (see below). Officials are preparing to add a further prison term to that of 30-year-old prisoner of conscience Fariduddin Abduvokhidov. A Tashkent court jailed him in November 2020 along with six other prisoners of conscience for between 11 and four years. Their 'crime' was to meet in Tashkent to discuss Islam. On 5 December 2023, a court in Tashkent Region added 10 years to his existing 11 year prison term. His 'crime' was to be three minutes late for a prison roll call. In November 2024, Navoi Regional Police Criminal Investigation Department opened a new criminal case against him (see forthcoming F18News article). From summer 2024, the regime has apparently implemented a policy of putting Muslim prisoners of conscience in a punishment cell for several days each to prevent them being eligible for early conditional release, or to make it easier to transfer them to a harsher-regime prison. Prisoners of conscience Faryozbek Kobilov and Alimardon Sultonov are among those given such spells in a punishment cell. Officials then sent Sultonov to a harsher prison (see forthcoming F18News article). Repeated torture of prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov for praying In 2021, Tashkent City Criminal Court jailed prisoner of conscience Tulkun Tashmuradovich Astanov (born 25 April 1971) for five years for defending Muslims' freedom of religion and belief. In 2021, officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 repeatedly tortured him, in June for praying the namaz (Muslim daily prayer), and in October also. As a result his health seriously deteriorated. The regime tries to stop its Muslim prisoners from praying the namaz, and frequently tortures those who do meet other Muslims for prayer. If prison authorities detect groups of Muslims praying together, they will be put in punishment cells for several days, Muslims who Forum 18 has talked to from October 2024 onwards have stated. Prison authorities may not detect or punish individual prisoners praying the namaz alone. Against legally-binding international human rights obligations, no-one has ever been held to account for the torture of prisoners of conscience such as Astanov. In July 2021, Governor Farrukh Ismatov of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 refused to explain to Forum 18 why no-one has been arrested and put on criminal trial for torturing Astanov or other prisoners. As the United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) noted in its Concluding Observations on Uzbekistan in January 2020 (CAT/C/UZB/CO/5): 'The Committee remains deeply concerned at reports that torture and ill-treatment continue to be routinely committed by, at the instigation of and with the consent of the State party's law enforcement, investigative and prison officials.' International human rights obligations Uzbekistan is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This defines torture as 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.' Under the Convention, Uzbekistan is obliged both to arrest any person suspected on good grounds of having committed, instigated or acquiesced to torture 'or take other legal measures to ensure his [sic] presence', and also to try them under criminal law which makes 'these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature'. Impunity for Astanov's suspect torturers 'is mockery not justice' Again during 2023 and 2024, officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 tortured prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov on multiple occasions, including threatening him with death. During autumn 2023, prison officer Davr Sottiyev on multiple occasions severely beat, suffocated, and threatened Astanov with death. 'He told Astanov that he will not let him leave the prison alive. Before Astanov leaves, he [Sottiyev] will give Astanov an injection which will soon kill him,' a local Muslim who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 in February 2025. As a result of Sottiyev's severe physical torture, prisoner of conscience Astanov was placed in the prison medical unit. The prison officer on duty (who refused to give his name) at Bukhara Region's General Regime Prison No. 1 refused to answer Forum 18's questions on 18 February about the torture of prisoner of conscience Astanov. He also refused to put Forum 18 through to Prison Governor Farrukh Ismatov. In 2024, prisoner of conscience Astanov made multiple complaints about the torture he suffered to the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Ombudsperson. Officials have taken no action against prison officer Sottiyev or other suspect torturers. The regime's only response was to send an alleged forensic medical 'expert' to the prison in spring 2024. The 'expert' wrote a report claiming that prisoner of conscience Astanov had 'no traces of wounds or bruises on his body'. The Muslim commented: 'This is mockery not justice.' Prison governor threatens relatives if they complain In January 2025, Governor Farrukh Ismatov of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 called various relatives of prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov. He claimed to them that Astanov is fine and that they have no need to complain to the authorities about his situation. The relatives understood that they were being threatened with punishment if they lodge complaints. Various officials of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, who refused to give their full names, between 10 and 12 February refused to answer Forum 18's questions about the multiple cases of torture inflicted on prisoner of conscience Astanov. Damir (who refused to give his last name), who leads the international affairs section of the Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, refused on 12 February to answer Forum 18's questions. He asked to be called back in three hours when 'I will have time to answer you'. He did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called back. Various General Prosecutor's Office officials, who refused to give their names, also refused to answer Forum 18's questions. Press Service official Asadullo Fatkhullayev claimed he would answer Forum 18's questions in writing by the end of the working day on 12 February. Forum 18 had received no answer by the end of the working day of 19 February. Aziz Yuldashev in the regime-appointed Human Rights Commissioner or Ombudsperson's Office, who deals with complaints, claimed to Forum 18 on 12 February that he had not heard of prisoner of conscience Astanov. Yuldashev went on to claim that he would 'check in our system if indeed there were complaints' and by the end of the working day reply to Forum 18's questions. Yuldashev then contradicted himself by also claiming that he would provide the contact details of responsible officials in the Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments to which the Ombudsperson's Office had (allegedly) made enquiries about prisoner of conscience Astanov. Despite Yuldashev's promise to reply by the end of 12 February, Forum 18 had received no answer by the end of the working day of 19 February. Prisoner of conscience Astanov is being held in General Regime Prison No. 1 in Bukhara Region, over 440 kilometres (275 miles) from his home in Tashkent.

Trump Says He Has Not Seen Egyptian Counter To His Plan For Gaza	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and Israel ends. 'I haven’t seen it,' Trump said in response to a reporter’s question on Air Force One. 'Once I see it, I’ll let you know,' he added. Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He said the United States will 'own' the territory and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' which prompted rejection by Arab countries. It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional leaders to make a counteroffer. The Saudi crown prince will host leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and other Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians. Saudi connection Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince. His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said. The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner. 'Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from Sunday school,' Blumenfeld told VOA. 'It's if you're rich, you're right.' As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his wide-ranging remarks that lasted over an hour, Trump did not mention Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in office. 'We've secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we're bringing in the hostages, and we're bringing them home to their families,' Trump said, adding that some of the hostages 'are in pretty bad shape.' He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any of the Saudi delegation during the event. During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Tuesday to find a way to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline Kyiv. Egyptian proposal on Gaza Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, 'secure areas' equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms rebuild the devastated infrastructure. The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern postwar Gaza. It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006 election to Hamas. 'What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,' said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network Al-Shabaka. The goal is that 'we don't return to a situation where Gaza remains under occupation,' he told VOA. On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar governance role. 'It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it serves the interests of our people,' Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Al Arabiya TV. Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay. However, it fulfills only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key demand — the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in postwar Gaza. So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority. The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab countries. Expedited hostage release A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47 senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages, eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel. Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week. 'What we're looking at now is possibly — possibly a swifter resolution to phase two,' said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the conflict,' she told VOA. 'And that's something that [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he's not going to want without Hamas being disarmed.' Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than 2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants.

Guantánamo Needs To Be Shut Down, Not Expanded – OpEd	In a deeply disturbing and unprecedented move, the U.S. has begun transferring immigrant detainees to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. They’re being held without access to their lawyers and families. President Trump has ordered up to 30,000 'high-priority' migrants to be imprisoned there as part of his larger mass deportation and detention campaign. Trump claims these migrants are the 'worst criminal aliens threatening the American people.' But recent investigations of those detainees have already challenged this narrative. And a large percentage of immigrants arrested in the U.S. have no criminal record. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time our government has invoked 'national security' to deny marginalized communities their basic human rights. President George W. Bush created the infamous military prison at Guantánamo during the 'War on Terror' to hold what his administration called the 'worst of the worst.' The prison has since become synonymous with indefinite detention — 15 people still remain there today, over 20 years later. Notorious for its brutality and lawlessness, Guantánamo should be shut down, not expanded. Of the 780 Muslim men and boys imprisoned there since January 2002, the vast majority have been held without charge or trial. Most were abducted and sold to the U.S. for bounty and 'had no relationship whatsoever with the events that took place on 9/11,' reported the UN’s independent expert in 2023, who reiterated the global call to close Guantánamo. The Bush administration designed the prison to circumvent the Constitution and the 1949 Geneva Conventions, refusing to treat the prisoners as either POWs or civilians. This legal fiction resulted in a range of human rights violations, including torture. But the Constitution — and international law — still applies wherever the U.S. government operates. All prisoners, including immigrants, are still entitled to humane treatment, legal counsel, and due process. 'Never before have people been taken from U.S. soil and sent to Guantánamo, and then denied access to lawyers and the outside world,' said Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the ACLU case challenging Trump’s executive order. However, the U.S. does have a sordid history of detaining migrants captured elsewhere at the base. As legal scholar Jeffrey S. Kahn points out, the U.S. has detained Haitians at Guantánamo on and off since the 1970s. In the 1990s, thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing persecution following a military coup were captured at sea. The U.S. held them in horrific conditions at Guantánamo so they couldn’t reach U.S. shores to seek asylum — which is a fundamental human right long enshrined under U.S. law. Shrouded in secrecy, the U.S. continues to capture and detain asylum seekers fleeing Haiti, Cuba, and other Caribbean countries at Guantánamo. Last fall, the International Refugee Assistance Project reported that refugee families are kept in a dilapidated building with mold and sewage problems, suffer from a lack of medical care, and are 'detained indefinitely in prison-like conditions without access to the outside world.' Trump’s order would take these abuses to a horrifying new level. Currently, the base’s existing immigration detention facility can hold up 120 people. Expanding it to 30,000 will require enormous resources. The 'War on Terror' prison at Guantánamo already costs an estimated $540 million annually, making it one of the most expensive prisons in the world. Then there are the moral costs. The mass deportation and detention of asylum seekers is not only unlawful but cruel — and not a real immigration solution. Instead, our government should prioritize meaningful immigration reform that recognizes the dignity of all people. We should also shut down the 'War on Terror' prison at Guantánamo once and for all — and pursue accountability for its decades of abuses. Otherwise, it will only continue to expand. 'I can attest to the facility’s capacity for cruelty,' warned Mansoor Adayfi, who was subjected to torture and endured nearly 15 years at the prison. Guantánamo’s legacy of injustice must end.

UN Calls For Rapid Economic Recovery In Syria To Reverse Losses F...	By Ephrem Kossaify A newly published report from the UN Development Programme warned that at current growth rates, the Syrian economy will not recover to prewar levels until 2080, leaving the country stuck in a state of prolonged hardship and instability. It also underscored the urgent need for a rapid economic recovery to help reverse the decades of progress that were lost as a result of the 14-year civil war. The conflict shattered nearly four decades of economic, social and human development, causing irreparable damage to the nation’s infrastructure, economy and social fabric. The report, titled 'The Impact of the Conflict in Syria: A Devastated Economy, Pervasive Poverty, and a Challenging Road Ahead to Social and Economic Recovery,' offers a detailed analysis of the socioeconomic state of the country, and outlines a road map for rebuilding its economy and infrastructure. According to the UNDP’s preliminary socioeconomic impact assessment, gross domestic product in Syria has halved since the war began in 2011, representing a loss of $800 billion over the past 14 years. Poverty has reached alarming levels, with the national poverty rate soaring from 33 percent before the war to 90 percent. Extreme poverty has also skyrocketed, with 66 percent of the population now affected, up from just 11 percent prior to the conflict. Three out of four people in the country rely on humanitarian aid and are in urgent need of support for critical aspects of life such as healthcare, education, employment, food security and housing. The country also has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, with one in four Syrians jobless. Achim Steiner, the administrator of UNDP, said that the requirements for Syria’s recovery extend beyond the immediate need for humanitarian aid. 'Restoring productivity for jobs and poverty relief, revitalizing agriculture for food security, and rebuilding infrastructure for essential services such as healthcare, education and energy are key to a self-sustaining future, prosperity and peace,' he said. The damage to Syria’s infrastructure, which has left many essential services nonfunctional, is among the primary obstacles to recovery. The report highlights a staggering array of damage: nearly 50 percent of schools are closed, one-in-three housing units have been destroyed, and nearly half of the nation’s water-treatment plants and sewage systems are no longer operational. Energy production has plummeted by 80 percent, with power plants and transmission lines heavily damaged. These failures in basic services exacerbate poverty levels and block any meaningful path toward recovery. The UNDP report also highlighted the devastating loss of life during the war, and the decline in health infrastructure. Nearly 618,000 Syrians died during the conflict, and 113,000 were forcibly disappeared, their whereabouts still unknown. Meanwhile, the collapse of the healthcare system has exacerbated the crisis; a third of all medical facilities have been damaged and almost half of ambulance services are no longer operational. The education sector was also hit hard, leaving 40-50 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 15 unable to attend school. The widespread destruction of housing has left 5.7 million people in need of shelter support. Essential infrastructure, including water-treatment plants, sewer systems and power plants, has been severely damaged, leaving millions without access to clean water, sanitation or reliable energy supplies. Syria’s position on the Human Development Index has plummeted to its lowest point since 1990, further illustrating the catastrophic effects of the war on the nation’s development. The economic outlook remains grim but hope can be found in the potential for robust growth if the correct strategies are implemented, the UNDP said. Its report calls for an ambitious approach to development, as growth rates will need to increase sixfold if they are to recover within a decade. At the current rate of annual growth, 1.3 percent, it would take more than 50 years to restore GDP to prewar levels. To recover within 15 years, Syria would need to achieve a growth rate of 5 percent, and a tenfold increase in growth would be required for the country to reach the level of development it could have attained in the absence of the war. Abdallah Al-Dardari, UNDP’s assistant administrator and director of its regional bureau for Arab states, stressed the important need for comprehensive reforms, and said: 'Syria’s future hinges on a robust development-recovery approach. 'This demands a comprehensive strategy addressing governance reform, economic stabilization, sector revitalization, infrastructure rebuilding, and strengthened social services.' He told Arab News that this strategy for recovery will rely on investments and on good management of those investments, as he underscored the institutional requirements Syria will need to meet to attract private investment in infrastructure. 'If you want to invest $100million or $200 million in (a) highway, you need to first of all be sure that you can go to the court, and the court will treat you equally if you have a litigation with your counterpart, which is the government,' Al-Dardari said. 'You need to make sure that there are internationally recognized arbitration systems. You need to make sure that your money can come in and leave the country. You need to make sure that your banking system respects the highest standards of banking. 'I can give you a very long list of things that need to be done and are not there yet. So this is an arduous journey. This is not an easy journey.' Al-Dardari also told Arab News about the effects of international sanctions, imposed on the Assad regime during the war, on the economy and the ways in which they are hampering recovery progress. 'I'll give you an example,' he said. 'Who is going to bring those investments of $36 billion while they are not really sure that the banking sector is free to bring in money, to use the SWIFT (banking system) to transfer funds and to invest? 'How do you make sure that your shipments into Syria of raw materials or semi-manufactured products are protected? How do you make sure that your exports from Syria can arrive at their destinations, and money will be paid for those exports? 'So at every step of the way in recovery, sanctions will play a role. The chilling effect of sanctions, what we call the ‘overload lines,’ will accompany those sanctions. So our core message (to countries) here is: Please understand the impact of sanctions and act accordingly.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj9p67zXoM_VI	2025-02-20T15:46:32-08:00	
Seven Weaknesses In ‘Fortress Switzerland’ – Analysis	The Swiss armed forces are grappling with significant challenges in a shifting geopolitical landscape. Experts highlight seven pressing problems that must be addressed by the next Swiss defence minister. By Balz Rigendinger The Swiss army is not up to the challenges of the present. Russia’s war against Ukraine has brought uncertainty to Europe and the need for enhanced defence capabilities. Swiss politicians from across the political spectrum recognise that need and parliament has already agreed to raise defence spending to 1% of GDP by 2032. But combat readiness has been a perennial problem for the Swiss army. There are seven other pressing issues demanding the attention of whoever succeeds Viola Amherd as defence minister. 1. Lack of strategy Historically, the Swiss army has adapted its resources to align with prevailing threats, hammering out new strategies in the process. These strategic frameworks were essential for communicating the rationale behind substantial expenditures to both the public and the troops. The last serious attempt at reform was initiated in 2010. Since then, the geopolitical situation has changed drastically – yet an adequate strategic vision to deal with it remains lacking. True, it is no longer necessary to ask 'what’s the point of the army?' after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the Swiss defence sector has lost any coherence it ever had as it scrambles to respond to a myriad of fresh challenges. Hybrid warfare, rapid advancements in digital technology, and the return of tank warfare – all need to be considered. 'We are being presented with numerous wish lists. But to set priorities right, we need an overall strategy,' says Priska Seiler Graf of the Social Democratic Party. She chairs the defence policy committee of the House of Representatives. Senator Werner Salzmann of the Swiss People’s Party adds: 'The current top priority is the defence capability of Switzerland in all areas. But we are not yet seeing any comprehensive defence concept from the government.' 2. Air defences are weak Most experts on the armed forces would agree that air defence is becoming more and more important. Yet Switzerland is weak in the air, because the two things needed – fighter jets and air defence systems – are outdated and require a major overhaul. In fact, they seem to be stuck in a never-ending overhaul phase. The 25-year-old F/A-18 fighter jets the Swiss air force uses are in a preventive maintenance programme to keep them going. Due to complications, this programme has had to be extended. Monitoring of Swiss air space is also a weak point. A system adequate to deal with serious incursions is only being developed now. The development process is troubled at best. Air defences for the middle-distance range are completely out of date. It is not known when a new system will become available. 'We are expecting it by the end of the decade,' says Kaj-Gunnar Sievert, spokesperson for the Federal Office of Defence Procurement. The replacement fighter jet, the F-35, has been ordered from US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. The first eight of the 36 planes bought are due for delivery in 2028. The tense security situation worldwide may lead to delays, however. The F-35 is already considered to be costly in terms of maintenance. 'We may be in for a few nasty surprises,' says parliamentarian Seiler Graf. 3. Procurement getting out of control In quick succession, Switzerland’s main financial oversight bodies both sounded the alarm about armed forces procurement. These are the finance delegation of parliament, which is responsible for the detailed examination and supervision of the national budget, and the Federal Audit Office. In December, parliament’s finance delegation warned that projects to a total value of CHF19 billion ($21 billion) were being affected by 'delays, increasing risks and insufficient resources'. Then in mid-January, the Federal Audit Office sharply criticised a CHF300 million procurement order for reconnaissance drones. The Hermes 900 drone, which is already established on the market, has been undergoing an elaborate customisation process to meet the special requirements of Switzerland. This Israeli drone needs to be able to fly around the Alps, necessitating the installation of a diesel engine and de-icing system – two long-standing problems. In addition, Switzerland wants to have an automatic evasion system built into the drone to prevent collisions with paragliders in the Alps. The result has been a debacle, with the first five delivered drones currently grounded and requiring helicopter escorts when they do return to service. The procurement of these drones has been significantly delayed. 4. Military IT projects in limbo The Swiss government is currently working on 22 digitalisation projects, all of which are strategically important, worth millions, and highly complex. Nine of these 22 projects are being run by the defence ministry. Hardly anything is going according to plan. 'We have identified seven projects that are causing us concern,' says army chief of staff Thomas Süssli. The jewel in the crown of these digital efforts is the development of a proprietary operating system to run military computers, essentially a 'Windows for the army'. It has been in the works for a decade. The list of requirements for this system is ambitious. There has to be a single platform for managing warfare across all operational terrains: on the ground, in the air, in cyberspace, in the electromagnetic (radio communications) and information space. All weapon systems should be compatible with it. And all data should reside in Switzerland, stored on secure servers, and independent of the normal power grid. There are further key projects in defence which the finance delegation of parliament finds to be at risk of failure. Has Switzerland bitten off more than it can chew? 'It remains a challenge to bring all these projects to a successful conclusion,' admits General Süssli. 5. Disagreements about international cooperation Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland came under pressure about its attitude to NATO. US ambassador Scott Miller said in 2023: 'In a way, NATO is a doughnut, and Switzerland is the hole in the middle.' What he meant was this. Switzerland benefits from the protection of the NATO states surrounding it. It doesn’t give anything back – it’s not even able to defend itself adequately. Defence minister Viola Amherd, during her time in office, took rapid steps to bring about cooperation with the Western alliance and with Europe. One decision that has been taken is to join the European air defence system called Sky Shield. Yet all such steps are controversial on the home front, for the People’s Party in particular sees Swiss neutrality as being endangered. 'Neutrality is what has protected us. That too is a part of the overall design of Swiss defence,' insists senator Salzmann. Going it alone militarily brings the risk of being left to stand alone in the event of war. 'One can only wonder how it can be in NATO’s interests to provide defence for a rich country which takes the liberty of making minimal efforts of self-defence and itself refuses to provide support in times of crisis.' This is what well-known strategy expert Mauro Mantovani said recently in an opinion piece in the newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung. The pressure from NATO and the EU for greater Swiss involvement is not likely to lessen. A new defence minister will therefore need to make Switzerland’s case abroad – and explain the position taken by other countries to the voters at home. This latter effort will have to be done as part of a referendum campaign. The Neutrality initiative of the People’s Party, due to be voted on soon, is intended to put a stop to any cooperation with NATO. 6. Lack of qualified people to fill jobs The lack of qualified people, a general problem in industry, also affects the Swiss defence sector. The Federal Intelligence Service alone reports it needs 150 more staff. Army planners are even more concerned about the overall demographic trends in the country. 'According to the army’s own projections, in the 2030s we will not be able to muster 100,000 recruits to serve,' says one. The existing obligatory national service system is about to undergo reform. There is a people’s initiative in the offing to require everyone with Swiss citizenship to carry out some service for the community, the 'Service citoyen initiative'. This initiative is also an attack on the traditional conscription framework, since opportunities to serve are to be more varied and a matter for freer choice. 'Staffing levels for the army are guaranteed with this initiative,' insists campaigner Noémie Roten. At the same time, two other new systems of national service are being developed. Both of these are likely to be subject to a nationwide vote as well. In Autumn 2024 a federal government studyExternal link found that a good half of those serving in the army stated that they had experienced discrimination or sexual abuse there. The leadership of the army committed to remedy this. The military knows that it will soon have to show clearly and convincingly what Swiss citizens are giving years out of their lives for. 7. A risky legacy of problems Then there are a number of legacy issues. One is the dumping of ammunition in mountain regions and lakes, which went on for decades without much thought being given to the consequences. The most notorious example is the little village of Mitholz in the Bernese Alps, which is unwilling host to 3,500 tonnes of old munitions buried in a vault in the mountainside. It will take until 2040 to clean up this dangerous mess. So far there have been a few surprises in this dossier as more information on the caches came to light. So it might take longer still. Another issue is the Swiss arms manufacturer RUAG. The company attracted some unwelcome attention in recent years due to a corruption scandal and cross-border lawsuits. The federal government has wanted to privatise this state-owned entity for quite a while. But there were a series of hitches. What is more, European customers began to lose interest when Switzerland forbade them to pass on Swiss armaments they had bought to the Ukrainians. The federal government has changed its mind on the future of the company. Now it is thinking of incorporating RUAG completely into the defence ministry. Yet, time and again, the company has been plagued by compliance problems. Switzerland is taking a big risk here.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX9-WdxIa1_WC	2025-02-19T16:55:20-08:00	
LAC Stalemate: Why China Fears Fighting In The Himalayas – Analys...	The towering peaks of the Himalayas form more than just a geographical barrier between India and China; they represent a formidable military challenge. The Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the two nations’ troops stand eye to eye, presents some of the harshest conditions known to warfare. For China, these mountains are more than a border—they are a battleground for which it remains unprepared. The Terrain That Tests Resolve The LAC’s rugged terrain and extreme altitude impose logistical nightmares. Sustained military operations here require highly skilled soldiers and a robust support infrastructure. At elevations where oxygen levels drop by 40 percent at 15,000 feet, combat effectiveness declines sharply. These conditions are an unfamiliar adversary for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), whose training largely focuses on plains and urban warfare. In contrast, the Indian Army’s history is steeped in high-altitude warfare. Decades of deployment in Siachen—the world’s highest battlefield—and the gruelling Kargil conflict at 16,000 to 18,000 feet altitudes have honed Indian soldiers into specialists in mountain combat. The Kargil War, fought on steep, rocky terrain under extreme weather, remains a testament to India’s unmatched resilience and skill in these unforgiving environments. Infrastructure: India’s Operational Edge A modern war is fought not just with weapons but with roads, bridges, and airstrips. India’s focused efforts to enhance border infrastructure have paid dividends. Strategic projects, from advanced airstrips to all-weather roads, have cut troop deployment times drastically. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has operational bases in Leh, Chandigarh, Bagdogra, Tezpur, and Hasimara—much closer to the LAC than China’s facilities. With Rafale fighter jets and S-400 missile systems now in its arsenal, India’s rapid-response capabilities are unmatched. Meanwhile, though expanding, China’s infrastructure in Tibet continues to lag. The absence of highways, railways, and airfields capable of sustaining large-scale military operations limits Beijing’s options. Heavy artillery and tanks—essential for prolonged ground operations—are of limited use in such inhospitable terrains, further diminishing China’s ability to mount an offensive. Acclimatised and Armed: India’s Military Readiness India’s advantage is not solely infrastructural. The Indian Army’s long-standing mountain divisions undergo rigorous acclimatisation and training, making them battle-ready at short notice. Strategic positions along key heights in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh give India control over vital observation and mobility routes. Sophisticated surveillance systems—including drones, satellites, and advanced radar—ensure that Chinese troop movements are detected long before they pose a threat. Recent studies by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the Center for a New American Security reaffirm India’s operational superiority in high-altitude warfare. These assessments underline that while China may possess numerical superiority, India’s defensive positioning neutralises this advantage. The Two-Front Predicament for China Beijing’s strategic calculus is further complicated by its focus on Taiwan. Taiwan represents not just a territorial claim but a core national interest for China—a geopolitical chess piece that could draw in global powers like the United States and Japan. Engaging in a prolonged Himalayan conflict risks diluting China’s military focus, leaving its flanks vulnerable in the Taiwan Strait. A two-front scenario would overstretch China’s resources and logistics. Balancing the demands of two geographically and strategically distinct conflicts is a challenge the PLA would struggle to manage. India’s steady military presence along the LAC ensures that any miscalculation by China could lead to an engagement it cannot sustain. Quad and Diplomatic Calculations India has cultivated robust strategic partnerships, unlike China, which finds itself increasingly isolated in the Indo-Pacific. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)—comprising India, the United States, Japan, and Australia—has emerged as a significant deterrent to Chinese aggression. Regular joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and enhanced defence cooperation with Western allies position India as a linchpin in regional security. India’s influential role in the Indo-Pacific further limits China’s strategic manoeuvrability. A conflict with India risks galvanising this emerging coalition, opening up new diplomatic and military resistance fronts for Beijing. Economic and Diplomatic Repercussions The economic stakes are equally high. India-China bilateral trade surpassed $136 billion in 2023, underscoring deep economic interdependence. However, India has shown a willingness to leverage this relationship when national security is at stake. The ban on over 300 Chinese apps following the Galwan Valley clash inflicted significant losses on Chinese tech giants. A full-scale conflict would trigger further economic decoupling, with India restricting investments and operations of major Chinese companies. The diplomatic fallout would be equally severe, casting China as an expansionist power at a time when its global image is already under strain due to tensions in the South China Sea and human rights issues in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Resilience and Strategy: India’s Calculated Posture The LAC has been described by top military officials and experts as stable but sensitive. India’s sustained deployment along the border and proactive military-to-military dialogues ensure that tensions are managed and do not escalate inadvertently. India’s diplomatic finesse in maintaining global partnerships has further reduced its strategic vulnerabilities. By presenting itself as a responsible power committed to regional stability, India has not only strengthened its own position but also exposed the limitations of China’s strategic posture in the Himalayas. A Stalemate on India’s Terms China’s reluctance to escalate tensions along the LAC is rooted in a complex web of strategic, logistical, and economic considerations. The extreme terrain of the Himalayas, India’s superior high-altitude warfare capabilities, infrastructural advantages, and robust diplomatic networks make a full-scale conflict an unpalatable option for Beijing. By transforming the LAC stalemate into a scenario that exposes Chinese weaknesses rather than one that serves Beijing’s territorial ambitions, India has demonstrated that in the heights of the Himalayas, it holds the upper hand—on its own terms and in its own time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdXxNo3LZveCh6	2025-02-19T16:53:53-08:00	
Family Politics: The Marcos-Duterte Feud And The Future Of The Ph...	By Pradeep Nadig The Philippine government is currently being led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the unpopular former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of the controversial former President Rodrigo Duterte. They joined hands and were brought into power in 2022 but their fragile alliance is now in shambles and going through a very public breakup. The situation reached boiling point in November 2024, when Duterte made death threats against Marcos, the First Lady, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, adding that arrangements had been made to kill them in the event of her assassination. The outcome of this fracas is likely to have stark domestic implications. It will also affect the country’s foreign policy, including its relationship with India, in 2025. Election predictions The collapse of this alliance comes ahead of the 2025 midterm elections in which all 317 seats in the House and 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate will be contested. Both dynasties are fighting to create a favourable situation for themselves in preparation for the 2028 presidential elections. Marcos has proposed extending presidential term limits beyond the current six years, but to do so, he must retain control of the House. In November 2023, he released former Senator Leila De Lima, who was Rodrigo Duterte’s fiercest political opponent. She was widely believed to have been imprisoned due to her vocal criticism of his administration and his brutal war on drugs. Her release well ahead of the midterm elections in 2025, where her vocal opposition to the Dutertes could help Marcos consolidate power in the House, is strategic. Meanwhile, the Duterte family is working to gain electoral ground in the House and set up favourable odds for Sara Duterte’s presidential campaign in 2028. The family has nominated Senate candidates that are not part of the ruling coalition party and many independent candidates who are known Duterte allies. Rodrigo Duterte is also preparing to run for mayor of Davao City, a position he held prior to becoming president in 2016. Following Sara Duterte’s statements and death threats and the corruption charges against her, the House has filed for her impeachment. This investigation led Rodrigo Duterte to describe Congress as a 'rotten institution.' The Dutertes are aiming to shift the balance of power to avoid Sara Duterte’s impeachment while Marcos needs to ensure that impeachment happens so that he can extend the presidential term limit and prevent Duterte from becoming president in 2028. Foreign policy differences As president, Marcos has deviated significantly from Rodrigo Duterte on foreign policy. While Duterte was known for his pro-Beijing position, Marcos’ actions in the past year indicate a clear pro-Washington stance. Unlike the former president, who continued to appease Chinese territorial claims and military exercises in the West Philippine Sea (even after winning an arbitration case in 2016), the current president has gone on a diplomatic and even security offensive. Duterte assumed an anti-US position despite Chinese maritime aggression. In 2021, however, he finally reversed his decision to end the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) that allowed US access to military bases in the Philippines. Although the agreement was reinstated, trust between Washington and Manila remained low until Marcos’ victory in 2022. In April 2023 Marcos granted the US access to four additional Philippine military bases in an expansion of the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) that was signed in 2014. Marcos has claimed that this measure was taken primarily to boost disaster relief in the area in addition to defending its coastline on the South China Sea. Bilateral ties between the US and the Philippines have made great strides in Marcos’ tenure. The countries have jointly issued new bilateral defence guidelines that updated the 1951 Mutual Defence Agreement between the two. These new guidelines have resulted in greater defence cooperation, foreign military funding, expansion of military bases, and an increase in military equipment supplies. In 2024, when the Spratly Islands dispute boiled to open confrontations between China and the Philippines, Marcos doubled down on Manila’s claims, strengthening its ties with Washington. Implications for India Marcos’ position on China, unlike that of Duterte, has been better for New Delhi. Since 2022, trade relations between India and the Philippines have steadily improved with the total value crossing US$ 3 billion. The two countries have also made great strides in defence cooperation, resulting in the sale of the BrahMos missile system to the Philippines worth US$ 375 million. During the fifth India–Philippines Joint Defence Cooperation Committee meeting held in Manila on 10 September 2024, India’s Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane encouraged the defence partnership between the nations and advocated for the joint development of military equipment. Marcos’ foreign policy has bolstered defence against China’s expansion in the South China Sea, which aligns with both the US and India’s strategic agenda for the region, making way for greater bilateral and trilateral security cooperation. Outreach to the Philippines also provides India with an opportunity to showcase its reliability and power to others in the ASEAN region. This was the theme of the 20th India-ASEAN summit held in Jakarta in 2023, which aimed to boost maritime cooperation. Increased defence cooperation with the Philippines signifies the end of India’s reluctance to supply weapons to ASEAN in fear of China’s response. As New Delhi seeks to become a leader in defence exports and position itself as a strategic partner, its ties with Manila must continue to grow for the success of its future foreign policy in Southeast Asia. The current political climate combined with shared strategic interests and the positive relationship between Trump and Modi have created favourable conditions for stronger India-Philippines ties in 2025. Future dynamics While these opportunities exist, Donald Trump’s election as president raises certain questions. The Marcos administration has received support from the US in deterring China thus far, however, the newly elected Trump administration could decrease military spending abroad and adopt an anti-interventionist stance, which would leave the Philippines in a vulnerable position. The upcoming midterm elections are likely to rebalance power between the Marcos and Duterte families. With potentially greater influence in the House and Senate, the Dutertes could advocate for a return to more pro-China policies and make it difficult for the US to continue joint military operations and access military bases in the Philippines. This would also undermine New Delhi’s influence in the region and hinder growing military cooperation with Manila. The Dutertes would also be better positioned to oppose Marcos’s proposal to extend the presidential term limit, making Sara Duterte a favourite for the 2028 presidential elections. If this were to happen, it would greatly hurt both New Delhi and Washington’s foreign policy interests in the region for the better part of a decade.

Choppy Waters Continue In The South China Sea – Analysis	By Carlyle Thayer China escalated its aggression in the South China Sea in 2024, highlighting the ongoing struggle between maritime rights, sovereignty and security. Several confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have led Manila to engage in security efforts to curb China’s intimidation, while divisions within ASEAN continue to hamper efforts to establish a South China Sea Code of Conduct. In 2024, China stepped up its intimidation, harassment and coercion against the Philippine Navy, Coast Guard and civilian vessels and aircraft operating legally within the country’s exclusive economic zone. China deployed large numbers of People’s Liberation Army Navy, China Coast Guard (CCG) and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) vessels into the West Philippine Sea. China also passed Provisions on Administrative Enforcement Procedures for Coast Guard Agencies in June 2024 and issued coordinates for baselines around Scarborough Shoal in November to provide ostensible legal cover for its coercion against the Philippines. But Chief of the Armed Force of the Philippines General Romeo Brawner characterised China’s grey zone tactics as illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive. From February to June, CCG and PAFMM vessels repeatedly confronted Philippine rotation and reprovisioning (RORE) missions to the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese coercion included dangerous manoeuvring, deliberate ramming and the use of high-powered water cannons. On 17 June, Chinese vessels conducted their most violent confrontation of a Philippine RORE mission. Armed Chinese sailors attacked a Philippine rigid hull inflatable boat and assaulted Filipino marines, smashed communication equipment, confiscated weapons and punctured the hull. The 17 June incident marked an inflection point. After a series of discussions, the two sides announced a provisional agreement to prevent similar incidents on 21 July. Philippine RORE missions were conducted without incident for the remainder of the year. But the agreement did not include Sabina and Scarborough Shoals. In April, after the discovery of crushed coral at Sabina Shoal, the Philippines deployed Coast Guard vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua to pre-empt Chinese construction, leading to a series of confrontations with Chinese vessels. On 19 August, 40 Chinese vessels blocked resupply and rammed the hull of the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times. On 12 September, as the BRP Teresa Magbanua withdrew due to ration, medical and ship repair needs, China surged 207 vessels to Sabina Shoal. Confrontations also escalated at Scarborough Shoal. In August, CCG military aircraft fired flares in Philippine air force flight paths. In December, China dispatched air and naval ‘combat readiness patrols’ around Scarborough Shoal, including a 12,000 ton CCG ship. In response to escalating Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, the Philippines announced a whole-of-government Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept in January 2024. The concept promotes greater interoperability between the tri-services and civilian agencies to conduct combined maritime and air defence operations. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also approved the US$35 billion Re-Horizon 3 program to modernise the Philippines’ Armed Forces. In November, Marcos Jr signed into law the Philippines Maritime Zone Act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act to bolster its sovereign jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea. The Philippines also participated in bilateral and multilateral land, sea and air military exercises with the United States, Australia, Japan and other security partners. While the United States offered to assist in resupply at Second Thomas Shoal, the Philippines declined, stating that they ‘will exhaust all means before seeking foreign intervention’. But the Philippines permitted the deployment of the US Typhon Strategic Mid-Range Fires System in April during Exercise Salaknib. China protested vehemently and declared that relations with the Philippines were at a crossroad. In November, it was revealed that a US military task force had been deployed to Palawan island to assist the Philippines in logistics and maritime domain awareness. Unlike the Philippines, 2024 was relatively quiet on Vietnam’s eastern front. In June, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported growing Vietnamese construction on the Spratly Islands through landfill, dredging harbours and constructing infrastructure, including a 1050 metre airfield on Barque Canada. But China has remained silent on Vietnam’s activities in the South China Sea. Within ASEAN, progress towards a South China Sea Code of Conduct has remained stalled. At the annual ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on 25 July, it was reported that Cambodia and Laos, the 2024 ASEAN Chair, blocked a proposal by the Philippines to include a reference to the 17 June incident. By the year’s end, various ASEAN diplomats privately reported that little progress had been made on the third reading of the South China Sea Code of Conduct because of divisions within ASEAN. Looking ahead to 2025, China will continue to assert its sovereignty over land features and adjacent waters within the West Philippine Sea and try to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration. The Philippines will redouble its self-defence measures and seek reassurance from the United States that its alliance commitment is ironclad. Vietnam will continue to improve infrastructure on its land features. On the South China Sea Code of Conduct, China will continue to play a double game in negotiations with ASEAN by pressing for an early conclusion of negotiations as a diplomatic ploy while letting negotiations drag on, as both options prevent direct US involvement.

The New India-US Security Compact – Analysis	By Vivek Mishra As states transition in economic heft, power, and influence, so do their relationships. Most starkly, this is visible in the changing nature of their ties with great powers. On the contrary, the recalibrations by great powers themselves have implicit success stories about growing powers, not just one of accommodation but increasingly, compulsion. While the United States (US) has remained a constant paradigm of growth, influence, and both soft and hard power for over three-quarters of the last century, China and India have presented two very contrasting pictures of the kind of relationship rising states have with the preeminent power of the world. China’s growth in the last three decades, in many ways, was facilitated by the US’s role as the global security guarantor. Now, China and the US are fundamentally locked in a great power competition, with almost every aspect of the contest speeding towards a downward spiral. Three factors have intensified this trend. First, rapid shifts in American social and political choices and patterns domestically have altered how America thinks of its security and role in the world. Second, the US wants to retain its numero uno position even as China is hurtling from behind in the most critical of domains that underscore this great power competition. China’s transformation of its naval power brings unprecedented pressure onto the Indo-Pacific countries and in the tacit spread of its economic tentacles throughout the world, compelling a reassessment of the metrics of the global power dynamic. Finally, a new tech race, which is beginning to unravel and will likely shape the course of great power competition in the next few decades, has enforced an order of multilateral accommodation of rising powers upon the US. Together, these have led to a new utilitarian view of security, power and influence in Washington. India is at the helm in that reassessment of Washington. When the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited the US to meet with his counterpart, President Donald Trump, on 13-14 February 2025, camaraderie, nostalgia, optics, and pragmatism seemed to roll into one. Keen observers of the India-US relationship were expecting Trump to give a new imprint to the bilateral relationship and not simply conform to the existing paradigms of continuity in bilateral ties. The barely 40-hour trip saw a new US-India COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) agreement, which aims to serve as the new broad framework for combining cooperation in defence, trade, energy security, technology and innovation, people-to-people ties, and multilateral cooperation. For the last two decades, the India-US defence ties based itself on the continued momentum provided by the 2005 Framework for the US-India Defence Relationship which promised 'setting the US and India on a path to increasingly broad, complex, and strategic cooperation' and the subsequent 10-year framework signed in June 2015 which provided 'avenues for high-level strategic discussions, continued exchanges between armed forces of both countries, and strengthening of defence capabilities.' The latest extension of the framework is reflective of the expansive nature of defence ties between the US and India, especially in its increasing importance for cooperation in the transfer of sensitive technologies and strategic trust. India and the US announced the signing of a new ten-year framework this year for the US-India Major Defence Partnership in the 21st Century, as the one signed in 2015 nears its culmination. Importantly, the new framework weaves in India’s Major Defence Partner (MDP) status to ensure that new technology access and supply guarantees in the area of defence and security can be part of a sustained process over the next decade. A path that was set for the India-US defence cooperation in 2005 has required a new thrust every 10 years to accommodate new priorities. The latest iteration has placed the expansion of defence industrial cooperation, coproduction, and interoperability at the heart of bilateral defence ties. Among key plans to speed up supplies for India’s defence requirements, India and the US have announced that they will pursue new procurements and co-production arrangements for ‘Javelin’ Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and ‘Stryker’ Infantry Combat Vehicles in India this year. Besides, the procurement of six additional P-8I Maritime Patrol aircraft is likely to boost India’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the expanse of the Indo-Pacific region. The second Trump administration has clearly taken a long view of the security ties with India, wherein the focus of the planned steps is to further integrate bilateral security ties by making them deeply structural. A wider leveraging of India’s MDP status through the Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 (STA‑1) authorisation; initiating negotiations for a Reciprocal Defence Procurement (RDP) agreement to enhance bilateral procurement channels and establish well-oiled reciprocal supply lines for defence goods and services; and reviewing arms transfer regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), are all geared towards fostering deeper integration, interoperability, and co-production. Given the lessons learnt over the past five years—both on and off the battlefield—it was rather incumbent upon Modi and Trump to outline a roadmap for the next decade. The importance of autonomous systems to the future of warfare and security is one such domain. India and the US announced the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA), a new initiative seeking to augment industry partnerships and production in the Indo-Pacific region. Partnerships between Indian and US companies for coproducing maritime systems and AI-enabled counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) could be useful for both countering and establishing deterrence. Perhaps most importantly, India and the US have broken ‘new ground’ by announcing their intention to 'support and sustain the overseas deployments of the US and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific'—a significant joint security commitment to the region. These deployments could reshape how India and the US approach regional security in the Indo-Pacific by enhancing cooperation in logistics, intelligence sharing, force mobility for joint humanitarian and disaster relief operations, and, most importantly, for countering common threats from the Gulf to the Far East. There were several other announcements in the field of technology, innovation, energy security, space and people-to-people ties, which all feed into the new security compact between the two countries. However, three trends in the India-US bilateral as well as their multilateral cooperation framework stood out in the joint statement. The Indian Ocean will be a key domain in the Indo-US cooperation. The launch of the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture—a bilateral initiative to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce—along with Meta’s ambitious 50,000-kilometre undersea cable project, underscores a long-term commitment to connect and strengthen global digital infrastructure and regional security. Second, Modi’s visit underscored that the commitment of both India and the US to the importance of the Quad framework in the Indo-Pacific remains resolute. And finally, a key convergence point in this new bilateral compact between India and the US is connectivity projects. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to serve as the next transregional connectivity project which could reroute energy supply chains. However, its success remains contingent on the geopolitical externalities of the Middle East. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President J.D. Vance emphasised that America expects Europe to take on a greater security role, allowing Washington to focus on other critical regions. The implicit message was clear: Indo-Pacific security and the challenge posed by China remain top priorities for the US. Despite concerns that a second Trump administration might scale back America's global security commitments, its strategic competition with China is set to continue. A confident Trump administration views India as a crucial partner in advancing its strategic objectives while recalibrating America’s role on the global stage.

Indonesia: With Next Election Years Away, Prabowo Already Eyes Se...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus Four months into his presidency, Indonesian leader Prabowo Subianto has already secured his party’s nomination for re-election, but analysts say the move is premature because of his untested leadership amid pressing economic challenges. While the announcement at the Gerindra party’s 17th anniversary celebration last week signaled confidence in Prabowo’s leadership, experts say it might also be a strategic move to consolidate power and pre-empt potential rivals, including his vice president. 'If his policies work, the people will see him as an effective leader and naturally re-elect him,' Ali Sahab, a political analyst at Airlangga University, told BenarNews. 'But right now, poverty and unemployment are our most pressing challenges. Addressing them requires deep, strategic policies to foster sustainable economic growth.' Indonesia’s poverty rate stood at 9% as of 2024, while unemployment is at 5%, according to government statistics. The coalition that helped Prabowo be elected last year, known as the Advanced Indonesia Coalition Plus, could also shift its allegiances before the next election, Ali said. 'In politics, there are no permanent alliances, only permanent interests,' he said. 'If Prabowo is perceived as underperforming, support could shift elsewhere. On Saturday, Gerindra Secretary-General, Ahmad Muzani announced that a special party congress had reached a unanimous decision to nominate Prabowo again. 'The entire Gerindra Party cadre has requested that we nominate Prabowo Subianto as the presidential candidate for the 2029 general election,' Muzani said. In addition to securing the party’s nomination, Prabowo was reappointed as Gerindra’s chairman and chief patron. Prabowo struck a cautious tone in his speech to the party on Saturday. 'If my programs fail, there is no need to nominate me again,' he said. However, in a move seen as an effort to consolidate his political influence, Prabowo on Friday proposed a 'permanent coalition' among his allies. The Presidential Communications Office declined to comment on the nomination, referring all inquiries to Gerindra. While major coalition parties such as Golkar, the National Awakening Party, the National Mandate Party, and the Democratic Party have voiced support for Prabowo, the National Democratic Party (NasDem) remains undecided. 'It’s too early to discuss this,' the news portal Tempo.co. quoted NasDem executive Willy Aditya as saying. Dominique Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Gerindra’s confidence in nominating Prabowo again was fueled by strong approval ratings for the new president’s performance in his first 100 days in office. A January survey by Litbang Kompas found that public satisfaction with the Prabowo administration stood at 80.9% – significantly higher than the roughly 60% approval rating former President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo had received early in his first term. Dominique attributed the high approval to Prabowo’s flagship program: free school lunches for students, a populist initiative that has resonated with many Indonesians. 'The free lunch program is a top-of-mind issue for Indonesians,' Dominique said. 'Populist programs tend to generate high approval ratings.' The early nomination also raises questions about Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s political future. Gibran, 37, Jokowi’s eldest son, is widely speculated to be a potential presidential contender in the next general election, in 2029. Ali, of Airlangga University, said Prabowo’s decision to accept the nomination might stem from concerns over Gibran’s ambitions. 'This could be Prabowo’s way of pre-empting a challenge from within his own ranks,' he said. Ambang Priyonggo, a political analyst at Multimedia Nusantara University, said that Prabowo’s early bid could also be a political strategy to project stability and commitment. 'This is likely an attempt to quash speculation that Gibran could take over the presidency before 2029,' Ambang told BenarNews. ‘Prabowo is logical choice for Gerindra’ Despite high approval ratings, the new administration has faced criticism for economic management and budgetary inefficiencies. A recent survey by the Center for Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS) that polled 95 experts and journalists gave Prabowo’s government an average performance score of 5 out of 10. Prabowo’s economic policies, including the free school lunch program, have also come under scrutiny. 'The program is proving inefficient in terms of budget allocation and coverage,' Ambang said. 'Reallocating funds to support it has had unintended consequences, creating dissatisfaction among other sectors of the economy,' he said, referring to the president’s controversial austerity measures. Arga Pribadi Imawan, a political analyst at Gadjah Mada University, said Prabowo’s early nomination reflects a broader trend in global politics: the centralization of power around individual candidates rather than political parties. 'In contemporary politics, it is the figurehead who matters, not the party,' Arga told BenarNews. 'Prabowo remains a dominant political figure in Indonesia, while his rivals from the 2024 election have seen their influence wane. This makes Prabowo the logical choice for Gerindra.' Trubus Rahadiansyah, a public policy expert at Trisakti University, said that Prabowo’s nomination also serves as a loyalty test for his ministers. 'This is a way for Prabowo to gauge who among his cabinet members is truly loyal to him,' Trubus told BenarNews. He pointed to recent policies introduced by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia, such as restrictions on the sale of subsidized liquefied petroleum gas that were later revoked after sparking public outrage. 'That policy benefited businesses more than ordinary citizens,' Trubus said, adding that such controversies could undermine Prabowo’s administration if not addressed properly.

Xi Jinping’s Bureaucracy In 2025: A Critique In The New Political...	Chinese Premiere Xi Jinping remains firmly in control of China's political landscape, with no visible plan for succession, barring extreme events like a lost war or economic collapse. Most opposition has fled the country, as fear prevents any serious challenge to his rule. Xi's firm control over the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unprecedented in modern China, especially after abolishing presidential term limits in 2018. His lack of a clear successor suggests an intent to rule indefinitely, which may ensure stability in the short term but creates uncertainty for the future. Historically, authoritarian regimes without succession plans often face power struggles when the leader eventually leaves. The absence of a designated heir could lead to internal conflicts within the CCP when Xi is no longer in power. The only possible threat to his authority could emerge from within the security apparatus if internal disagreements become public. Furthermore, his grip on power is not static; it is continuously reinforced through persistent anti-corruption efforts and Party rectification campaigns. In other words, Xi Jinping's entrenched control over China's political system and the mechanisms he employs to maintain power is prominent since he started up until now (2025). Political Variables: Controlled and Not The lack of a clear successor suggests that Xi intends to rule indefinitely, breaking with the leadership norms established after Mao Zedong's era. This raises concerns about political stability in the long term, as the absence of a transition plan increases the risk of a power struggle when he eventually leaves office. Also, it means a weakness of political opposition that emphasizes that opposition within China has largely disappeared, with dissenters either forced into exile or silenced through political repression. This suggests a highly controlled political environment where resistance is ineffective. While this strengthens Xi's immediate grip on power, it does not necessarily eliminate discontent rather, it forces opposition underground. If economic hardships or political scandals arise, suppressed grievances could resurface, potentially destabilizing the regime. Meaning, it that discontent is potentially creating instability in the future. Meanwhile, there are potential internal challenges within his political fence. Although Xi appears unchallenged, the mention of the security apparatus as a possible source of opposition is significant. Security forces[1] are crucial to maintaining authoritarian rule, and if internal divisions emerge, they could pose a serious threat to his leadership. Thus, if divisions emerge within China's security forces whether due to policy disagreements, economic struggles, or leadership disputes Xi's position could be at risk. While there is no clear indication of this happening, it suggests that control over the military and intelligence agencies remains a key factor in his rule. To wit, in authoritarian regimes, the military and intelligence agencies are often the key enforcers of the leader's rule, but they can also become sources of internal opposition. However, so far, he has maintained tight control over the military and state security agencies through purges and loyalty tests. There is also a role of anti-corruption and party rectification campaigns in Xi's bureaucracy and leadership. Rather than merely consolidating power in a passive way, Xi actively reinforces his authority through continuous anti-corruption drives and ideological campaigns. These serve two purposes: eliminating political rivals and maintaining loyalty within the Communist Party. While these measures strengthen his rule, such campaigns may also create resentment among officials who fear they could become targets, potentially fostering hidden opposition. If discontent grows within the party, it could lead to hidden opposition or even factional struggles. Aging Political Leadership The top leadership has been tilted in Xi Jinping's favor. But, as previously noted, this top leadership is also aging. An aging leadership also means that many of Xi's key supporters may retire or pass away, potentially opening room for new political dynamics that he may not fully control. In 2027, the current Politburo will have an average age above sixty-eight (68). Should they be renominated then, the average age of Politburo members would be above seventy-three on the eve of the next Party Congress and Current Central Committee members are not far behind. Their time horizon will become shorter, and as long as no potential successor appears to have been groomed, their political position will become increasingly vulnerable. Again, a defining feature of Xi's leadership is the lack of a designated successor, breaking from previous CCP norms that aimed to ensure stability through planned transitions. Without a clear heir, uncertainty will grow among the party elite, increasing the risk of political maneuvering or factional struggles as different groups seek to position themselves for leadership roles. This uncertainty could weaken Xi's grip on power over time, especially as leaders begin to consider their own political futures beyond his rule. As the current leadership ages and their career time horizons shrink, their incentives may shift. Rather than unwavering loyalty to Xi, some officials might begin looking for alternative paths to secure their personal or factional interests. If no successor emerges, competition among different factions could intensify, creating a fragile political environment. Additionally, older officials may become less effective in governance, potentially exacerbating policy stagnation or mismanagement, further weakening the regime's overall stability. Unless Xi Jinping changes his basic formula to ensure support and discourage any line debate, his power will become brittle, and the likelihood of a succession crisis will increase. His leadership strategy is either by grooming a successor or adjusting his approach to elite management. While his current control appears strong, the absence of institutionalized succession mechanisms makes a future power struggle more likely. Historically, power vacuums in authoritarian regimes often lead to internal conflicts, and China could face a similar scenario if Xi does not prepare a clear transition plan. There are also nuanced views of Xi Jinping's governance style, highlighting both his consolidation of power and the underlying complexities within China's political and economic landscape. Despite Xi's centralization of power and strong grip on influence, Chinese bureaucracies remain highly fragmented, with institutional silos, rival factions, and competition among individuals. This contradicts the idea of a fully unified authoritarian system, suggesting that power struggles still play a role in policy decisions. From here, tt depicts a complex picture of Xi Jinping's governance, emphasizing the tensions between his centralization of power and the persistent institutional, factional, and economic dynamics within China. Clearly, there is Xi's ability to enforce policy shifts while maintaining ideological rigidity, as well as the role of elite competition in shaping China's future. Additionally, the influence of princelings (descendants of revolutionary leaders) remains significant, particularly in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and financial institutions. While the next leader may not necessarily be a princeling, elite clans could act as key power brokers, determining leadership transitions behind the scenes. At a deeper extent, there is a pattern in Xi's governance since his helm started; initial inflexibility followed by strategic reversals or rigidity then with certain pragmatic adjustments. When policies face resistance or cause unintended consequences, this would be addressed through a 'pullback pattern' or 'rear-view mirror approach' that are evident in key crises, including: The COVID-19 lockdowns, which persisted rigidly until a sudden reversal in late 2022. The 2015 stock market crisis, where interventionist policies failed to stabilize financial markets. The 2020 real estate crash, in which Xi initially rejected bailouts but later allowed targeted financial support. The U.S.-China trade war, where initial confrontational policies eventually gave way to selective economic adjustments; even up to the first quarter of 2025. This suggests that Xi is a risk-taker but not reckless. Meaning, he is willing to implement bold policies but is also pragmatic enough to change course when necessary. However, these reversals are often framed in a way that protects his authority, shifting blame onto subordinates or external factors. Xi's political capital plays in a 'selective policy flexibility versus ideological rigidity'. While Xi has shown pragmatism in adjusting economic policies, his core ideological agenda remains unchanged. His governance remains centered around: Reinforcing ideology, particularly through slogans and propaganda that elevate his personal authority. Promoting 'struggle' (斗争), which can mean striving for progress but also preparing for external conflicts or internal challenges. Maintaining a strong international posture, with an ever-present possibility of major geopolitical confrontations. Even in areas where Xi has shown flexibility such as real estate bailouts or fiscal stimulus, these shifts are constrained by his broader ideological commitments. This balancing act ensures that economic policies remain adaptable without undermining his centralized control. At the backdrop of this, Xi Jinping has been deepening policies that pre-existed his rule. A look at history indeed reveals an affinity with the Self-Strengthening Movement of the Qing empire, summed up by the famous maxim: 'Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use' (中学为体, 西学为用). Republican China sought help from Germany to modernize its arms industry and sent students on scholarships to the United States. The best-known case is that of the rocket scientist Qian Xuesen who, after leaving the United States in 1955, led China's ballistic development, and whose influence stretches to this day. After the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty was the basis for what has been called the largest technology transfer in history. Much of this focused-on industry and infrastructure, but it also involved education and the training of scientists, including in the nuclear field. The Sino-Soviet rift inaugurated a period of closure, but Mao Zedong nonetheless launched several 'big projects' during the Great Leap Forward. They are recalled nowadays to justify the present large-scale policies. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, 'Zhou Enlai, followed by Deng Xiaoping', hailed the 'four modernizations' (四个现代化) that put the accent on big science again. Since the early 1960s, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has never ceased from engaging in research and development on new weapons, serving as a harbor for scientists in times of political turmoil or during more recent anti-corruption campaigns. A chief aim of China's normalization with the United States was to acquire key technologies. From former US Presidents Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter's presidency, which was the heyday of the US convergence with China against the Soviet Union, supercomputers (supposedly for climate predictions), nuclear knowledge, radar installations, and many other dual use technologies were shared. Large contingents of Chinese students underwent education and training abroad, mainly in the United States. Successively, we can observe that Xi's foreign policy adaptations are evident with strategic pauses. There is a pattern of assertiveness followed by recalibration. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), once a cornerstone of China's global strategy, has seen a decline in outward investments and loans, possibly due to economic slowdowns and concerns over debt sustainability. Additionally, in response to changing global dynamics, particularly under a potential Trump second presidency (2024–2028), China appears to be cautiously reassessing its relationships with key nations, including India, Japan, and the UK. This suggests that while Xi projects strength internationally, he is also willing to adjust diplomatic strategies to navigate shifting geopolitical realities. Implication and Conclusion Per its implication, while Xi's control appears secure for now, the long-term consequences of his rule remain uncertain. The suppression of opposition, lack of a succession plan, and reliance on internal purges could make the political system more fragile over time. If economic challenges or elite divisions intensify, his grip on power may face unexpected tests. Xi's leadership is characterized by strong, centralized control, but his dominance is not necessarily permanent. His reliance on security forces, ideological campaigns, and repression keeps him in power, yet these same factors could generate internal tensions. Whether his rule remains stable or faces future challenges depends on how well he navigates potential economic, political, and internal security risks. While Xi Jinping maintains firm control over the CCP, the aging leadership and the absence of a succession plan introduce long-term vulnerabilities. If these issues remain unaddressed, they could lead to political uncertainty, elite fragmentation, and a potential succession crisis. Xi's ability to navigate these challenges will determine the long-term stability of his rule and the CCP's future. Xi Jinping's leadership is characterized by a mix of ideological rigidity and strategic pragmatism. While he has consolidated power, elite competition, bureaucratic infighting, and security apparatus tensions remain underlying factors in China's political landscape. His policy approach follows a recognizable pattern: firm initial positions, followed by controlled reversals, when necessary, which helps him maintain authority while adapting to challenges. However, as China faces economic pressures, elite struggles, and an evolving international environment, the long-term sustainability of this governance model remains uncertain. *Ideas and/or views expressed here are entirely independent and not in any form represent author's organization and affiliation.

[1] Xi has significantly empowered China's security apparatus to enforce stability and suppress dissent. However, this has also created an environment of competition and potential conflict within these institutions. The reference to 'opaque fights' suggests that internal struggles within the security services could become a source of instability. If unchecked, these tensions could manifest as factional disputes, power plays, or even political purges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX9lFNhBNmYAQ	2025-02-19T16:43:03-08:00	
Sacrificing Truth On Leviathan’s Altar – OpEd	Last Sunday, 60 Minutes featured tyrannical German prosecutors boasting about persecuting private citizens who made comments that officialdom disapproved. Three prosecutors explained how the government was entitled to launch pre-dawn raids and lock up individuals who criticized politicians, complained about immigrant crime waves, or otherwise crossed the latest revised boundary lines of acceptable thoughts. In a craven slant that would have cheered any mid-twentieth century European dictator, 60 Minutes glorified the crackdown: 'Germany is trying to bring some civility to the world wide web by policing it in a way most Americans could never imagine in an effort to protect discourse.' Nothing 'protects discourse' like a jackboot kick aside the head of someone who insulted a German politician on Facebook, right? Mocking German leaders is punished like heresy was punished 500 years ago—though no one has been publicly torched yet. Do the priggish German prosecutors realize that they are the latest incarnation of nineteenth-century German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel? Hegel declared: 'Men are as foolish as to forget, in their enthusiasm for liberty of conscience and political freedom, the truth which lies in power.' Hegel bluntly equated government and truth: 'For Truth is the Unity of the universal and subjective Will; and the Universal is to be found in the State, in its laws, its universal and rational arrangements.' Hegel probably did more to propel modern totalitarianism than perhaps any other philosopher. Unfortunately, many Americans favor the US government becoming a Ministry of Truth like the German government. Fifty-five percent of American adults support government suppression of 'false information,' according to a 2023 poll. But other polls show that only 20 percent trust the government to do the right thing most of the time. So why would people trust dishonest officials to forcibly eradicate 'false information'? Did some people skip logic class, or what? A September 2023 poll revealed that almost half of Democrats believed that free speech should be legal 'only under certain circumstances'—perhaps only when a rascally Republican is president? Hegelian notions of 'Government = Truth' propelled censorship here in recent years. Three years ago, Americans learned they lived under a Disinformation Governance Board with a ditzy Disinformation Czar who boasted of graduating from Bryn Mawr University. A public backlash led to the board’s termination but federal censors quickly and secretly resumed their sway over the internet. Though American censors rarely invoke Hegel, their schemes tacitly presume that political power is divine, if not in origin, at least in its effect. The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), created in 2018, has relied on 'censorship by surrogate,' subcontracting the destruction of freedom. CISA partnered with federal grantees to form the Election Integrity Partnership a hundred days before the 2020 presidential election. That project, along with the efforts of other federal agencies, created an 'unrelenting pressure' with 'the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens,' according to a 2023 ruling by Federal Judge Terry Doughty. What standard did CISA use to determine whether Americans should be muzzled? CISA settled controversies by contacting government employees and 'apparently always assumed the government official was a reliable source,' Judge Doughty noted. Any assertion by officialdom could suffice to justify suppression of comments or posts by private citizens. But when did government I.D. badges become the Oracle of Delphi? During the 2020 presidential election campaign, CISA established a 'Rumor Control' webpage to deal with threats to the election—including rumors that the feds were censoring Americans. CISA targeted for suppression assertions by Americans such as 'mail-in voting is insecure'—despite the long history of absentee ballot fraud. Biden won the presidency in part thanks to Democrats exploiting the covid pandemic to open the floodgates to unverified mail-in ballots. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) declared, 'Twitter was basically an FBI subsidiary before Elon Musk took it over.' Censors act as if truth and lies are both self-evident. But as an investigative journalist hounding federal agencies, I have seen how government minimizes disclosures of its outrageous conduct. On April 19, 1993, 80 people died in a massive fire during an FBI tank assault on the home of the Branch Davidians. On that day, the FBI was adamant that they had nothing to do with the fire and also claimed to possess audiotapes proving the Davidians intentionally committed mass suicide. They never disclosed that proof. But anyone who suggested that the FBI was connected to the fatal fire was derided as an anti-government nut case, if not a public menace. A Los Angeles Times book reviewer practically blamed my criticism of the feds on Waco and other cases for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. But year by year, the FBI’s Waco storyline fell apart. Six years after the fire, a private investigator found proof that the FBI fired pyrotechnic grenades at the Davidians’ home before the fire, obliterating the FBI cover-up. The same pattern of delayed disclosures or leaks annihilated the US government’s credibility on the epidemic of Gulf War syndrome cases in the 1990s, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the glorious triumph for democracy and women’s rights after the US invaded Afghanistan. The 'trickle down' version of truth was also stark in the notorious Duke Lacrosse case. With his persistent, savvy analysis and investigations, Mises editor Bill Anderson heroically helped vanquish a media and prosecutorial lynch mob. Unfortunately, in Germany, and at least sporadically in the United States, 'truth' is whatever the government proclaims. 'Disinformation' is whatever contradicts the latest government pronouncements. It is irrelevant how many false statements politicians or bureaucrats make. Government retains a monopoly on truth and on the right to deceive. Recent censorship schemes vivify how democracy is being turned into a parody: voters choose politicians who then dictate what citizens are permitted to think and say. Censors destroy freedom of thought as well as freedom of speech. Censorship seeks to force each person to live in mental isolation, with no sparks for their thoughts from fellow citizens. Shortly before Hegel’s rise to prominence, German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, 'The external power that deprives man of the freedom to communicate his thoughts publicly, deprives him at the same time of his freedom to think.' By barricading individuals from each other, censors create millions of intellectual Robinson Crusoes, stranded on islands and trying to figure out everything for themselves. Prohibiting citizens from sharing facts of government abuses spawns a bastardized form of sovereign immunity. It minimizes opposition to political power grabs—often until it is too late to resist. Other European nations are as bad or worse than Germany. Britain is notorious for raiding the homes and arresting anyone who makes allegations about immigrants and crime. According to Irish Senator Pauline O’Reilly, government must 'restrict freedoms for the common good' when 'a person’s views on other people’s identities' makes them 'insecure.' Can I demand that government censor anyone who makes me insecure about my identity by mocking my vintage railroad engineer cap? By vastly expanding the definition of 'hate speech,' politicians justify suppressing any views they disapprove. Faith in officialdom to decree truth and punish error exemplifies growing political illiteracy. In earlier eras, Americans were renowned for heartily disdaining politicians who rose to power by making endless bogus promises. Why would any prudent person expect bureaucrats to deliver 'the truth, and nothing but the truth' like FEMA officials coming to the rescue after a flood? If the government can’t be trusted for reliable mail delivery, why in Hades would anyone trust government to judge and safeguard any thoughts citizens choose to share? Do people honestly expect that turning politicians into censors will evoke their inner sainthood? How can freedom of speech or any other freedom survive if so many people fall for so much BS from Washington?

How Hobbies Can Save Us From Over-Specialization – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen As we roll through the middle of February, we’re getting to the point of the year where most people start to abandon their New Year’s resolutions. According to research by Dr. Michelle Rozen, 94% of people fail their resolutions within two months. However, this doesn’t mean resolutions are a bad thing. New Year’s resolutions make good economic sense. People want to improve, but monitoring whether you’ve actually improved in something is costly. As such, using the beginning (and end) of a year as a benchmark provides a low-cost way of ensuring self-monitoring. Maybe many fail, but New Year’s provides a good place to start either way. For many, New Year’s resolutions involve reading more or losing weight. However, I’m noticing an increasing number of people centering their resolutions around hobbies. New Year’s resolutions and hobbies often go hand in hand. Among my friend group, people are pursuing resolutions of improving woodworking skills, learning how to work with glass, and honing jiu-jitsu skills. Recent Pew Research data suggests that, of the people who make resolutions, 55% make resolutions about hobbies. I see hobby-culture as an important part of our increasingly specialized society. While specialization has obvious upsides, we can also find clear downsides to the tendency. Hobbies act as a perfect hedge against the downsides of specialization. The Benefits of Specialization and Why It Matters Specialization as an idea comes at the very beginning of economics as a science. In Adam Smith’s book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, he introduces the idea of a factory that manufactures pins. He argues that if each person learns to make a small part (1/10th) of a pin, they will be much more productive: Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day. Economists have recognized two reasons why specialization improves productivity. Armen Alchian and William Allen present these two arguments in their textbook Universal Economics. The first reason specialization improves productivity is that some producers naturally have a lower production cost. As such, specialization allows individuals to produce that which is the lowest cost for them. For example, a farmer in the US does not have an adequate climate to produce coffee for as low of a cost as a farmer in Honduras. Likewise, the Honduran farmers would have to sacrifice acres perfect for coffee growth in order to grow corn. To remedy these issues, the US farmer can specialize in corn while the Honduran farmer can specialize in coffee, and then the two can trade. The second source of the gains from specialization comes from learning by doing. People improve at just about any action via repetition. The same is true of production. If a tailor is responsible for producing all kinds of clothes, he will have relatively limited time to learn how to produce suit jackets well. If, instead, he only produces suit jackets, it seems reasonable to think this specialization will improve his skills. These benefits of specialization have made it commonplace in the modern world. Whereas historically everyone needed to know how to grow crops, mend clothes, chop down trees, and hunt for food, nowadays most people outsource these roles to experts who specialize in them. It’s unlikely that our society could have risen to its current heights of wealth without specialization. Hobbies: The Antidote to Over-Specialization Libertarian author Robert Heinlein provides a different perspective on specialization in his book Time Enough for Love: A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. What are we to make of Heinlein’s quote here—does this undermine the importance of specialization in society? I don’t think so. Nowhere does this quote imply that specialized jobs are without benefits. Rather, Heinlein appears to be arguing that people should be well-rounded regardless of their careers. Heinlein is saying that every man should be a Renaissance Man. So how can someone whose job it is to program computers learn how to design a building, write a sonnet, or build a wall? Put simply, many of the activities Heinlein lists above are hobbies. Admittedly, some of the things on the above list extend beyond the realm of hobbies (I don’t know any amateur bone-setters), but many people learn these things today through their own interests. One of the benefits of hobbies, then, is that they insure us against the biggest downside of specialization: fragility. If everyone only knows how to do the work associated with his or her own station, what happens if someone doesn’t show up to his station? The whole production process gets stalled. Imagine, for example, if delivery trucks stopped coming to your local grocery store. How would you get food? Likely, many people don’t have a good answer to this question. Those who have taken up hunting or forestry as a hobby likely do have a good answer because they’ve achieved diversification through hobbies. This is an extreme example, to be sure, but it is representative of the downside of specialization and the attendant upside of hobbies. We can imagine a milder example (one that is personally relatable). Let’s say a winter storm strikes and all your local auto repair shops are backed up. The snow causes something on the bottom of your car to become dislodged, and it occasionally scrapes on the pavement. Maybe, once upon a time in history, car owners would know the necessary information to diagnose the problem themselves. However, in the era of specialization, you are used to taking your car to a specialist. What’s the remedy here? Well, you could wait several weeks for an auto repair shop, or you could call on a friend who is a car hobbyist. Your friend might not be a professional, but his experience might be enough to make up for your ignorance. At least that’s how it worked out for me, and this example shows exactly how hobbies build resilience. So if you’re not sure what to do for a resolution this year, get yourself a hobby. Heinlein’s list provides a pretty good idea of where to start. About the author: Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.

The Deep State Wins Again: All The Ways ‘We The People’ Keep Losi...	Almost one month into the Trump presidency, and the Constitution and the entire section on the various branches of government and how they work together are still missing from the White House website. This is no small thing. This omission, deliberate or inadvertent, speaks volumes about the priorities of this current administration. It also explains a lot about the legal mindset that is driving the Trump train, which continues to push forward with a theory of unitary executive power. You know what is not driving the Trump government? Any sense that it is bound by the rule of law, i.e, the U.S. Constitution. As Trump recently declared, 'He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.' Then again, Trump has never made any pretense of his aspirations to rule as a strongman. As the Washington Post reports: In 2017, he claimed 'an absolute right to do what I want with the Justice Department.' In 2019, he claimed that Article II of the Constitution gave him 'the right to do whatever I want as president.' In 2020, he said he could override state and local public health orders related to the coronavirus pandemic by saying: 'When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that’s the way it’s got to be. It’s total.' In 2022, he said that purported voter fraud in the 2020 election 'allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.' In 2023, he mused that he would be a dictator, but only on Day One of his presidency. And a year ago, he argued that presidents should have total immunity from criminal prosecution, even for 'EVENTS THAT ‘CROSS THE LINE.’ ' Listen, when someone shows you who they are, believe them. Then again, maybe the majority of Americans just don’t care about the Constitution anymore. Maybe, as journalist Zeynep Tufekci suggests, Americans want an authoritarian leader who embraces an 'ends-justify-the-means leadership style.' Maybe all they care about are the 'endless wins' that the Trump administration never ceases to claim for itself, but if we’re being brutally honest about the state of the country, 'we the people' are on a solid losing streak. While the team colors and the police state’s outward allegiances may have changed, from a constitutional perspective, we’re still losing in all the ways that matter, and the Deep State is still winning. Indeed, far from protecting our freedoms, the Trump administration is taking the Deep State’s unconstitutional disregard for civil liberties to new extremes. When you step away from the polarizing rhetoric and government spin long enough to look at the many ways in which the American police state is continuing to lockdown our freedoms, you’ll notice that not much has changed for the better. Has the Trump administration put an end to the police state’s use of surveillance on the American people? Has it scaled back the deployment of military forces domestically in violation of Posse Comitatus? Has it ceased the government’s war on cash? Has it stepped back from the NDAA’s threat of indefinite detentions? Has it de-militarized the police? Has it kicked the oligarchs out of the government’s inner circle? Has it been transparent and accountable in all of its dealings? The answer to all of those questions is a resounding 'no.' Rather than minimizing the power of the police state, the Trump administration appears to be doubling down on its commitment to police state tactics of fear, intimidation and brutality. Consider for yourselves. Free speech is still being undermined. The First Amendment prohibits the government from suppressing free speech activities by the public, the media, protesters, religious individuals, or by restricting the right of the people to assemble and associate with one another, yet we no longer have any real freedom of speech. We are moving fast down a slippery slope to an authoritarian society in which the only opinions, ideas and speech expressed are the ones permitted by the government and its corporate cohorts. In more and more cases, the government is declaring war on what should be protected political speech whenever it challenges the government’s power, reveals the government’s corruption, exposes the government’s lies, and encourages the citizenry to push back against the government’s many injustices. The ramifications are so far-reaching as to render almost every American who criticizes the government an extremist in word, deed, thought or by association. Although President Trump issued an executive order denouncing government censorship, primarily for speech with which he agrees, his administration has ostensibly engaged in a campaign of intimidation and coercion against news organizations that dare to disagree with or criticize his administration, as well as whistleblowers. Likewise, under the guise of fighting politically correct DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies and cancel culture, the Trump administration is engaging in its own campaign to cancel out expressive activities and content of which it disapproves, including anti-war protests. We’re still being subjected to expansive surveillance. All of the monitoring tools and weapons in the government’s surveillance arsenal that are being used to identify, track and target those on the Trump’s administration’s enemies list—facial recognition, biometrics, license plate readers, fusion centers, cell phone location tracking, etc.—can and will be used against the American people. AI surveillance harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and widespread surveillance technology to do what the police state lacks the manpower and resources to do efficiently or effectively: be everywhere, watch everyone and everything, monitor, identify, catalogue, cross-check, cross-reference, and collude. Everything that was once private is now up for grabs to the right buyer. With every new AI surveillance technology that is adopted and deployed without any regard for privacy, Fourth Amendment rights and due process, the rights of the citizenry are being marginalized, undermined and eviscerated. The government’s police powers are still being weaponized. With Trump claiming the power to target anyone or any group he perceives as a 'threat,' i.e., an 'enemy from within,' anyone who disagrees with the government could be placed on a government watch list. Having transformed local law enforcement into extensions of the military, the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI are turning the nation’s police officers into techno-warriors, complete with iris scanners, body scanners, thermal imaging Doppler radar devices, facial recognition programs, license plate readers, cell phone extraction software, Stingray devices and so much more. Government whistleblowers are still being persecuted. While claiming to be rooting out inefficiency, the Trump administration has been methodically dismantling all of the agencies charged with acting as nonpartisan watchdogs of government corruption. Americans are still being treated as suspects. The groundwork has been laid for a new kind of government where it won’t matter if you’re innocent or guilty, whether you’re a threat to the nation, or even if you’re a citizen. What will matter is what the government—or whoever happens to be calling the shots at the time—thinks. And if the powers-that-be think you’re a threat to the nation and should be locked up, then you’ll be locked up with no access to the protections our Constitution provides. Having launched a precrime programduring his first administration, the Trump administration would have no qualms about using AI predictive and surveillance technologies to classify, segregate and flag the populace. We’re still unofficially under martial law. We have what the founders feared most: a 'standing' or permanent army on American soil. This de facto standing army is made up of weaponized, militarized domestic police forces which look like, dress like, and act like the military; are armed with guns, ammunition and military-style equipment; are authorized to make arrests; and are trained in military tactics. With Trump having pledged to deploy the military domestically to work in conjunction with local police to address domestic threats, including political enemies, dissenters and immigrants, the American homeland is increasingly being transformed into a battlefield. We’re still being flagged based on our viewpoints, activities and associations. The government has a growing list—shared with fusion centers and law enforcement agencies—of ideologies, behaviors, affiliations and other characteristics that could flag someone as suspicious and result in their being labeled potential enemies of the state. Before long, every household in America will be flagged as a threat and assigned a threat score. It’s just a matter of time before you find yourself wrongly accused, investigated and confronted by police based on a data-driven algorithm or risk assessment culled together by a computer program run by artificial intelligence. Police shootings of unarmed citizens will continue. In the wake of Trump’s decision to reverse and revoke many of the policies intended to implement police reform and discourage police misconduct and stem the time of police brutality, we can expect the use of excessive force by police to continue unabated. We still don’t have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called 'economic elite.' Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. In other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism—a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. We still have an imperial president. Although President Trump has made no secret of his authoritarian impulses, he is not the first president to rule by fiat through the use of executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements. These unchecked powers enable all sitting president to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution. In other words, the seeds of chaos are still being sown, and it’s the U.S. government that will reap the harvest. My friends, if this is winning, I can’t imagine what losing will look like, but it won’t be pretty. All of this dismantling of government agencies, weakening of the economy, and fomenting of civil unrest feeds right back into the Deep State’s plot to destabilize the nation. Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command which anticipated that all hell would break loose by 2030? That’s barely five short years away now, but we’re being moved steadily in that direction. According to 'Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,' the U.S. military plans to use armed forces to solve future domestic political and social problems. What they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security. The training video is only five minutes long, but it says a lot about the government’s mindset, the way its views the citizenry, and the so-called 'problems' that the government must be prepared to address in the near future through the use of martial law. Even more troubling, however, is what this military video doesn’t say about the Constitution, about the rights of the citizenry, and about the dangers of locking down the nation and using the military to address political and social problems. Be warned: in the future envisioned by the government, we will not be viewed as Republicans or Democrats. Rather, 'we the people' will be enemies of the state. For years, the government has been warning against the dangers of domestic terrorism, erecting surveillance systems to monitor its own citizens, creating classification systems to label any viewpoints that challenge the status quo as extremist, and training law enforcement agencies to equate anyone possessing anti-government views as a domestic terrorist. What the government failed to explain was that the domestic terrorists would be of the government’s own making, and that 'we the people' would become enemy #1. We’re already enemies of the state. You want to bring about real change? Start by wresting back control of our government from the oligarchs, technocrats and Deep State operatives who are still running the show. Reject the propaganda and the polarizing rhetoric and the 'us vs. them' tactics that reduce the mass power of the populace to warring, powerless factions. Find common ground with your fellow citizens and push back against the government’s brutality, inhumanity, greed, corruption and power grabs. Be dangerous in the best way possible: by thinking for yourself, by refusing to be silenced, by choosing sensible solutions over political expediency and bureaucracy. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the solution to what ails this country is really not that complicated: decency, compassion, common sense, generosity balanced by fiscal responsibility, fairness, a commitment to freedom principles, and a firm rejection of the craven, partisan politics of the Beltway elites who have laid the groundwork for the Deep State’s ongoing authoritarian coup d’etat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX7ZbZUArG_AE	2025-02-19T16:39:34-08:00	
The Trump-Musk Cultural Revolution – OpEd	The aging leader wanted to shake up his country, so he launched a second revolution with the help of a cadre of young people. Drunk with power, the leader targeted his enemies, remade his political party, and turned his own government into a self-destructing circus. Anyone with real expertise was sent far away from the political center. Intellectuals of all kinds came under suspicion. And the young people who rose up in support of the aging leader ran roughshod through society. They might not seem to have a lot in common, Mao Zedong and Donald Trump. The Communist leader, having come to power through a revolutionary war, harbored a visceral hatred for capitalism. The American businessman shirked military service, won the presidency (twice) through democratic elections, and harbors a visceral hatred for communism. And yet, Trump is currently involved in a cultural revolution as thoroughgoing in its ambitions and potential destructiveness as what Mao unleashed in China in the mid-1960s. You Say You Want a Revolution? At one level, what Donald Trump and his minions are doing is regime change, as Anne Applebaum has argued. They aren’t reforming U.S. government. They are transforming its operating system, courtesy of Elon Musk and his inaptly named Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Regime change is certainly part of the Trump game plan. He has borrowed this strategy from Viktor Orban, who turned Hungary’s political system based on liberal principles into a patronage system run along illiberal lines. The Orban transformation relied on a compliant legislature that allowed him to concentrate power in the executive. Once a leading liberal, the Hungarian leader knew how to deconstruct the Hungarian political system from the inside by stacking the courts, suppressing civil society, and controlling a right-wing media. You’d think that regime change would be enough for Trump. He is a man of unpredictable utterances but rather constrained ambitions. He wants to punish his enemies, reward his friends, stay out of jail, and secure his financial and political legacy. Those around Trump, however, are pushing for something more extreme. They have cast him in the role of the Great Helmsman—Mao’s favorite moniker—who steers American society into turbulent, uncharted waters. Team MAGA wants a 'second American Revolution' that roots out all vestiges of progressivism, liberalism, and secularism and that 'will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,' according to Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation. By 'left,' Roberts means anyone who follows the Constitution, acknowledges the importance of international law, and has a moral conscience. This more revolutionary program owes much to Chairman Mao who, in 1966, decided that Chinese society was so infected with various strains of reformism (capitalism, liberalism, traditionalism) that it, too, needed another revolution. On top of that, Mao unleashed the power of populism—the 'masses' in the vernacular of that time and place—to eliminate his political enemies. 'It was a power struggle waged… behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement,' writes Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans. In the 1950s, after the country’s first revolution, Chinese society remained fundamentally conservative. The economy was primarily agrarian and Confucianism was still strong, particularly in the countryside. China was also elitist, with a Communist leader like Zhou Enlai born into the mandarin class and Mao himself coming from wealthy landowning stock. The Communists didn’t just aspire to change China’s governance. They wanted to turn Chinese society into something considerably more urban, industrial, secular, literate, and egalitarian. The change would be violent, if necessary, because Mao believed that 'revolution was not a dinner party' (one wonders if Kevin Roberts has a copy of the Little Red Book on his bedside table). At first, Mao relied on the Party and its repressive institutions to effect change. By the mid-1950s, he launched an effort at reform, the Thousand Flowers Campaign, that spiraled out of the Party’s control, which generated the backlash of the Anti-Rightist Campaign. That was, in turn, followed by the disastrous economic experiments of the Great Leap Forward. These whiplash changes in policy created considerable anxiety among the Chinese leadership that the Party, and the revolution more generally, was losing its hold over the population, which understandably didn’t know where to turn. Mao ultimately decided that only another revolution could break the country’s ties with its past. The agents of Mao’s Cultural Revolution were the Red Guards, teenagers who heeded Mao’s call for transformation by taking the law into their own hands. They attacked capitalist-roaders, 'bourgeois' teachers, and ultimately each other. Chinese society descended into such chaos that some people even fled over the border into North Korea, which was seen as a place of relative sanity. That’s how violent, unpredictable, and apocalyptic China was during the Cultural Revolution, which lasted nearly a decade until Mao’s death in 1976. Trumpists have their counterpart to Mao’s desire for revolutionary transformation: a plan to destroy everything in the federal government except the royal presidency and the Pentagon, and privatize everything in the country that has a tinge of the public to it. The Trumpian equivalents of the Red Guards are a motley crew. There’s 'Big Balls,' 19-year-old Edward Coristine, a DOGE-employed hacker who, among other questionable ventures, administers 'an AI-powered Discord bot operating in Russia.' Then there’s 25-year-old Marco Elez, a DOGE staffer who resigned after the revelation of his racist tweets (but whom Musk has promised to rehire). The parallel with China is not precise, since there are plenty of non-teenagers who are involved in this insurrection, including the middle-aged January 6 rioter Peter Marocco, who is slated to head up USAID. Whatever their age, however, these Trumpists are true believers, enthusiastically feeding democracy into the woodchipper. Mao, of course, wanted to pull China into a modern future. Trump and company promise something more high-tech, but they are really more interested in dragging the United States back to an imagined past. Why Trumpians Take Culture Seriously The Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not just a response to some recent fad. They are, as in China, an effort to radically revamp the very culture. Since the 1960s, the United States has become a more inclusive country, which has necessarily meant that white men have lost some part of their privileged positions in education, employment, and entertainment. By the 2000s, the United States still had a long way to go, but in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, anti-racism books were on the best-seller list, major corporations were examining their hiring and promoting policies, and educational institutions were finally beginning to address structural racism. Cultural transformations always move two steps forward and one step backward. In this case, the backlash has been much more intense, with Trump and company eager to rewind the clock to before the various civil rights movements, back even before the Fourteenth Amendment that added birthright citizenship to the Constitution in 1868. The Trump administration has tried to impose gender categories that define the trans community out of existence. It is restricting abortion access at home and abroad, fulfilling the candidate’s promise to help women 'whether they like it or not.' In the same way that Mao tried to make everything in China public—business, meals, child-rearing—Trump wants to privatize everything from schools to the post office. He is opening up government to conservative Christians, and religious institutions are poised to claw back as much public power as they can get. Mao thought that he was pushing with history’s tide. China’s current capitalist trajectory suggests otherwise, even though the regime change implemented by the Communist Party has remained more or less intact. The Party remains in charge, but the culture shows few enduring influences of the Cultural Revolution. With far-right politicians on the rise around the world, Trump and Musk similarly believe that they are on the cutting edge of change. But mass deportations and boosted birthrates among 'tradwives' won’t prevent America from losing its white-majority status in about 20 years. DEI is no fad. It is an accurate reflection of demographics. And short of imposing totalitarian control and setting up concentration camps, the MAGA crowd won’t be able to alter this trajectory. Welcome Back to 2025 This is not the first time I’ve written about the parallels between Trump and Mao’s Cultural Revolution. In 2022, safely ensconced in the Biden era but plagued by nightmares of the future, I wrote an article entitled 'The Terrifying World of 2025' for TomDispatch. It was/is a world of mass deportations, where 'Social Security checks and Medicare benefits have been delayed because the federal bureaucracy has shrunk to near invisibility.' Here was my look into the future, which is now our present: On his first day in office, the president signaled his new policy by authorizing a memorial on the Capitol grounds to the 'patriots' of January 6th and commissioning a statue of the QAnon shaman for the Rotunda. He then appointed people to his cabinet who not only lacked the expertise to manage their departments but were singularly devoted to destroying the bureaucracies beneath them, not to speak of the country itself. He put militia leaders in key Defense Department roles and similarly filled the courts with extremists more suited to playing reality-show judges than real life ones. In all of this, the president has been aided by a new crop of his very own legislators, men and women who know nothing about Congress and actively flouted its rules and traditions even as they made the MAGA caucus the dominant voting bloc. My piece focused on one part of this nightmare scenario—the dispatch of all newly unemployed federal employees, academics, and journalists to take the jobs vacated by deported immigrants. That has yet to take place, but Musk’s acquisition of all federal data could serve as the basis for a MAGA Corps of workers that fill the gaps in the private sector. The Trump team is currently stress-testing U.S. democracy to see where and how it breaks. Perhaps if we can hold the line here, in these opening months of the Trump-Musk cultural revolution, we can avoid all the mayhem and destruction that China experienced in the 1960s. Back in 2022, I was not optimistic in my crystal-ball-gazing: I know this nightmare won’t end overnight. China’s Cultural Revolution stretched on for nearly a decade and resulted in as many as two million dead. Our now-captive media doesn’t report on the growing violence in this country, but we’ve heard rumors about mobs attacking a courageous podcaster in Georgia and vigilantes targeting a lone abortion provider in Texas. Things might get a lot worse before they get better. Things could indeed get a lot worse. The mass deportations haven’t begun in earnest. The courts have hit pause on a number of Trump’s more egregious moves. The worst of the new Cabinet members—Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have yet to make their marks. But I’d like to believe that Trump and Musk, for all the power they currently deploy, are basically spitting into the wind. But it’s up to us, with every breath we take, to make sure that all that ugly spittle ends up back on the face of MAGA.

Excluded From Talks, Bruised By Trump, Zelenskyy Calls For ‘More ...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- With the most consequential talks his country has faced in decades proceeding without his country’s involvement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy punched back -- at doubters, at Russia, and, most notably, at U.S. President Donald Trump. At a news conference in Kyiv on February 18, Zelenskyy tried to reclaim a narrative that has been spinning out of his reach this week, as senior U.S. and Russian officials met for the first time since before Russia’s launched its all-out onslaught on Ukraine three years ago. And he sharply criticized the Trump administration – an unusually pointed swipe directed at Kyiv’s biggest supplier of weaponry and military equipment. 'I believe that the United States helped Putin to break out of years of isolation,' Zelenskyy said. 'All of this has no positive impact on Ukraine.' Trump, he charged, is pushing 'a lot of information that is coming from Russia.' Anxiety is spiking in Kyiv – not to mention in many supportive European capitals – as Washington and Moscow moved forward this week to lay the groundwork for a possible peace settlement to end the war. Adding further to the angst: comments, a day earlier, by Trump, who falsely suggested that Ukraine had started the war and, also inaccurately, that Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular among Ukrainians. He also said that a new presidential election should be held. Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy again on February 19, calling him a 'dictator' and suggesting he must agree to a peace deal soon. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Here’s what you need to know-- not only about Zelenskyy’s news conference but what is shaping up to be one of the most trying weeks of his wartime leadership. Zelenskyy: Outside Looking In Zelenskyy had been scheduled to fly to the Saudi capital of Riyadh on February 19 a day after top U.S. and Russian officials met face-to-face to lay the groundwork for peace talks. Those were the first formal high-level talks between Washington and Moscow since before the February 2022 invasion. Despite some assurances, and calls from European leaders, to make sure Ukrainian officials are involved in the negotiations, Ukraine has pointedly been left out – at least this initial stage. Hours after the U.S.-Russian talks wrapped up on February 18, Zelenskyy, on a previously planned trip to Turkey, made clear his position – and his displeasure. 'Decisions on how to end the war in Ukraine cannot be made without Ukraine, nor can any conditions be imposed,' he told reporters. 'We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us, I think for many others as well.' Trump Disses Zelenskyy If the launch of direct U.S.-Russian talks without Ukraine wasn’t disturbing enough for Zelenskyy, Trump’s blistering criticism likely was. 'Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,' Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. 'They had a seat at the table for three years,' Trump said, referring to Ukraine. 'When they are worried about not being seated, they could have made a deal long ago.' 'I like him personally,' he said, referring to Zelenskyy, 'but it is the leadership that allowed the war to go on.' Russia in fact started the all-out war on February 24, 2022, sending tens of thousands of troops across the border after months of military buildup and threats aimed directly at Kyiv. They included ultimatums to shrink its army, commit to neutrality, and recognize Russia-backed forces who had seized power in the part of the eastern Donbas region in 2014 with direct military and other support from Moscow. It wasn’t entirely clear what talks or 'table' Trump was referencing, but there have been no negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow since the first few months after the February 2022 invasion. Those talks produced drafts of a potential deal but petered out late that April, as the sides wrangled over points of dispute after revelations of alleged Russian war crimes emerged in the town of Bucha. In his comments on February 18, Trump also asserted that Zelenskyy was now deeply unpopular, and he suggested that the country must hold elections. 'We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law…in Ukraine,' Trump said. 'And the leader of Ukraine, I hate to say it, he’s down at 4 percent approval rating. In fact, a poll released earlier this month that compared possible candidates for the presidency found that Zelenskyy’s trust ratings remained in the double digits, though he lagged behind Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief who is now ambassador to Britain, and two other public figures. A separate survey released February 19 by the respected Kyiv International Institute for Sociology, showed that Zelenskyy’s trust rating had climbed to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in December. Zelenskyy used his Kyiv news conference to accuse Trump of parroting Russia’s positions on the causes and the conditions of the war. 'As we are talking about 4 percent, we have seen this disinformation, we understand it's coming from Russia,' Zelenskyy told reporters. 'We have evidence that these figures are being discussed between America and Russia,' Zelenskyy said, though he did not describe the evidence. 'Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly, is living in this disinformation bubble.' The issue of new elections in Ukraine is complex. The country is indeed under martial law, declared by Zelenskyy shortly after the start of the invasion and prolonged repeatedly since then, which precludes holding voting. Moreover, the logistics of organizing balloting and voting precinct at a time of war – never mind in territories currently occupied by Russia – is near impossible. Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the issue to bash Zelenskyy; on the eve of the Riyadh talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov once again questioned the Ukrainian president’s 'legitimacy.' While Zelenskyy remains broadly popular, as Ukrainians have rallied around a wartime leader, Ukrainians are also exhausted and in some cases frustrated by government decision on issues like manpower. Some prominent political figures, such as former President Petro Poroshenko, have made signals that they might mount a challenge to Zelenskyy if an election were held. Zelenskyy said Trump’s comments parroted the Russian remarks. 'I would like President Trump’s team to have more truth,' Zelenskyy said. Kellogg’s In Town Zelenskiy’s news conference on February 19 came shortly before he was scheduled to meet with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. Kellogg did not attend the Riyadh talks, and it’s unclear how central he will be to Trump’s thinking as negotiations coalesce. However, he has voiced at times a relatively hard line toward Moscow. Arriving at a Kyiv train station, Kellogg said his visit was 'a chance to have some good, substantial talks.' 'We understand the need for security guarantees,' he said. 'It’s very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well,' he said. 'Part of my mission is to sit and listen.'

Nenad Nesic: The Rise And Dramatic Fall Of Bosnia’s Former Securi...	By Azem Kurtic Over two decades, Nenad Nesic went from police officer to politician to one of the most powerful cabinet ministers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His relentless rise and growing real estate portfolio were shadowed by allegations of corruption. As a young police officer, Nenad Nesic used to put people behind bars. Now, Bosnia’s former security minister is the one sitting in a cell. In just under two decades, the 46-year-old went from police cadet to the civilian head of Bosnia’s security agencies, while simultaneously amassing an impressive real estate portfolio worth millions of euros. Last year, he claimed never to have taken a bank loan. 'I bought everything legally,' he said. 'With my own earnings. I have a salary, you have all the records, I paid for everything legally through the bank where I receive my salary. I paid for everything without a loan.' The money might not have come from the bank, but prosecutors say it wasn’t from Nesic’s salary either. On December 26, Nesic was arrested on charges of corruption, abuse of office, money laundering and bribe-taking during his tenure as acting director of the public road company in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s predominantly Serb-populated Republika Srpska entity. He resigned in January, on 'moral grounds'. Prosecutors allege Nesic put pressure on road maintenance companies to buy materials from a private company called Legend. Six others were also arrested. Nesic’s Democratic People’s Alliance, DNS party, which he leads, condemned the case against him as 'politically motivated'. DNS senior official Darko Banjac said his arrest was 'part of a broader political pressure campaign against the Serb people'. In his resignation letter, Nesic said that 'I do not acknowledge the commission of the criminal offence for which I am in detention. I will prove my innocence in the court proceedings ahead.' Climb to power According to Nesic’s official biography, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Novi Sad in northern Serbia in 2005, becoming a police trainee in East Sarajevo, Bosnia, where he was born. Nesic climbed to the rank of inspector, though there is little available public information on his role or performance during the period up to 2014, when he swapped his police uniform for suit and joined the DNS. Again, he climbed the ladder, first becoming head of the East Sarajevo municipal branch of the party, before finally being elected party leader in 2020. In October 2022, Nesic ran unsuccessfully for the Serb post on Bosnia’s tripartite presidency. When the DNS joined the state-level government, he became security minister, the Bosnian equivalent of interior minister or Britain’s home secretary. Nesic’s appointment was not without controversy, after he failed security checks conducted by the State Intelligence Agency, OSA, and yet still enjoyed access to classified information in his role in charge of the police, border service, OSA and other agencies. It was around this time that Nesic went from critic of Republika Srpska strongman Milorad Dodik to outspoken defender, calling the entity president’s ongoing trial before the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina – for flouting the decisions of the international community’s Bosnia peace overseer – 'an attack on the Republika Srpska and the Serb people'. More controversy came in October 2024, when Nesic’s security detail was reported to authorities for allegedly breaking the arm of an off-duty Sarajevo police officer while trying to clear a path for the minister’s motorcade through the city’s rush-hour traffic. Corruption allegations The charges against Nesic stem from his time as acting director of Roads of Republika Srpska, between 2016 and 2020. According to prosecutors, during this period Nesic took a total of one million Bosnian marks in bribes, or roughly half a million euros. It started, prosecutors say, when a company called Romanijaputevi won a tender worth two million marks, and its director, Milan Pandurevic, was allegedly told 'to allocate ten per cent of the tender value to Roads of RS for their needs'. Prosecutors say the money was funnelled to Nesic. They also allege that firms contracted to maintain Republika Srpska’s road were instructed to buy materials exclusively from Legend, whose director was Mladen Lucic. 'The money was then funnelled back into the hands of Nenad Nesic through Lucic,' the prosecution said. 'This was carried out in cafés, offices, parking lots, rest stops, and restaurants in Jahorina [mountain area near Sarajevo]. This continued while Nesic was the director of Roads of Republika Srpska.' A five-year investigation, involving wiretaps and physical surveillance, culminated in the arrests of Nesic, Legend owner Lucic and the current acting director of Roads of RS, Milan Dakic, all of whom remain in custody. Three other executives at Roads of RS – Srdjan Mijatovic, Cvijetin Milivojevic, and Mladen Cajic – were also arrested. Pandurevic, of Romanijaputevi, was taken in for questioning the same day but released that evening. Real estate empire As acting director of Roads of Republika Srpska, Nesic’s salary was roughly 1,500 euros per month. As security minister, he earned some 2,800 euros per month. Yet somehow, he, his wife and his brother, Predrag, amassed a total of 17 properties or plots in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro, including two apartments in a luxury marina for superyachts called Porto Montenegro in Tivat, Montenegro, according to his official property declaration when he became a minister. Similar apartments in the complex are listed for sale at more than a million euros each. Nesic also owns properties in the Montenegrin coastal town of Budva, in East Sarajevo and Novi Sad, his property declaration revealed. His wife, Maja, owns 10,000 sqm of land in Serbia, while his brother, Predrag, owns an apartment in the Montenegrin coastal town of Herceg Novi and land in Sarajevo, East Ilidza and East Sarajevo. Nesic’s assets also include the companies N-Group d.o.o., led by his wife, N Trade d.o.o., owned by his brother, and DAR, owned by his father. He also has a BMW and a Mercedes. Of these companies, only N Trade is in the black. Its profits soared from 30,000 in 2021 to almost 1.2 million euros in 2022. Nesic was not at home when police came knocking on December 26. He handed himself in at the police station in East Sarajevo where he began his career. He told waiting reporters: 'I love you Republika Srpska, and I will never stop fighting for you.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LKrlxG7vNvOO	2025-02-19T16:34:53-08:00	
EU Forges Ahead With ‘Independent’ Russia Sanctions Policy Amid M...	By Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- EU envoys agreed on a further round of sanctions on Russia on Wednesday amid conflicting signals from the United States about the future of Washington’s own regime of restrictive measures aimed at Moscow. The new sanctions package – the EU’s 16th since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – includes import bans on aluminium, export restrictions on chromium and other items used to produce factory equipment, and the removal of multiple Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system. It also includes additional measures to clamp down on Russia’s circumvention of the G7’s oil price cap, which limits the sale of Russian seaborne oil to $60 per barrel. The move, which came the day after US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia to discuss an end to the three-year-long Ukraine war, followed a meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels at which officials reaffirmed their support for the bloc’s current sanctions policy. One European official familiar with Tuesday’s discussions said that it is 'very likely' that the EU’s sanctions policy 'could evolve independently' of the US over the coming months, as it remains unclear what course US President Donald Trump might steer after his initial steps toward patching up ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I did not detect any reduction in commitment to the implementation of our sanctions package,' the official said. 'And therefore I don't see it likely that if the US was to go in a different direction we would follow.' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had initially suggested after his meeting with Russian officials on Tuesday that Washington could ease sanctions on Moscow as part of any ceasefire arrangement – and hinted that the EU might be compelled to follow suit. 'Sanctions are all the result of this conflict,' Rubio said, noting that 'in order to bring an end to any conflict there has to be concessions made by all sides'. 'But there are other parties that have sanctions,' he added. 'The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.' But Bloomberg subsequently reported that Rubio had privately informed several European counterparts that Washington would maintain its raft of sanctions on Moscow until the war is over, citing people familiar with the matter. A State Department spokesperson also confirmed on Tuesday that Rubio had briefed ministers from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, 'immediately' after the meeting in Riyadh. 'The group agreed to remain in close contact as we work to achieve a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine,' the spokesperson said. The EU's sanctions require unanimous support among the EU's 27 member states and must be renewed every six months. One EU diplomat noted that Trump's close relationship with Hungary's Viktor Orbán – who has repeatedly denounced the EU's sanctions – could lead to 'problems' if Washington pressured Brussels to lift sanctions on Moscow. 'If this scenario would happen [where] Trump asked EU to ease up with the sanctions, I'm pretty sure that there will be at least one head of state who will be willing to do that,' the diplomat said. A controversial confiscation Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, also said on Tuesday that Warsaw is sticking with its controversial push to confiscate the €210 billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in the EU. Such a move has been fiercely resisted by Belgium, where the vast majority of the assets are based. Belgian leaders have argued that seizing the assets is legally dubious and could threaten the financial stability of the eurozone. Confiscation is, however, staunchly supported by many Eastern European countries and was also strongly endorsed by the previous US administration led by Joe Biden. The profits generated by these assets are currently being used to finance a $50 billion loanto Kyiv, following an agreement last year by G7 countries. 'Of course, we do believe that these assets should be used to benefit Ukraine and not only the profits, but also the assets [themselves],' Domański said at a Bloomberg-hosted event. 'Having said that, of course, there are countries that express their position which is different,' he added. 'So we are in ongoing discussions – it would be premature to say what could be the end for that.' European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, who has also repeatedly refusedto rule out seizing the assets, also suggested yesterday that the EU’s sanctions policy could evolve independently of the US. 'I think it's very clear with the moves of the current Trump administration that EU will need to take issues related to its security more [into] its own hands,' he said, adding that this 'also concerns sanctions policy'. The EU has banned €91.2 billion worth of imports from Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as €48 billion in exports, according to the European Commission. The new sanctions package is set to be formally endorsed by EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LD_7JE5fHT_C	2025-02-19T16:32:01-08:00	
‘Time Is Running Out’ For Jailed Pro-Democracy Media Mogul Jimmy ...	By Alice Yam The son of jailed pro-democracy media magnate Jimmy Lai has warned that 'time is running out' for his father’s health, and called on Britain and the United States to push for his release. 'His body is breaking down ... It’s akin to torture,' Sebastien Lai told Reuters ahead of the Human Rights and Democracy summit in Geneva on Feb. 18. 'Time is running out for my father.' Lai, 77, has spent more than 1,500 days behind bars, and is diabetic. He is a British citizen. In jail since his arrest in December 2020, Lai is currently standing trial for 'collusion with foreign forces' under Hong Kong’s National Security Law. He has also been handed separate sentences for lighting a candle and praying for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, for irregularities in the use of his newspaper’s office space, and for taking part in the 2019 protests. Sebastien Lai called on global leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump — who has pledged to help get Lai out of jail — and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to take urgent action, as his father faces his fourth year of solitary confinement. 'We are incredibly grateful that [Trump] said that. It gives us a lot of hope,' Sebastien Lai said, but called for a stronger response from the United Kingdom. 'If (Britain) wants to normalize relations, they shouldn’t normalize citizens being arrested for standing up for democracy,' he said. The Hong Kong government told Reuters that Hong Kong 'strongly disapproves of and rejects misinformation and smearing remarks made by Sebastien Lai,' while China’s permanent mission in Geneva described the claims about Lai’s health as 'slanderous.' Sebastien Lai called on governments to 'champion' his father, who decided not to flee the city when Beijing imposed the first of two national security laws in 2020, despite knowing he’d be a target. 'He refused to leave,' he told Voice of America. 'Six decades after landing on the shore of this island in pursuit of freedom, he decided to stay and stand with his fellow protesters.' Human rights groups say Lai’s trial is a 'sham' and part of a broad crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong that has all but destroyed its reputation as the only place in Greater China where the rule of law and freedoms of speech and assembly were preserved. In November 2024, a Hong Kong court jailed 45 democracy supporters at the end of the city’s biggest national security trial to date. Those sentences drew international condemnation and calls for further sanctions on Hong Kong and the expansion of lifeboat visa schemes for those fleeing the political crackdown in the city.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LNXJS0wx9yAF	2025-02-19T16:27:12-08:00	
The Fall Of Eric Adams – OpEd	Eric Adams has a multitude of legal and political problems that have ended any political ambitions he may have had. Donald Trump may have kept him from going to jail, but in seeking a lifeline from a president hated by most New Yorkers, he has sealed his fate and will go down in history as the anti-Black, Black mayor. New York City residents are wondering if mayor Eric Adams will resign, or be removed from office by the governor, or be summoned to an Inability Committee , or limp along ineffectively until his term ends on December 31, 2025. The city’s mayoralty is hanging by a thread with four Deputy Mayors resigning, and top staff under indictment or leaving. Depending on a judge’s ruling, Adams may no longer be under indictment himself because Donald Trump interceded with the United States Attorney on his behalf. So egregious was the action that six prosecutors with solid republican bona fides resigned rather than sign onto the obvious travesty of justice. Adams denies agreeing to any quid pro quo with Trump but it is hard to believe him after his appearance on Fox and Friends with border czar Tom Homan. Homan felt quite comfortable beating up on the embattled mayor. 'If he doesn’t come through … I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city, the city that the people of New York love. Where the hell is the agreement we came to?' What was the agreement that caused Adams to humiliate himself on national television? He has promised to work with the Trump administration’s mass deportation plan and, in so doing, will end New York’s adherence to so-called sanctuary city status, which prevents city agencies from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). No one should think of New York as being free from ICE enforcement because of sanctuary city virtue signaling. New York City is home to an ICE detention facility and New Yorkers can be and are deported on a regular basis. But those facts are inconvenient and the Trump administration obsession with deportation photo opportunities gives the appearance that he is the first president to ever deport anyone. Adams is charged with taking bribes and using straw donors , which included illegal donations from foreigners, to inflate his campaign contributions using New York City’s generous matching program, and netting his campaign a cool $10 million. While the judge hearing his case has still not officially dismissed it, Adams is believed to have escaped a trial and any jail time that might have resulted from a conviction. Others indicted on the same charges have already pleaded guilty . They will face conviction and possible jail time even if Adams succeeds in walking free. New York City’s second Black mayor is not only facing serious accusations, but he is no friend to the nearly 2 million Black residents he governs. The existence of ineffectual and compromised Black elected officials is not a new phenomenon. Adams stands out because of his policies which are so obviously harmful to Black people. Until recently the Adams administration took more than 30 days to process Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP) and other public assistance applications, a violation of law and a cause of great suffering to low income people. Adams has also been slow to close the notorious Rikers Island jail, in defiance of the demands of a federal monitor. He did find time to be baptized at Rikers Island by none other than Al Sharpton in a Good Friday ceremony but he has stymied every effort at improving conditions there and eventually closing the facility. The New York Police Department (NYPD) remains a pet agency, allowed to violate the rules the mayor sets for others, including exceeding its overtime budget by $100 million . Adams fought against efforts to minimize the imposition of cash bail and worked with the governor to undo a process which impacted Black people more than any other group. Now under indictment himself, Adams bragged that other people presumed innocent should sit in jail because they lacked money to post a bond. When Luigi Mangione , the accused shooter of an insurance company executive was extradited to New York, Adams joined in the perp walk and trampled on Mangione’s presumption of innocence as he has done with others. 'I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city, the city that the people of New York love.' The right wing New York Post endorsed his 2021 campaign and the mayor made good on Rupert Murdoch’s seal of approval by constantly harping on crime as an issue even after major crimes decreased. He is so devoted to the state of Israel that he visits whenever that nation is in the midst of genocidal activity and in need of public relations campaigns to cover up its war crimes. Adams even mused about retiring to the occupied Golan Heights. Adams praised acquitted subway killer Daniel Penny who walked free after he choked a Black homeless Black man on a subway train. Adams said, 'You have someone [Penny] on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city.' The hopefully soon to be former mayor also brought back the stop and friskpolicies which victimized so many Black New Yorkers. Other Black politicians go through the motions of meeting the needs of their Black constituents and speaking to their issues of concern. But Adams made it clear that the needs of conservative white New Yorkers would be his priority. While others make phony progressive promises, Adams panders to a group unlikely to support any other Black politician. Amidst the drama of his legal woes he met with republican leadership, presumably to seek their endorsement to run on their party’s ballot line. While he ultimately decided against this ploy, Adams is completely discredited. A small coterie of clergy will show up at a press conference to show support, but politically speaking, Adams is a dead man walking. While current and past office holders have already announced they are vying to sit in the mayor’s office, it is wise to determine how to prevent another political debacle for the city. Despite not having announced that he is running, former governor Andrew Cuomo has both name recognition and a long list of rich people ready to contribute to a campaign. Despite not making his candidacy official, he is the front runner for the mayoralty. As governor of New York state, Cuomo governed as a neo-liberal, currying favor with rich conservatives and carrying on a years-long feud with then New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. Cuomo also attempted to undo a state ethics commission which this week ruled that he should not have received a $5.1 payment for writing his memoirs while in office. Cuomo is smoother and smarter than Adams but brings the same bad political baggage. No one is certain how long the Adams soap opera will go on, but he will not be missed by the Black New Yorkers whose political and material needs he ignored. Eric Adams will be a footnote in history as a clownish and quirky character with legal troubles but whenever he leaves office, he will not be missed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LE4N6JyS2bBV	2025-02-19T16:23:07-08:00	
Trump Assails Ukraine’s Zelenskyy As ‘Dictator Without Elections’	U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, calling him a 'dictator without elections,' after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space.' With settlement of Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine hanging in the balance, Trump took to his Truth Social media platform to attack the Kyiv leader, who has expressed the fear that the U.S. leader is trying to end the war on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022, three years ago next week. Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as 'a modestly successful comedian' who 'talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.' The U.S. leader, who declined last year during a political debate to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war, said 'the only thing [Zelenskyy] was good at was playing [former U.S. President Joe] Biden ‘like a fiddle’' for more military assistance. 'I love Ukraine,' Trump said, 'but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Trump’s assessment of Zelenskyy came after the Ukrainian leader this week expressed his anger at Ukraine’s exclusion from Tuesday’s high-level U.S.-Russian diplomatic talks in Saudi Arabia, where the two countries after more than four hours of discussions said they had agreed to meet again soon on how to end the war. Earlier, Trump on Tuesday scoffed at Zelenskyy’s complaint about not being invited to the talks in Riyadh headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders, whom he accused of starting the war even though it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he was pleased with the outcome of the Riyadh talks with the U.S. but said his country needs to build trust with Washington before the war can be resolved. Putin rated the discussions 'highly,' declaring that they were a 'first step' in improving contentious relations between Moscow and Washington. But he added, 'It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States.' Putin said in televised remarks that he would like to hold a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, 'but it needs to be prepared so that it brings results.' The Rubio-Lavrov talks were the first significant discussions between the two superpowers in more than three years following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the U.S.-led Western effort to arm Kyiv’s forces to fend off the attack. 'I was briefed [on the talks]. I rate them highly, there are results,' Putin was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying at a drone factory in Saint Petersburg. 'In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests.' Neither Ukrainian nor European officials were at the table in a Saudi palace for the talks, but the U.S. said they would be involved in future negotiations to try to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. Russia failed to take over all of Ukraine in the first stages of the war but now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. Zelenskyy has said repeatedly his country will not accept a dictated U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the conflict. While Biden provided tens of billions of dollars in arms for Kyiv, Trump has pushed for a fast end to the Moscow-initiated war. Speaking ahead of talks with Trump's Ukraine envoy in Kyiv, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian TV, 'President Trump ... unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.' The envoy, Gen. Keith Kellogg, said the United States understands the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any negotiated end to the war. Kellogg said he was in Ukraine 'to listen,' hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United States to consult with Trump. Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end, saying it would be good for the region and the world. Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the meeting with Kellogg that while U.S. officials have said there will be no U.S. troops deployed as part of any potential post-war peacekeeping mission, there are still other ways it can help, such as providing air defense systems. 'You don't want boots on the ground, you don't want NATO,' Zelenskyy said. 'Okay, can we have Patriots? Enough Patriots?' The discussions in Kyiv came amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts focused on the war, including French President Emmanuel Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks about the conflict and European support for Ukraine. Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders. Rubio said Tuesday after meeting with Lavrov that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to achieve peace. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters. Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the U.S.-Russia talks. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement after the Riyadh talks that the U.S. and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible.' Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LMtqLzIIrLXT	2025-02-19T16:21:16-08:00	
Ukraine: Three Years Of War Reverses Progress For Women And Girls	Three years of war in Ukraine have reversed decades of progress for women and girls, leaving millions in urgent need of support, according to UN Women. Russia’s full-scale invasion has forced more than 1.8 million women to flee their homes within Ukraine, while nearly 6.7 million require humanitarian assistance. More than 3,799 women and 289 girls have been killed, though the real toll is believed to be significantly higher. 'The full-scale war has pushed an entire generation of Ukrainian women backwards,' said Sabine Freizer Gunes, UN WomenRepresentative in the country. 'They are facing heightened exposure to gender-based violence; rising unemployment; decreased decision-making power; greater domestic burdens; and a severe mental health crisis,' she explained. Stressed out Gender-based violence has surged by 36 per cent since 2022, driven in part by conflict-related stress, UN Women reported. In parallel, depression rates among women and girls have worsened. On the economic front, opportunities have shrunk. By 2024, less than half of displaced women had jobs whilst the gender pay gap doubled since the beginning of the war. Meanwhile, the burden of unpaid care, from cooking to caring for children, has intensified as childcare services centres have closed and services dwindled. Women spent an average of 56 hours a week on childcare in 2024, up from 49 hours before the war. Leaders of humanitarian recovery Despite these hardships, Ukrainian women are leading humanitarian responses and driving economic resilience. Women have assumed key roles as aid workers, community leaders and entrepreneurs. Today, one in every two businesses in Ukraine is founded by a woman. Women are also entering traditionally male-dominated sectors such as security, transportation and demining. 'Donors’ support to Ukrainian women-led organizations and programmes is crucial so they can continue promoting gender equality, women’s rights and leadership,' said Ms. Gunes. 'Women’s full engagement will be essential to rebuild Ukraine as a gender-equal and gender-responsive society,' she added. Support and call for action In 2024 alone, UN Women supported more than 180,000 women and girls affected by the war through initiatives under the Women Peace and Humanitarian Fund. The agency provides life-saving humanitarian aid, psychosocial and legal support, protection services and programmes to strengthen women’s economic independence. Four years on since the beginning of the war, UN Women is working to ensure that women are included in decision-making and recovery efforts, advocating for legal reforms to secure equal rights and representation. Overnight attack on Odesa The UN aid coordination office in Ukraine, OCHA, reported that an attack on Odesa City in the small hours of Wednesday morning had injured a number of civilians, including a child. Local authorities say the attack left a large residential area without electricity and heating, affecting at least 160,000 people – in the midst of winter. 'Multiple apartment buildings were damaged, as well as a children’s hospital, and a kindergarten. For our part, we are providing emergency shelter materials, hot meals, psychosocial support, legal aid, and child protection services,' said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric., Medical teams are conducting quick health checks and distributing medicines, while schools will remain closed until power and heating are restored. In the southern city of Kherson aid workers are continuing to respond to an attack that took place on 17 February, and damaged a critical energy facility. 2,500 residents were left without electricity, heating, and water.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LCmjJbI5_Rua	2025-02-19T16:19:03-08:00	
I Sympathize With Nehru’s Views On The Importance Of Industrializ...	We put a lot of money into industry in the hope that this input would accelerate our growth. Jawaharlal Nehru's idea of the public sector was very different from the way it has evolved through the years. Whether you have a socialist or a capitalist economy, profits have always been the principal source of accumulation' said Dr Manmohan Singh, two-term India’s prime minister from 2004 to 2014 Ever since the passing away of Dr Manmohan Singh on 26 December 2024 in New Delhi, much has been written about his contributions as the two-term Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014, his historic role as the Union Finance Minister from 1991 to 1996. In the politically-charged atmosphere of the Indian capital, there have been debates on a memorial site and Bharat Ratna (highest civilian honour) for the late former Prime Minister; these continue to make media headlines, resulting in political tug-of-wars where decorum is often thrown to the winds. It is only appropriate to bring to centre-stage the mild-mannered soft-spoken Oxford-Cambridge educated Dr Manmohan Singh whose seminal works on exports, world trade, the role of public sector, and Pt Jawaharlal Nehru's vision continue to shed light on the roadmaps for the Indian economy till date. Back in 1999-2000 when he was Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament) Dr Singh, in a conversation with development economist Prof VN Balasubramanyam of Lancaster University, shared his views on a spectrum of issues relating to India’s economy. 'Yes, I sympathise with Nehru's views on the importance of industrialisation, indeed until the 1960s, there was no questioning of that policy. Yes, I subscribed to it, infact most of us did. It seemed the right strategy at that time,' said Dr Singh, adding 'Everybody who came to India also advocated that policy. Those were the days of the take-off into self-sustained growth. Whosoever came to India advised us that increasing investment to the right level was the thing to do. It was considered right that India should run a large deficit and the world would finance it. I do not think that till the mid-1960s we did terribly wrong. I think we should have had the vision to shift gear once we knew that we had created the basic infrastructure. We should have taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by the international trading system to build a dynamic and efficient economy. We should have paid more attention to restructuring of public and private enterprises on the basis of efficiency and international competitiveness.' Earlier in an interview with World Affairs (January-March 1997), Dr Singh explained, 'We have not paid adequate attention to social sectors in our development strategy. We adopted a strategy where steel was the kingpin, whereas we live in a society where knowledge is power. In a country such as ours where you have a literacy rate of 53 per cent with a dubious quality, it is not surprising that our growth rate is so low. We put a lot of money into industry in the hope that this input would accelerate our growth. Jawaharlal Nehru's idea of the public sector was very different from the way it has evolved through the years. Whether you have a socialist or a capitalist economy, profits have always been the principal source of accumulation. Therefore, if you socialise profits through the public sector, you will kill two birds with one stone: first, you accelerate the rate of saving through the prevention of superfluous consumption by the rich and thereby accelerate the process of accumulation; second, by socialising profits you can reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Nehru hoped that we would have a public sector that would generate large surpluses. But the public sector in our economy doesn't even yield a return to pay the interest on the capital the government has borrow.' Dr Manmohan often gave the Japanese example, looking at the trajectory of Japanese development since the 19th century. 'They created a large number of enterprises in the public sector and handed them over to the private sector. If we wish to industrialise quickly within a period of 15-25 years in a country where the private entrepreneurs are scarce, active state involvement in setting up industries is the only way to get things going. But if the process is to become self-sustaining, we need a progressive increase in productivity, improved capital productivity. Public sector and state instrumentalities are very inefficient ways of getting this productivity growth. You have to rely on the private sector to do this,' he explained to Prof Balasubramanyam. Undoubtedly Dr Singh’s handling of the balance of payments crisis of 1991 was truly historic, and remains a milestone in India’s contemporary history. He narrated the sequence of events, typically as an economics professor would: 'India was in the middle of a deep economic crisis. We were on the verge of bankruptcy as our foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted. We converted that crisis into an opportunity to launch a wide-ranging programme of structural reforms. The traditional response to a balance of payments crisis is to compress domestic demand through a programme of fiscal retrenchment. However, in an economy characterised by wage rigidities and supply bottlenecks which prevent resources moving from one sector to another, the traditional stabilisation programmes end up by creating unemployment and idle capacity.' He then highlighted the strategy adopted, 'we devised a stabilisation programme which was expected to produce positive results in a fairly short period and additional we launched a programme of structural reforms to improve the supply side responses. The end result was that the duration of the recession resulting from the stabilisation programme was short enough to prevent a serious political backlash. By 1993-94, the Indian economy started growing at a fairly respectable rate. In this way, the political resistance to reforms was contained. Even then there were problems once the sense of crisis was over. This is partly because we did not have enough time to educate public opinion.' For economists wishing to learn from this lesson of history, the key points are – improving supply side responses, preventing political backlash, and educating public opinion. Dr Singh acknowledged the highly inward-looking economic policies, the strong distrust of foreign investment and private entrepreneurship which was prevalent till 1991. 'The distrust was a reflection of India's history whereby the East India Company, which came to India as a trader, ended up as a ruler. Our struggle against colonial rule also strengthened these sentiments. In this background, it was natural that the opening up of the economy to foreign investment and liberalisation of imports should invite opposition from businessmen, trade unions and even political parties both on the right and the left. However, the fact that ours was a policy of measured opening up, that our economic reforms did not lead to unemployment and idle capacity, and that the growth performance of the economy improved year after year after the initial setback in 1991-92 diluted the vigour of opposition to economic reforms. Now there is widespread appreciation that reforms of 1991 to 1996 on the whole were beneficial in their impact and there can be no reversal of these policies,' he said, obviously with an obvious sense of satisfaction. He referred to the opposition faced by the Congress-led government from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Leftist parties who were against the opening up of the economy. But after coming into power, 'both the United Front government and the BJP recognised that xenophobia is no answer to India's problems. However, the BJP government's soft line towards foreign investment and import liberalisation is being opposed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Swadeshi Jagran Manch. In fact all the political parties contain elements which are not favourably disposed towards reforms. Even the Congress Party is no exception to this statement,' he noted. When questioned him about the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by Prof Balasubramanyam, Dr Singh’s reply is relevant and significant till date: 'As Finance Minister I put a halt to the automatic route through which the Reserve Bank was to fund the Government. I do believe that because of the close linkages between fiscal and monetary policies, we need a high degree of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. I gave a lot of weight to the advice of the RBI Governor. But I do not believe that the Reserve Bank can be totally independent. To a large extent the autonomy of the Bank is a state of mind. It very much depends on the vision, knowledge and experience of the Governor of the Bank. If the advice is of high quality, it cannot be ignored by any government. But I do not believe that we can legislate the autonomy of RBI.' He explained, 'We are not in that position and when people talk of independence, they are all talking of economies where factor mobility is very high, where a large number of policy instruments are available, where frictions and rigidities in economic structures and operation of the economy are low. Here we are operating relatively rudimentary structures with a lot of rigidity built into the system. We do not know the lags between policy implementation and its impact. So, I believe that RBI must have as much autonomy as possible in the sense that it must be free to give advice and if the government does not accept the advice, it should be known to the public why that advice was not accepted. But to say that the Central Bank can operate in isolation of the overall economic environment, unmindful of other objectives of economic policy, is not possible.' Not just a Bharat Ratna, the towering gateway of the Reserve Bank of India building on New Delhi’s Parliament Street needs renaming as ‘Dr Manmohan Singh Dwaar’ (or Gateway) where his words may be inscribed on stone.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LAaIfTt6XUj0	2025-02-19T16:16:57-08:00	
Putin Praises US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia As ‘First Step’ To ...	Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump could meet as early as this month, although a face-to-face meeting will take time to prepare, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, according to Russian news agencies. Peskov said the US-Russia talks held on Tuesday in Riyadh were a 'very, very important step' toward reaching a settlement on the Ukraine war, nearing its third year. 'In order to carry out, figuratively speaking, resuscitation measures, diplomats will now begin to work in light of the agreement (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov reached yesterday with (US Secretary of State Marco) Rubio,' Peskov was quoted by state media as saying. 'But this is the first step...Naturally, it’s impossible to fix everything in one day or a week. There is a long way to go,' he added. The talks in Riyadh were the first time US and Russian officials met to discuss ways to halt the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. No Ukrainian or European officials were invited. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent. Putin thanked the Saudi leadership, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for creating a good atmosphere for holding the talks. The Russian president said he rated the bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia 'highly,' describing them as a 'first step' to restoring relations with Washington. 'In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests,' he told journalists while visiting a drone manufacturing plant in his native Saint Petersburg. He added that Russia and the US needed to 'trust' each other if talks were to be successful. 'It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LGTOWeedvPHp	2025-02-19T16:14:06-08:00	
Peace In Europe Is Only Possible Under Trump – OpEd	After depending on America as its ally for decades, the European leaders at the Munich Security Conference this week now see first hand the continent's decades old norms and dogma of the American security umbrella now crumbling in front of them. The U.S. and Russia have begun talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at improving diplomatic ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, without the involvement of Europe and Ukraine. This is only made possible under Trump, and will signal a new path towards peace. If Biden defeated Trump in the elections, this conflict will only prolong with greater amounts of lives lost and money pumped in unnecessarily. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sat down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations after years of tension following the Ukraine conflict, and after years of limited engagement thanks to Biden's old school approach. Trump criticised Zelensky for his disapproval of this direct meeting without Ukraine, and Trump is right when he argued that Zelensky has for three years been here but practically the war has seen no signs of abating. Only Trump has the capacity in the world now to halt this previous stalemate of the West's stubborn old school approach, and to end the war now. This first formal talk will set up nicely the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin, which will mark a new chapter of ties between Moscow and Washington, where it will no longer be constrained by past status quo and conventional approaches of the Biden administration. This meeting is very much overdue, and this will pave the way for the end of the Ukraine conflict, and this also brings much certainty to long term bilateral ties and a reset of relationship with Russia, away from the past entanglements of traditional European factor and trap. Since the conflict started, America has been confined to two principles: that Ukraine's future should not be decided without the involvement of Ukraine; and that America and its Western allies must come together to face Putin. ⁠ In came Trump and this changed entirely. European leaders now face a scramble to reorient their security setting amidst the new shake-up and the risks of an American pullout or using that as a pretext to force Europe to ease on its conventional barriers to Ukraine peace talks. European leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday to align their position after they are left out of the talks for Ukraine. The outcome of the eventual Trump-Putin meeting also will transcend the impact on Ukraine alone, as a new set of improved ties with the US will lessen the necessity for Moscow to increase reliance on China and the DPRK as a trade off for higher bargaining chips with the US. Without external influences and forces and with Trump's new distinct mantra of self push for peace, with the doubling down on the reality that Zelensky will not be naively expecting the same territorial ownership before the war, and in shutting down any idea of Ukraine joining NATO, this meeting will mark a new beginning in long term peace deals for Russia. Europe will also now be left with a more self independent defence approach without the easy reliance on American power presence, which will further limit its potential for escalations or provocations with Russia. With Trump's warning that Europe will be left alone, the talks of the creation of the Army of Europe will not in any way embolden European powers to challenge Russia, knowing how without the US involvement, it is in no way able to sustain any aggressive confrontation. This direct meeting between Trump and Putin is the most beneficial and strategic in any ways, in keeping away the European forces that have for long been a main barrier. With Trump's own tariff strategy and reorientation of security ties with Europe, plus the new thaw of ties between Russia and the US, Europe will be forced to scale down on its Russian pushback, seeing how fragile cross Atlantic ties will further limit its trade and economic options, which it will now have to rely more on the Indo Pacific and China as a result, although both are still risky for Europe's shaky Indo Pacific push. Can Europe defend itself without American support? Not a chance. This will force Europe to spend more on its defence, including its NATO commitment. This will require a spike in defence spending and especially on targeted key defence areas and deterrence capacity, something which Europe lacks now with its stagnating economy coupled with the tariff threat from Trump. Last year, only 18 NATO allies just spent the target of 2% of GDP in defence. What Europe really lacks is the proper defence and deterrence capacity against Russia, and will be left as sitting ducks without the holistic American military deterrent capacity especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. What does Europe really lack? It is the basic military technology and capability that make armed forces credible, capable and most importantly, lethal. Europe has outdated and outnumbered ships and missiles. It has ships without the proper missiles, planes without the needed technological capacity including jamming capabilities, and even troops without adequate ammunition. The disparity of Western and Eastern European military capabilities and intra Europe power gap are glaring, and lacking the combined holistic military spectrum including intelligence, space security and satellite capabilities, cyber and digital warfare, and missiles and nuclear first and second strike capacities, Europe cannot afford to defend itself without America. But it has for decades been piggybacking on America's back, banking on the conventional and assured American military and financial support in securing its interests and security needs without the urgent need to bolster these capabilities. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate assurance and guarantee against a Russian invasion. This easy ride on security assurances for Europe made it easier for it to focus deeper on its economic and trade needs, and pivoting to Africa and Asia. However, even this is ineffective, with its Global Gateway strategy and the Indo Pacific push all failed to pull Europe out of its stagnation,even in post Brexit recovery. With Trump now reversing decades of free ride, European security suddenly looks in shambles, even without the Ukraine pretext in the first place. Compare that to Russia, who enjoys higher volume advantage both in conventional and nuclear capacities. France and Britain both have a combined nuclear warheads of around 500, while the US has around 5000, and Russia has the highest number at approximately 6000. The Ukrainian experience portrayed how the conflict there should not have been started in the first place, and if Trump was in power at that time, in his own words and Putin's, this would not have started. Trump has chastised the decision for Ukraine to take the fight with Russia, despite knowing the huge and glaring disparity of firepower and military capacity between Moscow and Kiev, while hoping for Washington to continue to provide military aid in the hundreds of billions, all while Europe is happy to just contribute enough, albeit little. Trump's further tariff threat on Europe should it continue hijack Trump's direct Putin deal remains a strategic and brilliant pull off from Trump, and open are the doors to new economic, trade and security reorientation with Russia in a gradually positive tone, especially if new future sanctions are withheld or waived in tandem with Russia's own reciprocal sweetener in the Ukraine peace deal. This new shake-up in the European security sphere where it is now finding itself suddenly exposed and vulnerable will mean that it is left with no choice but to placate Trump, and to avoid further tariff and risks of entire pullout of US security. This will push Europe to accept that the Ukrainian peace deal will need to go through, and there will be no more barriers to continue the financial wastages on the war and the ever mounting toll of lives lost on both sides. Europe has always singled out Russia as the main threat to its security, and yet before Trump 1.0, has continued to rely heavily on Russian oil and gas for its energy security, while soliciting American military and nuclear support at the same time. It will take Europe at least ten years to properly defend itself without America, and it will need America more than ever. In future thaw of ties and the upcoming negotiations, Russia is expected to demand for more considerations from the West, including possible prisoner swap and also the ease of sanctions on Iran which will allow for more Iranian oil export that will ease oil prices, and eventually help with Russia's post recovery. The West in turn is expected to push Russia to be disassociate more with China and North Korea, and to lower its role in BRICS and other anti-West mechanisms, barring the potentiality of Trump to further lavish higher tariff and sanctions on Moscow and also the risks of a fallout in the peace talks. However, both have more to gain from an eventual peace and a thaw in ties, and even Europe will reap more benefits in the future. The peace plan might also include the resumption of greater energy flow into Europe from Russia, which it needs.Most gas deliveries ceased in 2022, when Russia closed down Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The EU now receives just 10% of its gas from Russia, down from 45% in 2021. This affected Moscow's supply chain as well, and a heavy financial toll. Europe is feeling the pinch from continuing high prices, and this year it will need to buy more than usual to fill its storage which is now only 48% full compared to 66% at the same time last year. The limit on the supply and flow by Russia also affected both sides, in both navigating through this barrier while others tried to circumvent it. Hungary and Slovakia still receive piped Russian flows from Turkey; while others also get regasified Russian LNG that flows through northern Europe. Ukraine is adamant it will not renew its deal with Russia, but turnarounds are being studied. The EU'S most Russia-wary members would strongly oppose greater dependence on the country's energy, but that hinges on the outcome of the peace deal. At the same time, Trump would have wanted Europe to buy more of American oil and gas, but if the peace deal goes through, Russia will be able to supply more, which will lower prices around the world that might put American oil drillers and capacities at a disadvantage.However, the peace plan is more pressing, and will bring greater financial and security savings for Washington and Brussels. It is time to stop this madness of the Ukraine war, with the common sense and sensible approach taken by Trump to begin talks and negotiations, which will benefit all nations. Like what Trump has long argued, this should not have started in the first place, and would not have started should he still be in power, a fact where even Putin concurred, but at least Trump has now kept his promise to end this, cleaning up Biden's mess. Hopes are high for the return of peace at long last.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwXM1X-0KuOaN	2025-02-18T18:40:39-08:00	
Fighting Continues In Ethiopia’s Amhara Region – Analysis	Clashes are ongoing in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, where an ethnically based militia known as the Fano is battling the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) for control. In January, fighting broke out in Debre Birhan, a town 120 kilometers north of the capital, Addis Ababa. Fano militants used conventional and ambush attacks against government forces, the website Borkena reported. Fighting also was reported in the towns of Wollo, Gojjam and Gondar. 'The conflict continues to escalate, with widespread violence and heavy clashes across the Amhara region and parts of Oromia,' Hone Mandefro, of the Amhara Association of America, and Henok Ashagray, of the Centre for Human Rights at the University of Pretoria, wrote in an article for Inter Press Service. 'Government forces have intensified their military campaigns and are now using airstrikes and drones, while Fano militias resist fiercely. The fighting is severe and prolonged, with territorial control frequently shifting.' The violence comes after the ENDF launched a major military operation in October 2024 to defeat the Fano. But observers believe the Fano still control as much as 80% of the region. The militia operates mostly outside large population centers and has only briefly controlled major towns or roads. The fighting affects nearly every aspect of life in the Amhara region, disrupting farming and trade, shutting down health clinics, and raising the risk of famine. More than 4.1 million children are out of school, and more than 4,000 schools are closed, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Analysts believe that despite the heavy toll, the Fano continue to enjoy widespread public support, particularly in rural areas. 'Local communities appear to be closely collaborating with the groups,' the Rift Valley Institute said in a 2024 analysis. 'This seems to include information sharing, logistical support, and the provision of safe havens. The structure of the Fano, which mostly involves small groups operating in or near their home areas, means that they are able to rely on close ties with local communities.' The Fano formed in 2016 as a protest movement and later became an armed group claiming to protect Amhara land rights and other interests. During the 2020 to 2022 war in the Tigray region, the Fano fought alongside federal government forces and reclaimed a disputed area known as Western Tigray. The Fano, as well as government and Tigrayan forces, were accused of widespread war crimes, including brutal attacks against civilians. Near the end of the conflict, the ENDF began disarming and arresting Fano fighters, and, in 2023, the Fano launched an insurgency. Amid the prolonged insurgency, there is some positive news. In the seven weeks ending on January 31, there was a 44% decrease in fighting in the Amhara region compared to the previous seven weeks, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) Ethiopia Peace Observatory project. ACLED analysts believe this decrease was due to a lull during the holidays and the fact that an estimated 4,000 Fano fighters surrendered. They also credit peace talks initiated by diplomats from the African Union, European Union, United States and others. However, the fragmented nature of the Fano makes it difficult to hold discussions with all parties to the conflict. There are at least nine Fano groups, including some that are feuding with each other. 'The two conflicting parties face a long road to sitting at the negotiation table, particularly due to a lack of unity among Fano militias,' according to a 2024 ACLED report. 'One-to-one peace talks with each militia would complicate negotiations and offer less guarantee of establishing and sustaining peace in the region.

Iatrogenic Influence In Information Operations: Lessons From The ...	By Daniel Eerhart Introduction (FPRI) -- In medicine, iatrogenesis is when a physician’s medical treatment or procedures unintentionally induce disease, harmful complications, or any other ill effect. This paper introduces the concept of iatrogenic influence. It parallels the medical term and refers to situations where information operations inadvertently produce adverse outcomes and unintentionally exacerbate the issue they aim to improve. While this phenomenon has existed as long as information warfare has, the nearly twenty years of conflict following September 11th, 2001, known as the Global War on Terror (GWOT), has produced numerous missteps and infringements from which we can learn lessons to improve future efforts. During the GWOT, U.S. military psychological operations units deliberately integrated various information-related capabilities and aimed to wage a mutually supportive war in the tactical and cognitive domains. However, inherent to the nature of terrorist organizations is the ability to weaponize fear and win information battles. Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State, the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba all weaponized the information environment to bolster recruiting efforts and spread propaganda. While U.S. forces aiming to compete in the information environment had to wrestle with bureaucratic processes and protect domestic trust and perceived legitimacy in the combat zones, GWOT adversaries pressed their advantage in the information space through decentralized execution and rapid dissemination. U.S. military commands do not have the luxury of cutting corners; when they do, they increase the risk of iatrogenic influence. Inoculation theory suggests that exposure to a weak argument increases resistance to its persuasive abilities. Therefore, attempting to match adversary performance measures is an exercise in futility and may lend itself to further adversary advantage. U.S. influence systems are best suited for 'central route focus,' as described by the elaboration likelihood model, which provides detailed, well-reasoned arguments designed to engage audiences cognitively. In rapidly changing environments, emotional responses are more influential for short-term gains. However, the GWOT was fought for nearly twenty years, not a short period in any model. This paper contends that iatrogenic influence in information operations poses a significant risk to the U.S. military’s ability to achieve strategic objectives. By analyzing case studies, indicators of iatrogenic influence are identified, providing operational leaders an opportunity to assess their presence within operations. This enables pre-execution modifications, reducing risks in future influence activities. Iatrogenic Influence Since September 11, 2001, information operations and irregular warfare have played a significant role in the GWOT. With the rise of ubiquitous social media and a readily available information environment in the pockets of every target audience, adversaries seized the initiative and adapted. As U.S. military and allied forces aimed to compete in the information environment, numerous campaigns yielded unintentional negative consequences, exacerbating the issues they sought to mitigate. This phenomenon, designated as 'iatrogenic influence,' parallels the medical term of iatrogenesis, where interventions cause harm rather than heal. The risk of iatrogenic influence grows as modern conflict evolves to integrate information strategies and apply hybrid warfare methods. Contemporary conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza demonstrate the necessity to understand the information environment and effectively deliver the influence message. Without understanding how iatrogenic influence occurs, forces operating in the information environment will likely succumb to similar outcomes in future operations. Understanding Iatrogenic Influence in the Context of the GWOT This section explores the literature on information operations during the conflict, ethical frameworks during information operations, and counterinsurgency doctrine to contextualize the concept of iatrogenic influence. It will examine how coalition forces approached information operations during the GWOT and explains how those operations were nested underneath the overarching counterinsurgency strategy. Then it will concentrate on the role of the U.S. doctrine and establishing an international coalition by invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Information Operations During Conflict In their book Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt argue that conflict has transitioned from hierarchical frameworks to decentralized networks. During the GWOT, this concept came to fruition in 2001 following the overthrow of al-Qaeda, the Taliban’s surrender, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 to establish the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. In 2003, the coalition used traditional military forces to defeat the Baath Party and overthrow Sadaam Hussein, but the conflict degraded to network warfare afterward. With traditional military hierarchies dominating ground conflict in the initial stages, adversaries transitioned to types of warfare that favored their strengths. A decentralized asymmetric form of warfare emerged that relied upon networks and information rather than battalions and brigades. Adversaries who were embedded in the population had the cultural understanding of the populace and an idiomatic understanding of the language to generate propaganda that resonated with their audiences. Unlike our adversaries, without established networks to spread messages through word of mouth, U.S. and allied psychological operations forces often relied upon loudspeakers and leaflets to communicate their messages. Conventional military forces were unable to effectively compete with the speed and efficiency of decentralized, culturally fluent networks. Dorothy Denning’s book Information Warfare and Security emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and understanding the local context when performing information operations. However, despite having this academic understanding, the U.S. and allied ability to perform such activities on the ground was limited by the dissemination platforms, lack of availability of trans-cultural experts, and operational tempo. Counterinsurgency Doctrine In 2006, Gen. David Petraeus, USA, and Lt. Gen. James Amos, USMC, published Field Manual 3-24, the U.S. military’s first field manual on counterinsurgency. The manual’s 2014 rewritten version still defines the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. The authors address information management by stating, 'To limit discontent and build support, the affected government and any counterinsurgency forces assisting it create and maintain a realistic set of expectations among the population, friendly military forces, and the international community.' This statement is a critical indicator of whether the information operations will devolve into iatrogenesis. If creating realistic expectations is critical to building support and legitimacy, then inherently, any information operation that is revealed to be deceptive, that exaggerates expectations, or that disconnects perception will result in adverse results. Field Manual 3-24 provides insight into cultures and reminds the reader that they should not assume foreign audiences will share the same values or perspectives as U.S. personnel. Even within audiences, contradictions and variations of behaviors and beliefs will impact the message’s ability to resonate. The key is to balance the requirements within the goal of the operation and the cultural beliefs within the area of operations. In statistics, variance increases when data points become more spread out from the mean of the dataset. This concept parallels information operations, where the influence actors perform a target audience analysis on the 'mean' of their dataset (i.e., the average member of their target audience). The farther their effort spreads from the average member, the more likely they will violate a cultural belief, creating discontent as described in Field Manual 3-24. Transparent and truthful information with a precise target audience ensures effective information operations during counterinsurgency. Case Studies The following three case studies provide concrete examples of iatrogenic influence during the Global War on Terror and build upon the theoretical and doctrinal background as a baseline. Examining these case studies provides insights into the areas where missteps unfolded and created tensions. Guantanamo Detainee Photos (2002) On January 11, 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense released a photo of twenty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay on their knees. The shackled prisoners were in orange jumpsuits with masks over their heads and were surrounded by razor wire. The photo was not a leak; the Department of Defense deliberately released it as part of an assignment to photograph the opening day of Camp X-Ray in southeastern Cuba. The photo has been broadcast throughout the world and used by news agencies as evidence of U.S. wrongdoing and torture during the war on terror. Even twenty years later, the photo frequently reappears alongside stories calling for transparency in military detainee operations. Rather than the international community viewing the photo as anonymous prisoners detained within the guidelines of the Geneva Convention, the photo brought about criticism regarding the willingness to subject prisoners to sensory deprivation and degradation. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State both have used the photoas part of their propaganda efforts and recruitment messaging. The release’s original intent, to build trust in U.S. transparency, only led to further questions about prisoner treatment away from camera view. Iatrogenic influence indicators are again apparent in this case study, where a Western lens categorized the capture and distribution. Broad general audience photo dissemination occurred with inconsistent messaging. If the goal is to communicate that prisoners receive treatment with dignity and respect, then a display of hooded individuals on their knees surrounded by razor wire is incompatible with that goal. Furthermore, with a broad audience, there was no feedback mechanism from the target audience because the dissemination needed more specificity. Afghanistan Soccer Ball Incident (2007) In August 2007, protests occurred in Afghanistan after the U.S. military dropped soccer balls from a helicopter in Khost province. The soccer balls displayed flags from around the world, including Saudi Arabia, whose flag features the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada. For Muslims, the name of Allah is revered, and placing a verse from the Quran on a ball intended to be kicked by feet was a significant insult. The operation aimed to promote cooperation while engaging with Afghan youth and building unity to counteract insurgent influence. However, the cultural insensitivity of displaying a religious text on an item associated with the foot resulted in backlash and further exacerbated tensions, undermining the operational objectives. Furthermore, the incident allowed insurgents to exploit the misstep and message anti-coalition sentiment. The indicators of potential iatrogenic influence were present and likely evident before mission execution. First, there was a significant inconsistency between the delivery mechanism and the desired effect. Building rapport and cooperation occurs not by dropping objects out of a helicopter but through face-to-face communication. If the U.S. servicemembers had chosen to distribute the balls in person, they would have had an immediate cultural feedback mechanism. The first individual to respond angrily to receiving a ball with a Saudi flag would have been a clear signal of the messaging error and would have mitigated the backlash. If historical mistrust existed between the Afghans and coalition members in that region, it would have required consistent and persistent messaging rather than a solitary product to build trust. White Dog Leaflets (2017) In 2017, U.S. forces dropped leaflets in parts of Parwan province, Afghanistan, that depicted the image of a lion chasing a white dog with the Shahada printed on it. The operation intended to use the white dog to represent the Taliban flag, which is white with the Shahada. However, the printing of the Muslim profession of faith on an animal that many Muslims view as unclean was deemed deeply offensive and severely eroded local trust in coalition forces. Maj. Gen. James Linder, then the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, was forced to make a statement and apologize for the leaflets. Later, a Taliban suicide bomber detonated outside an American base, wounding four civilians, with the Taliban claiming it was retaliation for the leaflet. The use of religious content drastically increases the likelihood of iatrogenic influence by potentially oversimplifying the content or disseminating it through a false lens. The Taliban did not accidentally stumble upon the decision to have the white flag with the Shahada as their rallying symbol; it was a deliberate decision with ramifications in the information environment, and the U.S. military’s decision to oversimplify their assumptions about the Taliban resulted in severe consequences. The leaflets intended to inspire the local population to report the activities of Taliban members to coalition forces for elimination; however, because of iatrogenic influence, the credibility of U.S. forces was decreased instead. The leaflets needed to show evidence of a precise target audience, and there existed a disconnect between the delivery mechanism and the intended message. Since villages would have to find coalition members to communicate Taliban locations, disseminating this message through a leaflet does not make sense. With limited feedback mechanisms, this operation may have attempted to demonstrate performance measures within U.S. military hierarchies, which raise concerns about ethics. Analysis and Lessons Learned When examining instances where information operations in the GWOT had an iatrogenic effect, certain consistencies occur. By reviewing the publicly available case studies and through retrospective examination of a broader context, a trend arises of critical indicators that may signal an increased risk of iatrogenic influence. Table 1 summarizes the key indicators: Table 1: Iatrogenic Influence Indicators IndicatorDescriptionRiskBroad General AudienceThe operation targets a broad, general audience rather than a specific group, which makes performing target audience analysis difficult.The messages may be misrepresented or misinterpreted, resulting in rejection, resentment, confusion, or opposition.Inconsistent DeliveryMechanismThe dissemination method is inconsistent with the desired behavior or outcome.The target audience may question the nature of the messages and perceive them as superficial.False Cultural LensThe operation’s disseminators view products through their own cultural lens rather than the target audience’s perspective.Messages may inadvertently provoke backlash or negative emotions for violating the target audience’s cultural norms, beliefs, or values.Inconsistent Messaging/Information FratricideInconsistent or contradictory messaging among various stakeholders that is supposed to be mutually supportive.Undermines credibility and leads to skepticism or confusion about messaging and the messengers.Historical MistrustThe target audience has a history of mistrust or negative perceptions toward the source.Messages are more likely to be dismissed or viewed skeptically, exacerbating existing tensions.Deceptive TacticsThe campaign relies on deception, disinformation, or manipulation.Loss of credibility and trust if deception is uncovered; adversaries can exploit to discredit the campaign.Ethical and Moral ConcernsTactics or messages raise ethical or moral concerns.It provokes outrage and condemnation, undermining the operation’s legitimacy and enabling adversary propaganda.Insufficient FeedbackMechanismsThere are no mechanisms to gather and respond to feedback from the target audience.Adverse reactions may go unnoticed and unaddressed, allowing iatrogenic influence to grow.Oversimplification of IssuesCampaign oversimplifies complex issues.They are perceived as superficial or patronizing, failing to resonate and potentially reinforcing adversary narratives.Dynamic and RapidlyChanging EnvironmentThe environment is dynamic and rapidly changing.Messages can become outdated or irrelevant, perceived as incompetent or detached from current realities. Lesson Learned: As the Target Audience Size Increases, So Does the Risk In the three cases examined in this paper, the target audience was general and non-specific. When performing information operations, the smaller the target audience, the better the ability to perform target audience analysis and ensure the message is well received. As the target audience grows, so does the risk of iatrogenic influence. When disseminating messages to a large general audience, limitations on the options for delivery mechanism exacerbate the potential for a cascading series of uncontrollable responses. While face-to-face communication is slow and constricts an operation’s ability to have an extensive reach, Internet-based operations that involve the public release of photos have few decision points where commanders can correct the course of events. In the case of soccer balls in Afghanistan, dropping objects from a helicopter enables rapid dissemination. Still, it limits the ability to recover products following violating iatrogenic influence indicators. In future operations, commanders should limit general audience distribution and concentrate on targeted influence operations that limit risk while simultaneously increasing the likelihood of the message resonating. Lesson Learned: The Messenger Matters In each case study, official Department of Defense communication channels delivered the messages as an official release or from a military helicopter. The difficulty of information delivery occurs when the target audience realizes they do not identify with the messengers, increasing the barriers to resonation within the target audience. The special operations community made this realization in 2010, deciding to integrate all-female cultural support teams into special operations missions. Unsurprisingly, special operations soldiers conducting combat missions were having difficulty communicating with women and children and building trust among the local populace. As a result, the U.S. Special Operations Command issued a tasking order specifying five critical cultural support team tasks, including supporting information operations messaging to the female population and minimizing civilian interference with military operations. Commanders lauded the cultural support team concept as a resounding success and demonstrated that the messenger is at least as important as the message in all aspects of information operations. In future operations, commanders must strive to have the messenger meet all the traits of their target audience, just as Radio Sahar, the all-female Afghan radio station, did. It is important to emphasize that selecting a reflective messenger is not an action of deception; the messenger must remain truthful about their message and transparent about its attribution. Instead, it is simply an effort to allow the message to be heard among the target audience and given a chance to resonate. Lesson Learned: Legitimacy Before Influence In each case study, coalition forces attempted to utilize legitimacy shortcuts to influence their audiences. In the case of the white dog leaflets, U.S. servicemembers desired an increase in reports of Taliban locations. However, civilians need someone to report to—a person, or at least a method of communication they trust would not be used by malicious actors to punish people making reports. Likewise, in the soccer ball and Guantanamo prisoner case studies, the activities demonstrated a coalition self-perceived sense of superiority. In contrast, events like the 2006–7 Anbar Awakening demonstrate the effectiveness of establishing legitimacy before attempting influence. When Col. Sean MacFarland and 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division, arrived in al Anbar province, Ramadi was one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq, with more than three times more attacks per capita than any other area. Colonel MacFarland led the brigade in engaging directlywith tribal leaders, respecting their culture, and addressing the root causes of the population’s grievances. Once it established legitimacy, the brigade used a face-to-face dissemination mechanism consistent with its message. Through town halls, tribal councils, and direct communication, the soldiers built popular support. They worked with Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha to unite the tribes against al-Qaeda and stabilize the region. Conclusion The twenty-year GWOT provides numerous case studies to examine missteps in the information environment and recognize missed opportunities. Iatrogenic influence occurs where the consequences of information operations efforts are harmful and counterproductive. While this article used case studies of iatrogenic influence to identify indicators of high-risk operations, examining successful case studies will improve organizational success by recognizing when iatrogenic influence is appropriately mitigated. In the modern era, where adversaries rapidly aggregate influence capabilities, U.S. forces must recognize the lessons of iatrogenic influence. Contemporary conflicts are increasingly occurring in the cognitive domain, further demonstrating the necessity of U.S. civilian and military organizations to have cultural literacy when working in the information environment. Learning lessons from past GWOT operations and recognizing the possibility of iatrogenic influence will go a long way in America’s ability to use influence activities to our advantage in the future.

Outrage At Munich – Analysis	By Amrita Narlikar Following the World Economic Forum that convenes at Davos, another jamboree takes place in Munich. There is usually a fair overlap of key protagonists in the two settings, plus an additional, safe familiarity of reliable faces that have been invitees for years (and sometimes, decades) in the respective forum. For all the resources guzzled in organising these events and the media coverage surrounding them, they tend to be tame affairs involving men and women in expensive suits who speak politely of reforming the system and then return home to business as usual. So the speech by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on 14 February at the Munich Security Conference has shaken many of the global elite to the core. The anger is undisguised, especially among the Europeans. The German Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, described Vance’s critique as 'not acceptable'. For the European Foreign Policy Chief, Kaja Kallas, the speech sounded as if '… they try to pick a fight with us…'. The German Chancellor pushed back firmly and said that neither Germany nor Europe would accept outside interference, especially not from friends and allies. Social media platforms are alight with indignation against Vance. Why has the speech ruffled so many feathers? First, Vance, delivering his speech with aplomb, had the temerity to articulate a view that few dare to voice publicly: democratic backsliding (not in the Global South, as is common practice for Western actors to bemoan), but in Europe’s heartland. While Europe’s political establishment is unreserved in criticising the state of democracy, pluralism, and liberalism in the rest of the world, it resents being at the receiving end of similar scrutiny and commentary. Second, Vance went a step further: he framed his speech in terms of shared Transatlantic values. There is legitimate concern that Trump’s transactionalism may result in a sidelining of global norms; that his Vice President embraces the language of values should have been welcomed with open arms. But 'normative power Europe' seems to think it is the sole proprietor and representative of values. Third, Vance made only one passing reference to Russia and Ukraine in his speech in the context of reaching a 'reasonable settlement' between the two, and urged Europe 'to step up in a big way to provide for its own defence'. While many European leaders acknowledged the importance of burden-sharing as part of their NATO membership, the MSC audience at large seemed shocked and disappointed that Vance’s speech had incorporated such a cursory reference to the war on Europe’s borders. These are typical European double standards at work, already called out by the Indian Minister for External Affairs, Dr S. Jaishankar in 2023: Europe has the mindset that its 'problems are the world’s problem, but the world’s problem are not Europe’s problem.' Now that we finally have an administration that wants to ensure a division of labour between Europe and the US, with the latter focusing on the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific, Europe finds itself in a deeply uncomfortable position. Finally, Vance poked a hornet’s nest by referring to the challenges of 'mass migration' in Europe and made himself an easy target for the moral outrage of self-righteous, self-styled liberals. His speech could have certainly done with more nuance on this question of existential importance to many—including the emigrants who endure great dangers in the hope of reaching countries of safety and opportunity and then end up facing xenophobia and worse. But a much more serious discussion is needed on both legal and illegal immigration in Europe. Simply pretending that the problem does not exist and demonising Vance for his critique helps no one. Vance’s comments on the fragilities of European democracy hit too close to home. The great and the good of Europe seem to resent Vance’s 'physician, heal thyself' approach, doubly so perhaps because it makes it difficult for a governing elite to deflect attention away from serious domestic problems. Viewed from outside Europe, Vance’s speech offered some refreshing perspectives. Instead of a Transatlantic club of mutual admiration, with the rest of the world excluded from the party, something more interesting could be in the offing. This is not a US that is trying to destroy Europe or NATO (contra what some of the social media frenzy has suggested), but a mature power that recognises both the worth and the limitations of the Transatlantic partnership. If the EU opens up to some self-reflection, which it often demands from the Global South, it could build a more honest and lasting Transatlantic alliance that also welcomes other like-minded partners (including India). Vance’s speech told us something reassuring about America’s continued attachment to values. This will be one of several reasons why the US is likely to want to deepen its relationship with the world’s largest democracy. But the speech, and the reaction it generated, also ended up revealing a great deal about Europe’s political landscape. Vance, through his MSC speech, held up a mirror to Europe. The indignation exploding in Europe and beyond is simply the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in the glass.

Indonesia’s Probable Foreign Policy Shift From The West Under A P...	By Melinda Martinus The inauguration of Prabowo Subianto as Indonesia’s president and the appointment of Sugiono, a former military officer, as foreign minister mark a potential recalibration of Indonesia’s foreign diplomacy. This transition is expected to modify the foreign policy framework established during Joko Widodo’s decade-long presidency, which sought to serve domestic economic objectives over projecting regional or global leadership.[1] The new administration is anticipated to adopt a more assertive international stance, influenced by Prabowo’s personal experiences,[2] rapidly evolving geopolitical dynamics, Indonesia’s rising economic prominence, and a growing consensus among Jakarta’s policymakers on the need for a more proactive global diplomatic role.[3] While the country may project stronger global leadership, Prabowo’s presidency is likely to gradually shift Indonesia’s alignment further away from Western alliances—a trend that had already gained traction among Jakarta’s foreign policy elites during Jokowi’s administration. Under Jokowi’s leadership, Indonesia developed closer economic ties with China, which has emerged as Indonesia’s major trade partner, and with Singapore, which is its largest provider of foreign direct investment (FDI). The previous administration also made some efforts at strengthening alliances within Asia, particularly through cooperation within ASEAN and with key economies like Japan and South Korea, including defence cooperation with Russia[4] and India.[5] Key drivers behind this shift include the need to bolster economic growth, reinforce the principle of non-alignment, and diversify international partnerships beyond traditional Western powers. A few weeks after his inauguration, Prabowo’s administration signalled a reinforcement in this foreign policy direction, notably by deciding to become a BRICS partner. His first overseas trip was to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping to discuss economic and security cooperation. A surprise came with the joint statement issued after the bilateral meeting, which included an agreement on joint development in areas of the South China Sea where Indonesia and China have overlapping claims. This marked a significant departure from Indonesia’s previous stance on the South China Sea. With this statement, Indonesia appears to be the first ASEAN member state to implicitly recognise Beijing’s nine-dash line.[6] This article seeks to further analyse four critical dimensions that influence Indonesia’s foreign policy pivot under the new administration, namely adapting to the US’ protectionism, managing the EU’s conditionality, advancing the Palestinian cause, and strengthening ASEAN resilience. The analysis provided in this article draws on insights from the multi-year data from the State of Southeast Asia surveys[7] conducted by the ASEAN Studies Centre of ISEAS –Yusof Ishak Institute to highlight emerging trends and anticipated shifts away from Western-led initiatives. Rather than making specific predictions, this article showcases long-term perception trends among Indonesia’s foreign policy elites through the use of data and evidence to elaborate on the changes in strategic alignments. ADAPTING TO US PROTECTIONISM Under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesia is likely to sustain its focus on natural resource-driven and infrastructure developmental policies to meet an 8 per cent annual growth target—an essential step to reach high-income status by 2045.[8] The 'downstreaming'[9] strategy initiated under Jokowi, which restricts exports of raw minerals like nickel and bauxite, aims to strengthen domestic industries and move Indonesia further up the value chain in electric vehicle (EV) battery production, something that has become a key economic policy. However, the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted in 2022 to bolster US industrial competitiveness, mandates domestic sourcing and assembly requirements, which many partners view as protectionist. The IRA’s tax credits for clean energy production, such as electric vehicles (EVs), favour materials sourced domestically or from countries with free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US. Since Indonesia lacks an FTA with the US, these policies effectively obstruct its ambition to integrate into the EV supply chain.[10] Additionally, the IRA restricts involvement from 'foreign entities of concern,' notably targeting Chinese entities, who are instrumental in providing capital investment for Indonesia’s battery sector. The current political environment might complicate Indonesia’s ability to negotiate mineral and battery exports to the US. Consequently, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led initiative aimed at strengthening regional economic cooperation, has received only lukewarm interest from Indonesia. Indonesia perceives that the IPEF falls short of meeting its economic needs, especially as US policies like the IRA undercut the framework’s goal of enhancing connectivity with Asian partners. This disconnect reinforces Indonesia’s doubts about the framework’s benefits, particularly in light of restrictive US trade requirements that clash with its economic priorities. More so, the IPEF, focused on trade, supply chain resilience, clean energy, and economic fairness, does not include tariff reductions, which limits its appeal as a trade-enhancing agreement that is needed by most US trading partners in Asia. According to the State of Southeast Asia survey, most Indonesian elite respondents initially expressed uncertainty about the IPEF’s benefits (see Chart 1). In 2023, 52.1 per cent were uncertain, while 34.7 per cent viewed it positively and 13.2 per cent negatively. However, by 2024, perceptions had shifted. Although the majority (41.9 per cent) of Indonesian respondents remained uncertain, the proportion of those with a negative view almost doubled to 25.7 per cent. Indonesia may perceive that joining the IPEF would not help to lift restrictions brought by the IRA. Under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesia is expected to remain wary of US protectionism, particularly following president-elect and now President Trump’s election and his pledge to increase tariffs on Asian imports. This concern is further heightened by the likelihood that his party will depart from Biden administration policies, downplaying the IPEF, and reducing focus on ASEAN engagement. This may prompt Indonesia to reduce its reliance on the US as an export market and to seek broader trade cooperation with less protectionist partners such as BRICS, which could offer alternatives to Western standards, and also with Asian countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. Additionally, Indonesia may deepen ties with the Gulf states, especially to generate new sources of FDI. Chart 1 Growing Pessimism on the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) The overall impact and effectiveness of the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) (according to Indonesian respondents), is likely to be: The State of Southeast Asia: 2024 Survey Report (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2024) MANAGING THE EU’S CONDITIONALITIES Amid rising US protectionism, Indonesia’s scepticism toward Western trade conditionalities is mirrored in its diminishing perceptions of the European Union (EU). As Indonesia’s fifth-largest trading partner and a major source of foreign direct investment,[11] the EU has traditionally been valued as an alternative partner for export market, particularly as global trade adapts to the intensifying US-China trade war and China’s domestic economic turbulence. However, Indonesia increasingly views EU regulatory stances, on standards such as sustainability, labour protection, and human rights, as restrictive. This adds challenges to the forging of functional relationships and tampers enthusiasm for deeper economic alignment. The EU’s efforts to assert global leadership in carbon reduction, as pledged in the Paris Agreement and operationalised through the EU Green Deal, has increasingly incorporated extraterritorial regulations affecting trade partners. Policies like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) require trade partners to meet elevated environmental standards. These have generated negative sentiments, with Jakarta viewing them as forms of economic coercion[12] that infringe on its sovereignty and development ambitions; this complicates relations between the EU and Indonesia broadly. The situation has further diminished perceptions of the EU among policymakers in Jakarta (See Chart 2). According to the State of Southeast Asia surveys, Indonesian respondents initially held favourable views of the EU’s role in promoting global free trade. In the 2021 survey, 29.5 per cent of respondents viewed the EU as a primary leader in this area, ahead of China (20.9 per cent), ASEAN (19.4 per cent), and the US (15.5 per cent). However, by 2024, perceptions had shifted dramatically, with only 8.3 per cent of Indonesian respondents regarding the EU as showing leadership, placing it in fourth place alongside the US. Chart 2. Confidence in the EU’s leadership in championing the global free trade agenda has been dwindling, 2021 versus 2024 Who do you have the most confidence in to champion the global free trade agenda? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) The State of Southeast Asia: 2021 and 2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021 and 2024) The Prabowo administration is likely to intensify Indonesia’s stance against EU trade conditions by promoting partnerships with countries imposing fewer constraints. In seeking alternative alliances, Prabowo aims to reinforce Indonesia’s economic sovereignty, advocating trade frameworks that support domestic industries free from restrictive external pressures.[13] This approach underscores Indonesia’s commitment to a global economic order that accommodates diverse development paths, thus protecting its own strategic interests amid shifting international dynamics. ADVANCING THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE Indonesia’s trust in the Western alliance has been strained due to the latter’s perceived partiality in the Israel-Gaza conflict and double standards. Western nations, including the US and EU members, often advocate for human rights, international law, and civilian protection, most recently when they were rallying support for Ukraine. However, in the Gaza context, Indonesians see the West’s support for Israel as blatant ignoring of the humanitarian crises faced by Palestinians; this fuels perceptions of selective enforcement by the West of international norms based on political interests rather than universal principles. This sentiment resonates deeply with Indonesian public opinion. According to the State of Southeast Asia 2024 Survey, about three-quarters (74.5 per cent) of Indonesian respondents viewed the Israel-Hamas conflict as the top geopolitical concern for their government while 77.7 per cent believed that Israel’s attack on Gaza had gone too far. Trust in Western alliances, particularly the US and EU, has trended downward among Indonesian respondents in the State of Southeast Asia Surveys over the past six years (see Chart 3). This decline was especially sharp for the EU in 2024, reaching an all-time low, largely due to the West’s stance on the Gaza conflict. Trust in the US was initially low in 2019–2020 under Trump’s leadership but improved under Biden’s administration, with the latter emphasising US re-engagement with Asia. However, the trust in the US has been tempering again over the past two years. This could be attributed to the US’ lack of concrete functional cooperation in Asia, and the worsening situation in Gaza. Chart 3. Declinig confidence in US and EU leadership How confident are you that the US and the EU (respectively) will do the right thing to contribute to global peace, prosperity, and governance? (This is according to Indonesian respondents who indicated confident and highly confident) The State of Southeast Asia: 2019-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) To complicate matters, amid ongoing US-China geopolitical tensions in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is often viewed as a country capable of maintaining a strategic balance. Since the 2020 survey introduced a question on ASEAN’s strategic preference between the US and China, Indonesian respondents have shown a consistent approach towards balancing the two powers. In 2020, by a slim margin at 52.0 per cent, Indonesians chose China over the US (which garnered 48.0 per cent) (see Chart 4). Between 2021 and 2022, most respondents had leaned toward the US. However, by 2023, preferences had shifted significantly, with 53.7 per cent favouring China compared to 46.3 per cent for the US. In 2024, the gap substantially widened, with 74.2 per cent favouring China and only 26.8 per cent choosing the US. This significant shift signals that the US’ stance on the Gaza conflict has undermined its reputation in Indonesia. Chart 4. Future of ASEAN amid China-US rivalry If ASEAN were forced to align itself with one of the strategic rivals, which should it choose? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) The State of Southeast Asia: 2020-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) REVIVING ASEAN-CENTRIC REGIONALISM Amid today’s global uncertainties, Indonesia must find a pathway to navigate the escalating geopolitical competition. Enhancing its leadership within ASEAN and reinforcing regionalism may provide a cushion in case of future conflicts. Consequently, Prabowo is likely to project a more proactive regional role. While Prabowo may insist that his administration must adhere to a 'free and active' foreign policy and maintain balanced ties with both the US and China, he is expected to adopt a more assertive stance within ASEAN, particularly on security and economic matters.[14] This strategy corroborates well with the views of foreign policy elites in Jakarta. According to The State of Southeast Asia surveys, Indonesians increasingly view ASEAN as an essential counterbalance to China’s dominant economic role in the region (see Chart 5). Although China continues to be regarded as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s confidence in ASEAN is gaining momentum. When the first survey was conducted in 2020, only 10.4 per cent of Indonesian respondents viewed ASEAN as the most influential economic force in the region; by 2024, this share had nearly tripled (28 per cent). Amid geoeconomic uncertainties, ASEAN has upheld its multilateral trade frameworks, most notably through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and continues to negotiate trade agreements and investment facilitation with major dialogue partners. This openness and commitment to multilateral systems have led Indonesians to place high hopes in ASEAN. Chart 5. China remains the most influential economic power, while confidence in ASEAN continues to rise In your view, which country/regional organisation is the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia? The State of Southeast Asia: 2019-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) A similar trend is observed in perceptions of global leadership. In the same surveys, respondents were asked which country or regional organisation they had the strongest confidence in to provide leadership in maintaining the rules-based order and upholding international law. Among Indonesian respondents, ASEAN has increasingly been seen as the leader in this regard over the past three years, surpassing the EU, which held that position in 2021 (see Chart 6). ASEAN has consistently advocated for a rules-based multilateral system, both regionally and globally. It has promoted dialogue, cooperation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes through frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the East Asia Summit (EAS). ASEAN also played a critical role in advocating the implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and the ongoing negotiations for a Code of Conduct (COC) to manage regional tensions. Although progress has been slow, ASEAN continues to emphasise the importance of international law in resolving conflicts. Chart 6. ASEAN increasingly seen as the leader in maintaining rules-based order and upholding international law Who do you have the most confidence in to provide leadership to maintain the rules-based order and uphold international law? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) Looking at this trend, Indonesia could advocate a stronger regional security architecture, and emphasise the defence of maritime sovereignty amid Chinese incursions. On the economic front, the Prabowo administration may focus on improving intra-regional trade, strengthening supply chains, and boosting investment within Southeast Asia. However, structural challenges within ASEAN, such as divergent interests and strategic misalignment among member states, will likely constrain progress toward a collective regional security framework. Despite these challenges, Indonesia is expected to remain committed to ASEAN centrality, and to use that as a platform to balance external powers and promote autonomy.[15] CONCLUSION In conclusion, Indonesia’s foreign policy under Prabowo Subianto is poised to mark a significant shift away from its traditional Western alliances, reflecting both changing domestic priorities and evolving geopolitical dynamics. The administration’s focus on economic growth, regional security, and international diplomacy is likely to reinforce Indonesia’s strategic autonomy, with particular emphasis being put on deepening ties within Asia and diversifying its partnerships. With the appointment of several former military personnel to his Cabinet, including as foreign minister, Indonesia is expected to adopt a more security-oriented lens in its economic policies and international diplomacy. Indonesia’s growing scepticism towards Western trade conditionalities, such as those imposed by the US and EU, will likely continue to influence its foreign policy direction; it is expected to seek alternatives to economic frameworks that are perceived as restrictive. At the same time, Indonesia’s commitment to ASEAN as a central platform for regional cooperation and leadership, particularly in upholding a rules-based order, reflects the nation’s desire to enhance its regional influence while navigating the complex US-China rivalry. As the Prabowo administration seeks to recalibrate Indonesia’s international posture, the evolving trends in regional and global leadership suggest that Indonesia’s foreign policy will increasingly be driven by a vision of economic sovereignty and multilateral engagement, with ASEAN and potentially BRICS playing a pivotal role in this transformation.

How China Is Weaponizing Its Dominance In Critical Minerals Trade...	By Keith Rockwell Export curbs applied to technology or critical raw materials are often justified by the need to promote downstream industries, the raising of revenue and environmental protection. But there are other motivations, including the desire to gain an upper hand on a geopolitical rival. Governments justify export restrictions as necessary for national security, an ill-defined concept often used to defend trade-distorting actions. During the 2007 food crisis, countries hoarded rice and maize. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments applied export bans on vaccines and medical diagnostic products. The war in Ukraine saw Russia restricting agricultural, mineral and energy exports. An average of more than 110 export restrictions were introduced each yearbetween 2021–23. China’s December 2024 ban on exports to the United States of critical raw materials was predictable, given their strategic value in the production of semiconductors, electric batteries and armaments. The number of restrictions on the export of critical raw materials applied by governments grew more than five-fold between 2009–20 to 13,102. But this move represents a dangerous step which will further damage US–China relations. Gallium is used in semiconductors, germanium in both semiconductors and infrared technologies, antimony in the production of everything from bullets to missiles, while graphite is critical for electric batteries. China dominates the world market in all of these materials, producing roughly 60 per cent of the world’s germanium, 80 per cent of global gallium production and 78 per cent of antimony. The perceived utility of export curbs was underscored when China replied to Donald Trump’s decision to hit Chinese goods with 10 per cent tariffs. In addition to its imposing import duties on automobiles and filing a dispute settlement case at the World Trade Organization, Beijing imposed another layer of export restrictions on 4 February, this time on materials used in the production of military, information technology and clean energy products. Beijing’s muscle flexing signals to Trump that it will respond aggressively to Washington’s cascade of trade restrictions. In the past, China’s actions have been a direct response to the cavalcade of technology sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies. In 2018, the Trump administration banned Huawei and ZTE telecommunications equipment for government use. US allies later adopted similar prohibitions. Under former president Joe Biden, the United States banned exports to China of advanced semiconductors, quantum computing equipment and lithography equipment, also barring Japanese and Dutch companies using US technology from exporting to China. Reciprocal sanctions have driven up costs for both US and Chinese tech companies and fuelled national security concerns. Washington’s fear of being shut out of supply chains led the Biden administration to completely rethink its approach. Sustainability and ‘friendshoring’ became the principal objectives. In 2006 and 2010, China imposed export restrictions on rare earth minerals that are important components in defence technologies, clean energy products, smartphones, digital cameras and computer hard disks. China is the dominant global producer of rare earths, mining 240,000 tonnes in 2023. Chinese reserves at the end of 2023 amounted to 44 million tonnes. By contrast, the United States — the second largest producer — extracted 43,000 tonnes and had reserves of 1.8 million tonnes. Alarmed at the prospect of being cut off from rare earth supplies, Washington, Brussels and Tokyo all brought cases against China to the World Trade Organization in 2012. The United States argued that the artificial shortage of these minerals constituted a national security threat. In 2014, dispute settlement panels ruled in their favour and the Chinese measures were withdrawn. Trade restrictions have been unsettling and costly, but have also inspired companies to adapt, either with alternative technologies or by exploring new sources of materials. Despite US sanctions, Chinese companies have shown surprising resilience. Cut off from imports of advanced chips, Huawei developed its own advanced semiconductor for its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. Barred from using technologies like Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android in the production of its smartphones, the company unveiled in August 2023 its own operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT. Price surges for scarce minerals — gallium has risen 212 per cent from its 2020 price of US$298.20 per kilogram — have also driven new entrants to the mining business, threatening China’s dominant position. This mirrors the rising global production of rare earth metals since 1995, jumping from 75.7 kilotons to more than 350 kilotons in 2023. It is impossible to predict whether Trump will ramp up sanctions against China or seek a deal for greater access to the vast Chinese market. He is a dealmaker, but has also pledged to levy tariffs as high as 60 per cent on all Chinese goods and has surrounded himself with China hawks who will encourage a hard line. Distrust of Beijing in Washington is deep and cuts across party lines. Many US commentators see China weakened by slowing economic growth, demographic challenges and few real allies. But it would be a mistake to take China lightly. The January announcement that Chinese tech company Deepseek has developed an artificial intelligence model at a fraction of the cost of Western companies is further proof of this. President Xi Jinping is determined to preserve and augment China’s greatness and has made clear that any future aggression will be dealt with promptly and formidably. Even before Trump’s decisive victory in November, the US–China relationship was volatile. As he retakes the White House, there is a real risk that relations will deteriorate further. Keeping a lid on trade tensions will be a tall order. About the author: Keith M Rockwell is Senior Research Fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and Global Fellow at the Wilson Center.

Elections Won’t Save Haiti – OpEd	By Caleb Mills In a recent interview with TV5 Monde, Haiti’s transitional council president Leslie Voltaire told a nation on the brink of collapse that tentative elections would be scheduled for mid-November. It’s been nearly a decade since the small island’s last democratic contest, and understandably so. The guardrails for democracy have all but collapsed in the years since, and in its place, anarchical gang warfare has swept across a broken state. It begs the question; can a country where half the inhabitants currently face starvation support an election? Is Haiti’s violent political climate right for a democratic transition? The situation on the ground is critical. In the two years since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, Haiti has crumbled under the weight of local competing gangs and warlords. By 2023, roughly 60% of the capital city, Port-au-Prince, was occupied by non-governmental factions, with violence openly tearing into the streets and bringing everyday life to a standstill. For many, like musician Jean Jean-Pierre, simply leaving the house was a dauntingly dangerous task. 'When you do go out you are so aware of everything – a car behind you, a motorcycle behind you. You never know if a vehicle just wants to pass you, or pass you and force you to stop for a kidnapping because it happens so often,' Jean-Pierre toldUSA Today in March 2023. The situation has not improved almost two years after he made that statement. As a result, mass displacement of local residents has become a pressing issue for authorities in Port-Au-Prince. 'The gangs forced us out. I lost my parents – my mother and father. The gangs burned them alive in the house, and now we can’t go back,' one refugee told Reuters. Besides the recent introduction of an 800-strong UN peacekeeping force, little else has been done to quell the violence that has ravaged the island. In December, gang leader Micanor 'Mikanò' Altès was accused by the Haitian government of carrying out a massacre of nearly 200 people, following accusations of witchcraft in regard to his child’s illness. 'The massacre was triggered by the severe illness of his child. Micanor sought advice from a voodoo priest (‘bókò’) who accused elderly people in the area of practicing witchcraft and harming the child,' a report referenced by CNN said. 'On Friday, December 6, Micanor shot and killed at least 60 elderly individuals. On Saturday, December 7, he and his group killed at least 50 more using machetes and knives. Despite his actions, his ill child passed away. In addition, violence and political instability have brought the island to the brink of all-out famine. According to a report from the Food Security Phase Classification, over 5 million Haitians in September were at risk for starvation, with 18% facing emergency-level hunger. From a logistical perspective, holding elections in this environment may not even be possible. The amount of investment required by the state to organize such a polarizing event would require a level of both hard and soft power which Haiti severely lacks. Furthermore, even if elections were successfully held, the legitimacy of such a contest would immediately be called into question, considering that Port-au-Prince lacks territorial sovereignty over its own country. Will competing gangs allow Haitians to even vote? Could polling booths become the next victim of the unmitigated violence that these gangs have wrought over the island? By almost every facet at thus juncture, holding elections in Haiti would not only prove irresponsible, but perhaps impossible altogether. Ballots can’t feed the hungry. Nor does campaigning and electoral posturing do much to stabilize a failed state. While the consistent pursuit of the democratic tradition is ultimately in Haiti’s best interest, the timing for that noble experiment may be slightly off. Voltaire’s push to form a democratically elected government is admirable, but it does little to solve the very pressing issues currently facing his country. Achieving democratic representation must be the final step in a long, drawn-out process towards rejuvenation. Elections won’t save Haiti; only a concerted, national program for recovery can do that.

What We Learned From High-Stakes US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia ...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Top U.S. and Russian officials have finished their first talks on ending the war in Ukraine, with the Kremlin voicing new demands as Washington and Moscow agreed to move quickly to normalize their ties and begin negotiations around the nearly three-year conflict. The more than four-hour meeting in Riyadh -- which was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- is part of a major diplomatic push by the United States to bring the war to an end. The discussions were framed by U.S. officials as exploratory talks that could pave the way for a potential in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rubio told reporters after the February 18 meeting in the Saudi capital that the talks were 'the first step of a long and difficult journey' over ending the war in Ukraine and that the U.S. and Russian delegations agreed on four principles during their discussions. These comprise fully restoring their diplomatic missions in Washington and Moscow after years of sanctions and expulsions, appointing a high-level team to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, exploring further 'geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine,' and ensuring that the U.S. and Russian delegations present in Riyadh will remain engaged in discussions moving forward. Lavrov called the meeting 'very useful' and said Moscow would aim to appoint a special envoy as soon as possible. 'I have every reason to believe that the American side understands our position,' Lavrov said. Russia's chief foreign policy adviser, Yury Ushakov, who was part of the country's delegation, added that the two sides briefly discussed the conditions needed for a Putin-Trump summit. However, he added that the decision to begin deeper talks with the United States about Ukraine would ultimately rest with Putin himself. 'It's useful for the Trump administration's senior national-security team to hear these Russian positions and they can take them back to the president,' John Deni, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told RFE/RL. 'It's still too early to know what the Russians might be willing to give up or hold onto.' Key Takeaways From Saudi Meeting (Diplomatic) Boots On The Ground. The two sides agreed to re-staff their diplomatic posts in Washington and Moscow. It's a diplomatic spat that predates the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, stretching into the first Trump administration (dozens expelled on both sides), and even the Obama administration, which also shuttered two diplomatic compounds in the States. Putting more diplomats on the ground is, by all accounts, fairly noncontroversial. For its part, the Kremlin signaled prior to Riyadh it wants those compounds back. Give Peace A Chance. The delegations agreed to create a high-level team to focus specifically on the Ukraine conflict. But the devil is in the details: Is NATO membership off the table? European peacekeepers? More weapons for Kyiv? Fewer sanctions for Moscow? We won't get any hints of what's on the table for weeks. Something else to watch: a side comment made earlier by Putin in the Kremlin readout of his call with Trump, which referenced 'root causes' of the Ukraine war. If it pops up again, it may augur bad news for Ukrainian independence or autonomy. 'Closer Relations And Economic Cooperation.' That can mean pretty much anything, but one bit of low-hanging fruit for closer relations is space cooperation. Russia and the United States for years largely succeeded in shielding their joint space work from politics. That's atrophied in recent years. Signing a new agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would be an easy, noncontroversial move. What Came From The Meetings? The meeting appears to have laid the foundation for future talks between Moscow and Washington, with both Rubio and Lavrov saying each side will restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow to create missions to support Ukraine peace talks, bilateral relations, and cooperation more broadly. In a statement, the U.S. State Department said delegations from both countries have agreed to 'address irritants' in their ties with the goal of normalizing diplomatic relations after years of tensions. Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said both countries will explore 'future cooperation' but cautioned an exact timeline still remains unclear, noting, 'One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace.'She added the Riyadh talks are an early step in a longer process. Lavrov said the two sides 'practically agreed' that they need to resolve issues concerning the functioning of diplomatic missions. On Ukraine, he said there was 'a mutual desire' to find solutions and Russia will wait for the United States to appoint its representatives. 'After that, relevant consultations will begin and will be regular,' he said. The Russian foreign minister added the potential of any deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine -- which has been floated by some Western governments -- would be a 'completely unacceptable' proposal for the Kremlin. Separately, Russian officials said a long-term peace deal in Ukraine will not be possible without addressing a wider range of security concerns across Europe. 'A comprehensive long-term settlement is impossible without a comprehensive consideration of security issues on the continent,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on February 18. Peskov also said Putin would be open to talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'if necessary.' Putin had previously said he was unwilling to negotiate with Zelenskyy because his rule is 'illegitimate,' in part because Ukraine has not held elections since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. Speaking in Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow wants NATO to disavow its 2008 promise to one day give Ukraine membership of the military alliance, and for Kyiv to agree to neutrality. What Happens Next? Both sides all agreed to appoint envoys and continue talks moving forward. Rubio also hinted at a role for the EU further down the line, saying that 'there are other parties that have sanctions, the European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.' Jana Puglierin, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said both Kyiv and its European allies have watched anxiously from the sidelines as U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh and worries are high in Ukraine and European capitals that Trump could cut a hasty deal with Moscow that ignores their security interests. She says European leaders are currently grappling with multiple 'turning points' set off by Russia launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as well as recent comments by top U.S. officials suggesting Europe will need to play a larger part in security issues. 'February 2022 destroyed our faith in a collective security order with Russia and showed us the dark side of our fundamental dependence on Russia and China in critical areas,' she said. 'February 2025 shows us that the Americans no longer feel responsible for European security -- and that their interests are fundamentally different from ours.' European leaders held emergency talks in Paris on February 17 to discuss the war in Ukraine and European security matters but were unable to reach any agreement. Following the meeting in Saudi Arabia, U.S. national-security adviser Michael Waltz said any postwar peace guarantee would have to be 'European-led,' echoing calls by U.S. officials for European allies to increase defense spending and praising Britain and France for 'talking about contributing more forcefully to Ukraine's security.'Zeleneskyy has criticized the talks due to their lack of a Ukrainian representative and he called for 'fair' peace talks about ending the war, arguing they should also involve the European Union, Turkey, and Britain. The Atlantic Council's Deni said any potential settlement that can be reached is still likely far off and will require further discussions with Ukraine and European governments. He added the meeting in Riyadh should be seen as the latest U.S. attempt to reset relations with Russia, following similar efforts by former President George W. Bush in 2001 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Each of those diplomatic pushes ended with strained ties and new geopolitical flashpoints in Georgia and Ukraine. 'At a certain point you need to speak to your adversary and diplomacy needs to be in the U.S. toolbox,' Deni said. 'Reset efforts make sense, but in the past they've ended in disappointment.'

US Energy Department Offers Fresh Figures On Caspian Basin Energy...	(Eurasianet) -- A new US Department of Energy survey provides updated data on oil & natural gas production in the CaspianBasin. It shows that four regional states – Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – collectively account for 3 percent of global energy production. The Regional Analysis Brief: Caspian Sea additionally provides an overview of regional coal production, power generation and energy export routes, as well as a breakdown of regional refinery operations. Azerbaijan possesses oil reserves in 2025 of about 7 billion barrels and gas reserves of about 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), according to the US Energy Department report. Virtually all production is generated offshore. Oil production has fallen from nearly 1 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2010 to an estimated 600,000 b/d currently. Natural gas production, meanwhile, achieved a record high in 2023 (the last year for which data is available), totaling 1.3 Tcf. Azerbaijan is maximizing gas production to meet ambitious EU supply commitments. Kazakhstan’s proven oil reserves topped 30 billion barrels in 2025 and gas reserves were pegged at 85 Tcf. About 1.5 million b/d of crude oil and 400,000 b/d of petroleum liquid fuels were extracted in 2024. The country produced 1 Tcf of natural gas, most of which was used for domestic consumption. About a third of the gas extracted 'was reinjected to increase oil production,' according to the Energy Department survey, which adds that 'natural gas produced at [the] Tengiz and Kashagan [fields] generally is high in sulfur and so, requires special handling and additional expense to process.' Turkmenistan possesses the world’s fifth highest proven natural gas reserves, 400 Tcf in 2025, the report states. Dry natural gas production reached 3.0 Tcf in 2023, the highest annual total since records started being kept in 1992. Most exports presently head east to China, but Ashgabat is looking to expand export options, including southward via a trans-Afghanistan route. The Energy Department highlights an obstacle to expanding Turkmen gas exports to Europe. 'High methane emissions from its oil and natural gas fields threaten Turkmenistan’s prospects to enter the European natural gas market via a potential Trans Caspian Pipeline,' it notes. Turkmen oil reserves are comparatively minor, totaling 600 million barrels, with annual production reaching 275,000 b/d in 2024. Like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan’s oil reserves are relatively negligible at 594 million barrels, with production of 63,000 b/d in 2024, about one-third the level of the country’s peak production 25 years ago. Proven Uzbek gas reserves are 65 Tcf, with production reaching 1.5 Tcf in 2023. Uzbekistan is the only one of the four states covered in the Energy Department report that cannot meet its own energy consumption needs. Kazakhstan is the eighth leading coal producer in the world and the only major producer among the four Caspian states surveyed. About 130 million short tons of coal were extracted in Kazakhstan in 2023, with almost 40 million tons exported. Most of the extracted coal, including exports, was used for electricity generation. Coal is additionally 'a major energy source for the mining and smelting industries,' the report states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwWb1z8jIBcnT	2025-02-18T17:01:09-08:00	
EU’s Top Diplomat Kallas Warns Peacekeeping Is A Putin Trap – Int...	By Alexandra Brzozowski Top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas warned in an interview with Euractiv that Europe's discussion over a possible peacekeeping force in Ukraine risks playing into a 'Russian trap'. Just one day after an emergency meeting of European leaders in Paris, Kallas cautioned that attempts to find a coalition for a peacekeeping mission was premature, as the Russians 'don't want peace, there is no peace.' Before those discussions, she said, Europe's focus should be on putting Ukraine in a position where they are 'able to say no to a bad deal', and that 'the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table.' What follows is an edited transcript. What are your takeaways from how the American 'shock therapy' has been developing since last Wednesday? It's clear that Europe is not at the table in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh... KALLAS: Of course, the Americans can meet with whomever they wish to, but for any peace deal regarding Ukraine to work, it has to involve the Europeans as well as the Ukrainians. What options do we have if Trump refuses to include Europeans in the talks, even at a later stage, as his Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg has suggested? KALLAS: If some deal is agreed that we don't agree to, then it will just fail, because it will not be implemented. Washington seems to have drawn its red lines last week; what should Europe's red lines be when it comes to security guarantees for Ukraine specifically? KALLAS: They walked back from the red lines, because of the reaction they received. It is important that before the negotiations have even started, you don't give away all the main asks that Russia has. Otherwise, Russia's aggression really pays off: not only have they occupied some territory – so they have additional territory and mineral resources – but then on top of this, they get all these promises from the other side as well. I don't think it's a good negotiation tactic, nor is it strong. We have, from our side, put in place conditions that need to be there. But first, we really need to put pressure on Russia – that is the first element here. Right now, if you also look at the images from Saudi Arabia, the Russians are the winners. Their posture is: 'Everybody is coming to us now and offering us what we want'. Let's not walk into the Russian traps. What assurances have you received from the American side that the peace talks will not include any broader restructuring of Europe’s security architecture? The Russians will undoubtedly try to go in that direction... KALLAS: We had meetings with a lot of Americans, and, in general, we got different messages, even from the same people, in different meetings. How to understand it all is, of course, a question. What they are saying to us in the meetings is that they will not agree on anything like this. As there are many interlocutors on the American side, we need to accommodate ourselves to the new ways of working with the new administration to understand all the messages. The Americans assured us in every meeting that they were committed to Europe and working together. They're committed to NATO and understand the security concerns of Europe. It is clear that Europeans will be the ones asked to secure any kind of future deal, but the Paris summit has not produced concrete plans. How fast can we come up with a plan? And why didn't we have one in place in the first place? KALLAS: Again, if we are talking about peacekeepers, then we are walking into the Russian trap because they don't want peace; there is no peace. If you read the comments of the Russians, they were quite happy; they had already won everything. First, we have to put pressure on Putin so he wants to move towards peace. The Ukrainians say presence for the sake of presence is not feasible. Under what mandate could such a force work? KALLAS: If the discussion comes to this, then we can discuss it, but we are not at this point. Right now, we should focus our strength on supporting Ukraine and the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table. We should put Ukraine in a position [of strength] where they are able to say no to a bad deal. Arguably, we had three years to do that, to put them in a 'position of strength'? KALLAS: You can't imagine how frustrated I am that this is three years now. Yesterday someone was telling me, 'but the defence industry needs time'. I mean, they have had time. They have had time for three years when the war has been a full-scale war. It's not only a question of the sovereignty of Ukraine. It's a question of our sovereignty, of the global world as we know it, where might does not make a right. Yes, we have had a lot of time, but on the positive side, I remember the shock of 24 February 2022 when things started to happen. I feel that now we are in the same position. I am relatively optimistic that we will get our act together. But do you see the danger that now that peace talks have officially started and there is a perspective of the war ending, the urgency will disappear? KALLAS: In many societies, there is this will to pack things up, and go back to business as usual. We also have to understand that any kind of bad deal is just a deal for Russia to regroup and attack again. With every hesitation, the price just goes up. Making investments in defence right now requires painful decisions from all societies, but not making them would come at a higher cost later. If we draw the parallels with history, then we are in the situation of 1938. The difference now is that, unlike Czechoslovakia, Ukraine has now decided to fight. The only ask for us is to reallocate our resources and help them to defend themselves so there will be no Second World War. I don't know how to convey this to the public of different member states. What will you do if the US lifts sanctions? It seems that this could be part of the mix at some point. What do we do then? KALLAS: It is not wise to give up the strong card that we have in our hands. Why do the Russians want the lifting of sanctions? Because they hurt them and they want to go back to business as usual. This is the strong card that we have in our hands, and we shouldn't give it away. We shouldn't underestimate our own power because what we see is that their economy is in a very bad situation: Their national fund is almost completely depleted, and their national bank interest rate is over 20%, which is, by the way, worse than Haiti's. They can't raise capital outside because of the [Western] sanctions. They don't get the same revenues from oil and gas that they used to, and their employment market is in a really bad place. They want us to believe that they are the strong ones here, but actually, it is not true, and we should not walk into that trap.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwR4bg70trmc9	2025-02-18T16:57:03-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Two-Pronged Strategy To Gut The ‘Deep State’ – OpE...	By Alfredo Toro Hardy US President Donald Trump is convinced that the 'deep state' thwarted his first term, robbing him of the 2020 election. Expunging it seems to have become his main priority of this second term. But, is there such a thing as a deep state? There certainly is. It would be enough to read the memoirs of former US presidents or secretaries to discover their frustration in face of the bureaucratic resistance confronted while in office. In this regard, those of former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, written a few decades ago, were particularly enlightening. The following excerpts from his Memoirs speak volumes. They referred to the interaction between the White House and the Pentagon: 'Orders were given in that respect, but our military bureaucracy resists intromissions in strategic doctrine even if they come from the White House (…) When I assumed my functions, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told me that he too had tried to give more options to the President in strategic matters, but he finally desisted given the bureaucratic resistance (…) A 1969 presidential request demanding a reasoned explanation on the naval programs was never satisfactorily answered during the eight years that I served in Washington. The responses given were always close to insubordination and far from being useful.' The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis had also much to tell in this regard. One of the main reasons that led Nikita Khruschev, the Secretary General of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, to install missiles in Cuba was the presence of American missiles in Turkey, bordering the Soviet Union. US President John F. Kennedy understood the risks involved therein. Several months before the crisis, he had ordered that the US’s missiles be removed, as they represented an unnecessary provocation. However, bureaucratic resistance both within the State Department and the Department of Defense thwarted the implementation of such orders, which were never carried out. Moreover, during the infamous 13 days of the crisis, the US Navy was reluctant to obey the president’s orders with regard to the Cuban naval blockade. While Kennedy wanted to give Khruschev time to see, think and blink, bureaucracy within the Navy did all it could to circumvent those orders and put in place its own book of procedures. Additionally, when tensions between both countries peaked, and war could have ensued at any moment, an American spy plane crashed in Siberia. The Air Force bureaucracy had kept its regular procedures in place, notwithstanding Kennedy’s insistence on acting with the utmost prudence. The deep state, indeed, exists. It represents the natural impulse of the federal bureaucracy to act in accordance with its own institutional aims, set of rules and particular subculture. Seeing presidents and secretaries as simple snowbirds, bureaucratic loyalties are entrenched within their own institutions. For someone like Trump who, more than requiring loyalty for his agenda demands fealty to his person, this represents the worst of sins. Indeed, 'he demands personal loyalty—or what John Bolton, Trump’s longest-serving national security adviser in his first term, has called ‘fealty, a medieval concept implying not mere loyalty but submission.’' The interaction of complete opposites such as these can only lead to a trainwreck. Trump’s pincers: destabilizing federal departments from both sides In his second term, Trump aims to bend the federal bureaucracy into submission through a pincer strategy. One jaw pursues its destabilization from the inside by putting federal departments and offices under the control of well-known disrupters. The other jaw harasses and destabilizes these organizations from the outside. The avowed intention of this dual process is taming bureaucrats by making them feel vulnerable and insecure, by demolishing their sense of entitlement and career safety. In the words of Russell Vought, the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget: 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.' The first jaw, thus, is entrusted to people that have 'sworn' personal allegiance to Trump. Experience or knowledge regarding their assigned area is not an employment requisite, though. An important historical precedent in this regard dates back to 12th-century England. Faced with the Church’s resistance to his rule, Henry II of Plantagenet decided to appoint his closest friend, the conspicuous dissolute Thomas Becket, as Archbishop of Canterbury. The problem ended up being that Becket realized that his true base of power resided in the Church that he was supposed to 'rule,' and not in the king that had put him in charge. As the king’s man, he was fated to be institutionally resisted, thus becoming feeble and ineffectual. Contrariwise, by submitting to the Church’s interests and organizational subculture, he could personify the political might of that institution. Hence, he sided with the Church. This phenomenon is well known in contemporary US politics. For a political appointee, siding with the bureaucratic organization is known as 'going native.' When a secretary becomes a 'native' of the Department that they were chosen to lead, they acquire real power. Otherwise, the risk of remaining as an inefficacious figurehead is always present. Conscious of that reality, US presidents tend to choose figures with knowledge of the subjects involved, but at the same time with sufficient personal standing and integrity. The former is to avoid manipulation from the inside of the organization. The latter is for them to promote workable compromises between bureaucratic and political objectives. Although an imperfect solution, it is a pragmatic one. Trump, however, searches for absolutes. He not only wants personal allegiance from his barons but for them to forcefully control their fiefs. This is why he places so much importance in choosing disruptive figures, people susceptible of exacting obedience under the continuous threat of chaos. This translates into management by fear. However, installing fear from the inside may not be enough. That is why the second jaw of the pincer searches to project it from the outside as well. It does so through a blistering shake-up of federal bureaucracy: shutting down or dismantling agencies, ousting federal appointees before their term has ended, planning large-scale layoffs, reviewing the elimination or combination of bureaucratic divisions or entire agencies, transforming civil servants’ failure to implement the president’s will into cause for disciplining and separation. All this and more. Much of the above is being done in overt violation of the US Constitution’s separation of power. Since the inception of the Republic, indeed, it has always been the legislative branch that decides how to structure the executive branch, creating departments, giving them functions and providing their funds. Not anymore. So far, though, judicial authority in this field has been respected. However, a furious rhetoric on challenging the judiciary builds up in the president’s camp. All of this, of course, must be sending shock waves of fright upon federal bureaucrats, who feel that they may no longer be protected by the rule of law. Trump’s strategy may damage the US No doubt about it, this pincer strategy could be utterly effective in domesticating the deep state, rendering it docile. The problem is that it can disassemble the State itself in the process. It can, indeed, make a big mess of federal institutions, procedures and civil service, degrading the capacity for policy implementation and distorting institutional memory and governance know-how. Additionally, it can dangerously meddle with the Constitutional separation of power. Hammering the foundations upon which the federal government and the branches of government depend for their functioning, is indeed a risky business — one that could turn a global superpower upside down and set in motion a spiral of decline. Frankly speaking, though, a good dose of pure deep state doesn’t seem like such a bad thing, when faced with proposals such as turning Gaza into an American Riviera while permanently expelling the Palestinian population, retaking the Panama Canal or absorbingGreenland. And what about Trump’s repeated questioning of Canada’s viability as a nation and his threats to annex it through economic force? Indeed, the US might need its deep state.

US Government’s Excessive Spending Scandal Grows Bigger – OpEd	Members of the Biden-Harris administration went on a massive spending bender during their final four months in office. By that, I mean they figuratively blew a hole in the U.S. government’s budget as they headed out the door. This assessment is not included in the January 2025 Monthly Treasury Statement, which provides data on the U.S. government’s spending and revenues during its 2025 fiscal year to date. The statement covers the period from October 1, 2024, through January 31, 2025. During these four months, the U.S. government spent $2.44 trillion and collected $1.60 trillion in taxes. The difference between the amount spent and the federal government’s revenues is $840 billion. That deficit represents the biggest fiscal hole ever dug by any presidential administration during the first four months of any fiscal year. The chart below reveals how the U.S. government’s spending compares with the previous two fiscal years. Looking at revenue first, the federal government’s tax collections through January 2025 are slightly ahead of what they were a year ago. That’s good because the U.S. government collected a record amount of taxes in its 2024 fiscal year. It is on track to beat it in 2025. A lack of revenue is not the problem. The Real Problem The improvement in revenue is almost unnoticeable because it is dwarfed by the massive increase in spending. Cumulative spending through the first four months of FY 2025 is 15% higher than it was at the same point in FY 2024. It is also over 26% higher than FY 2023’s cumulative spending. The excessive spending is clearly unsustainable. It is so unsustainable that it raises the very good question of how they were spending it. The news in recent weeks was filled with horror stories about the role of USAID in contributing to the Biden-Harris administration’s flood of spending. But that’s just a drop in the bucket of government waste. The real problem is much bigger. This realization leads to more questions. How many other federal government agencies were also involved in the Biden-Harris administration’s growing spending scandal? Where has the money entrusted to their control gone? A full accounting of the excessive spending of U.S. politicians and bureaucrats is long overdue. They owe nothing less to the American people.

Trump’s Revival Of Lincoln’s ‘Colonization’ Plan – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo Now that the US and Israeli military has bombed almost all of Gaza into a smoldering ruin and killed tens or hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, President Trump has proposed getting Jordan and Egypt to house the remaining Palestinians. He has threatened to withdraw US taxpayer 'aid' to these countries if they do not accept his proposal. This is essentially a revival of Lincoln’s lifelong dream of deporting or 'colonizing' all of the black people out of the United States. Roy Basler, the editor of The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, wrote that as of 1857 Lincoln had no policy regarding slavery 'except the colonization idea which he inherited from Henry Clay.' When he was asked what was to happen to the slaves should they ever be freed he said, 'Send them to Liberia, to their own native land.' As president Lincoln held a White House meeting with free black men and implored them to lead by example and resettle in Africa. They wisely declined his offer. He did develop plans to send every last black person to Africa, Haiti, Central America, anywhere but in the US. As Phil Magness and Sebastian Page documented in their book, Colonization after Emancipation, Lincoln and his administration were hard at work until his dying day counting how many ships it would take to deport or 'colonize,' as they said, all the black people. Henry Clay was Lincoln’s professed political idol and role model. In his 1852 eulogy to Clay Lincoln praised him as a founding member of the American Colonization Society and said that 'colonization' was one of his 'most cherished objects.' Lincoln approvingly quoted Clay in the eulogy as having said that 'there is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children.' It would be 'a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe,' he said. Lincoln himself said that sending all the black people to Africa would be 'the ultimate redemption of the African race' and that every year 'had added strength to the hope of its [deportation] realization. May indeed it be realized!' In his December 1, 1862 message to Congress Lincoln reiterated that 'I cannot make it better known that it already is, that I strongly favor colonization.' One major benefit of 'colonization,' Lincoln said was that 'their places [i.e., jobs] be . . . filled up by free white laborers.' At the time, only adult white males or 'free white laborers' had the right to vote. Lincoln was the manager of the Illinois Colonization Society before becoming president, and the Society got the Illinois legislature to allocate tax funds for the purpose of deporting the small number of free blacks out of the state. As president Lincoln appointed Senator Samuel Pomeroy to supervise 'resettlement effort.' Pomeroy recommended deporting black people to a new Central American colony that would be named 'Lincolnia.' The Lincoln administration paid a businessman named Bernard Kock to establish a colony in Haiti but Kock turned out to be a crook and an embezzler so nothing came of it. All of this caused the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to declare that Lincoln 'had not a drop of anti-slavery blood in his veins' and called him 'The President of African Colonization.' Of course the Lincoln Cult has dozens of excuses for Lincoln’s Ku Klux Klanish attitude towards black people. They claimed for generations that Lincoln somehow gave up on the idea in 1863 but the book Colonization after Emancipation proved that to be untrue. The well known Civil War historian Gabor Boritt wrote in his edited book, The Lincoln Enigma, that Lincoln’s colonization proposals were 'noble.' He concocts numerous rationales and excuses, which after all is what makes one a 'Lincoln Scholar.' The most entertaining excuse is his statement that Lincoln’s lifelong advocacy of colonization is 'how honest people lie.' A perfect example of what makes one a 'Lincoln Scholar.' President Trump’s proposal to colonize Palestinians in Jordan or Egypt is hardly different from Lincoln’s colonization fetish. Both men treat a group of people as lepers who should be eradicated from society and who should be denied property rights in their own country no matter how many generations their family has lived there. Lincoln’s rationale was the subtitle of Lerone Bennett, Jr.’s book Forced into Glory: 'Abraham Lincoln’s White Dream.' (Bennett was the long time editor of Ebony magazine and an author of several books). As for Trump, his rationale seems to be payback for the $100 million campaign donation from Miriam Adelson and the prospect of participating in the Mother of All Real Estate Developments in the Middle East.

To Bomb Or Not To Bomb Iran – OpEd	By Jonathan Power The talk is talk. Or will it walk? President Donald Trump has raised the stakes once again, repeating the threats against Iran in his first term. It all goes back many years. Mitt Romney, the US Republican candidate for the presidency, said that on his watch Iran would not be allowed to build a nuclear weapon but that on his watch, if elected, the future president, Barack Obama, would let it happen. In an issue of Foreign Affairs, a mouthpiece of the American foreign affairs establishment, Mathew Kroenig penned soon after Obama took office an article, 'Time to Attack Iran. The time for talk is over', he wrote. Foreign policy analysts seem to overlook that it was the US who encouraged the Shah 75 years ago to begin Iran’s nuclear programme. The first discussion I attended on whether Iran was wanting a bomb was at the International Institute for Strategic Studies some 40 years ago. Experts were saying we should expect a bomb within a decade. Time passes but the argument barely change and no bomb has been made. All one knows is that in all this time many opportunities for a sensible negotiation have been ignored. 'Enormously difficult' to destroy Iran’s nuclear plant Kroenig wrote that, 'If Iran begins enriching its uranium to weapons grade levels of 90% or installs advanced centrifuges at its uranium-enrichment facility in Qom the US must strike immediately.' While admitting that it would be 'enormously difficult' to destroy Iran’s nuclear plant, Kroenig argued it could and should be done. New bunker-busting bombs would take care of underground facilities. They can penetrate through 200 feet of reinforced concrete. However, he admitted that the one at Qom would be a challenging target since it is built into the side of a mountain. He tried to knock down those critics who point out that Iran could retaliate, launching missiles at US military installations in the Gulf, closing the Strait of Hormuz, the relatively narrow (but not that narrow) water that tankers pass through at the opening to the Persian Gulf, firing missiles into Israel and activating proxies abroad. The US, he argues, could retaliate with devastating military action. Iran won’t be able to resume progress after its entire nuclear infrastructure is reduced to rubble. He discounts much—that this would strengthen Iran’s hardliners as it did in Germany after the blanket bombing of Dresden. Thankfully, the pro bomb faction has been undermined by many observers including Israeli’s ex-prime minister, Ehud Barak, who has long said that any decision on an Israeli attack on Iran was 'very far off'. Many experts believe that Iran has not yet decided whether to make a nuclear bomb. Perhaps too one should not overlook statements made by the hierarchy of Iran in this very religious country that it goes against the Koran to build a weapon of mass destruction. Could they justify lying to God? Another Middle Eastern war? Added to that, Koenig underestimates how Iran is building safer and safer hideaways. It can match any bomb by digging deeper. Does the US want to get drawn into another Middle Eastern war which would have serious spill-over effects in further radicalising Pakistan, Afghanistan, Palestine and big chunks of the population throughout the Middle East? Interestingly, some Israeli policymakers appear to have got the message some time ago. According to a poll conducted by the American Brookings Institution and the Israeli Dahaf Institute only a minority of Israeli Jews support a military strike even though 90% of them think Iran will eventually acquire nuclear weapons. When asked whether it would be better for both Israel and Iran not to have such weapons 65% of the Jews said 'yes'. Support for the idea of a nuclear-free zone A remarkable 64% support the idea of a nuclear-free zone. Moreover, a freeze has been supported by such unexpected characters as the former Mossad (intelligence) chief, Tair Pardo, a former Mossad chief, Ephraim Halevy, and a former chief of staff of the military, Dan Halutz. Could Iran refuse the proposition of a nuclear-free zone, if it came from Israel? The Israeli government has always put the cart before the horse. It says a nuclear-free zone cannot be considered until there is peace between Israel and its neighbours. But the answer to that, argues Harvard professor, Nicolas Burns, is there will be no peace as long as Iran and Israel are at loggerheads. Since Israel is the one who possesses an arsenal of nuclear weapons it must be the first to take steps towards reconciliation. He quotes the former Israeli spy chief, Meir Dagan, who has argued that Israel’s current stance might accelerate Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons and encourage other Arab states to follow suit. Under President Barack Obama the US accepted that talking with Iran was the best option, and after gruelling negotiations a deal was signed. Iran’s enrichment program was halted and the US lifted sanctions. But then his successor Donald Trump tore up the agreement and for 7 years nothing has been done on the diplomatic front, although sanctions have continued. Trump in his first term and now again has threatened war if Iran shows signs of moving towards 90% enrichment. That truly would be a nose-to-nose confrontation. I think there is a better way for America to do it—stop trying to pull Iran down. But with Trump in office, we must prepare for the worst. Trump might well want to walk the talk.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwUy1G_ajCdhn	2025-02-18T16:43:11-08:00	
Kremlin Tells Russia Media To Play Down Trump Lest He Upstage Put...	After US President Donald Trump telephoned Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, the Russian Presidential Administration instructed state-run and pro-government media to 'downplay Trump’s role and mention the US president less often – lest it appear as though Trump is achieving the results Putin failed to deliver,' according to the Meduza news agency. The independent Russian news portal based in Riga says that the Kremlin is 'concerned that Russians might start seeing Trump as a more pro-active and decisive leader than Putin.' And 't prevent this, officials directed journalists to emphasize that the outcome of any talks depends entirely on Putin' (meduza.io/feature/2025/02/14/sozvon-putina-i-trampa-kazhetsya-otlichnym-informatsionnym-povodom-dlya-prokremlevskih-smi). 'A political strategist working with the domestic policy team told Meduza that the Kremlin doesn’t want Trump to be perceived as ‘a strong leader capable of changing the situation.’' That could create a situation in which Putin might 'appear passive – in other words, weak – in comparison.' The news outlet’s source said that Moscow had 'also instructed Russian media outlets to scale back the numbers mentioning Trump, not only with regard to foreign policy but also concerning US domestic policies.' Meduza said that it already sees that some of the Russian government outlets have already adjusted their coverage of the US president.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwXX1Nypx-VYH	2025-02-18T16:39:20-08:00	
Real Corruption That Could Meet Republican Cost-Saving Targets – ...	The news has been filled with stories in recent days about Republicans desperately hunting for $2.0-$2.5 trillion (2-3 percent of the budget) in budget cuts over the next decade to cover the cost of extending tax cuts to the rich. While Elon Musk and his DOGE team have been screaming about corruption all through the government, they actually have found little that can be helpful here. They appear to have found virtually nothing by way of actual corruption. Most of what they have been screaming about are small-budget allocations having to do with race, gender, or sexual orientation that they don’t like. Individually these programs are nickel and dime stuff, and even collectively they won’t come close to covering the cost of the tax cuts that Elon Musk and his billionaire friends need so badly. Instead, the committees in the House and Senate working on designing a budget have focused on cutting Medicaid and SNAP, two programs that largely serve low and moderate-income families. The cuts being debated, if implemented, would deny tens of millions of people access to health care and reduce nutritional support that has meant a huge difference for millions of low-income children. The cuts to Medicaid would also have a devastating impact on rural hospitals since it is a major source of revenue. Many would probably have to close. But if the Republicans really want to find savings by eliminating government corruption, there is an obvious place to look. We pay twice as much for our drugs and other pharmaceutical products as people in other wealthy countries. The reason is that the government grants them patent monopolies. While other governments also grant patent monopolies, they also negotiate drug prices or have some other mechanism that limits the ability of pharmaceutical companies to exploit these monopolies. The United States is alone in granting drug companies monopolies and then telling them to charge whatever they feel like. It’s true that patent monopolies give the industry an incentive to develop new drugs, but we can provide that incentive through other mechanisms, like direct public funding. We had been providing over $50 billion a year in direct funding through the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. In the longer term we can increase this funding and let the new drugs that are developed be sold as cheap generics. This would also end the incentives to lie about the safety and effectiveness of drugs that led to the opioid crisis. (I discuss this in chapter 5 of my book, Rigged [it’s free].) If we began to follow the practice of France, Germany, and everyone else, we could cut our drug bill in half or more. We are on a path to spend over $700 billion this year on pharmaceutical products. If we cut that in half by negotiating prices, that would save us more than $350 billion this year, well over the Republicans’ saving target. It’s true that not all of this spending is done by the government, so the government would not directly be able to pocket all the savings, but it would likely get pretty close to its saving targets through this channel. In addition to the roughly half of spending that is paid by directly the government, the government subsidizes much of the rest through tax deductions. People don’t pay taxes on employer-provided health insurance. If lower drug prices led insurers to reduce annual premiums by $100 billion, this is likely to lead to an increase in taxable income of roughly the same amount. And that would mean higher tax revenue. In short, the Republicans and the DOGE crew are staring at an obvious place to save big bucks by slashing corruption, if they are prepared to go after the pharmaceutical industry with the same vigor that they have gone after programs they labeled as 'DEI' or individuals who have tried to enforce the law when Donald Trump violated it. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Congress are probably as scared of the pharmaceutical industry as they are of Donald Trump. This means we shouldn’t hold out breath waiting for lower drug prices. They will probably look to take away food and health care from low and moderate-income people. It is their way.

Trump International Hotel And Tower, Gaza – OpEd	Donald Trump spoke to reporters for over three hours on Air Force One on his way to see the Super Bowl in New Orleans on 9 February 2025. It was not clear to the reporters who broadcast his comments whether Trump was speaking as the President of the United States, a member of the United Nations, or as a real estate magnate. Gaza, he said, is a 'demolition site' that needed to be 'leveled out' and 'fixed up'. Since Gaza is on the Mediterranean Sea, Trump said, it could be developed into a new French Riviera. According to him, it is not the crime scene of a genocide but 'a big real estate site'. The United States, he said with his presidential smile on, 'will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too'. Palestinians from Gaza listening to this commentary could have imagined that the United States would be funding the reconstruction of Gaza, which has been estimated by the United Nations to be – at a minimum – $53 billion (the cost after the 2014 pulverization of Gaza by Israel was $2.4 billion). In 2023, total US Overseas Development Aid was $66 billion, and, with the cuts proclaimed by President Trump, it is unlikely that the US can muster anything near the bill for the reconstruction of Gaza. There was nothing humanitarian in Trump’s comments about the making of the Gaza Riviera (or since this appears to be a gift to Israel, it is more likely that Trump imagines it to be the Azzah Riviera, using the Zionist name for Gaza, meaning 'strong city'). The Israeli establishment has, from the start of this genocidal campaign, said that it wants to annex Gaza, which seems to be aligned with the Trump vision to make Gaza American or to develop Gaza as a beachside resort for U.S. tourists and Israeli settlers. Knowing Trump, he will likely want to reserve a section of the beachfront for himself and to build a Trump International Hotel and Tower that has a casino attached to it for good measure. Zionist Gentrification None of this is a surprise and nor are these ideas original to Trump. The entire Zionist project imagines an Eretz Israel that stretches from the borders with Egypt to that of Iran. The real estate deed for this is a line in the Bible, 'To your descendants, I have given this land, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river the Euphrates' (Genesis 15:18). It is not clear which river in Egypt this line refers to, whether the Nile or Wadi el-Arish (in the Sinai Peninsula). But if the Euphrates is taken as its border, then the land that Zionists claim includes the entire West Bank and Jerusalem, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the western half of Iraq. There are maps of this kind that can be seen in the offices of far-right Israeli politicians (on 19 March, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich spoke in Paris from a podium that displayed an Israeli map that included Jordan). This is utterly normal in the world of the illegal settlements in the West Bank (part of the UN-mandated Occupied Palestine Territory), which the settlers call Judea and Samaria. Their geography has been different since at least when their spiritual guide Ze’ev Jabotinsky wrote in The Iron Wall(1923) that Zionists must build Eretz Israel behind an 'iron wall, which is to say a strong power in Palestine that is not amenable to any Arab pressure'. Trump is not much of a reader. He probably has never heard of Jabotinsky or of Theodor Herzl. He probably cannot define Zionism. But he knows a real estate opportunity when he sees one, and that is how he has understood his solution to the problems facing Israel. In his first term, Trump made the 'deal of the century', the Abraham Accords, which brought a series of states to normalize relations with Israel: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (September 2020), Sudan (October 2020), and Morocco (December 2020). With Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994) having already made peace deals with Israel, the map had begun to shift away from the Palestinians and toward the Israelis. The new governments in Lebanon and Syria are not far from making their own separate agreements, and Saudi Arabia has already said that it would normalize with Tel Aviv. Trump is a 'bazaari' (marketplace) politician, one who tosses outlandish agreements in the air (for Morocco, the acceptance of its illegal occupation of Western Sahara) in utter disregard for international law. He is now doing the same with Gaza. 'I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people – the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza – to go back yet another time', he said on Air Force One. 'We don’t want Hamas going back', Trump said. 'The United States is going to own it'. It did not take long for all the UN Special Rapporteurs to sign a strong lettercondemning Trump’s comments. They made the correct argument that his idea, if implemented, is a war crime. Trump does not understand international law. He thinks like a gentrifier. This is what he has been doing across the United States: evicting ordinary people and building hideous buildings as a monument to the fabulous wealth of the few. Trump, like the illegal settlers, conducts Zionist gentrification. Silence Marwan Bardawil is an engineer with the Palestinian Water Authority.

Myanmar: Arakan Army Closing In On Capital Of Rakhine State	The rebel Arakan Army is closing in on Sittwe, the capital of Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, firing artillery on military junta outposts outside the city and preparing for an assault, residents told Radio Free Asia. Residents have been fleeing from Sittwe’s outskirts since January, but now aren’t able to escape because junta forces have blocked all exit routes, said Wai Hin Aung, an aid worker in the city. 'The blockade has led to this fighting, with the use of heavy weapons,' he said. The rebel ethnic Arakan Army, or AA, has made significant gains over the past year in its bid to root the military out of Rakhine state in its bid for self-determination. Of the 17 townships in Rakhine state, 14 are under the control of the AA, leaving only three still in the hands of the military junta – Kyaukphyu, Munaung and Sittwe, where the junta’s regional headquarters is based. Sittwe is crucial for the junta – which seized control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup d’état – not only as a source of much-needed revenue and foreign currency, but also for its role in Myanmar’s oil and gas trade via the Indian Ocean. If Sittwe falls, it would be the latest and one of the most significant defeats for the junta, which has been pushed back across the country by various ethnic armies and armed citizens who have formed militias called Peoples Defense Forces, or PDF. Junta forces have countered with artillery attacks and airstrikes on areas in Sittwe and two nearby towns where they believe that AA troops are stationed, a resident said, speaking anonymously for security reasons. Firing on naval vessels The Arakan Army also fired on junta vessels at a river naval base, a Sittwe resident told Radio Free Asia. The AA began firing at around 5 p.m., and junta fighter planes responded by dropping bombs on AA positions at about 9 p.m., he said. Several junta soldiers were wounded in the AA attack and were taken to a Sittwe hospital. 'The explosions were quite strong,' he said. 'The junta dropped about three big bombs. Then they started firing with a series of missiles.' The junta has recently reinforced its forces in and around Sittwe, and has also provided military training to thousands of Rohingya – a stateless ethnic group that predominantly follows Islam and resides in Rakhine. A Sittwe resident and military analyst from Rakhine state told RFA that neither the AA nor the military junta will easily abandon Sittwe. 'The AA is unlikely to halt its attacks on Sittwe, and the military will not abandon the city,' he said. 'That’s why intense fighting cannot be ruled out.' Rakhine State’s junta spokesperson, Hla Thein, didn’t answer his telephone when RFA tried to contact him for comment about the situation in Sittwe. AA spokesperson Khaing Thukha also didn’t immediately respond to a message left by RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwVku2CsMlKP_	2025-02-18T16:22:27-08:00	
Waste, Corruption And Foreign Meddling – And On Our ‘Nickel’ – Op...	President Donald Trump has frozen funding for the National Endowment for Democracy and proposes to shut down USAID funding. The US president’s spending cut reportedly leaves the organizations unable to pay staff and grantees. Well, it's a start anyway. In one of his first executive orders after taking office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid ($68 billion), pending a review of its alignment with US national interests. Pursuant to these orders, President Trump’s administration has frozen all funding to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The move is said to have caused what some have called a 'bloodbath' within the organization, leaving it unable to pay staff or fulfill financial commitments. The NED, established in 1983, is officially a nonprofit organization that, ostensibly, provides grants to support democratic initiatives worldwide. However, over the years, it has faced allegations of covertly influencing political outcomes overseas, with critics arguing that it has taken over covert functions previously handled by the CIA, particularly those aimed at undermining and in some instances overthrowing foreign governments. Earlier this month, Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given responsibility for finding ways to cut federal spending. Musk singled out NED immediately, calling it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization' that needs to be dissolved. Since then, this organization and others have reportedly felt 'under siege' from Musk’s DOGE. 'It’s been a bloodbath,' one NED worker told the Daily Mail, explaining that the organization has been unable to meet payroll and pay basic overhead expenses. It has an allocation budget of $142 million for the current fiscal year and has already allocated $70 million for distribution to various NGOs. The NED has faced longstanding criticism over its role in supporting political movements to undermine sovereign governments. The Center for Renewing America, a research organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a policy paper on February 7, accusing the NED of functioning as the 'tip of the proverbial spear for heightened CIA and State Department efforts to foster political revolution in Ukraine.' The report claimed that the NED had funneled tens of millions of dollars to a myriad of Ukrainian political entities and anti-Russian interests and 'advanced both the ‘Orange Revolution’ (2004) and ‘Maidan Revolution’ (2014) that paved the way for the current Ukraine-Russia war.' The NED has also faced accusations of sponsoring 'color revolutions' in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan and of funding opposition groups in Belarus, Serbia, and Egypt. The funding freeze on the organization comes as part of broader measures by the Trump administration to cut foreign spending. Trump’s 'executive pen' has also included a crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington’s primary vehicle for funding political projects abroad. Trump earlier called for the agency to be shut down, claiming it is run by 'radical lunatics.' Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has formally requested that Elon Musk disclose detailed information about American grants allocated to Slovak NGOs and media outlets through Washington’s primary agency for funding political projects abroad -- USAID. In a letter to DOGE chief Musk – who previously branded USAID a 'criminal organization' – Fico voiced concerns over what he described as 'gross interference' in Slovakia’s political landscape. 'It is undeniable that funds originating from USAID were also used for political purposes in Slovakia to distort the political system and favor specific political parties,' Fico wrote in a letter shared on X on Tuesday. He urged Musk to disclose which NGOs, media outlets, and individual journalists had received US funding. Last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban similarly announced that his government would seek full transparency regarding USAID grants to NGOs and media outlets critical of his administration, emphasizing the need to 'eliminate these foreign networks' that interfere in the country’s domestic affairs. In late 2023, his government created the Sovereignty Protection Office to monitor and address the risk of political interference in the country. Foreign financing for parties or groups running for office are banned in the country, with penalties of up to three years in prison. On Tuesday evening, USAID staff received an email saying that starting Friday, 'all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership, and specially designated programs.' The email added that essential staff would be notified on Thursday afternoon and that the agency would begin moving international staff back to the US within 30 days. Data for fiscal year 2024 shows that USAID distributed nearly $32.5 billion (its entire budget) in aid that year, much of it to Africa and the Middle East. The US spends more on humanitarian aid than other countries by wide margins, though foreign aid spending is under 1% of the federal budget. The US provides some amount of aid to most countries, including nearly every country in Africa and Asia. Many polls have found a majority of Americans believe the US is spending too much on foreign aid, including for Ukraine. But here’s the thing: How much of the spending cuts will Congress (regarding the NED and USAID) permit and which cuts will federal courts rule exceed President Trump’s authority? This is a drama that will surely play out in the midst of Trump 'taking Gaza,' the Ukraine proxy war with Russia and the global array of punitive tariffs orchestrated between the US, Canada, Mexico, China and the EU – so far.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PweoS0YcuoUPp	2025-02-18T16:15:16-08:00	
In Southern Thailand, Vintage US Items Drive Market Boom For Used...	By Asmadee Bueheng Piya Dueramae makes a living selling secondhand clothes, and spends much of his time hunting for rare finds in markets across Thailand’s Deep South. The 43-year-old’s connection to the business runs deep – his parents introduced secondhand markets to him when was a child. 'In Yala, we grew up going to the Maprao Market for clothes,' Piya told BenarNews, referring to a popular used-clothes market in Yala province. 'While city kids shopped in malls, our parents took us to secondhand markets. It became a way of life, a culture.' Used clothes shipped in from the United States – such as blue jeans and t-shirts featuring Marvel Comics’ action heroes – are among the 'treasures' that can be found among piles of old apparel at secondhand markets in the Deep South. The mainly Malay Muslim border region is more known for a long-running separatist insurgency than its booming secondhand clothing market. But used clothing is deeply ingrained in the local culture. By buying secondhand clothes, people with low incomes in this economically underdeveloped region could afford popular brand name apparel. The secondhand markets in southern Thailand grew bigger with the global trend of vintage clothing gaining popularity, as these markets became well-known for the rare items they sold. 'The beginning of second-hand clothing sales in the southern border areas started in 1973, when villagers from Yaring district, Pattani, who worked on fishing boats in Malaysia, brought second-hand clothes and goods from Malaysia back to sell at home,' Thitaree Srisurat, editor of the Rusamilae Journal at Prince of Songkla University in Pattani, another province in the Deep South, wrote in a 2021 article. 'It gained popularity, and many families took it up as a business, with about 20% of the community working in second-hand clothing sales. Some families still continue this to this day.' The main factor is affordability. 'People here cannot afford expensive goods, and since these are second-hand clothes, they don’t feel bad about wearing them to work in the fields,' Thitaree said. Soliha Ayohsae, a veteran secondhand clothing vendor, switched from running a regular clothing store in Bangkok to selling used clothes in southern Thailand because of the higher demand in the region. 'It’s easier and faster to sell here than in Bangkok because it’s cheaper. I used to sell in Bangkok, and although the profit per item was higher, the sales were fewer. Here, people buy a lot and often. Since it’s second-hand, they can easily replace it without feeling guilty,' Soliha told BenarNews. 'People here prefer secondhand because they are branded, high-quality, and affordable…. The demand has always been strong.' The secondhand fashion industry has witnessed explosive growth worldwide. According to ThredUp, a United States-based resale marketplace, secondhand clothes’ share of the total global apparel in 2025 is expected to be 10%, or U.S. $246 billion. This used clothes market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 12% between 2024 and 2027, reaching an estimated value of $350 billion by 2027, with Asia expected to account for 41%. Thailand’s secondhand market is expanding alongside. The Thai secondhand fashion market in 2023 was valued at 1.8 billion baht ($53.4 million), reflecting a 20% growth from the previous year, according to a report by SCB Economic Intelligence Center. It is expected to continue growing at a rate of 15% annually through 2027. However, no studies have specifically examined the market in Thailand’s Deep South, where buying used clothes has been the norm for decades. Data for 2024 was not available. Secondhand clothing in southern Thailand is mostly available in key markets like Yala’s Maprao Market, and Pattani’s Rusamilae and Yaring markets. A diverse clientele shops at these places including locals and collectors, seeking vintage American apparel, such as blue jeans. ‘Discarded in America but are treasures here’ Most of the secondhand clothing available in Thailand comes from the U.S. via Malaysia. The clothing is transported from America to Malaysia via cargo ships. Foreign vendors in Thailand then purchase some of these clothes to resell in their countries. Soliha, the veteran secondhand clothing seller from Maprao Market, said secondhand American apparel was in high demand. 'These were once discarded in America but are treasures here. People buy them for work, farming, the office, and even as fashion. The quality is good, the price is low, and vintage never goes out of style,' she said. 'Maprao Market is a shopping paradise. We get shoppers from Malaysia’s border areas, Pakistan,and Western tourists also shop here. I make over 100,000 baht [$2,966] a month.' A single bale of secondhand clothing imported from Malaysia, which could consist of 200-220 T-shirts or 150-180 jackets or trousers, costs around 1,000 baht ($29.6). At Maprao Market these clothes could then sell for anything from 5 baht (U.S. 14 cents) an item to tens of thousands of baht per item, depending on their rarity and brand. The popularity of secondhand clothing has led to eye-catching sale prices at auctions. For instance, a vintage (1997) T-shirt featuring Marvel Comics’ characters Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer from Maprao Market sold for 220,000 baht ($6,526) in an online auction. 'Collectors from Japan, in particular, love U.S. made T-shirts, especially ones made of thin cotton fabrics, and [music] band T-shirts,' he said. Piya, the Yala vendor, said he bought a vintage T-shirt from the 1970s from Maprao Market for 80 baht ($2.37) and sold it for 22,000 baht ($654) in the same market. Secondhand military apparel, workwear, denim, jerseys and Hawaiian shirts also fetch high prices. Military garments from World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam wars are considered especially valuable, particularly if they feature unit-specific prints. Lately, unofficial band merchandise, which is usually sold outside concert venues, is becoming trendy as well. 'Some of these items sell for over 100,000 baht ($2,800) each, more than what official band merchandise sells for,' Piya said. 'You have to know what’s valuable and what’s not.' Competition is rising, though, with a growth in demand. Some vendors buy high-value pieces from southern markers to resell them in Bangkok. More are being filtered before they reach Thailand, as the popularity of vintage clothing has risen. And more Japanese collectors too are traveling to Thailand to hand-pick rare finds. As demand grows, sellers must continuously expand their knowledge to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized market, vendors said. For vendors in southern Thailand secondhand clothing is about more than just fashion or a hobby – it’s a livelihood. 'This business is not just a passion anymore; it supports our families and our children’s education,' Piya said. 'We have to adapt. The secondhand market is changing fast, and only those who learn and evolve will survive.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwVEdSd4og-sX	2025-02-18T16:11:32-08:00	
Spyware As A Service: Challenges In Applying Export Controls To C...	By Kolja Brockmann and Lauriane Héau For all their legitimate law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering uses, cyber-surveillance tools are prone to abuse. Among other things, they can be used by states to target political opponents or to oppress certain ethnic or religious groups, or to steal an adversary’s data or attack critical infrastructure. States have increasingly sought to use export controls to help prevent transfers of cyber-surveillance tools, including software, that could enable human rights violations or pose a threat to national security. Controls covering transfers of cybersurveillance hardware, software and technology have been introduced through the Wassenaar Arrangement, the European Union and national control lists and by way of a catch-all control in the EU dual-use regulation. However, the growing use of the ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) model—in which a software application is hosted and used on a cloud server but not downloaded by the end-user—poses a particular set of challenges. States differ in how they apply export controls to cloud computing, including SaaS, and their interpretation of relevant legal provisions informs their application of licensing requirements and enforcement measures. This divergence opens potential loopholes and gaps that could be exploited for illicit procurement. It also creates a confusing landscape for companies that want to remain in compliance with the controls on cyber-surveillance tools and other software. This blog aims to highlight the export control compliance and enforcement challenges posed by SaaS and offers some thoughts on how states can close these gaps and achieve more effective oversight of the trade in cyber-surveillance tools. The software as a service model and cyber-surveillance products SaaS is a type of cloud computing in which the software is uploaded to a cloud server—which could be owned and operated by the software provider or by a separate cloud service provider—and made available for use without the end-user being able to download the software to a local device or storage medium. Familiar examples of SaaS include cloud-based collaborative work and e-mail solutions or design and engineering tools that are available directly via the internet without the need for download. One type of cyber-surveillance tool that may be offered via the SaaS model is intrusion software. Controls on intrusion software were added to the dual-use control list of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 and apply to software ‘specially designed or modified to avoid detection by 'monitoring tools', or to defeat 'protective countermeasures', of a computer or network-capable device’ in order to remotely extract or modify data and, in some cases, take control of the device. Some companies also offer facial recognition software via the SaaS model. This may, under certain conditions, be subject to control in EU member states by way of the EU dual-use regulation catch-all control for unlisted cyber-surveillance items or potentially via national control lists. In July 2024 the United States also proposed adding facial recognition software to its national dual-use control list. Challenges for export controls if cyber-surveillance tools are offered via the SaaS model When software is made available through the SaaS model, there are three main actors: the software provider, the cloud service provider (who may also be the software provider) and the recipient end-user of the software (see figure below). There are several actions in this model that may constitute an export. First, the software provider uploads the software to a cloud server, which may be owned by the software provider or by a separate cloud service provider. Second, once it is on the server, the party controlling access to the software (usually the software provider) grants access to the recipient, thus making the software available. Third, the cloud service provider may also (at least potentially) grant access to the software for maintenance purposes. And finally, the recipient end-user downloads the data gathered using the software. To determine whether any of these actions constitutes an export and who would be considered the exporter, an export licensing authority may need to establish a number of things, including the locations of the server and the three actors; who had effective control over granting access to the software during each of these steps; and whether the software was made available to the cloud service provider, the end-user or both. Screenshot Key differences in states’ interpretations of controls on SaaS States’ interpretations differ on some key points: whether making controlled software available through SaaS is considered an export; and if it is considered an export, who is the exporter and which parts of the transaction trigger licensing requirements. These differences are found even within the EU, where member states share a common regulation for dual-use export controls. Some states appear not to have settled on a consistent national interpretation thus far. As well as creating potential loopholes and gaps, this divergence makes compliance more difficult, particularly for companies that operate in several states with different interpretations. For example, according to guidance published by the German export licensing authority, BAFA, the cloud server being located in a state outside the EU is sufficient to trigger a licensing requirement for uploading controlled software. Granting access and thereby making the controlled software available to a user in a third country may also constitute an instance of export or brokering and therefore trigger a separate licensing requirement. Other states, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom focus instead on the location of the person or entity accessing the software—rather than the location of the server—when determining whether it is a controlled export. The United States has indicated that granting or gaining access to controlled software via SaaS does not constitute an export per se if the software provider uses a certain industry-standard level of end-to-end encryption that prevents the cloud service provider or any of its agents (for example those performing maintenance on the server infrastructure) from accessing the software. However, this only applies if the software is unclassified and neither destined for a recipient that is a party of concern on the entity list—a tool used by the USA to list foreign persons and companies to which specific restrictions or licensing requirements apply—nor stored on a server in a country under an arms embargo. What the different interpretations mean for oversight, controllability and enforcement Different interpretations of key concepts, including ‘export’ and ‘exporter’, determine the level of oversight and the ability to impose controls and—where necessary—prohibit transfers using export control legislation. States need to consider whether their current legal interpretations and provisions regarding making software available through SaaS satisfies their need for oversight, including for sensitive transactions involving cyber-surveillance software. Whether their desired level of oversight is reached also depends on whether they have complementary legal measures other than export controls at their disposal that enable oversight or provide means of intervention. However states frame their export controls, they need to think about how to enforce the controls, which requires having the appropriate capacities to respond when they suspect that unlicensed transfers have taken place or are imminent. There are also practical detection and enforcement challenges that make it difficult for states to claim jurisdiction and to collect the evidence required for establishing intent, who had effective control over granting access and whether controlled software was made available to a specific end-user. Some states, including the USA, require a certain level of encryption to be applied for transfers of controlled software instead of a licensing requirement—an approach that is favoured by industry actors. However, relying only on the use of encryption could mean less attention is paid to the end-users and end-uses. It could also risk creating additional hurdles for enforcement investigations, particularly if states do not have the required digital forensics capabilities available to retrieve required information and retrace transfers and access. Striking the right balance The use of cloud computing and the provision of software via SaaS are both set to increase. As with all dual-use export controls, states need to find the right balance between ensuring regulatory control over potentially risky cyber-surveillance exports and limiting the burden on legitimate trade. Industry representatives have called for harmonization across states in how export controls apply to software in order to facilitate compliance. This currently appears unlikely to happen, even in the EU, given states’ continued disagreement on key aspects of how controls apply. However, states should clarify their national interpretations concerning how export controls apply to cloud computing, including SaaS, and provide guidance and conduct outreach to companies to support their compliance efforts. At the EU level, the current process of drafting common guidelines on intangible transfers of technology provides a welcome opportunity to do this. It is not yet well known how and to what extent companies are offering different types of cyber-surveillance tools via SaaS. National authorities should thus engage regularly with both domestic and multinational companies to stay on top of this development and ensure that their legal interpretations and enforcement capabilities are appropriate for controlling the trade in cyber-surveillance software. More exchange between states’ licensing authorities and enforcement agencies on the detection, investigation and prosecution of cases involving SaaS could also be useful to this end. One way this could be achieved is through broader multilateral initiatives—such as the ‘Pall Mall Process’—that seek to regulate the trade in cyber-surveillance tools and could improve understanding of both the technical aspects of the trade in these tools and how export controls can complement other regulatory mechanisms. Considering the threat that cyber-surveillance tools may pose to civic freedoms, open societies should strive to ensure, despite the technical and legal difficulties, that cyber-surveillance tools do not fall into the hands of actors who seek to misuse them.

Purchasing Power And The International Demand For Dollars – Analy...	By Frank Shostak Often various factors are perceived to be important in determining a currency rate of exchange. For instance, for some commentators an increase in the government foreign debt is regarded as pointing to a likely deterioration in economic fundamentals ahead. This provides the rationale for the selling of the currency of concern. For many economists, the state of the balance of trade is a key factor in the currency exchange rate determination. On this way of thinking, all other things being equal, an increase in imports, which leads to a trade deficit, causes an increase in the demand for foreign currency. To obtain the foreign currency, importers sell the domestic currency for it. As a result, this causes a strengthening in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the domestic currency (i.e., more domestic money is sold per unit of a foreign currency). Conversely, all other things being equal, an increase in exports leads to a trade surplus. Once exporters exchange their foreign currency earnings for domestic money, this leads to a strengthening in the domestic money exchange rate against the foreign money (i.e., more foreign money is sold per unit of domestic money). Alternatively, consider the case when the central bank tightens its interest rate stance. The increase in the domestic interest rate, all other things being equal, attracts foreigners’ demand for domestic money. The holders of the foreign currency are now exchanging it for the domestic currency which is going to be placed in the domestic currency deposits in order to earn higher interest rates. Consequently, this lifts the price of the local currency in terms of foreign currency. It would appear that various factors such as the government debt, the interest rate differential, the state of the economy, and the balance of trade are important factors in the currency exchange rate determination. We can also add to these various psychological factors that would appear to be important in the currency exchange rate determination. Thus, a change in individuals’ perceptions regarding the state of the economy is likely to influence the currency rate of exchange. Rather than focusing on these many factors, it would make more sense to identify the key or the essential factor that determines the currency rate of exchange, that is, to identify the essence that dictates the currency rate of exchange determination. The Relative Purchasing Power of Money (PPM): The Essence of the Exchange Rate The essence of the currency exchange rate is the relative purchasing power of various monies. In a non-monetary barter economy, the 'price' of goods has to do with what trades individuals are willing to make in terms of units of goods or services (e.g., 100 apples might be exchanged for shoes). A price of a good, in monetary terms, is the amount of money exchanged for it. The 'price' of money is determined in what units of goods and services will be exchanged for it. We can also say that the amount of money exchanged for goods is the purchasing power of money (PPM) with respect to goods and services. If, in the US, the price of a good is one dollar and in the Eurozone an identical good is sold for two euros, then the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the euro is likely to be two euros per one dollar. An important factor in setting the purchasing power of money is the supply of money. Now, let us say that, over time, the growth rate in the US money supply exceeds the growth rate of European money supply, all other things being equal. Since a price of a good is the amount of money per good, this now means that the prices of goods in dollar terms will increase faster than prices in euro terms, all other things being equal. As a result, an identical good is priced now, for example, at two dollars against the one dollar previously, while in the Eurozone, 2.5 euros against 2 euros previously. This would imply that the exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro should be now 1.25 euros per one dollar and not 2 euros per one dollar. Another important factor in driving the purchasing power of various moneys and the exchange rate is a change in the demand for money. For instance, with an increase in the production of goods, the demand for money is likely to follow suit. The demand for the services of the medium of exchange is likely to increase since more goods are now going to be exchanged. As a result, for a given supply of money, the purchasing power of money will increase, all other things being equal. Less money will be chasing more goods now. Arbitrage Any deviation of the exchange rate from the rate implied by the relative purchasing power of money is likely to generate profit opportunities, which tends to undo the deviation. For instance, the deviation could emerge because of the market response to the trade account data or because of a change in the interest rate differential in the domestic economy versus other economies. Such deviations are likely to open profit opportunities for entrepreneurs. This rearranges the market toward the elimination of the underpricing. However, let us say that the Fed raises its policy interest rate while the European central bank (ECB) keeps its policy rate unchanged. If the price of a good in the US is one dollar and in the Eurozone the price of an identical good is two euros, then, according to the purchasing power framework, the currency rate of exchange should be one dollar for two euros. Because of a widening in the interest rate differential between the US and the Eurozone, an increase in the demand for dollars pushes the exchange rate in the market towards one dollar for three euros. (The holders of the euros are now exchanging more euros for dollars that are going to be placed in the dollar deposits in order to earn higher interest rates). The dollar is now overvalued versus the exchange rate as implied by the relative purchasing power of the dollar versus the euro. (It should be two euros to one dollar and not three euros to one dollar). In this situation, it will pay to sell goods for dollars, exchange dollars for euros, and then buy the goods with euros, thus making an arbitrage gain. For example, individuals could sell a good for one dollar, exchange the one dollar for three euros, and then exchange three euros for 1.5 units of the good, gaining an extra 0.5 of a good. The fact that the holders of dollars increased their demand for euros in order to profit from the arbitrage is going to make euros more expensive in terms of dollars (i.e., more dollars per euro, pushing the exchange rate in the direction of one dollar for two euros). Arbitrage is set in motion once the rate of exchange deviates—for whatever reasons—from the rate of exchange as dictated by the relative purchasing power of monies. Conclusion The key factor in the currency exchange rate determination is the relative purchasing power of various monies. If, for whatever reasons, the market currency exchange rate deviates from the exchange rate as implied by the relative purchasing power of various monies this activates an arbitrage, which works towards the convergence of the exchange rate towards the relative purchasing power of monies.

Can Australia Stay Resilient In An Unpredictable 2025? – Analysis	By Melissa Conley Tyler and Viet Dung Trinh After a positive 2024 in which Australia successfully encouraged China to reverse remaining trade restrictions, everyone expects 2025 to be a difficult year for Australia’s economy. Leading economists have predicted that the most likely impacts of US President Donald Trump’s second administration on Australia will be negative, including slower progress to net zero emissions, higher US inflation and weaker Chinese economic growth. How is Australia positioned to cope with what 2025 might throw at it? The current state of Australia’s economic statecraft is illustrated by two developments at the end of 2024. The Australian Parliament passed the ‘Future Made in Australia’ Act, setting out industry policy to build competitive new industries for the clean energy economy. At the same time, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also launched the ‘Trading Nation’ report on how open trade and investment contribute to Australians’ prosperity. These developments show a country trying to walk a fine line between intervention and openness. For Australia, more active government involvement in markets through the Future Made in Australia plan is a significant ideological departure from the recent past. With a global retreat from open economics and a reemergence of nationalist approaches to trade, countries like Australia have had to adapt. As Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers noted, ‘it would be preposterously self-defeating to leave our policies unchanged in the face of all this industry policy taking shape and taking hold around us’. Australia is responding to these geostrategic forces by competing with industry incentives offered by other countries, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Canada and the European Union to nurture the development of new industries. A Future Made in Australia is investing AU$22.7 billion (US$14.3 billion) into Australia’s workforce, renewable energy, supporting investment in Australia, technological and industrial renovation and utilisation of natural resources and critical minerals. It aims to produce more goods domestically, creating more job opportunities for Australians. In contrast, the Trading Nation report emphasises the role of free and open trade in Australia’s prosperity. Around 31 per cent of Australian economic output is supported by trade activity and one in every four jobs are linked to trade. Global trade regulation, such as through the World Trade Organization, is described as one of the pillars of Australians’ prosperity, supporting the stability of the trading environment and providing Australian exporters with access to markets. Australia’s 18 bilateral and regional free trade agreements on average boost trade by 13 per cent and covered around 78 per cent of Australia’s two-way goods and services trade as of 2022. New, creative accords like the Singapore–Australia Green Economy Agreement encourage trade, open business opportunities and facilitate investment in industries that promote the net zero transition. The report also makes the case for foreign investment to facilitate access to more capital and investment, with Australia’s openness to foreign investment contributing to the country’s development, job creation and improvement of living standards. Sectors like banking, energy, infrastructure, resources and agriculture — essential to achieving the goal of net zero — are largely dependent on foreign investment. Placed side-by-side, the two reports illustrate a country trying to find a balance between different imperatives. This is in line with a report by the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D), which argued that it is in Australia’s interests to promote a transparent, predictable and rules-based global trading system alongside industry measures. This is an important message to keep in focus in 2025 with the likelihood of another US–China trade war and tit-for-tat protectionism in response to US tariffs. It is worth remembering that an open global trading system is a vital counter to attempted economic coercion, allowing targeted industries to seek out alternative markets. Following China’s 2020 trade restrictions, Australia’s ability to withstand China’s economic coercion by redirecting targeted commodities was a factor in Beijing deciding to reverse remaining trade restrictions. During the period of attempted economic coercion, there were advocates focused on ‘friendshoring’ — selling more to countries perceived as allies and friends, particularly collaborating on supply chains and foreign investment. But this can be difficult and expensive, working against economic logic. Diversification is better achieved by agnostically increasing the number of markets, reducing the risk of disruption in any one market. It is also important for Australia to keep sight of the importance of the global economic system and its significant role within it. Australia has actively supported and played a leading role in the creation of global rules that underpin the rise of global trade, even being one of the founding members of the World Trade Organization. Particularly during the second Trump administration, Australia should focus on cooperating with like-minded states to ‘save the furniture’ of the global trading system. Despite the challenges that 2025 will bring, Australia’s economic statecraft cannot focus only on domestic industry policy — it must also promote open trade and investment. In an unpredictable global economic environment, Australia’s policy responses need to continue to strike the right balance. This means that in 2025, Australia needs to continue its approach of supporting the global trading system alongside industry measures.

China’s LAC Infrastructure In Xinjiang: A Colonial Perspective – ...	By Ayjaz Wani In a tactical move to reduce the travel time between northern and southern Xinjiang from seven hours to three hours while protecting goods from harsh winter conditions, China completed excavating the world’s longest roadway tunnel in the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang in December 2024. The 22.13 km tunnel, set to open in 2025, is crucial to China’s ambitious 319.72 km Urumqi-Yuli Expressway. Around the same time, China’s Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and State Council approved the creation of two new counties, He’an and Hekang, in the Aksai Chin region of India, which was unlawfully ceded to China by Pakistan through a border agreement in 1963. The illegal creation of new counties in the Aksai Chin region, close on the heels of the recent rapprochement with India, shows Beijing's colonial mentality, adding to the complexities of Sino-India bilateral relations. The new counties managed by Khotan prefecture and the establishment of counties in the uninhabited region close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) represent an effort aimed at building infrastructure and increasing the Han population along the border, reminiscent of actions taken during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. However, China has maintained that the tunnel will enhance connectivity and support the socio-economic development of southern regions predominantly inhabited by Uyghurs, thus strengthening unity among ethnicities. China’s Xinjiang border policy post-1949 Xinjiang’s history is marked by conflicts over its autonomy and independence. Chinese imperial rule lasted only 400 years, until 1949. In 1720, the Qing dynasty extended its control into the area for the first time since the Tang dynasty, but sustaining authority was challenging. This historical context is crucial to understanding China's current Xinjiang border policy. After 1760, Qing leaders began relocating Han criminals from the mainland to Xinjiang, providing them subsidies and loans to settle and farm. After 1950, Beijing initiated the mass migration of the Han people to the province to leverage its natural resources, establish political dominance, and integrate the local population into Chinese culture. Following 1949, this migration aimed to exploit resources and safeguard the frontier from external influences, particularly those of the erstwhile Soviet Union. Following 1958, 60,000 Kazaks moved to the former Soviet Central Asian Republics. Beijing responded by sealing the border and forcibly relocating thousands of non-Han families from the border area, replacing them with Han citizens. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), established in 1954, facilitated all these population transfers. Comprising primarily of demobilised troops, XPCC functions as an economic enterprise and military force, wielding considerable governmental authority that impacts the region’s socio-political and financial dynamics. The organisation aimed to relocate Han individuals outside existing cities by establishing colonies, promoting the slogan of ‘transforming nature and reforming man’ to reclaim land, build industries, explore natural resources, and construct strategic roads and railway lines. XPCC assisted Beijing in extracting oil and gas from Xinjiang. Estimates indicate the region has 23.4 billion tonnes of oil reserves and 13 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves. The XPCC constructed the Xinjiang-Xizang highway through Aksai Chin. By 1958, over 6,000 miles of roads had been built. The highway network expanded from 17,830 km in 2015 to 20,920 km in 2020. After 2021, Beijing commenced the construction of new roads towards the LAC from the G219 highway, which runs along the border. Beijing has prioritised building strategic roads and highways in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) to upgrade the LAC infrastructure in Tibet and Xinjiang. Similarly, China is also constructing the rail networks in Xinjiang, which have expanded from 5,900 km in 2015 to approximately 7,800 km in 2020. Colonial rationale behind the new counties and infrastructure Most Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang reside in the southern regions, particularly in Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, and Kurla, where they have managed to resist the Chinese Communist Party's enforced sinicisation, a process of assimilating non-Chinese communities into Chinese culture. Beijing’s growing security and economic interests in neighbouring Central and South Asia and concerns about potential unrest within southern Xinjiang have forced China to create new counties and increase its push for infrastructure. Despite its draconian policies in Xinjiang, Beijing is increasingly concerned about the rising security dilemmas along the Pakistan border, making enhancing security measures there and along Uyghur-dominated regions a priority. The new Han migrants are mostly retired army personnel and work as a security force wielding administrative powers. Additionally, due to the rising demand for lithium and the estimated presence of 2 million tons of lithium in the vicinity of these new counties, XPCC intends to promote mining in the area. The Tianshan Shengli Tunnel will enhance Xinjiang’s connectivity and boost Chinese trade and commerce with Central Asia, especially after the completion of the China- Kyrgyzstan- Uzbekistan railway line. Enhanced connectivity will attract more Chinese companies and further integrate the south of Xinjiang with Eurasian nations under the Belt and Road Initiative. Similarly, establishing two new counties in the parts of the Aksai Chin region of India will facilitate the transfer of Han migrants to the area through XPCC to develop new infrastructure and logistics to support the Chinese army in the region, which will have geostrategic implications along the LAC for India. India’s response After 1991, China capitalised on Central Asia's economic and political instability to extend its influence into the tumultuous Xinjiang region. Beijing exploited the economic and political upheaval in the Central Asian countries bordering Xinjiang, securing 22 per cent, 32 per cent, and 3.5 per cent of land claimed from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, respectively. Beijing tried the same towards India after 2020, which heightened tensions along the LAC and increased standoffs. Unlike other neighbouring countries in restive Xinjiang, New Delhi has intensified its infrastructure initiatives in Kashmir and Ladakh. It has built the impressive Chenab Bridge, recognised as the tallest cable-stayed bridge in the world, alongside the 12.77 km T49 rail tunnel. Additionally, the ongoing construction of the 13.5 km Zojila Tunnel showcases India’s exceptional engineering feats and strategic edge over its rivals. Since 2019, India’s Prime Minister has personally overseen many of these geoeconomic and geostrategic projects. On 13 January 2025, the Prime Minister formally opened the Z-Mohr tunnel on the critical Srinagar-Leh highway. The Zojila Tunnel is anticipated to be finished by 2026, further boosting New Delhi's strategic influence in Eastern Ladakh and along the LAC. India has also expanded its road and bridge infrastructure along the LAC in Ladakh. In 2021, 87 bridges were completed, while in 2022, the Defence Minister inaugurated projects costing INR 2,180 crores, including 18 solely dedicated to Ladakh. Following the successful rail connection with Kashmir, New Delhi should prioritise the 489 km Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway line to swiftly deploy forces and equipment along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh. To maintain its pace and strategic advantage over Beijing along the LAC, India requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes expedited infrastructure development, enhanced defence capabilities, and collaborative international efforts with allied nations to counter Chinese deceptive tactics.

Kadyrov’s Efforts To Create Chechen Muftiate In Ingushetia Threat...	Chechnya’s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has never made his hopes a secret to absorb Ingushetia (a neighboring republic within the Russian Federation) and perhaps portions of Dagestan into his republic, both of which were part of the Chechen-Ingush republic in the past (see EDM, September 27, 2018, February 28, 2023). In 2019, he compelled Magas to hand over 10 percent of Ingushetia to his control (see EDM, December 1, 2021). More recently, Kadyrov has supported the Batal-Haji Sufi order in Ingushetia, a group that is now in open conflict not only with Magas but Moscow as well (Fortanga.org, November 4, 2022; Window on Eurasia, December 8, 2022, January 28; see EDM, January 24, 2023). Now, Kadyrov has launched an indirect effort to subordinate Ingushetia to himself and his republic through the use of Islam (see EDM, March 24, 2022). According to the independent Fortanga news agency, he has organized meetings in Cairo with Ingush Muslims to create a new muftiate for Ingushetia that will supervise Muslim parishes there, giving him yet another basis for exercising leverage over the government in Magas as well (Fortanga, January 31). On January 31, Fortanga reported, based on conversations with two informed sources, that Chechnya’s mufti, Salakh Mehiyev, with Kadyrov’s backing, began talks in Cairo with a group of instructors of the Ingush Islamic University about the possibility of forming a new muftiate in Ingushetia (Ibid). Many federal subjects of the Russian Federation have more than one such organization, also known as Muslim spiritual directorates (MSDs). The Chechen-backed move, however, appears intended not to become yet another of these institutions there but rather to replace the existing MSD with a Chechen-controlled one, something Fortanga suggests has the support of some in the Magas government (Ibid). According to one of Fortanga’s sources, participants in the talks have the support of Salakh Mezhiev, the chairman of the coordination center of Muslims of the North Caucasus Federal District, and Adam Shakhidov, an advisor to Kadyrov. Moreover, this source claims, 'Mahmud-Ali Kalimatov [head of the Ingush Republic] is also aware of the plans. Representatives of the local clergy carry out consultations on further actions between the heads of the two regions. [But] participants in the process are afraid of leaks and public discontent and act as quietly as possible' (Fortanga, January 31). This is an indication of just how explosive such a development could be. Another sign of the sensitivity of these talks is how the most recent round occurred not in Magas or Grozny but in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. According to Fortanga’s second source, Grozny officials decided on this radical step after failing in their earlier efforts to win over Isa Khamkhoyev, the former mufti of Ingushetia (Ibid). Earlier, Chechen officials tried to win over the head of Ingushetia MSD. That failure highlights what is likely to be widespread opposition among Muslims in Ingushetia to what the Chechens are trying to do, however much money Grozny may be willing to spend and however much support those who go along with the Chechens may receive from Kalimatov. In Fortanga’s words, all this clearly indicates that 'the goals being pursued by Ingushetia’s neighbor are power and the creation of their own team, which will give them influence over the republic and its internal processes' (Fortanga, January 31). Three aspects of this development make it far more significant than it might appear at first glance. First, the Chechen effort to create a new MSD in Ingushetia may very well succeed, at least initially, because the Ingush governor has long had a troubled relationship with the republic muftiate and now appears ready to work with the Chechens (APN.ru, November 26, 2021). Thiswill reduce the authority of the current governor and may even lead to a new round of protests against him if a new muftiate is created or even if Ingush residents become aware that Kalimatov is working with the Chechens. Many Ingush residents will likely view this as an act of betrayal, just as they viewed signing of an accord in 2019 by Kalimatov’s predecessor Yunus-Bek Yevkurov which transferred 10 percent of the smallest non-Russian republic to Chechen control when he (see EDM, September 27, 2018, April 9, 2019). The accord sparked the largest protests in Ingush history, with tens of thousands taking to the streets and numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments that have lasted in some cases until now (Window on Eurasia, October 11, 2021, December 7, 2024). Second, the border issue in Ingushetia is heating up again. On the one hand, members of the Ingush Seven, as the leaders of the protest became known, are now being released from prison. The Ingush are welcoming them as heroes, but some Russian officials want them to be drafted and sent to fight and possibly die in Ukraine, suggestions that have outraged many in Ingushetia (Fortanga.org, February 5). On the other hand, Moscow officials have expressed support for further changing the border between Ingushetia and Chechnya in Grozny’s favor (Fortanga.org, December 11, 12, 2024). Many Ingush will view talk of a Chechnya-controlled muftiate in their republic through these optics, and some may decide that they need to take to the streets again lest their republic be further reduced to a shadow of its former self, something that is more likely if news of Chechnya’s role in creating a new muftiate spreads. One activist responded that Grozny will not stop until it controls all of the Ingush Republic (Fortanga.org, December 18, 2024). Third, Grozny’s move to create a muftiate in Ingushetia that Chechnya controls is going to echo across the North Caucasus, especially in Dagestan, where Kadyrov has also made territorial claims. The meeting of any of them in Dagestan would likely trigger more violence in what is rapidly becoming the most unstable republic in the Russian Federation (Window on Eurasia, March 13, October 12, 20, 2024; Kavkaz Uzel, August 12, 2024). The danger that what Kadyrov is doing will destabilize the North Caucasus more generally may cause Moscow to try to prevent Kadyrov from taking action on a new Ingush muftiate. In the past, however, the Kremlin has often found it hard to rein in the Chechen leader given his ability so far to keep Chechnya quiet and provide support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda. Both the dangers of more destabilization in the North Caucasus more generally, as well as the radicalization of Islam among Chechens in the Republic of Georgia and the revival of secular Chechen nationalism in the emigration and among Chechens fighting against Moscow in Ukraine, may lead some in Moscow to conclude that they need to rein in Kadyrov, despite the risks that any such moves would have (Window on Eurasia, January 24, February 12). Consequently, what might appear to some as a minor administrative shift in the governance of the Muslims of Ingushetia could have enormous consequences not only in the North Caucasus but in Moscow as well.

From Tariffs To Turmoil: Trump’s Protectionist Playbook – Analysi...	US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports on February 10, doubling down on his protectionist agenda to 'boost' the U.S. economy through import taxes, a move that could disrupt trade with key partners. Set to take effect on March 4, the tariffs will impact the 25 million tons of steel the U.S. imports annually. This follows a White House decision to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest steel exporters alongside Brazil and South Korea. The move marks another step in Trump’s aggressive trade policy, coming just days after the administration imposed a sweeping 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, escalating tensions with global trade partners. The policy enforces tariffs 'without exceptions or exemptions,' ending carve-outs previously granted to certain nations and raising aluminum duty rates. This mirrors Trump’s 2018 tariffs during his first term, which triggered global retaliation. By rejecting multilateral trade norms, the move risks escalating trade disputes while prioritizing economic nationalism over diplomatic engagement, despite warnings of market disruptions and strained international relations. Trump has also hinted at reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing duties on U.S. imports, though specifics on exemptions or targeted nations remain unclear: 'If they charge us, we charge them.' Given that Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea are major steel and aluminum sources, the policy may worsen critical trade ties and increase international trade tensions. Fears of a perfect storm in world trade have already been triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of wide-ranging tariffs on products from Mexico, Canada, and China. Enacting executive authority to tackle the 'major threat' of illegal immigration and drug trafficking—including fentanyl—Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico as well as 10 percent on Chinese imports. Additionally, he promised trade restrictions on European goods and intends to introduce 'reciprocal tariffs' on other nations very soon. Historically, Trump has always argued that focusing on countries having trade surpluses against the United States would boost the American economy and has even mentioned tariffs as a possible substitute for an income tax. Once again Trump has supported a protectionist economic plan despite acknowledging their potential economic damage on the United States and calling it a required price. America’s three biggest trading partners—China, Mexico and Canada—reacted immediately. While China imposed countermeasures aimed at U.S. exports including crude oil, LPG, and farm machinery, Canada and Mexico reacted with punitive tariffs. Beijing has also started a Google antitrust investigation and threatened to bring suit against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Investors in Asia and Europe are preparing themselves for the consequences of an escalating trade conflict. The interruption of global supply networks, increased stock market volatility, and worries of lasting financial instability highlight the wide-ranging effects of Trump’s tariff-based approach on the international economic system. Far from providing the unilateral advantages he contends, Trump’s tariff war will exact a great cost on the American economy. Given that rising business expenses are passed on to consumers, the most immediate outcome would be accelerated inflation, which provides a sharp contrast to Trump’s pledge to control rising costs. Greater tariffs will interrupt global supply chains, stifling growth and investment, lowering borrowing costs, and even hurting U.S. exports. The measures are predicted to hit particularly hard leading industries such as agriculture and the car sector. Should Trump expand this tariff conflict to Europe, the financial consequences for the United States would amplify, lowering growth and aggravating internal issues. Far from what Trump claims, the expenses of this protectionist approach more than exceed any potential advantages. History shows clearly how Trump’s trade initiatives have faltered. Under the pretense of lowering the U.S. trade deficit, he started a trade war with China during his first term by means of $400 billion in tariffs. Six years later—even as President Biden continued with this protectionism—the deficit has hardly shifted. Indeed, this trade war has never really been about the deficit. Rather, it is part of a general U.S. policy to restrain the ascent of China. Trade restrictions and attempts to limit China’s access to sophisticated technologies, notably semiconductors and AI development, have been part of this plan. The United States has been trying everything to slow down China’s economic rise. The attempt to contain the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek for it not only showcases China’s resilience but also reveals the weaknesses of American attempts to block its technological and economic advancement. The ultimate outcomes of Trump’s tariff policies remain uncertain, but one consequence is undeniable: the United States is steadily dismantling the rule-based international order established after World War II, a system anchored in free trade and globalization. By withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and doubling down on protectionism, the United States is undermining the very framework that has sustained global stability. This shift risks creating greater chaos and instability at both global and regional levels. Moreover, a transactional approach to trade wars alienates allies and fails to significantly curb China’s rise, while simultaneously destabilizing the global economic order. In pursuing short-term gains, the United States risks long-term damage to its interests and the foundations of the international system it once championed.

Donald Trump’s Tariffs: Bad Economics And Maybe Illegal, Too – Op...	Amid the flurry of unconstitutional or illegal executive orders from President Donald Trump—for example, the freezing of congressionally approved spending, the end of constitutionally stipulated birthright citizenship, and the mass firing of prosecutors—lies another one that, unfortunately, he is more likely to get away with. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, Trump, who earlier had questionably declared a 'national emergency' at the U.S. border, is using this law to threaten to impose 25 percent tariffs (import taxes) on Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on China 'because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.' Drug flows and illegal immigration are certainly problems, though the extent to which they rise to the legal definition of a 'national emergency' is debatable. Other means of solving them exist short of threatening to start a wider trade war with the largest U.S. trading partners and possibly threatening the post-war open-world trading system. Trump’s threatened use of tariffs seems especially punitive given the minimal level of illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing over the border from Canada—in fact, the net flow of drugs seems to be in the reverse direction. Yet, Trump believes that because the United States has the largest market in the world, such import taxes will hurt other countries more than the United States, thus making available a valuable instrument of threatened coercion. However, countries and companies trade because it is mutually beneficial for them to do so. Therefore, threatening or imposing import taxes—paid by the American consumer—is an economic murder-suicide. Other countries may be hurt more than the United States, but the people of all countries are hurt by bilateral or multilateral trade wars. Slower economic growth and higher prices result when the flow of trade and market conditions are uncertain or impaired. Sometimes, this effect can be catastrophic. Many economists believe that the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 and foreign retaliation deepened the economic downturn into the Great Depression. As a result of economic disruptions caused by the Great Depression and World War II, the United States was instrumental in creating (and greatly benefited from) the post-war system of free trade and free markets. Ironically, Trump’s threatened import taxes and possible trade war likely will benefit China by positioning that communist country as the new guardian of free trade worldwide. The bad economics of import taxes was succinctly summed up by Senator Rand Paul(R-KY), one of the few Republicans to criticize Trump’s tariffs: 'Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.' Another question that has gotten far less attention is whether imposing import taxes under the IEEPA law is constitutional. Make no mistake, other presidents have used IEEPA many times since 1977 to retaliate for other countries’ behavior—in sixty-nine 'national emergencies,' to be exact—but these all placed U.S. restrictions on financial transactions in target countries rather than imposing taxes on Americans for their imports. This misuse of IEEPA will probably result in legal challenges. Furthermore, most of the sixty-nine declared 'national emergencies' in which IEEPA was invoked were hardly that. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was designed to reduce presidential misuse of this overwrought designation for everyday non-catastrophic problems. Yet that act failed—probably on purpose—to constrain presidential use of such emergencies since it didn’t define them. Instead, it allowed the president to declare one as long as a specific reason was given. One recent example of the abuse of the designation of national emergencies was Barack Obama’s economic sanctions against foreign computer hackers. An even more important problem is the past delegation of Congress’s constitutional responsibility 'to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' and 'to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises' via laws allowing broad discretion by the president. In addition to initiating war, treaties, and budgeting, Congress has also forfeited its power in international trade and taxation to an imperial presidency. In the almost inevitable legal challenges to Trump’s tariff policy, a primary one should be via the non-delegation doctrine, which maintains that Congress cannot cede legislative powers to the executive. This occurs often enough in order to blame the president for bad policies. However, the Supreme Court should view presidential abuse of trade policy with a jaundiced eye and force Congress to exercise its rightful powers.

Canada’s Ailing National Healthcare Is Not A Model For America – ...	By Nikolai G. Wenzel Earlier this month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began a US-Canada economic summit designed to improve his country’s economic climate. Canada’s political landscape is shifting. After nearly a decade in office, Trudeau has announced his resignation, with the Party leadership election scheduled for March 9. He will leave behind a country that has been grappling with a decade of disillusionment. Trudeau’s legacy will be marred by soaring taxes and a Canadian economy that many now describe as being on 'life support.' The country’s healthcare provision is the weakest part of its economy. For years, American reformers have idolized Canadian healthcare, touting it as the gold standard for universal care, and a model to replace an American system that is also broken. But the reality tells a starkly different story. In Canada, wait times are unmanageable, access to services is dwindling, and public trust is eroding. Recent data indicate that one in six Canadians lacks a regular family physician, and fewer than half can secure an appointment with a primary care provider within a day or two. This shortage has led to overwhelmed emergency rooms and significant delays in care. In 2023, more than 1.3 million Canadians abandoned emergency room visits due to excessive wait times. Some hospitals have even exceeded 200% capacity, forcing patients into hallways and onto floors. As Americans reckon with record deficits and runaway government spending, some voices are once again touting the Canadian example as cheaper and more effective than the US system. One of the loudest cheerleaders for Canada’s model is Wendell Potter, a former healthcare executive turned activist, who has lately been painting a utopian vision of Canada’s government-run healthcare in op-eds and interviews. But like all advocates of socialized medicine, Potter is peddling an illusion rather than reckoning with the harsh realities Canadians face daily. Consider the data. Patients in Canada often wait months for critical procedures. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time for medically necessary treatments in 2022 was over 27 weeks—nearly double what it was in 1993. For many Canadians, timely access to care is not a guarantee but a gamble. For patients with life-threatening conditions, these delays can mean the difference between recovery and irreversible harm. The deterioration of Canada’s healthcare has not gone unnoticed by its citizens. Recent polls show that dissatisfaction with healthcare is at an all-time high, with many Canadians now exploring private care options to bypass the public system’s inefficiencies. Some 75% of Canadians now believe their nation’s healthcare is in crisis. 'Free' healthcare costs the average citizen nearly $9,000 a year in taxes, and people who once championed Medicare are acknowledging its shortcomings. The problems plaguing Canadian healthcare are deeply rooted in its design. A single-payer arrangement relies on the government (i.e., the taxpayer) as the sole payer for healthcare services, ostensibly ensuring universal access. But basic economics predicts two problems. First, as sticker prices fall (because a portion of the cost is subsidized by taxpayers), demand will increase. Second, as the government does not respond to market forces, there is no incentive for supply to grow. When demand outpaces supply, as it has in Canada, the limitations become glaringly obvious. Hospitals face chronic underfunding, staffing shortages are widespread, and technological investments lag behind those of other developed nations. Despite a population of 40 million, there are only 432 MRI machines in the country. The US has more than 13,000. These structural issues lead to the long wait times and reduced access that have become hallmarks of Canadian healthcare. Another alarming consequence of these failures is the rising use of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID). Reports have emerged of patients feeling pressured into considering euthanasia due to inadequate access to care. Since its legalization in 2016, MAID has accounted for 4% of deaths in Canada, and some fear that systemic healthcare failures are influencing these decisions. Scarce resources must be allocated somehow; if markets can’t encourage increased supply, rationing will take place through waiting. Or worse. Meanwhile, advocates of Canada’s model argue that the American system is broken because it prioritizes profit over care. There is certainly room for reform in the US. But US healthcare is anything but a free-market wonder (or the market dystopia condemned by its detractors). Before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ('Obamacare'), more than half of US healthcare expenditures were already funded by various government sources. If we add a tangled web of regulations and distortions, it’s no wonder that prices are so high. No country’s healthcare is without flaws, but Canada’s current crisis should serve as a cautionary tale rather than an aspiration. By romanticizing Canada’s healthcare system, advocates of fully nationalized healthcare gloss over the lived experiences of countless Canadians struggling to access essential care. Their narrative does little to address the failures that have led to this crisis, offering a one-sided view of American healthcare that conveniently ignores the shortcomings of the alternative. Whether the US-Canada summit delivers meaningful solutions or simply serves as a political farewell tour remains to be seen. In any event, Trudeau’s resignation signals a new chapter for Canada, and it is an opportune moment to confront the mythologies surrounding its policies—particularly its healthcare system. Canada offers a cautionary tale of what happens when lofty ideals collide with practical realities. The cracks in Canada’s healthcare model are too large to ignore. The lesson is clear for Americans still enamored with replicating Canada’s single-payer arrangement—be careful what you wish for. Promising universal access but failing to deliver timely care is not a model worth emulating. Canada’s healthcare crisis is a wake-up call for its citizens and anyone who believes in the promise of universal care. As Trud­eau’s political legacy fades, the urgent task of addressing Canada’s failures remains. Advocates of full nationalization of healthcare would do well to shift their focus from selling dreams to confronting realities. Only then can the conversation about healthcare reform—on both sides of the border—begin to move in a meaningful direction. Healthcare in Canada, the US, and beyond needs more consumer choice, less regulation, and better-aligned incentives—not more socialism. About the author: Nikolai G.

Anthony Fauci Museum Exhibit Cancelled – OpEd	The federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has canceled a $168,000 grant for an exhibit on Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in suburban Silver Spring, Md. The cancellation might prompt people to 'muse' on the career of Dr. Fauci, who in 2021 claimed that 'attacks on me, quite frankly, are attacks on science.' That’s a rather bold claim for a non-practicing physician whose bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, vital disciplines in the field of virology. So it was doubtless a purely bureaucratic move when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made Dr. Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 1984. Kary Mullis, who earned a PhD from UC Berkeley, and won a Nobel Prize for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was on record that Dr. Fauci didn’t understand medicine and 'should not be in a position like he’s in.' Fauci went on to prove Mullis right. Dr. Fauci’s drug of choice to treat AIDS was AZT (azidothymidine, zidovudine), rejected for cancer treatment because of high toxicity. In the early 1990s, Fauci’s NIAID forced AZT and other toxic drugs on foster children in New York City, with deadly results. For further information see the BBC’s Guinea Pig Kids and The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Dr. Fauci’s prediction that AIDS would ravage the general population never came to pass, and it wasn’t even close. As Michael Fumento showed in The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS, the syndrome remained most prominent among male homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and intravenous drug users. Despite the error, Dr. Fauci remained at the helm of NIAID. In 2019, Dr. Fauci funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to perform gain-of-function research, once banned in the United States, that makes viruses more lethal and transmissible. The NIAID boss maintained that the COVID virus was 'zoonotic,' arising naturally in the wild. Scientists more qualified than Fauci, including CDC Director Robert Redfield, found evidence of a laboratory origin. Dr. Fauci branded them 'conspiracy theorists' and Dr. Redfield even got death threats. The NIAID boss imposed a lockdown regime that was particularly hard on families with children in school. That prompted the scientists of the Great Barrington Declaration to push for a more humane approach. NIH Director Francis Collins tasked Fauci with a 'devastating takedown' of those 'fringe epidemiologists,' most if not all more qualified than Fauci and Collins. Dr. Fauci proclaimed there was no need to wear a mask, then said to wear one maskbefore advocating two masks. The NIAID boss imposed distancing rules and urged vaccines even for children, the least vulnerable group. It later emerged that the masks were useless, and the distancing rules were simply made up and not based on any science. Fauci’s vaunted vaccines failed to prevent infection and transmission, which the fully boosted NIAID boss confirmed by coming down with COVID. After more than 50 years as a government bureaucrat and nearly 40 years as head of NIAID, Dr. Fauci retired in 2023 but continued to receive taxpayer-funded transportation and security services. In November 2024, Fauci authored a paper claiming that HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, was 'zoonotic,' just like the COVID virus. That reversed his position from the 1980s when he smeared the scientists who challenged him, all more qualified than himself, as 'AIDS denialists.' On Jan. 20, on his way out of the White House, Joe Biden issued a pardon for Dr. Anthony Fauci. Whatever the pardon was for—Sen. Rand Paul, author of Deception: The Great Covid Coverup, made a criminal referral to the Biden Department of Justice—wasn’t likely to turn up in Fauci’s museum exhibit. His network remains in place and that calls for deep reform. At the very least, the NIAID director should be limited to a single four-year term, with all grants posted online in real-time. Never again must a single person control public health policy and spending on medical research. Absent these and other reforms, white coat supremacy could well mount a comeback. In 2021, Dr. Fauci explained the WCS concept: I think what people have to appreciate is that indeed, you do have personal liberties for yourself and you should be in control of that. But you are a member of society, and as a member of society—reaping all the benefits of being a member of society—you have a responsibility to society. And I think each of us, particularly in the context of a pandemic that’s killing millions of people, you have got to look at it and say there comes a time when you do have to give up what you consider your individual right of making your own decision, for the greater good of society.

Ralph Nader: Trump/Musk Dictatorship Is Galvanizing The American ...	Madmen Trump and Musk are moving with warp speed to illegally and dictatorially wreck America and enrich themselves in the process. Forget the use of the terms 'autocracy' and 'constitutional crisis.' This is a savage dictatorship, getting worse by the day. Trump is attacking the courts, ignoring Congress run by a cowardly GOP, pushing to cut off critical assistance for tens of millions of Americans, devastating health, safety, food (Meals on Wheels), education (Head Start), and Medicaid insurance protections. The rabid, ravaging, unstable Musk and his Chief Musketeer Trump are shutting down whole agencies, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Agency for International Development (only Congress can do this). The CFPB is the federal cop enforcing laws against corporate crooks stealing your money in myriad ways, and returning many billions of dollars back to you. As for shuttering illegally the U.S. Agency for International Development, consider what is happening in these direly poor countries, as reported in the New York Times: 'Funds from the world’s richest nation once flowed from the largest global aid agency to an intricate network of small, medium and large organizations that delivered aid: H.I.V. medication for more than 20 million people; nutrition supplements for starving children; support for refugees, orphaned children and women battered by violence.' ('Chaos and Confusion Reign as U.S. Cuts Off Aid to Millions Globally' by Apoorva Mandavilli, February 12, 2025). Trump is also cutting monitoring for the emergence of deadly epidemics such as Ebola, drug-resistant Tuberculosis, Malaria and other lethal viruses and bacteria, which could come to the U.S. like COVID-19 did. The cost of all these vital protections is less than one percent of the federal budget. These safeguards have been supported by both Republican and Democratic Presidents – until Trump’s brutal reign of terror. Children, women (maternal health assistance) and men are dying now in places like Africa. Americans are just starting to suffer with the unlawful cutoff of funds (only Congress can do this) and the firing of thousands of dedicated civil servants ministering to their fellow Americans in need. U.S.A.I.D. is the humanitarian face of America, and Republicans like Marco Rubio once called it necessary for our country’s national security. American businesses are starting to feel Musk’s poisonous tusks. Just with closing A.I.D., this South African racist ordered the sign on its headquarters taken down. 100,000 positions have been cut overseas, an estimated 52,000 Americans in 42 states have lost their jobs. Agricultural food supplies ready for export are starting to rot in warehouses and ports, according to the Times. The Trump/Musk machetes are swinging wildly striking beyond bullying the poor, defenseless, and powerless, and also upending the business community. Much of our government is contracted out to millions of businesses – small and large. Their contracts are being ripped up by this lying, corrupt President who many business leaders helped elect last November. However, voters electing Trump didn’t mean that they elected a fascist dictator betraying his campaign boasts and 'Day One'promises with the first flurry of executive orders or dictates violating our Constitution, statutes, and international laws. There is a systemic cunning behind the wild rioting that Trump and Musk are causing. First, their actions are not about efficiency. Here is their broad scheme. First fire the cops, the law enforcers against corporate violators of worker, consumer, environmental, and small investor protections. Many federal agencies have current investigations into Musk’s companies (SEC, NHTSA, EPA, FAA, etc.). Second, establish a kleptocracy to enrich both Musk and Trump personally. (See the February 13, 2025, New York Times article by Eric Lipton titled 'Under Trump Shake-Up, Benefits for Musk Empire'). Third, smash programs assisting people, while protecting huge waste, fraud, and abuse from corporate crime harming taxpayers (e.g., fraud on Medicare/Medicaid) and vast outlays of corporate welfare – giveaways, subsidies, bailouts, and endless tax escapes by big business. After all, Trump and Musk are both corporatists. The military/industrial complex’s unauditable Pentagon budget is untouchable. Far from squeezing the enormous waste, redundancy, and corporate fraud, Trump gives every sign of supporting an additional $150 billion, which should go for domestic necessities, to this years’ Defense Department’s swollen taxpayer appropriations. After all, Trump and Musk are militarists. What of the resistance, presently mounting, but still outrun and over-run by the Trumpster gangsters? Americans don’t like to be told to shut up; they don’t like to have things rightfully theirs taken from their families; they don’t like to be fired en masse without cause; they don’t like government contracts for vital services being arbitrarily broken. They also don’t like their government being overthrown by fascistic gangsters. Street demonstrations are spreading from Washington to California, from Oregon to Florida. Government employees and their unions are filing lawsuits in federal courts. Half of the country’s state Attorneys General are filing numerous court challenges. The mainstream media, under direct attack by Trump, and being frivolously sued by Trump, is still reporting and investigating. The campuses will start rumbling as Trump/Musk cuts to medical research and other aids to education corrode these institutions. Retired military personnel are voicing their objections to the devastation of the kind of America and the freedom they fought to defend. (See veteransforpeace.org.) Veteran benefits are on draft-dodger Trump’s cutting table. The American Bar Association (ABA) has finally spoken out. On February 11, 2025, the ABA assailed the disregard of the judiciary and threats to judges by Trump/Musk/Vance, which 'threaten the very foundation of our constitutional system.' The ABA calls for every lawyer and legal organization to speak with one voice and to condemn the efforts of any administration that suggests its actions are beyond the reach of judicial review.' Soon the business community, unable to tolerate the chaos, inflation, instability, and recklessness of Trump’s regime’s contracting violations, will speak out as economic indices fall, including stock markets. It will take a few weeks or months, with heightened inflation, for this disruptive pipeline to reach critical mass as it will everywhere including the Red States where Trump supporters are concentrated. As one example, one of Biden’s enacted laws 'is projected to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into low-carbon energy technologies.' Most of these benefits are in Republican-voting communities in Red States 'where they are creating a once-in-a-generation manufacturing boom.' (The New York Times). Recall, Trump’s 'drill, baby, drill' mantra of climate violence was linked with downgrading efficient solar energy and shutting down wind power projects under construction, along with the EPA’s work. Once Trump’s voters and his business base start turning against him, with wide media coverage and dropping polls, the stage will be set for surging demands for his resignation and impeachment that starts with 'impossible,' then 'possible,' then 'probable,' then conviction. If the GOP sees either its political skin at risk in 2026 versus Trump’s destructive, daily delusions and dangerous daily damage, politicians will put their political fortunes first. That is what Congressional Republicans did when they told Nixon to resign in 1974 over the Watergate scandal – a peapod by comparison with Trump’s wholesale subversions of our government to one man rule who has said 'With Article II, I can do whatever I want as President.' Call the White House switchboard 202-456-1414 and tell Trump to stop the destruction of America and go back to Mar-a-Lago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adESSDNs-XzyJ	2025-02-17T15:44:40-08:00	
Maldives: Treading Cautiously – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya Maldives recorded no terrorism-linked fatality in 2024. The abduction and killing of blogger Yameen Rasheed by a local affiliate of Al-Qaeda on April 23, 2017, was the last terrorism related incident of the country. There have, nevertheless, been at least nine terrorist attacks in the country since the Rasheed killing, including three in 2019, four in 2020 and one each in 2021 and 2022. Further, there have been no incidents of terrorism-linked arrests in Maldives in 2024, continuing with the trend of 2023, as against 26 such arrests in 2022. Nevertheless, as reported in January 2024, according to the country's intelligence sources, Maldives not only remains a hub of Islamic State (IS) operatives but also of Pakistan-based terrorist groups, as well as of narcotics smugglers with international linkages. Sources indicate that a Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) base has also been identified in Maldives in the past. Maldives faces a major problem from radical Islamist fundamentalists who fund local governments, with the involvement of some big business houses. These business houses have also been drawn towards China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Moreover, key Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) operative Umar Nisar Bhat alias Qasim Khorasani, who was arrested in 2021, stated in his confession that he was in regular touch with the Bangladesh and Maldives-based Islamic Ameer (chief), who could have used this link to expand terrorist propaganda networks. However, at the official level, on October 1, 2024, Maldives participated in the 10th Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS (D-ISIS) hosted by then U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, D.C. and reiterated Maldives' unwavering belief that terrorism must never be associated with any religion, nationality, or ethnicity. With the Maldives engagement at the Ministerial Meeting, Malé also reaffirmed its commitment to fostering global security, promoting dialogue, and advancing the shared aspiration for a peaceful and prosperous world. This marks Maldives' inaugural participation in the D-ISIS Ministerial, following its formal membership of the Coalition in August 2023. In 2024, the Ministry of Homeland Security and Technology undertook strategic initiatives targeting four challenging areas that needed to be addressed to ensure the country's internal security and safety, including persisting drug issues. On November 24, the President of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, stated that it is one of the highest priorities of the government to transform Maldives into a drug-free environment. Muizzu's statement came in a post on 'X', after the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) seized 468.6 kg of illicit drugs from a Sri Lankan vessel that illegally entered into Maldivian waters. Maldives have been dealing with various narcotics-related issues that have plagued the archipelago for many decades, and adequate reform has not been brought about to date. Nevertheless, as reported on December 9, President Muizzu disclosed that his government has stepped up efforts to combat drug trafficking, and six times more drugs were seized in 2024, as compared to 2023. President said the drugs seized so far this year are estimated to have a street value of around USD 84 million. He added that over 150 expatriates linked to drug trafficking have been deported so far this year (2024), which is twice that of 2023, and that the Police had raided over 13,435 establishments in 2024, amid a nationwide crackdown on trafficking, as compared to around 8,500 raids conducted in 2023. Further, as reported on January 9, efforts have been commenced to detect the Maldives' main gateway, Velana International Airport's (VIA's) camera blind spots and increase security to address the smuggling of drugs via air. Efforts are also ongoing to install vessel tracking devices to tackle drug trafficking via sea. The archipelago is also grappling with an increased rate of cybercrime. The number of reported cybercrimes in Maldives nearly doubled in 2024, as compared to 2023, as revealed by Police Commissioner Ali Shujau on December 11, 2024. Shujau emphasised the urgent need to curb the spread of cybercrime and expand cyber security measures across the nation. 'In 2023, the Maldives Police Service recorded 99 cybercrime cases. This year, the figure has risen sharply to 173,' Commissioner Shujau disclosed. In a positive direction, Maldives has enacted legislative amendments to criminalise cybercrime. On December 17, the amendments to the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Act on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, were ratified by President Muizzu. The amendments to the Penal Code formally recognise cybercrime within the legal framework and categorizes 10 activities as cyber offenses: Unauthorized access to computer systems Accessing unauthorized computer systems with the intention of committing a crime Intercepting unauthorized data on computer systems Interfering with unauthorized computer systems Misuse of computer systems or similar devices Acts of cyber violence Computer-related forgeries Acts of fraud and misrepresentation related to computer systems Infringement of copyright and associated rights People found guilty of such offenses will be subject to upwards of one year in prison. Comprehensive economic reforms are urgently needed in Maldives, to address fiscal and external imbalances, build investor confidence, and reduce debt over the medium-term. On October 10, 2024, a World Bank report titled Maldives Development Update: Seeking Stability in Turbulent Times, underlined heightened external and fiscal vulnerabilities that required the urgent implementation of comprehensive economic reforms. While overall inflation remained low at 0.5 per cent in the first half of 2024, food prices rose by 6.7 per cent in the same period, as compared to the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves are also low, enough to cover only 1.5 months of imports. Dollar reserves fell from USD 590.5 million at the end of 2023 to USD 443.9 million in August 2024. Further, in the month of December 2024, the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) reported that the inflation rate, which was at 0.3 per cent during the second quarter, had risen to 1.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2024. The Central Bank released its Economic Quarterly Bulletin, in which it emphasized that this increase in inflation could mainly be attributed to price changes in the energy sector. President Muizzu of the People's National Congress (PNC) party won the September 2023 presidential elections, with a 54.06 per cent of the vote in the run-off contest, defeating incumbent President Ibrahim Solih. In April 2024, the PNC won a super-majority in the People's Majlis (Parliament), with 66 seats, while its allies won 9 seats, giving Muizzu the support of 75 of the 93 members of the Majlis. It won't be wrong to say that the economic disturbances of the country are the reason for Muizzu's tip-toeing between India and China. With his 'India Out' campaign at the forefront, Muizzu visited Beijing in January, 2023, signing infrastructure and climate deals with China - but he has not burned bridges with New Delhi. He described India as a 'valued partner' and in the aftermath of his Indian visit in October, 2024, India approved a USD 400 million currency swap agreement, to support the cash-strapped Maldivian economy. With a string of domestic issues and economic challenges, Maldives needs to tread cautiously to sustain itself under Mohamed Muizzu's leadership. The archipelago is in dire need of better management of regional players, of economic crises, of the challenge of radicalization, and of the increased narco-threat.

India: Reinforcing Gains In Maharashtra – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On February 11, 2025, the inspector of a special commando unit C-60, Mahesh Kavadu Nagulwar (39), died, succumbing to injuries sustained during an anti-Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) operation in the Bhamragad Tehsil (revenue unit) of Gadchiroli District. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis confirmed the Police inspector's death during an exchange of fire at Bhamragadh, where the Police team was dismantling a Maoist camp. Following the encounter, the Police team conducted a thorough search of the area and recovered significant Maoist materials, including an approximately 100 feet of Cordex wire, 15 Gelatin sticks, four detonators, solar plates, walkie-talkies, and other equipment used in daily operations by the rebels. On February 1, 2025, ex-panchayat samiti (local governing body) chairman Sukhram Madavi was killed by CPI-Maoist cadres at Kiyer village in the Bhamragad Tehsil of Gadchiroli District for allegedly helping Security Forces (SFs) set up permanent posts in the region. The Maoists left a pamphlet near the body stating that Madavi earned the Maoists' ire for assisting the Police in opening posts to facilitate mining operations by private companies. The Maoists were also angered by Madavi's alleged role in helping disenchanted cadres surrender to the Police. However, Superintendent of Police (SP) Neelotpal claimed that the Maoists falsely accused Madavi of being a 'police informer' and of assisting the Police set up new camps, including one at Pengunda. Two persons have thus been killed (one SF Inspector and one civilian) in the two incidents of Left Wing Extremist (LWE)-linked violence in Maharashtra in 2025, thus far (data till February 16). According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), three civilians were killed through 2024 in Maharashtra. There were five such killings in 2023. Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE-linked violence across the country, a total of 205 such killings have been documented in the state, including a high of 36 civilian fatalities in 2011. Significantly, SFs did not suffer any loss in Maharashtra through 2024, as well as in 2023. The state recorded no loss in this category through 2022 and 2021. The last SF fatality recorded was on August 14, 2020, when a Police constable was killed and another constable sustained injuries, when a CPI-Maoist 'action team' opened fire on them in a market at the Kothi village under the Bhamragad Tehsil of Gadchiroli District. In remaining part of the year, another two fatalities were recorded in 2020, bringing the count of SF fatalities to three through 2020. The SF category recorded a high of 52 fatalities in 2009. A total of 171 such killings have been recorded since March 6, 2000. Meanwhile, SFs neutralised at least 24 Maoists in 2024, in addition to six in 2023. A maximum of 51 Maoist fatalities was recorded in 2018. A total of 351 such killings have been recorded in the state since March 6, 2000. Significantly, the last SF:Maoist kill ratio recorded was 1:3 in 2020. There were no SF fatalities between 2021 and 2024. Meanwhile, the favourable kill ratio for the SF was 1:25.5, recorded in 2018. Significantly, the overall SF:Maoist kill ratio in the state since 2000 has been 1:2.05, in favour of the SFs. In 2024, SFs arrested nine Naxalites (LWEs), in addition to seven such arrests in 2023, according to the SATP database. Since March 6, 2000, 490 Maoists have been arrested. Mounting SF pressure also resulted in the surrender of 19 Naxalites in 2024, in addition to five in 2023. Since March 6, 2000, total surrenders stand at 333, including 21 such surrenders already recorded in the current year (data till February 16). In the most recent surrender, on February 10, 2025, four wanted CPI-Maoist cadres, collectively carrying a bounty of INR 2.8 million, surrendered before the Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Gadchiroli District. The surrendered Maoists include Ashok Pochya Sadmek aka Balanna aka Chandrashekhar (63), a 'divisional committee member (DVCM)', Vanita Dohe Zore (54), 'area committee member (ACM)', Sadhu Lingu Mohanda aka Shailesh aka Sameer (30) and Munni Podiya Korsa (25), both Platoon Members of Platoon No. 32. Other parameters of LWE-linked violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation in the state. There was no major incident (resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the Maoists in 2024, as well as in 2023. The last major incident was recorded on May 1, 2019, when at least 15 SF personnel of the special commando unit C-60 of the Maharashtra Police, and one civilian driver, were killed in an ambush by CPI-Maoist cadres, who triggered an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion on the Dadapur Road near Lendali Nullah in Jamburkheda village under Kurkheda Police Station limits in Gadchiroli District. The Maoists failed to carry out any incident of arson in 2024, as against one such incident in 2023. On March 2, 2023, a group of CPI-Maoist cadres set three road construction machines on fire between Pursalgondi and Alenga in the Etapalli Tehsil in Gadchiroli District. Further, the Maoists did not issue any bandh (shut down strike) call in 2024, as against one such call in 2023. On November 23, 2023, the CPI-Maoist called for a 'Gadchiroli bandh' on November 30 in protest against Police action in dispersing anti-mining protesters from Todgatta village in Etapalli Tehsil, Gadchiroli District. The CPI-Maoist 'western sub-zonal bureau' called for the bandh. According to the SATP database, all Maoist-linked fatalities Maharashtra in 2024 were reported from Gadchiroli District alone. Likewise, in 2023, all fatalities were reported from Gadchiroli. Meanwhile, an analysis of underground and over-ground activities of the Maoists in 2024 indicated that, while Gadchiroli remained highly-affected, Gondia and Pune were considered marginally affected. By comparison, in 2023, Gadchiroli remained highly-affected, while Gondia was marginally affected. An analysis of the overall fatalities recorded in Maharashtra since March 6, 2000, indicates that, out of 738 fatalities (205 civilians, 171 SF personnel, 351 Naxalites and 12 Unspecified), at least 722 (196 civilians, 167 SF personnel, 348 Naxalites, and 12 Unspecified) were recorded in Gadchiroli alone, followed by seven (five civilians and two SF personnel) in Gondia, three (one civilian and two SF personnel) in Bhandara, two (one civilian and one LWE) in Nagpur, and one civilian in Aurangabad. The location of three fatalities (one civilian and two Maoists) remains unspecified. Maharashtra has a total of 35 districts. The last fatality outside Gadchiroli was recorded on October 18, 2019, in Gondia District, when CPI-Maoist cadres shot dead a civilian, Bhagchand Dhurve (50), suspecting him of being a 'police informer'. Against the backdrop of the declining impact of the CPI-Maoist, especially in Gadchiroli district, the epicenter of Maoist violence in Maharashtra, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken several steps against LWE elements in Maharashtra. Most recently, on January 2, 2025, NIA chargesheeted four CPI-Maoist cadres for the abduction and brutal killing of a youth in Gadchiroli District. The accused, Doba Wadde, Ravi Pallo, Sattu Mahaka, and Komati Mahaka, were charged with the abduction and murder of Dinesh Pusu Gawade in November 2023. Tha NIA stated, 'They had kidnapped and killed Gawade on suspicion of being a police informer and a member of RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh].' In its chargesheet filed before the NIA Special Court, Mumbai, Maharashtra, in case RC-03/2024/NIA/MUM, the agency stated that the accused were active members of CPI-Maoist and had committed the crime in furtherance of the outfit's conspiracy to spread terror in the minds of the local villagers. The case was initially registered at Dhodraj Police Station by Gadchiroli Police, which arrested the accused and seized a Bharmar gun, along with explosives and other incriminating materials. Meanwhile, according to a November 8, 2024, report, security and intelligence agencies joined forces to increase surveillance on around 180 pro-CPI-Maoist private (front) organisations spread across Maharashtra. These frontal organisations project various socio-political agendas, but their main aim is to ensure that no parties inimical to the Maoist cause come to power in Maharashtra. The end goal is to prevent the formulation and implementation of plans to eradicate Maoism from the region. The frontal organisations are reportedly active in many Maharashtra cities, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Nanded, Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Wardha, Bhandara, and Gondia. Moreover, Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah has urged Maoist-affected states such as Maharashtra to set a deadline for the complete elimination of Maoism. The Maharashtra government, which is planning a law against front organisations of the banned CPI-Maoist, titled the Maharashtra Security Act, has reportedly set a deadline of April-December 2025. The Maoists are failing in their appeals to secure the support of the local masses. On June 14, 2024, seven tribal hamlets of Bhamragadh Tehsil in the foothills of Abujhmadh, which houses the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) headquarters on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, banned the CPI-Maoist from entering their hamlets under the government's 'gaonbandi' scheme of rewarding villages for not giving support or providing assistance to Naxalites. The tribal hamlets of Paraynar, Nelgunda, Kucher, Kawande, Gongewada, Midadapalli, and Mahakapadi are escaping Maoist influence after four decades of forced indoctrination in the ultra-Left ideology. On June 14, 2024, they took a historic vow during a 'krishi melava' or agricultural congregation at the Dhodraj Police outpost, to shun the Maoists and extend support to SFs, in lieu of government benefits which form the bulwark of the 'gaonbandi' scheme. They promised to shut out Maoists, boycott their meetings, and ban their entry into villages, which are often used as launchpads for guerrilla operations, as well as to propagate LWE ideology, or organise political and military training camps. To bolster security against the rebels and curb their activities, a new Police Station was inaugurated on January 30, 2025, at Nelgunda in the Bhamragad sub-division of Gadchiroli District, to strengthen security and promote overall development in the remote and inaccessible parts of the district, which has long been affected by Maoist activity. On January 1, 2025, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis inaugurated the 32-km-long Gatta-Gardewada-Wangeturi Road and bus services of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation on the Wangeturi-Gardewada-Gatta-Aheri route in the Gadchiroli district. The road link will connect Maharashtra directly to Chhattisgarh. On December 11, 2024, a new Police Assistance Centre was opened at village Pengunda under Bhamragad Sub-Division, with the objective of providing security and overall development to the citizens of the extremely remote Pengunda and surrounding villages, to bring them into the mainstream of development. Meanwhile, according to a January 3, 2025, report, Chief Minister Fadnavis reintroduced the Maharashtra Special Public Security Bill, 2024, during the winter session of the State Assembly, asserting that the proposed law does not attempt to suppress genuine dissenting voices, but to close down the dens of 'urban Naxals' instead. The Bill has been sent to a Joint Committee and will be brought up again during the monsoon session later this year. Despite important security and developmental components, Maharashtra continues to suffer critical gaps of strength and quality in the State Police Force meant to fight against any kind of internal challenge. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, the sanctioned strength for the States' Police was 232,965, but only 172,382 personnel were in position, yielding a vacancy of 60,583 (26 percent). Police personnel per 100,000 population in Maharashtra currently stand at a sanctioned 184.92, while those actually available are 136.83. Further, the Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometers) for Maharashtra is just 56.02, as against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio are well below their sanctioned strength, at 75.71 and 82.82, respectively. Further, of a sanctioned strength of 317 apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State, 41 posts, i.e., 12.93 per cent, remained vacant, substantially weakening executive command of the Force. At least two out of 1,191 Police Stations had no telephones. The Maharashtra Police has been able to ensure a relatively safe environment on the ground, and has substantially contained the Maoist challenge. This is an opportunity for SFs to further consolidate their gains and eradicate Naxalism from the state.

People Survive On Less Than $1.9 A Day In A District Of Atyrau Pr...	According to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2024, developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Human Development and Poverty Initiative, 1.1 billion people live in acute poverty worldwide, meaning they dispose of less than $1.90 per day as living expenses, with 40 percent living in countries experiencing war, fragility, and/or low peacefulness. The Zhyloi district, with its center in Kulsary, an oil workers' town in the Atyrau province of Kazakhstan, is not experiencing war, fragility, and/or low peacefulness, yet there, as it turns out, are people there, too, who live in such poverty that they dispose of far less than $1.90 a day per person as living expenses while being at the heart of the Kazakh State's gas and oil producing industry, that provides the very basis of economic and social well-being of the republic's 20 million-strong population considered an upper-middle-income nation. The paradox of that situation doesn't end there. What's more, the Zhyloi district definitely is the richest district in the country. As of October 1, 2022, the population of the district was 86,118 people, and the town of Kulsary accounted for more than 70 percent of them (65,964 people in 2023). That is, the Zhyloi district is, first of all, the oil workers' town of Kulsary. Being just a part of the Atyrau province, it is potentially richer than any province of Kazakhstan, except maybe the Atyrau province itself. It is potentially richer than many individual post-Soviet States, as this is the largest oil-producing district in Kazakhstan, with over 40 oil fields with total reserves of 2.5 billion tons. But this all has seemingly been of little use to Kulsary, where more than two-thirds of its population is concentrated. On February 10, 2025, residents of the town of Kulsary took to the streets, asking for employment opportunities. They said unemployment had reached a critical level, with many able-bodied citizens left without income and forced to live on [state] benefits that would end in six months. 'What should we do next? Here is what we ask: the local companies should provide people with work on a 14/14 system (shift work). Now, we are being laid off. And we have come here to be heard. This is not a rally or a provocation. We just want to show how many people have been left without work', - said the protesters. Among the participants of the action was Zhanargul Sagynbai, a district activist, who noted that there had been about 100 people gathered for the rally, although there are actually more of them [unemployed ones in Kulsary]. She referred to a situation in one family where four able-bodied members are forced to live on the income of the daughter-in-law, who earns only three thousand tenge [around US$6] a day from trade. If this sum is divided by the number of able-bodied family members, each would get US$1,5. Surely, there are also children in that family. So, one can just imagine living like that. It would seem that such a protest action was due to be an event of general importance in the country as its social and economic well-being is, among other things, built on the Zhyloi district's oil and gas industry. However, it remained largely unnoticed in the Kazakh mainstream media. The central authorities of the country, as far as is known, paid no attention to it. In this sense, official Astana seems to be putting their trust merely in the State and pro-government Kazakh media and bloggers. The latter ones, as far as can be judged, largely follow the classic models of Soviet propaganda before the perestroika period. That is, they mainly display the achievements of the country and speak negatively about those who criticize the ruling regime and its policies, and sometimes, about, say, striking oil workers in Western Kazakhstan, asking for employment opportunities, or demanding higher salaries and better working conditions. Here’s how Miras Nurmukhanbetov, а Kazakh journalist, described one such case a while ago: 'In short, those ‘opinion leaders’ focus on several aspects. These are ‘dependency attitude’ [i.e. ‘parasitic attitude’, ‘parasitic way of life’, or ‘parasitism’], ‘repatriates’, ‘already high salaries’ and so on, with a direct or indirect conclusion that ‘it is beneficial for someone to rock the boat’… But it is obvious that those opinion leaders to a greater extent promote the latent position of official bodies and the no less official KazMunayGas [national oil and gas company]. The authorities, for obvious reasons, cannot voice it, so as not to worsen their already shaky image. However, they believe that they were able to form a negative opinion about the strikes among at least part of society. By and large, the formula ‘divide and conquer’ is again set in motion, dividing Kazakhs into ‘ours’, who are supposedly objective and earn their bread (with caviar), and into ‘troublemakers’ who strive to stand out from others. Here, it must be emphasized that part of the audience of those public opinion leaders needs this to calm down and find excuses for themselves because almost all of them have nothing to do with Mangystau province and the oil-producing West [Western Kazakhstan] as a whole. This has always been the case, and it has been repeated after almost any socio-political excesses. But in this case, we are witnessing a real escalation of the situation, when such bloggers, as conductors of the authorities’ opinions, ‘appoint’ those to blame instead of looking for ways for dialogue'. Kazakhstan’s revenues from Western Kazakhstan’s oil and gas fields feed the national budget and are being used for supporting the subsidy-dependent provinces, which are composed of the country’s all other regions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Southern Kazakhstan. At the same time, people in the oil-producing region are increasingly getting bogged down by social, economic, and environmental problems, exacerbated by persistent drought and water scarcity. Not without reason are the richest provinces of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with an average per capita GDP comparable to that of some EU Member States, have now been called by Russian experts ‘the destitute West’ of Kazakhstan. It should seem astonishing for West Kazakhs to be called by Russian experts ‘destitute’, and ‘Barbarians’ by Chimkent Kazakhs in conditions when, say, in 2008, per capita income in the Atyrau province of Western Kazakhstan was almost 15 times higher ($23.6 thousand) than in the South Kazakhstan province ($1.8 thousand), which then included Chimkent. It is clear that people there (in Western Kazakhstan) mostly can’t be happy with such a state of things. That seems to be the reason there are often demonstrations and strikes over there. The situation in Kulsary described above is pretty strange on its own. It seems to be even weirder when you take in that here, we speak of a district on the territory of which over one-third of the budget revenues of the Kazakh state were generated in, say, 2018. And that is no exaggeration. Over a third or more than 35% of the Kazakh republican budget revenues planned for 2018 (without transfers) for 5 trillion 528.4 billion tenge fell to share of the Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) alone. It’s easy to verify if one wants to. The TCO operates a license that includes the unique, supergiant Tengiz field and the adjacent, smaller but still significant, Korolevskoye field. Both fields are in the Zhyloy district territory, the center of which is Kulsary, a town that, less than a year ago, has been badly hit by the devastating water floods. In 2023, the TCO produced 28.9 million metric tons of oil. That is more than the peak figures of Kazakhstan as a whole in the Soviet years and just a little less than what Azerbaijan produced in 2023: 30.2 million metric tons of crude and gas condensate. However, even with all this, some people have to struggle to survive on less than $1,9 a day in the Zhyloi district of the Atyrau province, which is richer than the whole rest of Kazakhstan. This is the way things are.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adD9fCSZuBI_-	2025-02-17T15:37:20-08:00	
Trump’s Ukraine Envoy ‘Clarifies’ What Europe’s Seat At The Table...	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- European views will be taken into account and Ukraine will not be pressured into a deal, the US envoy for Ukraine and Russia told a group of reporters at NATO HQ. Keith Kellogg's two-day visit to Brussels comes amid growing unease among European allies that a future Ukraine peace deal would be struck over their and Kyiv's heads, as neither of them is expected to participate in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, tomorrow. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv would not agree to a deal that would be detrimental to his country or that resulted from negotiations in which he didn't participate. Kellogg said 'nobody' would impose decisions on Zelenskyy as the 'elected leader of a sovereign nation' and the decision about striking a deal would ultimately be the Ukrainians'. Trump’s Ukraine envoy is expected to travel to Kyiv tomorrow night for a three-day visit, where he is scheduled to meet with the Ukrainian leader. He will then return to Washington and continue a tour of NATO capitals in the next few weeks. At the table Asked by Euractiv about his comments made on stage in Munich that 'Europeans would not be at the table,' Kellogg clarified that this would not mean European concerns would not be taken into account. 'If you believe there are going to be thirty-three people sitting at the same table – exactly the same table – during the discussion, in all probability, the answer is no, not at all,' Kellogg said. 'If 'at the table' means that your views are heard, understood, transmitted, the answer is absolutely,' he said. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals earlier last week to determine what resources they would be ready to contribute to a possible future peacekeeping force. 'Before any type of discussion and security guarantees is finalised, of course, those discussions are going to take place,' Kellogg said. 'Answers to those questions will be determined as you come up with the final process,' he added, throwing the ball back to the Europeans' court. Status concerns Kellogg's absence from the US negotiating team travelling to Riyadh raised questions over his leverage on Trump's efforts to draw up a peace proposal – and how European input will find its way into them. Responding to concerns about his status in the process, Kellogg said, 'That doesn't mean that the team is not fully synced.' 'They are going to come out of the Middle East, I will come out of Ukraine – we will go back to being synched up,' he said, adding he had a joint conference call with the negotiating team over the phone after Munich. The team includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adJ71pDTO5Ouj	2025-02-17T15:34:11-08:00	
China Warns Philippines Of ‘Red Line’ In The South China Sea	Maritime tensions between China and the Philippines were in the spotlight at the Munich Security Conference, with former Chinese vice foreign minister Fu Ying calling the occupation of disputed features in the South China Sea 'a red line.' Speaking at a forum at the annual international security conference at the weekend, Fu said that China had a very strong position on ownership over territories and 'we cannot lose them.' The former vice minister said China would not agree to the Philippines occupying the Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal, where Chinese and Philippine ships have been confronting each other over the past two years. Both are within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. Fu, who served as Chinese ambassador to the Philippines from 1998 to 2000, spoke of how Manila deliberately ran aground an old naval ship on the Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to use as an outpost. It attempted to do the same at Scarborough Shoal, which is classified as a rock under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. 'If the Philippines can take new rocks how can you stop others?' Fu asked. 'How can you stop China from taking more?' 'We’re capable, there’s no problem, but we are exercising constraint,' the former diplomat said, adding that China was committed to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea that urges claimants to handle their differences in a constructive manner. 'That’s a red line no one should be allowed to cross … that kind of naughtiness shouldn’t be encouraged,' she said. China’s domestic law at sea Philippines foreign secretary Enrique Manalo, meanwhile, said his country was 'following international law.' 'But when another country … applies its own domestic laws to certain areas within our exclusive economic zone then it really does create the kind of tension that we have been experiencing especially over the last two years,' Manalo said. All the disputed features mentioned by Fu are miles away from the Chinese coast, Manolo pointed out. The foreign secretary added that Manila had received support from like-minded nations. 'I haven’t heard of any country really coming out against what we’ve been doing except for one,' he said, referring to China. Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven developed countries, or G7, who also met at the Munich Security Conference, 'reiterated their commitment to a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific region, grounded in respect for the rule of law and sovereignty,' they said in a joint statement. 'They strongly opposed China’s attempts to restrict freedom of navigation through militarization and coercive activities in the South China Sea.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met separately with his Philippine counterpart, Enrique Manolo, and 'not only reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the United States-Philippines Alliance, but noted his enthusiasm for building an even more invested and enduring relationship,' the U.S. State Department said. US-China strategic competition For her part, Fu said, 'what concerns China now is the shadow of the U.S. behind the claimants.' Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, said that China’s stance on the South China Sea was that countries outside the region should not get involved. But the question 'when China is strong enough what would it do?' is what strikes fear in countries in the region, Ng said, 'It’s up to China to assure its neighbors,' he said. The Singaporean minister noted that China wanted to show deterrence by strength as the U.S. does and the strategic competition between the U.S. and China 'is still in play' in the South China Sea. Speaking of the U.S.-China rivalry, Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi, after delivering a keynote speech at the Munich gathering, said that the two countries 'must not come into conflict, otherwise, the world will suffer.' 'China is full of confidence in the future of China-U.S. relations, but if the United States insists on suppressing China, China will have no choice but to fight to the end,' Wang said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adLbxGkpaS-gs	2025-02-17T15:32:14-08:00	
Ukraine Won’t ‘Recognize’ US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia, Zelens...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine will not participate in the upcoming talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters in Abu Dhabi, where he was visiting as part of a Middle East tour, which also includes Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Zelenskyy on February 17 said Ukraine was unaware of the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia and considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine to serve no purpose. 'We cannot recognize any agreements about us without us,' Zelenskyy told reporters in the capital of the United Arab Emirates. 'And we will not recognize such agreements,' added Zelenskyy, who traveled on to Turkeyafter his U.A.E. stop. Meanwhile, the U.S. presidential envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, told reporters that no one will force a peace deal on Zelenskyy, and that he and the people of Ukraine would make that call. 'Nobody will impose [a peace agreement] on an elected leader of a sovereign nation,' Kellogg said. He earlier caused a stir when he said Europe may not be 'at the table' if the United States brokers negotiations to end Russia's war against Ukraine. He later clarified to say that even if Europe were not 'at the table,' its views would be taken into account. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those remarks, saying Ukraine and other European nations would be included in any meaningful negotiation sessions, if and when they take place. 'Ultimately, it will reach a point -- if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet -- but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved because they're the ones that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on [President Vladimir] Putin and Russia as well,' Rubio said. 'We're just not there yet.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, arrived in Riyadh late on February 17, set to take part in bilateral talks with their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia on February 18. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the meeting will focus on restoring relations between Moscow and Washington, while Ushakov told Russian state TV that the delegation would be approaching the talks with a 'businesslike' attitude. Upon arrival, Ushakov said that 'the main thing is to achieve a real normalization of relations between us and Washington.' The United States will be represented by Rubio, who is already in Riyadh, national security-adviser Mike Waltz, and special envoy Steve Witkoff, the State Department confirmed. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow with his Serbian counterpart ahead of the Saudi talks, Lavrov claimed that Europe had already had several chances to be involved in a settlement on Ukraine but that he didn't know how European politicians could contribute given that they want the war to continue. While there are different views on Ukraine among European politicians, most agree that they want 'a just and lasting peace' to be settled with Ukraine at the table. U.S. President Donald Trump on February 16 insisted that Zelenskyy 'will be involved' in any peace negotiations to end the Russian war, while he also stated that he could meet 'very soon' with Putin. Trump did not specify details. Bloomberg, citing unnamed officials, reported on February 16 that Trump wants to secure a cease-fire by Easter, which falls on April 20 this year both for Western and Orthodox churches. Trump told reporters his team has had 'long and hard' talks with Russian officials and that Witkoff had spoken with Putin for three hours recently. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine on February 20, Zelenskyy said at a virtual press conference with Ukrainian reporters. 'I want him to visit the front line with me [...] We will meet [Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr] Syrskiy and maybe some brigade commanders,' Zelenskyy said. Kyiv said Zelenskyy's visit to the region was aimed at boosting economic ties and that there were no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials. Zelenskyy late on February 17 said he had arrived in Turkey for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish presidential spokesman Fahrettin Altun said Zelenskyy will meet with Erdogan on February 18 to discuss 'regional and global' issues. Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Saudi Arabia on February 19, although specific details were not disclosed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, said that 'there are no negotiators who will represent Ukraine in Saudi Arabia' in peace talks. 'Today, there is nothing on the negotiating table that could be discussed. Russia is not ready for negotiations,' he told Ukrainian TV. Zelenskyy has said he would not engage in negotiations before meeting with allies, including European leaders, to develop a strategy. 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never,' Zelenskyy told NBC's Kristen Welker on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. He said there cannot be a legitimate peace plan in the works because 'they can't have it without us.... Maybe there are some ideas.' In the same interview, Zelenskyy told Welker that Ukraine had suffered '46,000 killed soldiers' and approximately '380,000 wounded' since February 2022 in the war. Russia hasn't disclosed losses, but Western sources have put the death and wounded toll at more than 600,000, not including losses suffered by North Korean soldiers involved in the fighting. Meanwhile, some 4,600 kilometers away, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted European leaders on February 17 in an emergency summit on the Ukraine war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adGSGgqUU2Ifs	2025-02-17T15:30:19-08:00	
Criminal Complaint Filed Against Ex-President Duterte For ‘Threat...	By Jason Gutierrez The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed a criminal complaint against former president Rodrigo Duterte over his alleged threat to kill incumbent senators, some of whom were campaigning under the ticket of his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte made the remark on Thursday when he introduced senators he was campaigning for in the May midterm polls. Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, chief of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, said the former president allegedly violated laws against incitement to sedition and unlawful utterances. 'I am filing this as a citizen. And you know, I’m a policeman. It’s part of the PNP to make sure that we protect the citizenry from criminal activities like this,' Torres told reporters on Monday, noting that Duterte has many 'blind supporters' who could actually take him seriously. He filed the complaint before the justice department and asked prosecutors to study it. 'You know, this is beyond politics. Don't think that this is politics and that I’m doing this to favor politics. We don’t have politics there. What is stated in the statement is a clear enumeration of violations of laws written in our laws. It cannot be ignored just like that,' Torre said. On Thursday, the former president told supporters about using a bomb to kill 15 senators to create vacancies for the senatorial bets he is supporting. 'Now, there’s many of them,' Duterte said on Thursday, referring to the incumbent senators. 'What should we do? Let’s kill the senators now to create vacancies.' 'If we can kill around 15 senators, we can all go in,' the ex-president sent, referring to the senatorial bets he was campaigning for. He said that the 'only way to do it is to use a bomb.' Five incumbent senators, including President Marcos’ sister, Imee, were running for reelection under the administration ticket. Duterte’s lawyer, Salvador Panelo, said he was confident the case would be dismissed because the former president’s remarks should not be taken seriously. He said the senators would find the joke 'just as amusing and (a) laughable remark.' But Torre said Duterte’s jokes 'are no longer acceptable.' 'He wants to kill the 15 senators he wants to bomb (them),' Torre said. The police are urging 'the public to respect the legal process and avoid speculation that may mislead or create unnecessary division,' Torre said. President Marcos touched on Duterte’s remarks during Saturday’s rally for his administration-backed senatorial candidates in the southern Davao del Norte province. 'We just heard the other day, maybe they felt they stand no chance, that they will just kill 15 senators,' he said. 'That’s the problem when people think that the only solution is for them to kill their fellow Filipinos.' While Duterte’s officials often say the former leader’s utterances were never serious, thousands of suspected addicts and dealers had been killed during his six years in power from 2016-2022. Analysts said the Duterte family was using the political race to shore up support for the ex-president’s daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who may face an impeachment trial in the Senate in July for an alleged threat to assassinate Marcos Jr., his wife and the House Speaker. The Dutertes support the reelection bids of incumbent Sens. Ronald dela Rosa, who served as a police chief under the Duterte administration, and Christopher Go, the former aide of President Duterte. They are joined by Duterte’s spiritual adviser Apollo Quiboloy and outgoing Congressman Rodante Marcoleta, a staunch supporter of the Duterte family. Dela Rosa was the chief enforcer of Duterte’s controversial drug war while Quiboloy commanded the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC), a religious group that had grown in prominence and influence during Duterte’s presidency. He is campaigning from jail, where he is fighting sex trafficking charges, including minors. If they win in the May midterm elections, they are expected to protect Sara Duterte amid the impeachment process, analysts said. Earlier this month, Sara Duterte – the running mate of Marcos in the 2022 national elections – was impeached by the House of Representatives, who had accused her of violating the constitution, graft and corruption, plotting to assassinate Marcos as well as other high crimes. In response, the vice president said she won’t resign from her post as vice president and denied making an assassination threat against her former political ally. The Marcos and Duterte families are two of the country’s leading political families. They entered into an alliance to defeat the opposition in 2022, with Sara Duterte agreeing to run as a Marcos’ deputy. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately, part of a system of checks and balances built into the constitution. The alliance subsequently soured amid mounting pressure for Marcos to allow international prosecutors to investigate the former president on his drug war. The president initially said he would block International Criminal Court (ICC) investigators from entering the country to investigate, but later said they could carry out their own investigation here as well.

European Leaders Discuss Being Left Out From US-Russian Talks On ...	French President Emmanuel Macron hosted European leaders Monday for talks focused on the U.S. push to start Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, seemingly set to proceed without the involvement of European officials. The leaders of Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, along with NATO chief Mark Rutte, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen began arriving in Paris for the hastily called meeting. The discussions came in the aftermath of last week’s phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two leaders agreed to start immediate talks to end Russia’s three-year war on its neighbor, but at least initially without the involvement of Ukrainian or European leaders. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Saudi Arabia where he is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Russian officials for discussions about the war. Rubio is being joined in the talks by two other key U.S. officials, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce described the Riyadh discussions as 'a follow-up' to the Trump-Putin call but said, 'I don't think people should view this as something that is about details or moving forward in some kind of a negotiation.' It does not appear that any Ukrainian officials will join the talks, even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he will not accept a U.S.-Russian dictate on Ukraine’s future and that Ukraine must be involved in any settlement of the conflict. Russia now holds about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow unilaterally annexed in 2014 and much of eastern Ukraine. After arriving in Paris, von der Leyen said on X, 'Europe’s security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine — but it is also about us. We need an urgency mind-set. We need a surge in defense. And we need both of them now.' European officials have expressed fear that Trump might pull U.S. troops out of Europe or negotiate an end to the Russian war on Ukraine on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and European allies uniformly supported Ukraine and supplied them with billions of dollars’ worth of weaponry. Additionally, European officials were shocked last week by U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s speech in Munich in which he assailed Europe for excluding far-right groups from power and what it might portend for future U.S.-European relations. Meanwhile, Trump last year at a political debate declined to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war. More lately he has suggested that Ukraine hand over some of its rare earth minerals needed for U.S. technology manufacturing as compensation for the military aid Washington has supplied it. European leaders have in recent days pledged continued support for Ukraine, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying his government was ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force. 'I do not say that lightly,' he wrote Sunday in the Daily Telegraph. 'I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way.' Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Putin from further aggression. Sweden’s Prime Minister Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday his country would not rule out contributing troops to a peacekeeping force that has a 'clear mandate.' The European Council’s Costa said last week’s Munich Security Conference showed the clear message that the security of Ukraine and the European Union 'cannot be separated.' 'There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the European Union.' Costa said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday the Russian delegation at the Riyadh talks with the U.S. would include Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin. Even though the Riyadh talks are the first effort at ending the war since shortly after it began in 2022, Rubio told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' in an interview that aired Sunday, 'A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing.' 'We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, in a way that is sustainable and fair,' Rubio said. Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once 'real negotiations' begin, then Ukraine 'will have to be involved.' In an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said, 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.' Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace. 'I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.’' Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult' to defeat Russia. 'And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance — low chance to survive without support of the United States.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adMxiu-GT8KMd	2025-02-17T15:25:58-08:00	
India’s Christians Splinter As Persecution Rises – OpEd	By John Singarayar (UCA News) -- The often-quoted phrase, 'Who will tie the cat?' aptly encapsulates the crisis of ecumenism in India today. Amid an increasing anti-Christian atmosphere under the shadow of Hindu majoritarianism, the body of Christ in India bleeds, not only from external wounds but also from self-inflicted fractures. Indian Christians, though a minority of 2.3 percent in a population of 1.4 billion, represent a mosaic of traditions: the ancient St. Thomas Christians claiming Apostolic history, Roman Catholicism shaped by Portuguese mission, Protestant denominations introduced by Western missionaries, and the 20th-century Pentecostal movements. The question is no more about Christian diversity or unity nor the threat to their survival amid Hindu majoritarianism. The vital question is about their moral accountability: If the Church is the embodiment of Christ, how does its fragmentation compound His suffering in a time of crisis? We need to critically examine the historical, theological, and socio-political dimensions of ecumenical failure in India, arguing that without confronting internal divisions, the Christian community risks further marginalization. Christianity’s arrival in India is traditionally dated to the St. Thomas mission in 52 AD. The ancient Syrian Christians, based in present-day Kerala, integrated into local caste structures and maintained distinct liturgical practices until Portuguese missionaries imposed the Latin rite system on them in the 16th century, sparking rebellion. More than five decades of rebellion resulted in the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653, pledging to reject Western missionaries and splitting the Church. Those joined to oppose the Portuguese further divided, now forming at least seven Kerala-based churches claiming St. Thomas tradition. The Catholic-Protestant theological mudslinging, their competition for converts among lower castes and tribal people, further fractured the Christian landscape. The Evangelical, Baptist, and Pentecostal movements arrived in the early 20th century, often funded by foreign agencies. Their proselytizing efforts among already Christian communities led to accusations of 'sheep-stealing.' These historical fissures, compounded by sociological identities such as caste, language, and ethnicities within churches, laid the groundwork for an often delayed and almost always divided response, or none at all, to issues Christians face. Since the rise of a common Hindu identity during pre-independence India, Hindu groups have been demanding laws against conversion saying Christian conversion destabilizes Indian society as it undermines the Hindu caste system. The Hindu-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), coming to political prominence and power with a thumping majority in 2014, has intensified anti-Christian rhetoric, framing conversions as a threat to national identity. The Hindu groups supporting the BJP took the election victory as a mandate to push their ideology of establishing a Hindu nation. Attacks range from mob violence — burning churches, assaulting worshippers — to bureaucratic harassment via anti-conversion laws in 12 states. These laws, requiring state approval for religious conversion, are weaponized to criminalize humanitarian work and communal worship. For instance, in Chhattisgarh, Pentecostal pastors face arbitrary arrests under false 'forced conversion' charges. The Uttarakhand High Court’s 2024 ruling mandating state scrutiny of religious practices further erodes constitutional freedoms. Persecution is also societal: tribal Christians or Dalit converts in Odisha face economic boycotts and social ostracization. Yet, the Christian response remains fragmented, reflecting theological and strategic divides. India’s ecumenical movement, embodied in the National Council of Churches in India (NCCI) and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI), has struggled to bridge denominational gaps. While the CBCI, representing 20 million Catholics, emphasizes dialogue with the government, mainstream Protestant bodies like the Church of North India (CNI) advocate legal resistance. Pentecostals, often independent, prioritize evangelism over institutional alliances, viewing persecution as spiritual warfare. This dissonance was obvious during the 2008 Kandhamal riots, where over 100 people were killed, mostly Christians. While Catholic institutions provided refuge, evangelical groups criticized the CBCI for 'compromising' with authorities. Similarly, during the 2023 Manipur violence, where Kuki tribals (mostly Christians) were targeted, denominational NGOs competed for relief funds, diluting advocacy. Theological differences and caste divisions continue to bleed the Body of Christ with a thousand cuts. External perceptions further complicate unity. Hindu nationalists paint Christianity as a 'foreign' faith despite its ancient Indian roots. In response, groups like the Syro-Malabar Church emphasize their swadeshi (indigenous) identity, distancing themselves from newer denominations. The 2008 Kandhamal anti-Christian riots exemplify ecumenical failure. After Hindu mobs targeted Christians, destroying 300 churches and 6,000 homes, the CBCI worked for rehabilitation. But evangelical bodies like the Global Council of Indian Christians (GCIC) publicized atrocities internationally, angering the federal government. Ecumenical bodies themselves are plagued by bureaucratic inertia and hierarchical rigidity. The NCCI, comprising 30 Protestant and Orthodox churches, struggles with denominational rivalries. The CBCI, though more centralized, prioritizes Catholic interests, often side-lining interfaith initiatives. Women and laypeople remain under-represented in leadership, stifling grassroots perspectives. The cost of fragmentation is stark. Politically divided, the tiny Christian community spread all across India cannot form a voting bloc. Socially, the absence of a unified narrative allows Hindu nationalists to stereotype Christians as either violent converts or foreign agents. Vulnerable groups, like Dalits and tribals, suffer disproportionately from their dual marginalization by caste and faith. The Body of Christ, segregated by caste, bleeds in silence. Internationally, India’s Christians fail to leverage global networks effectively, as seen in the muted response to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) downgrading India to the lowest tier in 2024. Yet, even in the valley of dry bones, hope flickers. The 2021 formation of the United Christian Forum (UCF) for human rights monitoring marks a tentative step toward collaboration. In Jharkhand, ecumenical coalitions successfully challenged anti-conversion laws in court. Theologians like Father Felix Wilfred urge re-imagining ecumenism beyond institutional mergers, focusing on shared ethical imperatives: defending democracy, aiding the poor, and promoting interfaith harmony. Grassroots movements, such as ecumenical prayer vigils during attacks, model solidarity. Digital activism, exemplified by the #NotSilent campaign during the Manipur violence, bridges denominational gaps among youth. Even the CBCI’s 2023 synod acknowledged caste as a 'sin against communion.' As Jesus Christ bleeds in the persecuted, the Indian Church faces a reckoning. Ecumenism cannot remain a polite dialogue among bishops; it must become a radical solidarity that dismantles caste, shares power and embraces vulnerability. The Hindu nation project of the BJP parental organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or national volunteers’ corps) thrives on Christian division; every denominational rivalry, every caste hierarchy, becomes a weapon against the Cross. To 'tie the cat,' the Church must confront its complicity in oppression — spiritual, casteist, and colonial. This demands more than joint statements; it requires a costly kenosis, a self-emptying model by Christ, who bled not for a faction but for all. The choice is clear: unity or irrelevance. In the shadow of the gallows, the Body of Christ must decide whether to heal — or to let the bleeding continue. In a nation where majoritarianism seeks to erase pluralism, Christians’ survival may hinge on their ability to rekindle the ecumenical spirit — not as a lofty ideal but as a pragmatic necessity.

Arabs Know Their History And Won’t Let It Be Repeated – OpEd	Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, said in a 2020 interview that he had 'read 25 books' on the Middle East. Such intellectual bravado would not matter if it were not for the fact that Kushner served as the president’s Middle East adviser during his first term and was essentially the main architect of Trump’s policies in the region. Trump’s successor did not fare any better, as the Biden administration largely adhered to Trump’s major mistakes and ultimately sustained the Israeli genocide, which killed — as per the latest estimates — more than 55,000. Joe Biden, too, proved to be a reader; although, unlike Kushner, he did not publicly brag about his intellectual prowess. On Nov. 29, a photo emerged of him holding a book by Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi entitled 'The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017.' Though American leaders and officials claim to base their decisions on a thorough understanding of the complexity of the Middle East, they are repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Trump has repeatedly insisted that the US will take ownership of Gaza, displace its population and turn their destroyed homeland into a real estate opportunity, while threatening them with 'hell' should they not follow his diktats. Trump is using such language based on the misguided idea that these threats will allow him to restore the political leverage that Washington lost over the course of its 15 months of blind support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza. No rational thinker, in the Middle East or beyond, would actually imagine a scenario in which Palestinians leave en masse due to Trump’s threats. They refused to do so after more than 85,000 tonnes of mostly US-supplied explosives were dropped on Gaza, destroying nearly all of the Strip. Empty threats will certainly not change that. Even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist government have taken advantage of Trump’s words to repair, however temporarily, their struggling coalition, turning Trump’s supposed new doctrine on Gaza into a reality is impossible. Israel has, in fact, tried to create the circumstances that will lead, in the words of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, to the 'voluntary emigration' of Palestinians out of Gaza. Instead, on Jan. 27, nearly 1 million displaced Palestinians who had been driven to southern Gaza began their awe-inspiring march back to the north. It behooves the US administration to stop discounting history, as any wrong move or policy could lead to disastrous outcomes. Historically, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians has been the main objective of all Israeli policies, even before the establishment of the Israeli state on the ruins of historic Palestine in 1948. Aside from the immorality of that act, the pain of which continues to be felt by generations of Palestinian refugees, the event was catastrophic to the Middle East region as well. Aside from millions of refugees displaced in Palestine itself, millions more live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, other parts of the Middle East and around the world. Currently, there are nearly 6 million registered Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA, though a large number remain unaccounted for. That political earthquake of 77 years ago remains one of the most decisive events that shaped, and continues to shape, the Middle East to this day. Its reversal will remain elusive unless justice finally prevails in Palestine — justice that is dictated by international and humanitarian laws, not impulsive statements from American officials. Jordan, Lebanon and Syria were the Arab countries that hosted most Palestinian refugees and whose political dynamics, as well as conflicts, were shaped by the mass displacement of Palestinians. Palestinian groups became part of the political fabric of these societies, sometimes becoming involved in internal struggles and sometimes being used to balance out existing demographic conflicts. Hardly a major event in the Middle East did not involve Palestinians, or the price of which was not disproportionately shouldered by them. Anyone who knows the fundamentals of modern Middle Eastern politics ought to know this. One can only imagine what would happen if 2.2 million more Palestinian refugees were pushed into Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries, as per Trump’s proposal. It would arguably be the most earth-shattering event in the region since the Nakba. No Arab government can possibly entertain such a scenario under any circumstances. While the prospects of another Gaza Nakba were born dead, the real worry is the fact that nearly 50,000 Palestinians have already been internally displaced in the West Bank. This ongoing ethnic cleansing is no less dangerous than the US-Israeli designs in Gaza. The uninformed US policy on Palestine, which continues to be led by the extremely dangerous policies of the politically bankrupt government of Netanyahu, is once again unifying the Arabs around a common cause. The Arabs know their history very well. It is time for them to prove to Israel that the lessons of history have been learned and will never be repeated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adG02XAMeMq0t	2025-02-17T15:20:34-08:00	
Assessing Trump’s Aggressive Deportation Goals: How Many Migrants...	One of the main themes of Donald Trump’s electoral campaign in the recent presidential elections has been immigration. Following his victory, Trump has begun implementing his action plan. One of his key proposals was the execution of mass deportations of immigrants. By Rut Bermejo Casado and Eric Sigmon Analysis 1. Introduction During the 2024 electoral campaign, Trump not only promised to restore some of his previous immigration policies, such as the creation of a ‘great wall’ on the southern border, but he also introduced new proposals to combat irregular immigration to the US. One of the most repeated claims was that he would carry out ‘the largest deportation operation in American history’. Thus, his plan is not only to work on the external dimension of migration control (particularly border controls or, in his words, ‘sealing the border’) but also to address the internal dimension, that is, to reduce the number of immigrants already within the country’s borders.[1] Although the concept of mass deportations appears to conflict with the very historical identity of the US as a nation of immigrants (Cornelius, Martin & Hollifield, 1994; Martin & Orrenius, 2022),[2] from the day of his inauguration, he began signing executive orders to implement a restrictive immigration policy designed by his trusted advisor, Stephen Miller, and to fulfil the promised deportations. Two main aspects of his immigration policy, particularly his deportation plan, are discussed below. First, the potential numerical scope of his plan is examined to answer the question: how many people are likely to be deported? Secondly, which individuals will be included in the operation? Although the well-known Republican policy platform, ‘Project 2025’, clearly states that his immigration policy objectives are to ‘secure the border, complete the construction of the wall, and deport illegal immigrants’, the lack of clarity regarding these aspects or even the contradictory statements were frequent during the electoral campaign. These grandiose, yet detail-lacking proposals, combined with an avalanche and overlapping of measures in the first two weeks of his Administration, make it difficult to ascertain the specifics. Both elements appear to be deliberate to ‘declare victory’ regardless of the outcome of his so-called ‘Operation Aurora’, as the lack of precise objectives prevents the assessment of his achievements. However, his response to how many and which ‘illegal’ immigrants are deported will determine not only the economic cost –which is expected to be high– but also the human cost for the immigrants themselves and the impact on the fundamental values and liberties of US democracy. This paper distinguishes, for analytical purposes, the questions of how many and which. However, both aspects are interconnected, and the response to one has an influence on the other. The total number of deported individuals is clearly linked and also determined by the second aspect: which ones will be deported? If the focus is placed on criminals, as Trump has occasionally said and as suggested by the first ‘detention operations’, that number will be lower than if it includes the entire population residing illegally in the US. 2. Deportations in the US immigration system President Trump’s statements regarding ‘Operation Aurora’ have recalled –indeed, he has explicitly referenced– President Eisenhower’s 1954 ‘Operation Wetback’ (García, 1981; Astor, 2009; Langham, 1992; Hernández, 2006). It is not clear how familiar he is with the operation or to what extent he considers it a model to follow; it may also simply be a nod related to his MAGA slogan, referencing the era that his movement holds as exemplary: the 1950s.[3] ‘Operation Wetback’ is, for many, one of the most shameful episodes in US democracy. This historical event has been described as follows: ‘Eisenhower’s mass deportation policy was a tragedy. Human rights were violated. People were transported to distant locations without food or water. Many unnecessary deaths occurred. On some occasions, even US citizens of Hispanic origin were deported. It was absurd. It was terrible. The immigrants were humiliated’. That operation involved the use of the military and was led by retired military officer Joseph Swing, who implemented it in the summer of 1954. One million young Mexicans were deported (Hernández, 2006), yet its effects in reducing irregular migration appear rather minimal, as many of those deported soon attempted to re-enter, some illegally and others legally. ‘Operation Wetback’ was not only aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants but also at redirecting their entry through legal channels, such as the ‘Bracero’ programme. The latter was designed to meet the demand for labour in specific sectors, requiring workers to meet established conditions to obtain temporary contracts. However, while the operation facilitated the return of some migrants through this system, it failed to curb irregular immigration, as many deportees continued to enter unlawfully. Thus, the operation can be assessed as a costly form of immigrant regularisation and an inefficient method for reducing irregular migration. As previously indicated, the primary target of the deportation operation was young, recently-arrived undocumented Mexican immigrants. Mexico cooperated closely with the US government, to the extent that it has been described as a ‘binational’ operation (Hernández, 2006). The reason for this intense and extensive cooperation was due to Mexico’s labour shortages and its desire to recover its young workforce (predominantly men). In addition to stopping the influx of undocumented Mexican workers, the operation also sought to dissuade employers from hiring them. However, resistance arose from certain legislators and agricultural and livestock industry groups that lobbied Congress. Many legislators opposed one of the initiative’s fundamental principles: penalising employers who hired undocumented workers, arguing that proving their knowledge of their employees’ immigration status would be difficult. Furthermore, some legislators were wary of Brownell’s militaristic approach, which proposed executing the plan as if it were a military invasion. Ultimately, Congress failed to pass legislation sanctioning employers who hired illegal workers but did approve increased funding for the Border Patrol. In summary, ‘Operation Wetback’ encountered legal and operational complications, as well as systematic violations of rights by authorities, including inhumane and degrading treatment, as well as torture. These factors, along with high costs and logistical difficulties, led to its swift termination. There is no doubt that Trump is no Eisenhower, nor is the context the same. Furthermore, certain details of the US immigration system, particularly deportation, have changed since then. Understanding how the system functions is crucial to grasping the new President’s capacity and possibilities for implementing his deportation programme. In the US the deportation or removal system generally requires obtaining a judicial decision for violating immigration laws. To refer to individuals returned to their country of origin following such a judicial resolution, the terms deportation, removal or return are used. It is estimated that in 2022 around 1,200,000 individuals had a final removal order that had not been executed because immigration authorities were unaware of their whereabouts or due to the government’s prosecutorial discretion not to enforce it. In cases where an immigration judge is involved, legal safeguards are clear. Even if the judge determines that a non-citizen may be deported, denies some kind of ‘relief from removal’ and issues a removal order or grants voluntary departure, the individual still has the right to appeal. The deportation order is only considered final if the 30-day period for filing an appeal expires without one being lodged, if the individual expressly waives the right to appeal, or if the Board of Immigration Appeals dismisses the appeal or upholds the deportation order.[4] This general system also includes expedited removals, which are primarily applied to individuals who have just crossed the border and entered the country, executed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Under the system established in 1996, these expedited removals bypass judicial authorisation if the deportation occurs within 14 days of entry for individuals apprehended within 100 miles of the land border unless the individual applies for asylum. These expedited removals, without judicial intervention, can also be applied to those who have been previously expelled (reinstatement of the removal order). The 2020 reform, under Trump’s first term, allowed the DHS to expel such individuals without a formal deportation order. That year expedited removals accounted for 41% of total deportations, while reinstated removal orders constituted 40%. The remaining 19% were determined by an immigration judge. The Trump Administration has once again modified expedited removals. The DHS has reversed the limitations imposed by Biden in 2022. With the new notification, the DHS has regained its authority to apply this procedure more broadly. The new regulation allows individuals without legal status to be subject to expedited deportation if they cannot prove they have been in the country for the previous two years, regardless of where they are found within the US. This measure has raised concerns among human-rights advocates and pro-immigrant organisations. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has criticised the expansion of expedited deportation, stating that this policy ‘leads to the deportation of individuals without due process and without the opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility to remain in the country’. Similarly, the American Immigration Council has warned that the lack of adequate judicial review could increase wrongful deportations, affecting immigrants with legitimate asylum claims or community ties in the US. Title 42 expulsions were also used during the pandemic, from March 2020 to May 2023. This legal provision allowed for swift expulsions of irregular immigrants seeking to enter the US based on public-health risks without requiring a formal interview, thus preventing individuals from seeking asylum. Trump initiated the use of Title 42 and Biden used it more than initially expected until he finally terminated it (Sigmon, 2024). The increasing use of expedited removals, including during the latter part of the Biden Administration, is linked to the termination of Title 42, as it seeks to ensure that immigrants can be deported swiftly without a court hearing if they do not apply for asylum. If immigrants processed under expedited removals apply for asylum, they must pass an initial screening interview with an asylum officer to avoid deportation and proceed with their case in the immigration system. 3. How many people can be deported under the new ‘Operation Aurora’? Although President Donald Trump has begun implementing his planned deportation programme immediately after taking office, one undetermined aspect is the numerical objective of his deportation initiative. In fact, during his campaign, Trump spoke of deporting 15 million or even up to 20 million people, despite estimates from the Pew Research Centerindicating that between 11 and 12 million undocumented immigrants reside in the US. In the case of ‘Operation Wetback’, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the legacy US immigration agency, reported deporting 1,100,000 individuals, though there is no consensus on the actual number, with some sources citing 200,000 people (Langham, 1992), others 1,000,000 (Hernández, 2006) and some suggesting as many as 1,300,000. In the US immigration system, over recent decades, resources for the enforcement of immigration laws have steadily increased, both at the border and within the interior, leading to a rise in deportations. Figure 1 shows the average annual deportations under the last five Administrations. The annual average of deportations increased from the Clinton Administration through Obama’s presidency. However, during Trump’s first term, deportations decreased due to reduced cooperation between state and local jurisdictions with ICE officials, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the government’s ability to detain and remove immigrants. This downward trend continued under the Biden Administration, which prioritised the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, as Obama had also done. Screenshot According to ICE data (see Figure 1), Obama deported more immigrants on average per year (385,000) than Clinton (143,000), Bush (252,000), Trump (299,000) and Biden (174,000). If these figures are broken down annually (see Figure 2), it is evident that during his previous term, despite promising to deport millions of immigrants, the highest number Trump achieved in a single year was 347,250 in fiscal year 2019. ICE’s highest one-year total was 432,228 in 2013 under President Obama. This figure helped to earn him the nickname ‘Deporter-in-Chief’. If Title 42 expulsions and expedited removals are included, Trump reached 393,000 deportations/expulsions in 2020, while Biden’s total reached 1,083,000 (adding up the three years –2021, 2022 and 2023– during which Title 42 remained in effect, reflecting his Administration’s reliance on Title 42. In total, from March 2020 to March 2023 more than 2.8 million immigrants were expelled from the US pursuant to Title 42. Screenshot Considering both these averages and the annual figures, even Vance’s estimate of deporting one million people per year seems quite difficult to achieve. Although it is still very difficult to determine how many people Trump will deport during his term, and how many he has effectively deported during his first week in office, some sources point to approximately 7,300 individuals. Of these, Mexico received 4,094 deportees from the US, the majority of them Mexican nationals, although individuals of other nationalities were also included. Undoubtedly, the operation that has received the most attention has been that of Colombia, which refused to receive two US military planes with approximately 200 Colombian deportees. However, military flights have been a minority thus far –around six– while deportations via commercial flights have been far more frequent. These deportations are attracting particular attention not so much due to their numbers, which some do not find abnormal, but rather because they are accompanied by raids[5] in sanctuary cities such as Miami or Chicago. ICE is also requiring state prisons to notify them before releasing detainees. This allows ICE to take custody of individuals and then place them in formal proceedings. 4. Who is being deported? A mass deportation, as anticipated under ‘Operation Aurora’, would be highly divisive, leading to family separations and potentially devastating effects on communities. It is estimated that, on a national level, more than 16.7 million people have at least one family member living with them in an irregular immigration situation. In fact, there are 5.9 million US children citizens who could potentially be at risk if these measures target their undocumented family members. The imagery of arrests within communities and family separations would be difficult to justify for a democracy like the US and would provoke strong opposition, such as the outcry during Trump’s first Administration against his ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy, which resulted in the separation of immigrant children from their parents.[6] Trump has spent months –if not years– laying the groundwork for this opposition, using rhetoric suggesting an invasion or a massive wave of immigration that would justify mass deportations,[7] drawing parallels with ‘Operation Wetback’ (Hernández, 2006). Mass deportation could even affect individuals with legal immigration status. Some expect that the operation will not indiscriminately include ‘any immigrant without legal status’ but will instead focus not on ‘how many’ but on ‘which ones’. There is a significant difference between prioritising the deportation of individuals serving criminal sentences or those in immigration detention –or, as the President insists, individuals in mental asylums– and deporting people who have been living in the US unlawfully for 20 or 30 years, with spouses or children who are US citizens. Trump has talked about targeting immigrants who entered via the humanitarian parole programme the Biden Administration implemented for certain Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans because he believes the programme was illegal. By this logic, he could also target the so-called ‘DACA children’ and individuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It is worth remembering that, during his first term, Trump sought to end the DACA programme and eliminate TPS designations for certain nationalities. During his first week in office, Trump has emphasised the need to deport criminals, dangerous offenders and members of organised gangs. However, this could be merely the beginning: ‘the worst ones first’. Consistent with his focus on immigrants who have committed crimes, the first law he signed as President during his second term was the Laken Riley Act, approved the day after his inauguration, which expands the DHS mandate to detain any individual who is in the US illegally or lacks the necessary documents upon requesting admission and who has been accused, arrested, convicted or admitted to having committed acts that constitute the essential elements of burglary, theft, larceny or shoplifting. The Trump Administration has provided overall arrest figures for its first two weeks, but has not provided enough details to determine what proportion of the arrests were criminals or other details to help evaluate the kinds of operations ICE is conducting or the profiles of its targets. However, at the same time, reports of warrantless arrests have begun to emerge following the raids conducted during the first weekend in sanctuary cities such as Chicago and Miami. In this regard, Homan, known as Trump’s ‘border czar’, has reiterated that undocumented individuals apprehended during raids targeting criminals will also be deported. As with ‘Operation Wetback’, the majority of individuals being deported are of Mexican nationality. However, unlike that operation, this one will also include citizens from other countries, mainly Latin American. Additionally, while ‘Operation Wetback’ was primarily concentrated in the south-western US –starting at the California and Arizona borders before expanding to Texas’s southern border and later including Chicago (Langham, 1992)– the current US operations will be nationwide. Conclusions ‘Operation Aurora’ presents various challenges, which are examined in the second part of this paper –budgetary, operational, diplomatic, political and legal–. However, the first two weeks of President Trump’s Administration has already clarified some aspects regarding ‘how many people will be deported’ and ‘who will be affected’. The comparison with 1954’s ‘Operation Wetback’ highlights numerous similarities, whether intentional or coincidental, and underscores the risks of repeating historical mistakes. That policy not only resulted in significant human and economic costs but also proved ineffective in reducing irregular migration as it focused solely on mass deportation without offering viable pathways for regularisation. In the present context, where Trump has restricted legal migration pathways, a policy that combines ‘enforcement’ with regularisation could avoid these pitfalls and align with the principles of justice and humanity that should guide a democracy like the US. At present, it is not yet possible to describe this as a ‘mass deportation’. For some, the initial figures do not indicate an exceptional level of deportation activity. However, it remains to be seen how events unfold as the Administration’s efforts to pursue a mass deportation campaign present significant challenges, which will be analysed in the second part of this paper. Nevertheless, if the promised numbers are to be reached, the campaign will deeply impact social cohesion, employment in certain sectors (like agriculture and construction), human rights and the democratic values of the US. Moreover, images of family separations and mass arrests, detentions and deportations would be difficult to justify and support for an extended period of time in any 21st century democracy.

Donald Trump And North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Program – Analysis	By Ranjit Kumar Dhawan Introduction The Donald Trump administration after coming to power on 20 January 2025 expressed its desire to improve relations with the Kim dynasty regime in North Korea.[1] Notably, on the day after his inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, Trump termed North Korea a 'nuclear power' state, which caused apprehensions in South Korea.[2] However, during his meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba on 7 February 2025, Trump called for 'complete denuclearisation' of North Korea.[3] On the other hand, the North Korean regime has not yet responded to Trump’s gesture for restarting dialogue between the two countries. In the backdrop of the newly inaugurated second Trump administration, the Kim regime has been bolstering its nuclear weapons programme and has tested a more sophisticated cruise missile system. According to some analysts, Pyongyang will remain hostile towards the United States in 2025.[4] Also, contrary to the expectations of President Trump, North Korea would probably not give up its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Programme and the United States The enmity between North Korea and the US dates back to the Cold War period of intense ideological rivalry between capitalism and communism. The US played a key role in the division of the Korean Peninsula in 1945, and also militarily supported South Korea during the Korean War (1950–1953), which ended only with an armistice. The brutalities committed by the American army and threat to use nuclear weapons during the Korean War shaped North Korea’s approach towards the US. The American military bases on the Korean Peninsula and stationing of tactical nuclear weapons by the US in South Korea during the Cold War were also opposed by North Korea. In the post-Cold War period, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme gained momentum. The nuclear programme was guided by Pyongyang’s goal for achieving self-reliance or Juche in the field of national defence.[5] Despite being a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea secretly pursued the development of nuclear arsenal. In its pursuit of developing nuclear weapons technology, North Korea received some help from Pakistan.[6] Since 2006, North Korea has tested various kinds of nuclear devices, and has been developing long-range ballistic missiles which are apparently capable of reaching North America and could target the mainland US. The US has been strongly opposed to the North Korean nuclear weapons programme and has imposed severe economic sanctions against this reclusive regime. However, the fears of massive causalities and escalation of the conflict had deterred various administrations in the US to take pre-emptive strikes against the North Korean nuclear facilities. Remarkably, the previous Donald Trump administration in 2017 had even threatened to 'totally destroy' North Korea. But the three rounds of meetings between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during 2018–2019 remained unsuccessful. Notably, the current Trump administration has again pledged for North Korea’s denuclearisation. Why North Korea Will Not Denuclearise? A few days after the inauguration of the second Trump administration, the North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong-un made a visit to a secret weapons-grade nuclear materials manufacturing facility in North Korea, where he called for the reinforcing of the 'nuclear shield of the country'.[7] The North Korean state media also stated that the nuclear weapons of the country should not be regarded as a 'bargaining chip'.[8] Further, Kim Jong-un on the occasion of the 77th founding anniversary of the (North) Korean People’s Army on 8 February 2025, spoke about the threats from the US as the reason for bolstering North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.[9] Therefore, it appears that North Korea is not interested in negotiations with the US to curb its nuclear arsenal. Firstly, the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war since 2022 has provided useful lessons to the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang against denuclearisation. Also, North Korea and Russia signed a treaty on ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ for mutual defence in June 2024. As a result, the military engagement between Pyongyang and Moscow has increased significantly. Reportedly, North Korea has dispatched thousands of troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine, and has also provided Moscow with several tonnes of conventional weapons. In return, North Korea has apparently received rice, money and cutting-edge military reconnaissance satellite technology from Russia.[10] North Korea has also been treating Russian soldiers wounded in combat operations against Ukraine.[11] Also, there is a possibility that Moscow may even accept Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons development programme.[12] Secondly, the Trump administration’s approach for peace with North Korea has not been accompanied with any significant effort for reduction in tensions between the two countries. Evidently, the military exercises between the US and South Korea have continued unabated since Trump took office in January 2025. On the other hand, North Korea has continued to be critical of the US–South Korea military alliance, including sale of weapons to Seoul by Washington.[13] Also, the visit of an American nuclear-powered submarine to Busan in South Korea in February 2025 triggered angry response from North Korea.[14] Moreover, the comment by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding North Korea as a 'rogue state' was also vehemently criticised by Pyongyang.[15] Thirdly, North Korea’s relations with South Korea have undergone profound changes since 2024. The Kim dynasty regime in North Korea has abolished the idea of reunification of the Korean Peninsula, and has probably amended its constitution to regard South Korea as a 'hostile state'.[16] North Korea has also destroyed roads and railway links with South Korea as part of Pyongyang’s ‘two hostile states’ policy.[17] Therefore, South Korea is now a ‘separate and enemy’ country for North Korea. Arguably, this strategy of Pyongyang towards Seoul is to push South Korea to compromise and accept North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.[18] Conclusion The rapidly developing nuclear capabilities of North Korea have been an issue of deep concern to the US. This also reflects the failure of all previous American administrations to get rid of the North Korean nuclear arsenal. The advent of the second Trump administration has raised hopes for a solution on this issue. However, there has not been any major shift in Trump’s policy towards the North Korean nuclear weapons programme. For its part, the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang has been strengthening its nuclear weapons capabilities and has been critical about the policies of second Trump administration. Therefore, it appears that North Korea’s denuclearisation shall remain only a propaganda campaign for the US and Pyongyang would not abandon its nuclear weapons programme.

Syria: A Larger Lebanon Or A Signal For Major Geopolitical Change...	By General (Rtd) Corneliu Pivariu I. Brief History Syria, under French mandate after World War I, gained independence in 1945, subsequently experiencing a highly turbulent political and social period marked by numerous military coups until 1970, when General Hafez Al-Assad seized power through a coup. A referendum in the spring of 1971 legitimized his leadership, establishing an autocratic rule based on the military and secret services, widely supported by his Alawite coreligionists (a minority), who held the most important positions in the power structures. The natural passing of Hafez Al-Assad in 2000, one of the longest-serving heads of state in the Middle East, was linked by many analysts to the beginning of Syria’s decline in regional influence. His successor, his son Bashar, assumed power instead of his elder brother Basel, who had been groomed for leadership but died in a tragic car accident in Lebanon. Retaining his father’s loyal supporters, Bashar managed to stay in power for nearly 24 years, until December 8, 2024, when he fled to Moscow. Ultimately, the London-trained ophthalmologist failed to effectively manage the external and internal challenges he faced, exacerbated by severe mistakes made by his close circle and the shifting geopolitical landscape. The phrase popular in Damascus in the 2010s—'The West needs Bashar al-Assad more than Bashar needs the West'—gradually lost its validity due to the regime’s serious errors and changing international attitudes toward Damascus. II. Syria and the Arab Spring In Syria, the Arab Spring (or rather, the Arab Winter) emerged later than in North Africa, where protests and political upheavals began in 2010. The onset of Syrian unrest, which gradually escalated into a long and bloody civil war[2], is traced to March 15, 2011, following earlier protests in Dara, a southern Syrian city near the Jordanian border. The Assad regime mishandled these protests, employing heavy-handed repression, particularly through the Republican Guard led by Bashar’s brother, Maher Al-Assad. Popular discontent was further fueled by the presence of several hundred infiltrators from abroad, carrying passports from a neighboring country, between January and March 2011. This signaled an external decision to remove Assad, reinforced by substantial financial and material support from Arab states such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Despite the regime’s powerful secret services, which recruited followers from an early age, protests became violent across nearly the entire country. Armed intervention against demonstrators led to the radicalization of the movement. Due to Syria’s unique social situation and the government’s intelligence operations, opposition groups fragmented into various factions, including armed groups like the Free Syrian Army, which failed to unify into a single force. Extremist organizations such as Daesh (ISIS) exploited the ensuing chaos to seize control of different regions. The situation was further complicated by the involvement of international actors such as Russia (from 2015), Iran (from the beginning, both militarily and through Hezbollah), Turkey, and the U.S.-led coalition, each pursuing distinct geopolitical interests. Mass desertions weakened the Syrian army, which, except for its elite commando units and the Republican Guard, was generally poorly trained. Alongside foreign military presences—Russia and Iran being crucial in securing strategic areas—the regime also established local paramilitary formations such as the Shabiha ('ghosts'), primarily composed of Alawite minorities who maintained control, especially along the coast, where their population was significant. To survive, the regime employed all available means, from airstrikes using fragmentation bombs to chemical weapons. Prisons became overcrowded with opposition members detained for the slightest act of defiance. From a demographic perspective, the war was catastrophic, causing over 500,000 deaths, more than 6 million external refugees, and around 4 million internally displaced persons. Material destruction is difficult to estimate, with figures reaching approximately $300 billion. Between 2011 and 2023, the Syrian economy shrank by 85%. The regime survived largely due to Iranian support, estimated at $2-6 billion annually. Another financial lifeline was the production of Captagon, an illicit drug known as the 'jihad drug,' generating over $10 billion for the Assad regime. In late November 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham[3] (HTS) – Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, which controlled Syria’s northwestern Idlib region, launched an offensive against key strategic points, capturing Aleppo within days, followed by Hama, Homs, and finally Damascus. The Syrian Civil War formally ended on December 7, 2024, following a meeting in Doha involving Arab foreign ministers and the Astana Process for Syria. They signed a Joint Declaration [4] endorsing a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254. On December 8, 2024, Bashar al-Assad fled from Damascus to Latakia and was evacuated to Moscow from Russia’s Hmeimim military airbase. III. The Fall of the Assad Regime, Current Developments, and Perspectives The fall of the Assad regime was driven by a combination of internal and external factors that reached a critical point towards the end of 2024. Nevertheless, the regime demonstrated remarkable resilience, though the worsening economic and social crisis heightened the risks of regime change. Key external factors included Israel’s desire to capitalize on developments in Gaza and Lebanon to minimize Iran’s influence in Syria, as well as the situation of the Russian Federation, which, being engaged in the conflict in Ukraine, was unwilling to intensify its military support for Bashar al-Assad, thereby accepting his departure within a broader geopolitical context The Assad family was not entirely caught off guard[5], having taken precautions from the early years of the civil war to secure a comfortable life in Russia. Bashar shared his plans to flee Syria with almost no one, misleading his advisors, officials, and even relatives about his real intentions. His brother, Maher—commander of the Republican Guard—departed by helicopter to Iraq and then flew to Moscow. On December 8, the armed opposition announced the fall of the regime, and the acting Prime Minister, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, declared his willingness to hand over power to a transitional government. On December 10, Ahmed al-Sharaa[6], the emir of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who became the de facto head of state, appointed Mohammed al-Bashir as Prime Minister of the Salvation Government. Initially consisting of 12 members from the previously established government in Idlib, the cabinet was expanded by six members on December 21, and the first female minister was appointed a day later. On December 30, Maysaa Sabreen was appointed as the first female governor of the Central Bank of Syria, having previously served as the first deputy governor of the bank during the latter part of the Assad regime. On January 29, 2025, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) held the 'Victory Conference' in Damascus, officially naming Ahmed al-Sharaa as interim president. He was tasked with forming an interim legislative council to draft a new constitution. In a five-minute speech, Sharaa outlined his five priorities: resolving the power vacuum; maintaining civil peace and preventing acts of revenge[7]; rebuilding state institutions, particularly the military, security, and police forces, to ensure public safety; revitalizing the economy by rebuilding human resources, agriculture, industry, and the service sector; and regaining Syria’s regional position by establishing foreign relations based on sovereignty, respect, and mutual interests. Aware of the difficulties ahead, al-Sharaa remarked, 'The first moment of victory can be the first moment of defeat.' In defense, initial steps were taken as 18 larger and around 50 smaller armed factions agreed to dissolve and integrate into the new army. However, two armed factions in the south, from Suwayda and Daraa, as well as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which control a significant area in northeastern Syria, have not yet accepted integration. The SDF, of Kurdish origin and allied with the U.S., maintains ties with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, which seeks to eliminate it. Economic reconstruction is estimated to take at least ten years for Syria’s GDP to return to its 2010 level ($80 billion), compared to just $10 billion in 2023. In 2019, reconstruction costs were estimated at approximately $400 billion, likely exceeding $500-600 billion today. The new Minister of Economy has promised a transition to a free, competitive economy, abandoning the centralized control model. Although the U.S. and the EU are expected to lift most, if not all, economic sanctions, massive investments will be required for reconstruction, making it a fundamentally political issue. Countries financing reconstruction will play a crucial political role in Syria’s future. Despite expressing interest, Iran and Russia are unlikely to play a dominant role due to their internal and geopolitical circumstances. Given Syria’s new power dynamics, Turkey is in the most advantageous position. Turkish exports to Damascus were worth $2 billion in 2023, and given Ankara’s support for HTS, Turkey is likely to become the primary investor in reconstruction. The Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s visit to Damascus on December 22, 2024, signaled not only political-military but also economic intentions. By late January 2025, President Erdogan stated that Turkey alone could eradicate terrorist groups in Syria, implying its desire for a leading role in the country. In this context, the revival of the Turkey-Qatar gas pipeline project, first proposed in 2009 and abandoned due to political difficulties, including the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, is worth noting. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani’s visit to Damascus on January 30, 2025—the first by an Arab head of state since Assad’s fall—further underscores Qatar’s interest in Syria’s future. Apart from general discussions on post-war collaboration, Qatar provided 200 MW of electricity, with plans for gradual expansion. Another crucial issue is securing Syria’s oil supply, which was 90% dependent on Iran before deliveries ceased following Assad’s fall. Additionally, Hezbollah’s oil trafficking routes from Lebanon were bombed by Israel, forcing Syria to seek alternative sources. Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and even Iraq are being considered for this purpose. Iran evacuated its personnel from Syria shortly before the regime’s fall but remains open to cooperation with the new authorities. Iran still has significant influence through its supporters in Syria, which it can leverage to advance its interests. Although initially stating its intention to maintain good relations with Moscow, the new Syrian government has annulled Russia’s 49-year lease of the Tartus naval base. A visit by Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister to Damascus in late January failed to resolve the issue, and Russian military equipment has begun to be evacuated by sea. However, Syria will need to maintain some level of normal relations with Russia, considering their historical ties and future dependencies. Syria’s external debt to Russia exceeds $15 billion, primarily for military procurement, and its armed forces rely on Russian technology, making a shift to alternative suppliers a long-term process. Moreover, Russia’s long-standing advisory presence in Syria’s security and defense sectors remains a strategic advantage for Moscow. The U.S. has shown interest in Syria’s developments, evidenced by a State Department delegation’s visit to Damascus shortly after Assad’s fall. The U.S. maintains around 2,000 troops in northeastern Syria, supporting the SDF, a stance opposed by Turkey. After December 8, 2024, the U.S. reportedly expanded Ain al-Assad airbase in western Iraq to serve as a logistics hub for American bases in the region. Additionally, it allegedly secured agreements for three new bases in Damascus, Daraa, and Quneitra, while expanding the Hasakah base. I personally believe that the regime change in Syria was linked to the changes underway in the Washington Administration, in order to align with the new intentions of the Trump administration in the Middle East, with Syria potentially playing an important role in the security architecture envisioned by the new American administration for the region. Israel was an active participant in the evolution of the situation in Syria and took advantage of the circumstances that emerged after December 8, 2024, to carry out over 400 air strikes against Iranian targets, Hezbollah, and the Syrian military—destroying missile and ammunition depots, striking the most important points of Syria’s anti-aircraft defenses and radar installations, and sinking a large part of the Syrian military fleet. Israel justified its actions as preventive, to ensure that the respective weaponry and military equipment would not be captured by terrorists. Furthermore, immediately after December 8, it proceeded to completely occupy the heights of the Golan as well as Mount Hermon (2,814 m), the highest in the area, overlooking Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. 'It is extremely important from a strategic point of view. There is no substitute for mountains,' explained Efraim Inbar, Director of the Institute for Strategy and Security in Jerusalem (JISS). Although Israel officially declared that it would not retain these territories, I doubt that it will not, in the not-too-distant future, proclaim the annexation of the entire Golan plateau and maintain control over Mount Hermon, where it could install specialized equipment for military electronic reconnaissance (if such equipment has not already begun to be installed). At present, I do not believe that Israel has established a long-term policy towards the new regime in Syria, given the multiple possible political scenarios regarding the developments in that country. Potentially, a normalization of relations between Syria and Israel could open new economic prospects, particularly in the energy sector for Israel. Ahmad al-Sharaa and the interim government established in Damascus face particularly heavy and complex challenges both domestically and internationally. The transition period is estimated to last around three years, after which a new constitution must be approved by referendum, followed by elections in the fourth year. The issues that the new government will confront are very different from the administration of a region such as Idlib, where errors were also made. Regarding the medium- and long-term evolution of the situation in Syria, I believe it can be grouped into two main scenarios, each with several variants: either Syria remains within its current territory—with some modifications in the Golan area that will be entirely annexed by Israel—or Syria is partially or completely divided (the latter being the least likely variant), depending on the evolution of the internal situation and the negotiations between various regional powers and global actors. In the event of a division, Turkey is best positioned, as it would like to bring under its control the area in the north, from immediately north of Latakia, through Aleppo and along the Euphrates to the border with Iraq. The coastal area, where the Alawite minority is predominant, could declare independence and come under the umbrella of Moscow, thereby saving its maritime bases in the Mediterranean. Jordan, as a maximalist plan, might lay claim to expand its territory even as far as Damascus, taking into account the historical traditions of the Hashemite dynasty, or only as far as Daraa and Suwayda. This, too, will depend on developments in Gaza. Of course, Israel will take the entire Golan as well as Mount Hermon. Will Ahmad al-Sharaa, at the age of 43, be able to successfully lead Syria through the transition period and subsequent reconstruction? Determination alone is not enough; the way in which internal and external factors will interweave, as well as how he will seize emerging opportunities, will determine the final outcome of Syria’s evolution in the first half of the 21st century. IV. Brief Conclusions The fall of the Assad regime in less than a month after nearly 14 years of civil war is a clear indication that regional and global geopolitical shifts in the second quarter of the 21st century will be more significant than before. The possibility of border modifications worldwide is no longer far-fetched. In the Middle East, Israel and Turkey emerge as the main winners, though each faces internal and external challenges. Syria’s situation remains highly complex and open to various possibilities. The new government must tackle a deepening economic and social crisis while preventing a descent into factional conflict, reminiscent of Lebanon’s historical turmoil. Syria’s developments will shape new regional and global power balances, potentially becoming the new litmus test for Middle Eastern and even global geopolitics.

[3] Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is a Sunni Islamist politico-military organization that emerged in January 2017 through the merger of several Syrian Sunni opposition military factions. Previously, in 2011, HTS was known as Jabhat al-Nusra and was affiliated with Al-Qaeda. It also had ties with the Islamic State, but these affiliations were severed with the formation of HTS. The organization has been designated a terrorist group by the UN, the US, Turkey, the EU, and other states. HTS controlled the northwestern region of Syria, known as the Idlib region, as well as parts of the Aleppo area, including the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. It established a Salvation Government composed of 10 ministers. The organization has received increased support from Turkey over the past year, including drones, military instructors, and weaponry. Additionally, it benefits from support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, other Arab and non-Arab countries, and wealthy opponents of the Assad regime who have taken refuge abroad. [4] The foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey, as well as the Russian representative, participated in the Astana Process. [5] According to the Financial Times, as early as 2019, the extended Assad family purchased 19 apartments in Moscow’s modern commercial center, valued at $40 million. The US State Department estimated in 2022 that the Assad family’s wealth was approximately $2 billion, spread across numerous accounts, shell companies, real estate portfolios, and tax havens. A Syrian intelligence officer told a Turkish publication that, before his departure from Syria, Bashar al-Assad had transferred $135 billion out of the country. His eldest son, Hafez, now 22 years old, is currently preparing for his doctorate in Moscow [6] Ahmed al-Sharaa, known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani (born October 29, 1982), was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to a Syrian Sunni family from the Golan region. At the age of six, he returned with his family to Damascus. Shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he fought for three years before being captured by American forces and imprisoned in various locations from 2006 to 2011. His release coincided with the start of the Syrian civil war, during which he established the Al-Nusra Front to support Al-Qaeda's fight against Bashar al-Assad’s Ba'athist regime. In 2013, he was placed on the US State Department's terrorist list, and four years later, a $10 million reward was set for information leading to his capture. In December 2024, the reward was canceled following his meeting with a US State Department delegation visiting Damascus.On July 28, 2016, al-Sharaa announced that Al-Nusra was severing ties with Al-Qaeda and renamed the organization Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS). In January 2017, he formed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) by merging with other groups. He prioritized combating Al-Qaeda and Daesh to improve relations with the West, particularly with Turkey, and succeeded in controlling most of the Idlib region, which he governs through the Syrian Salvation Government. [7] Reports have already surfaced of summary executions of approximately 35 people in central Homs and another 10 people in the Alawite area, from which the Assad family originates.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRRTRL8PLYtsU	2025-02-16T17:20:54-08:00	
Why India Matters To Singapore – Analysis	By Fiona Raval President of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam concluded a four-day state visit to India on 18 January 2025. The first Indian tour by a Singaporean president in a decade, it commemorated the 60th anniversary of India and Singapore establishing bilateral ties. This high-level visit follows the one made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Singapore in September 2024, when the two countries elevated ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). India and Singapore have maintained amicable relations with strong economic and trade ties over the years. Singapore has been one of India’s foremost trading partners and its top Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) contributor. As of 2023-24, Singapore was India’s largest trade partner in ASEAN, with petroleum products, electronic machinery, coal, and ships being the most traded items. The two countries also have a sound defence partnership which manifests through joint drills, exercises, regular ministerial dialogues, and association in equipment manufacturing. 2024 onwards New Delhi and Singapore have seen a still further uptick in bilateral ties. From a Singaporean perspective, this growing partnership results from a combination of national and regional considerations that reflect its evolving strategic interests. What are the specific factors driving this robustness? Bilateral Incentives India-Singapore ties are primarily based on trade, commerce, and people-to-people linkages. In 2023-24, bilateral trade reached around US$ 35.62 billion. The annual compound growth rate of total trading volume since 2019-20 has been around 10.75 per cent, with the balance in Singapore’s favour. This relationship has been facilitated by the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), a Free Trade Agreement signed in 2005. The CECA reduces tariffs, protects FDI, and boosts market access. Additionally, it enhances cooperation in areas like knowledge-sharing, education, and skill-building, while also easing visa restrictions and recognising qualifications to allow easier exchange of professional talent. The relationship recently progressed to a CSP following CECA’s success. This endeavour reaffirms existing collaborations but also opens doors to new and emerging areas like healthcare, semiconductors, digital technologies, and sustainability. There is also hope that the CSP can help address the problem of reduced FDI flow into India. Although Singapore is the top contributor, its overall investments have seen sharp decline in the past year. Collaborative skill development and exchange of skilled labour further strengthens bilateral relations between India and Singapore. Singapore has long depended on foreign workers due to its small population size and shortage of native manpower. As of 2024, around 6,50,00 Indians were living in Singapore. Indians are a major source of the low wage migrant workforce in Singapore, with Indian Employment Pass holders nearly doubling between 2005 and 2021. This workforce also contributes to the rising demand of finance and tech-centric jobs at multinational companies that have set up shop in Singapore. Without this labour, the Singaporean economy, which depends on multinational corporations for 73 per cent of its corporate tax, would take a significant hit. This is why technical education and skill development are important areas of collaboration. In fact Singapore has associated with several Indian states for such initiatives, such as setting up the North-East Skill Centre in Guwahati, Assam, and the World Skill Centre in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. These efforts allow Singapore to capitalise on India’s demographic dividend by making people more employable. For example, the winners of the Singapore India Hackathon were incentivised by potential job opportunities at the Singaporean DSB Bank. While advantageous to its economy, the rise in foreign workers has also caused strains within Singapore. Singaporean natives have grown to resent foreigners for allegedly stealing professional opportunities. Indians face racial and xenophobic abuse in Singapore, where ‘CECA’ is used as a slur for Indian workers. In the absence of punitive action, the discrimination has not stemmed. The Singaporean government has however made statements saying that this nature of abuse won’t be tolerated, that economic agreements, including the CECA, don’t grant favour for employment. Singapore’s ongoing investments in Indian skill-building and the induction of Indians into its workforce underscore how vital this sector is to its economy. On the flipside, local hostility towards foreign workers from India continues to be a significant concern, though the Indian government is yet to raise the issue with Singaporean counterparts. Regional Drivers As a small country, Singapore’s success and stability depend on its partnerships and ability to adapt to major power competition. Despite Singapore’s longstanding and meaningful relations with both the US and China as well as deft attempts to walk the foreign policy tightrope, some problems persist. Regional flux has manifested in the form of protectionist trade practices, which create exclusion and hurt Southeast Asian economies. It has also increased competition in areas of key and emerging technologies. Always a proponent of regional collaboration, Singapore has highlighted the need to create diverse multilateral partnerships so as to not get caught in geopolitical crossfire. Singapore has adapted to the flux created by major power competition by diversifying and strengthening other relationships. In this light, expanding areas of collaboration with India is a strategic move to create dependable ecosystems in the region. For example, the India-Singapore semiconductor deal tries to bridge supply chain gaps created post the COVID-19 pandemic and to insulate from the impacts of China's stance against Taiwan. This not only adjusts to regional changes but also creates new opportunities by giving Singapore greater market access. Other areas of collaboration include setting up a green energy corridor to cooperate on critical and emerging technologies. This will achieve India and Singapore’s joint goal of sustainable development, and facilitate greater visibility for Singapore as a regional lead in clean technology. As a strong supporter of multilateralism, Singapore had thrown its weight behind ASEAN’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). India’s sudden decision to opt out of RCEP negotiations in 2019 was thus met with concern. This concern was reportedly exacerbated when India was perceived as repositioning itself away from ASEAN. Singapore’s strategic position as a gateway to Southeast Asia plays a key role in ensuring ASEAN remains a priority for India. Given the unceasing crisis in Myanmar, this partnership as well as India’s active involvement in ASEAN become even more urgent. New Delhi and Singapore have significant investments and economic interests in Myanmar and share a common goal of maintaining peace in the ASEAN region. India’s participation is needed for developing a comprehensive and durable solution to the crisis, especially when ASEAN’s 5-point consensus has failed to make a difference. India’s Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that Myanmar was a topic of discussion during this presidential visit. Conclusion In their 60 years of partnership India and Singapore have maintained steadfast relations. The past year has seen a positive escalation in the relationship, with a deepening of ties through a blend of bilateral and regional strategic considerations. Bilaterally, CECA has helped further bolster trade and economic linkages and opened new pathways to cooperation, such as digital technologies. While racial tensions are an active concern, the high volume of labour and expertise flowing into Singapore also emphasises a critical interdependency. Regionally, Singapore's efforts to diversify partnerships due to major power competition further drive its engagement with India. This new phase in their partnership is not just to foster mutual growth and stability but is an acknowledgement of shifting global dynamics and an effort to navigate them jointly.

Sri Lanka Struggles To Deliver A New Era Of Post-Crisis Growth – ...	By Ganeshan Wignaraja Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) government, led by the charismatic President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, entered office in late 2024 at a turning point in the country’s economic history. Sri Lanka experienced its worst post-independence economic crisis in 2022–23. While the economy is now stabilising, the challenges are far from over. The new government is struggling to balance economic growth with debt sustainability. Sri Lanka’s economic outlook offers cause for cautious optimism. The combination of prudent monetary and financial stability policy by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, fiscal policy reforms, a US$3 billion International Monetary Fund program and US$4 billion of Indian assistance appears to have steadied the economy after severe macroeconomic turbulence. A debt restructuring deal of US$17.5 billion reached with private bondholders and China gave Sri Lanka the breathing room it desperately needed, while earnings from tourism have accelerated, contributing to the recovery of foreign exchange reserves. The October 2024 World Bank growth forecasts point to growth slowing from a forecast 4.4 per cent in 2024 to 3.5 per cent in 2025. Despite a stabilising economy, over half the country’s population is experiencing what the UNDP terms multidimensional vulnerability to their standard of living. While the economic outlook is positive, there are risks that the new government will need to tackle head-on. One of the most pressing issues is the outflow of skilled professionals. Sri Lanka has seen a significant brain drain with over 300,000 people leaving Sri Lanka for foreign employment in 2024 alone. The country faces an ever-shrinking talent pool — talent which is desperately needed to propel growth. The newly elected parliament has little experience, as the country struggles with the repercussions of the brain drain. Of the 225 members of parliament, about 150 are untested first-term representatives. This raises questions about whether Sri Lanka’s politicians have the legislative and technical capacity needed to enact the economic reforms Sri Lanka so desperately needs. The government will need to focus on improving service delivery, retaining key talent within the state sector and developing expertise in governance and public administration. Sri Lanka will have to rejuvenate the elite cadre of the civil service by establishing a top-quality public policy school akin to The Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy or France’s Sciences Po. Tourism — which has long been a critical sector for Sri Lanka — is showing strong recovery, with significant potential to boost foreign exchange reserves and spur growth. Over 2 million touristsvisited Sri Lanka in 2024, a 38 per cent increase over 2023. But the government has to do more to ensure that the tourism industry is sustainable and its economic benefits extend beyond the capital, Colombo. Marketing Sri Lanka as a multicultural destination, coupled with targeted development of less-visited regions in the north and east of the country and small tourism businesses, will help create a more balanced and decentralised tourism industry. Fiscal sustainability is one of the most contentious issues facing the new government. While revenue has increased due to higher taxation, further reducing government spending and exposure to corruption risks are powerful means of reducing fiscal imbalances. Despite ruling out privatisation, the government plans to turn around state-owned enterprises through better management. But some of the larger loss-making state-owned enterprises — such as SriLankan Airlines and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation — should be reconsidered for privatisation or restructuring, as their drain on public funds threatens Sri Lanka’s long-term fiscal stability. With the support of international financial institutions, the government should pursue a strategy that right-sizes the state, encourages private-sector growth and ensures fiscal health in the coming years. Sri Lanka’s foreign policy choices are vexed. The geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific are dramatically changing after US President Donald Trump resumed office, with India emerging as a key player in Sri Lanka’s economic future. The government must strengthen economic ties with India and its southern states, ensuring that Sri Lanka benefits from Indian investments and partnerships. President Dissanayake will have to live up to his promises of non-interference in India’s security concerns, particularly given China’s increasing commercial presence in Sri Lanka. President Dissanayake’s visit to India in December 2024 was a promising foundation for stronger bilateral relations. The government must now focus on making concrete progress, particularly in business-to-business links, digitisation, cross-border energy projects and the deeper bilateral free trade agreement now under negotiation. Sri Lanka faces a serious risk of having to make capital repayments on its external debt in mid-2027 if it cannot increase its foreign exchange reserves through trade-led growth. In partnership with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, India should stand ready to help if Sri Lanka falters a second time. The new Sri Lankan government will need a comprehensive growth plan that addresses both immediate risks and long-term opportunities. Navigating these choppy waters will require pragmatic leadership, bold policy decisions and a clear vision for Sri Lanka’s future prosperity. The publication of the national budget in mid-February 2025 will provide important insights into the NPP administration’s economic plans.

Spring Is In The Air In US-Russia Ties As Trump’s Revolution Gain...	What emerges from the dramatic happenings of the past week is that the 3-year chronicle of US-Russia rivalry and the NATO’s proxy war in Ukraine was a crisis engineered with great deliberation by the Anglo-American nexus per a pernicious agenda conceived by the neocon liberals wedded to globalism ensconced in the Washington and London establishment to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. In less than a month since President Donald Trump returned to Oval Office, in a series of bold moves, he began dismantling the Iron Wall that descended on Central Europe. Its impact is already visible, as communication channels with Moscow have been flung open, as evident in the new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Saturday and their agreement to meet at delegation level in Saudi Arabia next week. The Trump administration will allow the resumption of normal diplomatic work as well as discuss the early return of diplomatic properties unilaterally seized by the Obama – Biden administrations in wanton acts of motiveless malignity and hubris, in violation of Vienna accords. Trust Russia to reciprocate! The downstream salience of the readouts in Moscow and Washington, here and here, on the Rubio-Lavrov phone conversation is the mutual agreement between the two leaderships — Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin — for US-Russian interactive exchanges at various levels is being followed through with a view to improve bilateral relations as well as 'on key international issues, including the situation in Ukraine, developments in Palestine and the broader Middle East, as well as other regional matters.' Furthermore, a team designated by the White House comprising apart from Rubio, the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and the president’s Middle East envoy (who also works on Ukraine-Russia issues) Steve Witkoff will meet a Russian team led by Lavrov as early as this week ahead. The inclusion of Witkoff, a ‘result-oriented’, pushy negotiator and old friend of Trump is particularly interesting. Witkoff flew into Moscow for an unpublicised solo visit last week, which appears to have been productive. Clearly, Trump has drawn lessons from this first term and is determined not to get emasculated again in the Washington ‘swamp’. This is where Witkoff comes in. Trump’s approach and political style is utterly fascinating. Trump began shifting gear no sooner than he managed to put together a team of like-minded people who are 'loyalists' to head the Justice Department, Pentagon, the Treasury, etc. — and, importantly, to forcefully regenerate the authority of the attorney general and the national intelligence agency to serve his agenda. Thus, in the final analysis, it is immaterial that his administration is packed with pro-Israel figures or has a sprinkling of hardliners on China. For, it is Trump who will call the shots. Surprises could be in store in policy twists and turns. This should already give sleepless nights to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu whom Trump has sensitised apropos his intention to improve relations with Iran. To my mind, Trump may not even follow through his dramatic announcement of 'taking over' Gaza, et al. The pattern appearing with regard to relations with Russia is that Trump levels with Putin first and passes down decisions to the state department and other agencies to follow through. Equally, the mechanism of summitry is being revived as the locomotive of big power relations. There is already talk of Trump holding summit meetings with Putin in Saudi Arabia and with Xi Jinping. Trump will likely look for a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at some point. Such an approach necessitates cutting down the role and influence of the Deep State which had throttled Trump’s presidency through the 2016-2020 period. The challenge facing Trump is formidable, given the nexus between the Democratic Party and the Deep State, and the mischief potential of mainstream media which is largely under their control and hostile towards Trump. In a glaring instance this week, Wall Street Journal deliberately misrepresented certain remarks by Vice-President JD Vance to vitiate the air in the nascent US-Russia tango. According to the story, Vance allegedly stated that the US might use economic and military leverage against Russia, and the option of sending the US military to Ukraine 'remains under consideration' in case Moscow refuses to resolve the conflict in good faith. Moscow immediately sought clarification and a rebuttal had to be issued by Vance himself to set the record straight. Vance wrote on X: 'The fact that the WSJ twisted my words in the way they did for this story is absurd, but not surprising considering they have spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas.' Trump has repeatedly expressed distrust of US intelligence agencies. According to CNN, all employees (approx. 22,000 people) at the CIA have received letters whereby they are given two options: to continue his/her service without guarantees of job retention in the future or to leave under the so-called deferred dismissal program at own request, while retaining salary and additional preferences until end-September. Interestingly, a code was sewn inside these letters that tracks the re-sending of the letter by the recipient, as a guarantee against leaks which was the practice used when dismissing employees of the former Twitter after its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk, who is now considered one of Trump’s closest advisers and heads the quasi-Department of Government Efficiency overseeing the reduction of federal government! Again, the disbandment of USAID, which traditionally worked as the 'B Team' of the CIA to promote colour revolutions and regime changes, etc. can also be seen in the light. According to Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Institute of USA and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who closely studies this topic, Trump has declared war on CIA, which he blames for his electoral defeat in 2020. Vasiliev estimates that so far, the fight against the deep state in foreign and domestic intelligence is proceeding steadily, but will now 'accelerate' with the confirmation of former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for the post of head of national intelligence, and Kash Patel for the post of FBI director. On the other hand, the Delhi grapevine, which is dominated by fellow travellers of the defunct Biden regime is that Deep State will ultimately have the last laugh and Trump may not even be allowed to complete his 4-year term. But to my mind, that is wishful thinking. Trump’s grit should not be underestimated. Nor the seamless resources and tools at his command to queer the pitch of the disarray within the Democratic Party, which traditionally provided the requisite political cover for the Deep State. There is, conceivably, a method in Trump’s provocative moves, with some able help from Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, to stir up the pot in European politics, including Germany and Britain, who constitute the high ground of Euro-atlanticism in the continent, which serves to prevent a coalescing of liberal-globalist cliques within the transatlantic system. Patel has hinted that sufficient incriminating evidence of misuse of power is available to damn the Old Guard all the way up to Biden himself. Trump cannot be unaware of the high importance of pre-empting a Democratic backlash. The federal judges in Democrat-ruled states are openly challenging Trump’s methods. Suffice to say, Trump’s credibility to entrap the Old Guard in a cobweb of protracted litigation will be a game changer. The latest poll shows that Trump enjoys a soaring 77% support for cleaning up the swamp. The optic of this crusade is going to be hugely consequential to Trump’s ability to push both his domestic and foreign policy programme.

Trudeau: What Went Wrong, And What Lies Ahead For Canada? – OpEd	By Julia Taleb When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office in 2015, he ushered in a wave of optimism, diversity and inclusivity. His charisma and vision propelled the Liberal Party from third place to a majority government. Trudeau promised a progressive agenda centered on climate action, gender equality and reconciliation with indigenous peoples — a stark departure from the policies of his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. Nearly a decade later, Trudeau’s popularity has steadily declined. While he did fulfill some campaign promises, he fell short on others, and some backfired, leading to a gradual decline in public trust. Economic challenges, internal party divisions and a series of controversies gradually destabilized both Trudeau and the Liberal Party. His resignation announcement on January 6 marked the culmination of years of dissatisfaction. The economic toll A key factor in Trudeau’s decline was his government’s inability to address the economic anxieties of ordinary Canadians. Housing affordability became a crisis, with skyrocketing prices and limited inventory in urban centers. Despite government measures such as theFirst-Time Home Buyer Incentive, Trudeau failed to address structural housing issues. Canada’s inflation rate peaked at 6.8% in 2022 before gradually declining, while GDP growth languished at 1.3%. Economic uncertainty, driven by external trade tensions and domestic policy shortcomings, further fueled voter frustrations. Under Trudeau’s leadership, Canada experienced its worst economic growth in recent history, with annual per-person GDP growth averaging just 0.3%. Trudeau’s government overspent, leading to a deficit of $61.9 billion for the 2023–2024 fiscal year, far exceeding the target of $40.1 billion. This fiscal shortfall raised concerns about the government’s ability to meet its financial commitments. The final blow came in December 2024 when Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland resigned over disagreements about economic management and the government’s response to US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports. This move could raise prices for consumers and businesses, trigger retaliatory measures by Canada and lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth in both countries. Freeland’s resignation exposed deep divisions within the party and signaled a loss of confidence in Trudeau’s ability to lead effectively. In the weeks before his resignation, Trudeau faced mounting internal pressure as multiple Liberal members of parliament (MPs) publicly called for his departure, citing concerns about his leadership and the party’s future. For instance, Ontario MP Chad Collins stated that the Liberal caucus was 'not united' on Trudeau’s continued leadership, suggesting the party needed a new vision. These internal divisions, combined with declining public support, left Trudeau with little choice but to step down. In his resignation announcement, he cited 'internal battles' as a distraction, stating that Canada 'deserved a real choice in the next election.' Public perception and scandals Controversies marred Trudeau’s tenure and undermined public trust. In 2019, reports revealed that Trudeau’s office had pressured then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a major Canadian engineering firm facing corruption charges for allegedly bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau’s office sought to secure a deferred prosecution agreement for the company, allowing it to avoid a criminal trial. The ethics commissioner concluded that Trudeau had violated federal conflict of interest rules by attempting to influence the legal proceedings. Another major case was Trudeau’s approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, designed to transport oil from Alberta to British Columbia. It sparked widespread criticism from environmentalists and Indigenous groups, who cited concerns over oil spills and its environmental impact. The approval contradicted Trudeau’s earlier commitments to both environmental sustainability and Indigenous reconciliation, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Trudeau initially saw a surge in popularity due to his steady communication and swift government support programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. However, his popularity waned as the pandemic dragged on, particularly during the Freedom Convoy protests in early 2022. These demonstrations, sparked by vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers, evolved into broader opposition to government restrictions, leading to blockades in downtown Ottawa and key trade routes like the Ambassador Bridge. Trudeau’s response, including invoking the Emergencies Act, was divisive — praised by some as necessary to restore order but criticized by others as government overreach. What lies ahead for Canada? Trudeau’s resignation marks the end of an era in Canadian politics that began with immense promise but ended with significant challenges and disillusionment. The Liberal Party must now grapple with internal divisions, voter fatigue and a growing appetite for change as they prepare for the next federal election. Two key candidates have emerged: former Finance Minister Chrystia Freelandand former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. They signal a potential shift toward a more fiscally conservative and economically pragmatic approach. Freeland brings political experience, a strong party base and a proven track record as deputy prime minister and finance minister. However, she must overcome Trudeau’s legacy and the public’s growing frustration with the party. On the other hand, Carney offers a fresh alternative with strong economic expertise and a reputation as a global leader on climate and fiscal policy that may appeal to centrists and dissatisfied Liberals. However, his lack of political experience and grassroots support are key obstacles. Currently, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, known for his populist approach, is leading in the polls. His rise suggests a potential shift towards more conservative policies, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the status quo rather than a definitive embrace of conservatism. Poilievre’s focus on reducing inflation and increasing housing affordability has also resonated with Canadians seeking practical solutions to everyday challenges. The Liberal Party’s choice of leader will determine whether they can regain public trust or risk further decline. The next election will not only define the country’s political trajectory but also test the resilience of the Liberal Party’s legacy. The convergence of political shifts, trade uncertainties and economic challenges suggests a complex path ahead of Canada. Whether Canadians embrace new leadership, reject the Liberal brand altogether or simply seek change, one thing is clear: The decisions made in the coming months will shape the nation’s future for years to come.

Turkmenistan: Second Conscientious Objector Sentenced To Correcti...	By Felix Corley A second Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector is serving a corrective labour sentence, where the state takes a fifth of his wages. On 27 January, a Dashoguz Region court sentenced 20-year-old Agabek Rozbayew to 18 months' corrective labour. The indictment shows he informed the Military Conscription Office in September 2022 that he could not perform compulsory military service on grounds of conscience. More than 10 others appear to be under criminal investigation. An assistant to regime-appointed Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa told Forum 18: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow is paralysed in prison hospital. On 27 January, Shabat District Court in the north-eastern Dashoguz Region sentenced 20-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Agabek Rozbayew to one year and six months' corrective labour. This means that while he does not have to go to prison, he must pay the State 20 per cent of his salary from his employment during that period. Rozbayew did not appeal and the verdict has entered into force, a court official told Forum 18. Rozbayew's verdict marks the second time since December 2024 that a court has convicted a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector for refusing compulsory military service. On 18 December 2024, the regime imposed a punishment on a conscientious objector for the first known time since 2021, when 16 jailed conscientious objectors were freed under amnesty (see below). On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed down the maximum two-year jail term to 21-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Arslan Wepayew. On 7 January 2025, Mary Regional Court changed his sentence on appeal to two years' corrective labour (see below). 'We are deeply concerned that this is the second criminal case against a conscientious objector in recent times,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. 'We are greatly saddened that, after a brief period of calm since May 2021, Turkmenistan has resumed prosecuting and imprisoning conscientious objectors, in violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it acceded on 1 May 1997. The government has consistently ignored the UN Human Rights Committee's Views censuring Turkmenistan for violating the ICCPR and obligating it to provide a genuine alternative civilian service not under military command' (see below). More than 10 other Jehovah's Witness conscientious objectors appear to be under criminal investigation, Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from the capital Ashgabat: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Asked why young men who cannot perform military service on grounds of conscience cannot perform an alternative civilian service, the assistant responded: 'I'm not a lawyer. I need to clarify this' (see below). Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, did not answer his phone each time Forum 18 called (see below). Since autumn 2022, Rozbayew has repeatedly received summonses to appear at the Military Conscription Office. 'Each time he was summoned, he respectfully explained his Bible-based beliefs and why he refused to perform military service,' Jehovah's Witnesses noted (see below). On 20 December 2024, the Prosecutor's Office summoned Rozbayew. Officials told him verbally that a criminal case had been initiated against him. On 6 January 2025, Shabat District Prosecutor's Office issued the indictment against him. The indictment – seen by Forum 18 - quotes Wepa Cholukow of Shabat District Military Conscription Office confirming that when Rozbayew was first called up in September 2022, the young man had told officials that his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness do not allow him to serve in the military (see below). Rozbayew's older brother Rasul was twice sentenced for refusing military service on grounds of conscience (see below). The 51-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow remains in poor health in strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is one of five readers of the works of the late Muslim theologian Said Nursi jailed for 12 years in 2017. Three of the group are also held in the same labour camp (see below). 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 in January. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' His family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored' (see below). When in January Forum 18 asked an official at Labour Camp MR-E/16 – who did not give his name – about Shamyradow's poor health, the official put the phone down (see below). Shamyradow remains paralysed in prison hospital. 'He lies in bed,' the individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 on 12 February (see below). Asked why individuals like Shamyradow and the other Muslims have been jailed on long sentences, the assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Gurbannazarowa told Forum 18: 'I need to clarify this.' He declined to answer any other questions (see below). The 42-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Bahram Saparow is also held in Labour Camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is being punished for leading a Muslim study group in the eastern city of Turkmenabat. The regime arrested and jailed more than 60 of the group's participants from 2013. At least three are known to have died in prison of torture or neglect. At least four others are known to have been freed after completing their sentences. No alternative to compulsory military service Turkmenistan offers no alternative to its compulsory military service. Military service for men between the ages of 18 and 27 is generally two years. Article 58 of the 2016 Constitution describes defence as a 'sacred duty' of everyone and states that military service is compulsory for men. Young men who refuse military service on grounds of conscience generally face prosecution under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. (Article 241 replaced the almost identically-worded Article 219 when the new Criminal Code came into force on 1 January 2023.) Turkmenistan has ignored repeated international calls, for example by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, to introduce a genuine civilian alternative to compulsory military service, to stop prosecuting and punishing conscientious objectors, and to compensate those it has punished. The UN Human Rights Committee has published 14 Decisions in favour of 16 conscientious objectors from Turkmenistan, all of them Jehovah's Witnesses. The most recent – in March 2022 – was in the case of Arslan Begenchow (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses filed a complaint with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in May 2020 on behalf of 19 then-current or former jailed conscientious objectors. Legally-binding international human rights obligations The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted that conscientious objection to military service comes under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 18 ('Freedom of thought, conscience and religion') and has recognised 'the right of everyone to have conscientious objection to military service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.' The OHCHR has also noted in its Conscientious Objection to Military Service guide that Article 18 is 'a non-derogable right .. even during times of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.' In 2022 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated (WGAD-HRC50) that 'the right to conscientious objection to military service is part of the absolutely protected right to hold a belief under article 18 (1) of the Covenant [the ICCPR], which cannot be restricted by States.' The Working Group also stated: 'States should refrain from imprisoning individuals solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to military service, and should release those that have been so imprisoned.' It added: 'All States should adopt appropriate legislative or other measures to ensure that conscientious objector status is recognized.' Second conscientious objector corrective labour sentence Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Agabek Ruslanowich Rozbayew (born 1 October 2004) is from a village in Shabat District of the north-eastern Dashoguz Region. He refused military service when first called up in autumn 2022 and on subsequent occasions, most recently on 9 December 2024. He explained to Shabat District Military Conscription Office why on grounds of conscience he could not take up arms and swear the military oath. Jehovah's Witnesses are conscientious objectors to military service and do not undertake any kind of activity supporting any country's military. But they are willing to undertake an alternative, totally civilian form of service, as is the right of all conscientious objectors to military service under international human rights law. On 19 December 2024, the Military Conscription Office sent Rozbayew's case to Shabat District Prosecutor's Office, which launched a preliminary investigation and questioned witnesses. On 6 January, prosecutors issued the indictment against Rozbayew. Deputy Prosecutor R. Rozymuradow prepared the indictment, which was counter-signed by District Prosecutor Shyly Pellayew. They brought charges against Rozbayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'), according to the indictment seen by Forum 18. This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. 'The Holy Scriptures that Jehovah's Witnesses read state that one must not take up arms and participate in war, nor take a military oath,' the indictment quotes Rozbayew as telling investigators. The indictment quotes Wepa Cholukow of Shabat District Military Conscription Office confirming that on 9 September 2022, when Rozbayew was first called up, the young man had told officials that his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness do not allow him to serve in the military. Rozbayew tried to challenge the opening of the criminal case in court. Forum 18 was unable to reach Shabat District Military Conscription Office or the Prosecutor's Office. Rozbayew's older brother Rasul was convicted twice for refusing military service on grounds of conscience. Niyazov District Court sentenced him for a second time to two years' imprisonment on 16 March 2021. He was freed under the general amnesty on 8 May 2021. On 27 January, Shabat District Court convicted Rozbayew. The Judge sentenced him to one year and six months' corrective labour. 'He has been given the written decision,' a court official – who did not give his name - told Forum 18 on 12 February. This means that while he does not have to go to prison, he must pay the State 20 per cent of his salary from his employment during that period. Rozbayew did not appeal and the verdict has entered into force, the court official added. Under the Criminal Implementation Code, those serving a corrective labour sentence live at home but are assigned to a place of work. They must report any change of address or place of work within 10 days, and must report to the authorities twice a month. The place of work is responsible for making the deductions from earnings and handing the money to the state. Jehovah's Witnesses 'deeply concerned' over second criminal case 'We are deeply concerned that this is the second criminal case against a conscientious objector in recent times,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. 'We are greatly saddened that, after a brief period of calm since May 2021, Turkmenistan has resumed prosecuting and imprisoning conscientious objectors, in violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it acceded on 1 May 1997. The government has consistently ignored the UN Human Rights Committee's Views censuring Turkmenistan for violating the ICCPR and obligating it to provide a genuine alternative civilian service not under military command' An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from the capital Ashgabat on 13 February that she was out of the office. Asked why two conscientious objectors have been sentenced to corrective labour, the assistant responded: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Asked why young men who cannot perform military service on grounds of conscience cannot perform an alternative civilian service, the assistant responded: 'I'm not a lawyer. I need to clarify this.' Gurbannazarowa's annual report for 2023 – her most recent available – makes no mention of any attempts to introduce an alternative civilian service for those who cannot serve in the military on grounds of conscience. Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, did not answer his phone each time Forum 18 called on 13 February. Court jails conscientious objector for two years Arslan Wepayew (born 7 February 2003) is a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector from Bayramaly, Mary Region, east of the capital Ashgabat. In October 2024, the Military Conscription Office ordered Wepayew to report for military service on 19 December 2024. On 17 October, he submitted a written statement of conscientious objection to military service 'based on sincere religious beliefs', Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. He made clear to the Military Conscription Office that he was prepared to undertake alternative civilian service. On 19 October, prosecutors opened a criminal case against Wepayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Formal charges were laid on 31 October 2024, but prosecutors did not inform Wepayew. Officials took him into custody on 13 November. On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed Wepayew the maximum two-year jail term under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Wepayew appealed against his conviction. Sentence changed to corrective labour On 7 January 2025, a panel of three judges at Mary Regional Court heard Arslan Wepayew's appeal. The court changed his sentence to two years' corrective labour, with 20 per cent of his earnings to be taken by the regime. This is the maximum corrective labour punishment under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service') Wepayew was then released from the detention centre, where he had been held since November 2024. Forum 18 is unaware of any previous cases where a conscientious objector's jail sentence was changed on appeal to corrective labour, However, from 2014 courts punished conscientious objectors with corrective labour or suspended prison terms, rather than imprisonment. However, jailings resumed in January 2018. In May 2021, the regime freed all the 16 then-jailed known conscientious objectors. This was the first known criminal conviction of a conscientious objector in Turkmenistan since May 2021, when the last 16 imprisoned conscientious objectors – all of them Jehovah's Witness young men - were released under a general amnesty. UN Committee notes regime's failure to implement 2022 decision On 4 November 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reviewed implementation of its March 2022 decision in the case of another former jailed Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector, Arslan Begenchow. The Committee had found that the regime had violated his human rights (CCPR/C/134/D/3272/2018). In February 2023, Begenchow's lawyer had noted that neither he nor Begenchow 'were aware of any steps taken by the State party to implement the Committee's Views'. The UN Committee's November 2024 progress report on individual communications (CCPR/C/142/2) reviewed how the regime had responded to the Committee's three key recommendations:- Expunging Begenchow's criminal record;- Providing Begenchow with adequate compensation, including by reimbursing any legal costs he has incurred;- Non-repetition, including by reviewing the legislation of the State party with a view to ensuring the effective guarantee of the right to conscientious objection under Article 18 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 'for instance by providing for the possibility of alternative service of a civilian nature'. In all three provisions, the UN Committee found: 'Information or measures taken are contrary to or reflect rejection of the recommendation.' The Committee noted: 'One Expert noted there was no convincing evidence that the State party had contemplated compensation of any kind to [Begenchow].' The Committee decided: 'Close the follow-up dialogue, with a note of unsatisfactory implementation of the Committee's recommendation.' Paralysed religious prisoner of conscience 'lies in bed' in prison hospital Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow (born 7 May 1973) is one of five Sunni Muslims punished for meeting with others to pray and study their faith using the works of the late Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi. The authorities arrested the group in May and June 2017. On 15 August 2017, Balkan Regional Court in the regional capital Balkanabat in western Turkmenistan sentenced the five men to 12-year jail terms each in strict regime labour camps. The court ordered that religious literature, mobile phones and cash be seized from them. The Supreme Court in Ashgabat refused on 11 July 2018 to overturn the 12-year strict-regime jail terms imposed on the five prisoners of conscience. Four of the five - Shamyradow, Meret Hydyrowich Owezow, Ahmet Bayramberdiyewich Mammetdurdyyew and Begejik Begejikow – initially served their sentences in the isolated top-security prison at Ovadan-Depe (Picturesque Hill) in the Karakum desert 70 kms (45 miles) north of Ashgabat. They were transferred in mid-2022 to the strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 on the north-eastern edge of Bayramaly in Mary Region, where they remain. The fifth member of the group, Jumanazar Yuldashowich Hojambetow, is being held in the labour camp BL-E/6 in Balkan Region. The camp houses former police officers and other former officials. 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 in January. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' In view of his poor health, Shamyradow's family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored,' the individual told Forum 18. The duty officer at Labour Camp MR-E/16 put Forum 18 through on 8 January to a colleague. When Forum 18 asked about Shamyradow's poor health, the official – who did not give his name – put the phone down. Shamyradow remains paralysed in prison hospital. 'He lies in bed,' the individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 on 12 February. An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from Ashgabat on 13 February that she was out of the office. Asked why individuals like Shamyradow and the other Muslims have been jailed on long sentences, the assistant responded: 'I need to clarify this.' He declined to answer any other questions.

In Syria, The Barbarians Aren’t At The Gate, They’re In Power Wit...	Atrocities are being committed every day in Syria by the new rulers, according to Irish writer and peace activist Declan Hayes. However, the Western corporate-run media are ignoring or censoring the horrific reality because the Western governments backed the regime-change operation. He says that Syria – a cradle of civilization – is now being ruled by barbarians with the tacit support of Western governments and media. The population is living under a reign of terror because the new rulers are terrorists affiliated with Islamic State who espouse an extremist version of Islam that does not tolerate other religions or versions of Islam. Declan Hayes visited Syria as a peace activist and humanitarian many times during the decade-long war in that country. He witnessed the aftermath of atrocities carried out by insurgent groups in Latakia, Kassab, and Maaloula, among other places. These mercenary groups were proxy forces financed and armed by the United States and its Western allies in a covert war for regime change against the former Syrian government. The reasons for the regime-change operation were geopolitical due to the West’s support for Israel and antagonism towards Russia and Iran, as well as control of oil and gas resources. Hayes maintains close contact with religious leaders and other community figures in Syria, especially among the Alawite, Christian and Shia Muslim communities. He says that the appalling violence and killings that were carried out by the Western-backed terror proxies during the decade-long war are continuing to be inflicted today. Homes and villages are raided daily by armed supporters of Syria’s new ruling regime led by the de facto president, Ahmed al Sharaa, also known as Mohammad al Jolani, who is the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia. HTS was formerly an affiliate of Islamic State and other Al Qaeda-linked terror networks. HTS seized power two months ago in Damascus after former President Bashar al-Assad fled the country with his family. Assad is living in exile in Russia. The collapse of his government surprised the world but in many ways, it shouldn’t have been a surprise because Syria was worn down and destroyed by a 10-year war sponsored by the U.S., European powers, Israel and the Gulf Arab kingdoms. The country was also devastated by crippling Western economic sanctions. Assad’s allies, Russia and Iran, could not prevent the collapse and takeover by the Western terrorist proxies. Syria is facing an extremely dangerous future where the new regime is exacting brutal retribution against minorities and communities perceived as being loyal to Assad. What makes the situation all the more grim is that the United States and European Union governments and their media are propping up the new regime, whitewashing its violations and its terrorist links, or simply ignoring the daily atrocities being inflicted. However, Declan Hayes contends that the new rulers of Syria do not have a firm control over the country where resistance to the reign of terror is growing.

Was The AI Summit In Paris A Missed Opportunity? – OpEd	By Simone Galimberti Since the start of the Paris AI Action Summit, held on the 10th and 11th of February, the expectations were minimal. Yet there was a trickle of hope that the gathering would succeed at maintaining a modicum focus on safety and security of artificial intelligence. Instead, the speeches resembled more business pitches. There was a deliberate intent at attracting billions of investments to spur the unlimited potential of a new technology that has already become so pervasive to our lives. Those at the Summit, concerned with the implications of an unregulated and unchecked AI could not find neither a glimpse of a symbolic traffic light nor of a guardrail, two images often invoked to slow down the crazy pace of AI development. Instead, in the words of Kevin Rose of the New York Times, it was like 'watching policymakers on horseback trying to install seatbelts on a passing Lamborghini'. Many wondered if there was a real intention, on the part of the policymakers in questions, to seriously set any standards at all. Watching their speeches, each of them, from JD Vance, the new American Vice President, to the European Commission’s President, Ursula Von der Leyen, to President Macron of France to PM Modi of India, it seems like they were trying to outmatch each other. It was like every single of them was trying to outperform the competitors, all generously offering free passes to the 'racing circuit' of AI development. Only UN Secretary-General António Guterres tried with his speech, to take the moral high ground. He remembered the audience of the high risks of a race to the bottom in developing and deploying AI tools that humanity, sooner than later, might lose control of. Wide gap Yet, at the same time, I can’t possibly imagine of a wider gap between the key messages emerged from the leaders and the discussions on the sidelines of the big speeches. Lots of cross cutting discussions related to the transformational shifts posed by artificial intelligence indeed took place. Listening to the pro business talks by the political leaders, it comes easy to dismiss the fact that the whole initiative was grounded over five underlying central pillars of absolute importance. Indeed, talking and tackling issues like Public Interest AI, The Future of Work, Innovation and Culture, Trust in AI and Global AI Governance, the key themes at Paris, remains central to ensure that the AI can be truly a force for good, rather than a force for self-destruction. But, as anticipated, these complex discussions were inevitably overshadowed by the political impetus of harnessing the business potential of the AI revolution. The United Nations, despite immense efforts over the last few years, to lead a global conversation on ethical AI development, appeared powerless, unable to steer the conversation. This happened despite the engagement in Paris not only of the Secretary General but also of active presence of Mr. Amandeep Singh Gill, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology. It is not that the two final outcomes of the Summit, the Paris Charter on Artificial Intelligence in the Public Interest and Statement on Inclusive and Sustainable Artificial Intelligence for People and the Planet, did not contain some references to the ethical imperatives that comes with AI. But even a sympathetic reading of them cannot flip the narrative of an agenda brazenly centered on deregulating the rollout of AI. Then how counter such intentional purpose of doing whatever it takes to incentivize the rushing to develop Artificial General Intelligence, a technology that, at minimum, will equal human capacities and, over the time, surpass them? The only hope is that the United Nations won’t give up on its moral mission to promote AI safeguards, achieving a global consensus on deploying the 'traffic lights', 'seatbelts' or any other precautionary tools indispensable for an ethical development of AI. The problem is that global leaders do not care about them. Only PM Modi, in his speech, spoke of the SDGs and 'to ensure that the AI future is for Good, and for All'. But then even Mr. Modi was taken over by an overoptimistic view that AI won’t jeopardize millions and millions of jobs but rather will be a multiplier of them. So, at the end of the day, it will be up to Mr. Guterres and Mr. Singh Gill to find a way to, once again, bring into the global agenda, the need of AI as a real force of good. Nice words delivered in international summits like the upcoming 3rd UNESCO Global Forum on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to take place from 24 to 27 June 2025 in Bangkok, won’t be nearly enough. Nor the upgrading of Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology into a new UN Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies (ODET) always under Mr. Singh Gill, as positive development as it is, will be sufficient. The UN needs a new bold strategy that should include an effective public relation dimension that, even if cannot match the prowess of Silicon Valley, can at least challenge the mainstream narrative so dominating in Paris. Involving and engaging big personalities like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei who did not hesitate calling the Summit 'a missed opportunity', should be a top priority. The propositions set in Governing AI for Humanity, the groundbreaking report prepared by the UN AI Advisory Board, must be fully taken into consideration and they should become policies. In Paris, unfortunately, it did not happen. If you look at them, none of them are even radical nor bold enough. The UN’s efforts for truly setting up common rules and standards and a global governance architecture for the AI must be re-thought, starting from a complete re-branding. Indeed, if we need business-like pitches, these should come from the UN. The stakes are too high for the UN to give up on its core mandate, saving humanity from the very probable and realistic possibility of AI induced mayhem. Simone Galimberti writes about the SDGs, youth-centered policy-making and a stronger and better United Nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRanu0p5u7YVZ	2025-02-16T16:45:17-08:00	
German Elections Important For Middle East – OpEd	By Dr. Diana Galeeva Germany will hold federal elections on Feb. 23. Last week, during a discussion at Oxford University, a well-informed speaker who advises European governments responded to my question about how the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections may affect relations with the Middle East. He commented that the topic was not high on the agenda of the region’s countries. Arguably, the forthcoming German elections also do not seem to be on the agenda of Middle Eastern countries’ governments.However, this assumption ignores how Middle Eastern governments have been revising their international relations and I suggest that this should be regarded as a golden opportunity to plan and execute strategic policies toward the EU (and especially its traditional heavyweights). The bloc is struggling, especially with economic and immigration pressures, meaning new perspectives are more likely to receive a hearing.Now is the time for offering 'win-win' scenarios, when the Middle East’s energy-rich countries, with their accumulated experience of dealing with the most challenging matters in Germany (such as radicalism and terrorism), can boost relations between Europe and the region.Who are the main candidates in these elections in Germany and whose policies could Middle Eastern governments deal with profitably? What are their agendas and, based on these, what are the potential areas for collaboration?Briefly, there are five candidates who aim to become German chancellor. At this stage, Friedrich Merz’s conservative Christian Democratic Union leads the polls. Merz’s slogan is 'A Germany we can be proud of again.' He suggests restricting immigration and cutting taxes. He has also promised to boost Germany’s aid to Ukraine.Olaf Scholz, who has been chancellor for the past three years, heads the Social Democratic Party, but his government has struggled, largely because of the impact of the Ukraine war.Alice Weidel, of the far-right Alternative for Germany, backs the deportation of migrants and has suggested ending the sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine war. Meanwhile, the Greens’ Robert Habeck, who was vice chancellor and economy minister in the Scholz government, instead propounds strong support for Ukraine.Sahra Wagenknecht of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance suggests closer relations with Russia and offers strong support to her base in eastern Germany. Her policies include strict limits on asylum and immigration.In short, the candidates’ manifestos focus on the economic crisis and political orientation toward Russia, as well as possible reforms in immigration and asylum — all topics that are very much related with the Middle East.The German economy is Europe’s biggest, but these days it seems in need of revival. External actors, including Middle Eastern countries, have an unusual opening to provide solutions. The region’s energy-rich countries might be useful in overcoming several of the challenges that Germany is facing, such as its energy crisis, in addition to becoming key investors who could bolster the German economy in such challenging times. These mutually beneficial shifts could also be used for building diplomatic dialogue. Previously, Germany largely built its economic relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries based on non-energy exports, in the infrastructure, manufacture and service sectors. However, because of the Ukraine war and the energy crisis — which seems set to continue, perhaps not least because several of Germany’s chancellor candidates want to boost aid to Ukraine — Qatar and Germany in 2022 signed a declaration to boost their energy collaborations through trade in hydrogen and liquefied natural gas. And at the beginning of this month, Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power and Germany’s SEFE energy company signed a deal to deliver green hydrogen to Europe. Under the deal, Saudi Arabia aims to export 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen to the continent by 2030.Another possible area for collaboration relates to the series of deadly terrorist attacks, including those in Mannheim, Aschaffenburg, Solingen and Magdeburg, which have put pressure on the mainstream parties to reform Germany’s asylum and immigration rules. There will be pressure on the incoming government to introduce new and effective ways to control immigration.Counterintuitively, at a time of increased social tension, as most of the suspects in these attacks are from Middle Eastern countries, I suggest that there are opportunities for the region’s moderate nations to build constructive relations based on their expertise on antiterrorism and antiradical reforms. Contrary to some populist narratives, violence is not integral to these suspects’ ethnic background, but a radicalization of it. Centrist candidates, in particular, might welcome dialogue that makes the discussion less binary and more political and human instead.The countries of the Middle East have strong experience in this regard, which might be helpful for Germany and the rest of Europe. For example, at the UN General Assembly in 2017, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the current UAE deputy prime minister and foreign minister, stressed his country’s resolve to fight terrorism, suggesting working together to eradicate the threat and its radical ideological roots. This becomes especially urgent with the implications of the Gaza and Lebanon wars.Finally, regional transformations offer further opportunities for closer collaboration. As a result of the Angela Merkel government’s decision in 2015-2016 not to close Germany’s borders to refugees fleeing Syria’s civil war, there are about 1 million people with a Syrian passport in Germany. Jens Spahn, deputy leader of the CDU, has suggested chartering planes and giving Syrians €1,000 ($1,049) to return to their home country following the collapse of the Assad government. Weidel has suggested that 'whoever in Germany celebrates ‘free Syria’ obviously has no reason any more to have fled.'Both the German and French foreign ministers have met Syria’s new leaders. Germany’s Annalena Baerbock spoke (guardedly) of Europe’s support for Syria’s transitional government in Damascus, stating: 'A political new beginning between Europe and Syria, between Germany and Syria, is possible.'It seems that, using the example of collaboration with a new Syrian government to deal with immigration and asylum, it could also be useful to form strategies and future policies with Syria and beyond. In other words, while acknowledging the failures and mistakes of previous German governments, it might be useful for the next government, in collaboration with Middle Eastern actors and stakeholders, to form effective policies toward immigration and refugee problems. This might set a good example for other EU countries that face similar problems.To sum up, the most challenging topics for German society today include issues that are closely connected to the existing resources and accumulated knowledge of the Middle East. These could be harnessed through 'win-win' policies. This is why the elections are important to the region and could prove to be a golden opportunity to cement relations with a troubled European heavyweight.

Europe Scrambles After Exclusion From Ukraine Talks – Analysis	By Frud Bezhan (RFE/RL) -- European leaders will meet on February 17 for an emergency summit to discuss Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine. The hastily arranged meeting in Paris is in response to mounting fears that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia will negotiate an end to the war alone, leaving Ukraine and its European allies on the sidelines. European leaders are expected to present a united front and discuss new proposals to support Ukraine and bolster European security. 'There seems to be a group of EU countries who are clear that they are not going to be part of a poorly designed and hasty Trump deal, and who are focused on continuing their support to Ukraine,' said Majda Ruge, senior policy fellow at the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations. Concerns in Europe have intensified after Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on February 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in peace talks. On the same day, it emerged that U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to start talks on ending the war -- possibly without Ukraine itself. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 16 arrived in the neighboring United Arab Emirates seeking to boost economic ties after attending the Munich Security Conference. He said he would later travel to Saudi Arabia, but Ukrainian officials said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials there. Just days earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Washington was no longer 'primarily focused' on Europe’s security, in another blow to the continent. The moves by Washington have triggered alarm and left European leaders on the continent scrambling over how to respond to what they see as Washington’s unilateral approach to ending the Ukraine war. But it is unclear if the continent can overcome its deep divisions and come up with its own concrete strategy to end the Ukraine war and deal with Russia. 'Europe has spent more time discussing, making statements, and making calls than actually putting its money where its mouth is and stepping up to give concrete support to Ukraine or to pursue any other policy of its own choosing,' said Ian Garner, a Russian expert at the Warsaw-based Pilecki Institute. European officials have warned that a hurriedly agreed peace or cease-fire deal will undermine Ukraine and wider European security. Europe is the largest financial supporter of Ukraine, even overtaking the United States. But it lags in military support, despite pledges to boost defense spending and arms production in recent years. With the exceptions of Hungary and Slovakia, there is broad support for Ukraine in Europe. But there is also disagreement 'Everybody is technically on the same page,' said Garner. 'The problem is when you actually look at finer details of the plans, everybody disagrees.' The creation of a European army is a prime example. Some European leaders have called for deploying European military forces to Ukraine to ensure security if a peace deal is agreed. But the idea has been rebuffed by other officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. 'All these European leaders are still trapped in potential maybes,' added Garner. 'Nobody has come up with a cohesive, comprehensive, and collaborative plan to say, ‘here’s what we would actually be willing to definitely do.’ And so, of course, Trump, Putin, and even Zelenskyy don’t take Europe seriously.'

Sudan, ‘The Most Devastating Humanitarian And Displacement Crisis...	Sudan’s ruinous civil war is approaching its third year, leaving a legacy of malnutrition, massive population displacement and chronic insecurity. As the UN system prepares to launch a call for record funding of $4.2 billion to support aid operations in the country, here are some of the main things to know about what has been described as the largest and most devasting displacement, humanitarian and protection crisis in the world today. 1) The war: 2023 Khartoum clashes herald end of peace process By the end of 2022, there were hopes that a UN- backed peace process would finally lead to a civilian administration in Sudan, after a tumultuous period which saw the fall of long-term dictator Omar al-Bashir in a military coup, followed by the harsh suppression of protests in favour of civilian rule. 'A final political agreement should pave the way towards building a democratic State', said former UN Special Representative for Sudan, Volker Perthes, in December 2022. Ominously, however, he warned that 'critical contentious issues' remained, not least a merger of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), separate military groups which had teamed up to depose al-Bashir. Tensions between the two sides grew in early 2023, marked by intermittent clashes, but the start of the current civil war came with the RSF attack on the capital Khartoum on 15 April. The fighting, which then spread to other parts of the country, forced the UN to evacuate Khartoum, and base operations in the relatively stable city of Port Sudan, on the Red Sea. On Friday, the Secretary-General, described the situation in Sudan as a catastrophe of 'staggering scale and brutality' at the AU's high stakes annual meeting in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and warned that it is increasingly spilling into the wider region. The UN has strongly condemned the fighting, and the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy to Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, continues to support peace efforts, in close collaboration with regional organizations, including the African Union (AU). 2) Humanitarian crisis: More than 30 million need aid The war has been catastrophic for Sudan’s civilians and the numbers are staggering. Some 30.4 million people – over two thirds of the total population – are in need of assistance, from health to food and other forms of humanitarian support. The fighting has led to an economic collapse, sending the prices of food, fuel and other basic goods soaring, putting them beyond the reach of many households. Acute hunger is a growing problem. Over half the population faces high levels of acute food insecurity, and famine conditions have been confirmed in five locations in North Darfur and the eastern Nuba mountains. Famine is expected to spread to five more areas by May of this year. 'This is a critical moment, as the consequences of food insecurity are already being felt in parts of South Kordofan, where families are surviving on dangerously limited food supplies, and malnutrition rates are rising sharply,' warned Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan. Humanitarian efforts are severely hampered by the lack of security, which is putting severe constraints on humanitarian access, complicating the movement of supplies and endangering aid workers. Despite the dangers, the UN and its humanitarian partners continue to reach vulnerable populations. The World Food Programme – the UN’s emergency food aid agency – is saving thousands of lives every day and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) successfully distributed seeds to over half a million households during the planting season. In all, some 15.6 million people received at least one form of aid from the UN in 2024. The country’s health system is on its knees, with health facilities attacked and many health workers forced to flee. The World Health Organization and UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are still operational, supporting immunization for cholera and malaria, and deploying mobile medical teams. 3) Massive displacement: Equivalent to the entire Swiss population Huge numbers of people have been forced to flee their homes for areas of relative safety, both within Sudan and in neighbouring countries, adding to regional instability. Over three million people are classified as refugees, and almost nine million are internally displaced. The total displaced population is greater than the entire population of Switzerland. Because of the shifting frontlines, there have been successive waves of displacement, making the task of reaching those in need increasingly complicated. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has described the situation in Sudan as 'the largest as well as the fastest growing displacement crisis globally.' The displaced population, whether they remain in Sudan or have moved abroad, face reduced access to food, scarce natural resources and limited access to essential services. In addition, outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and measles are rampant in camps for refugees and internally displaced people. Many of the surrounding nations have their own economic and security problems, and some are among the poorest in the world, with limited and overstretched services. Where possible, the UN migration agency (IOM) and UNHCR are protecting lives, supporting states hosting refugees, and ensuring that the needs of those fleeing are met with dignity. 4) Insecurity: Women and girls highly vulnerable Over 18,800 civilians have been reported killed since the beginning of the conflict, and the levels of violence in Sudan are getting worse. At the beginning of February, at least 275 people were killed in just one week, a threefold increase on the previous week’s death toll. Civilians are being hit by artillery shelling, airstrikes and aerial drone attacks: the worst affected regions are South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. As well as the general population, aid workers have been targets of intimidation and violence, with reports that some have been falsely accused of collaborating with the RSF. A UN fact-finding mission has documented a range of harrowing human rights violations committed by both the SAF and RSF, and called for investigations into the violations, and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. In an interview with UN News, Edmore Tondhlana, the deputy head of the UN humanitarian office (OCHA), explained that women and girls are the most severely impacted by the conflict, with reports of rape, forced marriage and abductions. 'If you look at the recent attack in South Kordofan, in which about 79 people were killed, the majority of victims were women and girls.' However, teenage boys are also at high risk. 'They cannot easily travel between frontlines. They will be suspected of spying,' added Mr. Tondhlana. Large numbers of children have been recruited into armed groups, forced to fight or spy against the other side. 5) Funding: Billions needed A lack of sufficient funds is severely limiting the UN’s ability to help Sudan’s population. UNHCR and partners have been able to provide less than the bare minimum of support for refugees, and food rations have been drastically cut, adding to food insecurity. On Monday, OCHA and UNHCR will launch an appeal for funding, based on their respective response plans to the crisis. Humanitarian needs have been estimated at a record (for Sudan) $4.2 billion, with an additional $1.8 billion needed to support those hosting refugees in neighbouring countries. Whilst the amount needed might seem large, Mr. Tondhlana emphasizes that, given the numbers in dire need, it barely scratches the surface. 'We’re trying to reach 21 million people, so this essentially $200 per person over the whole year. If we break it down even further, this is around $.0.50 per day.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRcr0OsSzQsSr	2025-02-16T16:34:36-08:00	
Kirill’s Crack About Critic Possibly Being From Western Ukraine S...	Until very recently, it was a commonplace among Western commentators on Ukraine that Western Ukraine, the portion that Stalin annexed to the USSR, was fundamentally different from the rest of that republic and even was the primary source of anti-Russian attitudes in Ukraine as a whole. But sociological investigations by Ukrainian scholars have shown that there has been almost a complete convergence in attitudes about Russia between Western Ukraine and the rest of that country (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/01/putins-invasion-has-led-to-almost.html). Consequently, talk in the West about divisions between Western Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine as far as attitudes toward Russia are concerned has become less common. But strikingly, it remains a prominent feature of discussions in Moscow about Ukraine and even appears to shape Kremlin views about how Ukraine might be partitioned to Moscow’s advantage. The latest example come from Moscow Patriarch Kirill who snapped back at a priest from Mozhaisk who said the church should be trying to help Russians find the way to Christ rather than to become better patriots of the Russian state and active supporters of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine (meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/12/are-you-from-western-ukraine). Kirill said that he’d 'never heard that before' and then pointedly asked whether the priest was 'by any chance from Western Ukraine?' The Meduza news agency reported that the hall 'filled with the sound of laughter and applause,' especially after the patriarch told the priest to 'go sit down and seriously reflect on what you just blurted out.' But Kirill’s remark is no laughing matter. Instead, it reflects both his unstinting support of almost anything Putin does and the belief both in the Kremlin and in the Patriarchate that Ukrainian opposition to Moscow is rooted in Western Ukraine rather than being part of the mentality of Ukrainians in the country as a whole. That has not only sparked suggestions in Moscow that Stalin made a major mistake by annexing Western Ukraine but also forms the core of Putin’s ideas about partitioning Ukraine where he assumes that without Western Ukraine, an eastern Ukraine annexed to Russia won’t be a problem (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/02/stepashin-says-stalin-made-major.html). That notion is almost as certainly wrong as it is widespread in Moscow, and that in turn means that even if the West stops supporting Ukraine and Moscow is allowed to annex large swaths of Ukraine to Russia, that will not end the conflict. Ukrainians in the east just like Ukrainians in the West will continue to resist whatever Moscow elites think.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRUR1Of0-r8cc	2025-02-16T16:31:00-08:00	
Bangladesh: Islamists Attack Book Fair For Promoting Women’s Mens...	Since Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge of an interim government in Bangladesh after the ouster of the Awami League regime , the country has witnessed a surge of radical Islamist activity. More than 250 Hindu and Buddhist temples, Christian churches and shrines of the Liberal Sufi Muslim saints have been vandalised and all institutions promoting liberal secular Bengali culture have been targeted. Even an annual fair organised in the memory of the legendary saint Lalon Fakir was closed down. Now the annual book fair in Dhaka, organised to observe the 1952 Bengali language movement in what was then undivided Pakistan, has been targeted. And the Yunus government, instead of clamping down on the Islamists have sought to appease them. The Annual Book Fair is one of Bangladesh's most cherished cultural events, where book lovers gather to celebrate Bengali heritage, intellectual freedom, and the power of ideas. However, under the rule of the Muhammad Yunus-led unelected government, the very essence of this festival is under attack as extremist forces tighten their grip on the nation. After months of violence against religious minorities, radical groups have now turned their attention to the book fair itself. In a shocking display of extremist Islamist fascism, Islamist militants targeted a stall selling sanitary napkins, branding it 'immoral' and demanding its removal. Instead of ensuring protection for the stall operators and upholding the rights of women and progressive entrepreneurs, Bangla Academy's Director General, Professor Mohammad Azam, chose to appease the extremists, recommending that the stall belonging to the Pran-RFL group, be shut down. Traditionally, the book fair has welcomed companies that support social progress, feminism, and health awareness. But under this regime, even essential healthcare products for women are being vilified in a disturbing push to erase progress in gender rights and public health awareness. The decision to dismantle the stall not only emboldens the radical forces but also signals the government's complicity in dismantling Bangladesh's hard-earned social advancements. The alignment of the Yunus administration with the extremist agenda is no longer subtle—it is open and unapologetic. By siding with religious radicals instead of safeguarding free expression and women's dignity, this government has shown that it is not only failing to protect its citizens but is actively enabling the spread of fundamentalism. As Bangladesh slips further into the hands of militant Islamists, the question remains: How much more of Bangladesh's heritage, rights, and freedoms will be sacrificed before the nation rises against this oppression? In fact, many fear that thos year , the celebration of 21st February ( locally Ekushe February) may be a muted affair. Bengalis remember the martyrs of the language movement who fell to police bullets on this day in 1952 . The Bengali language movement is seen as the starting point for the independence of Bangladesh from Islamist Pakistan. But under the Yunus regime, relations have sharply improved with Pakistan and there seems to be a conscious effort to play down the legacy of the Bengali language movement and the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. More than 700 Islamist radicals have either been released from jails or forcibly freed much before their sentence ended, even as the administration has been a silent spectator. Islamic State flags have been noticed in rallies or during mob attacks on libraries and museum which showcase the legacy of the Liberation War. Earlier this month, the museum in the ancestral house of Bangladesh's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was bulldozed and destroyed. Many feel the Islamist groups who provide the muscle for Yunus' interim government are creating an environment to transform Bangladesh into an Taliban type Islamist Republic.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRWCGwBvgWqf8	2025-02-16T16:25:25-08:00	
Rubio: Hamas ‘Must Be Eradicated’	The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated. Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop. While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a 'common strategy' for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants. Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza. Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario. Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Hamas described the attack as a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRY41McruRy_8	2025-02-16T16:22:07-08:00	
Breaking Barriers: Can ASEAN Unlock Peace On The Korean Peninsula...	The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most volatile regions in the world with ongoing tensions between South and North Korea threatening regional and global security. Despite efforts for reconciliation summits including peace talks deep-rooted mistrust and political differences persist. In this context, ASEAN (Association of Asian Southeast Nations) holds significant potential to contribute and peace stability in the Korean Peninsula by leveraging its experience in multilateral diplomacy, economic cooperation, and confidence-building measures. ASEAN through its mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and ASEAN Plus Three (APT) can facilitate and promote dialogue, and economic collaboration and support de-escalation efforts. By engaging both Koreas within a regional framework that prioritizes dialogue and cooperation ASEAN can help reduce tensions and foster a path lasting toward peace. However, ASEAN faces challenges such as divisions political security concerns and the limitations imposed by international sanctions. Despite these ASEAN's challenges’neutral s and inclusive offers approach a valuable pathway toward progress on the Korean Peninsula. Economic cooperation initiatives serve as a crucial tool for building trust and interdependence between the two Koreas. According to 2024 a report by the ASEAN Secretariat regional intra-trade between ASEAN and South Korea reached $200 billion reflecting deep economic ties. However, trade with North Korea remains minimal due to sanctions. Despite ASEAN's potential to play a pivotal role, it can promote multilateral projects such as the development of tourism infrastructure and initiatives in areas like the Kaesong Industrial Complex, especially if sanctions are eased. Additionally, ASEAN + 3 which includes China Japan and South Korea could facilitate trilateral economic dialogues that incorporate North Korea into regional supply chains. Economic engagement has historically proven to reduce hostilities created by shared interests and ASEAN’s success in fostering regional economic integration makes it a credible facilitator. Confidence-building measures (CBMs) are another area where ASEAN can contribute meaningfully. The ASEAN Forum Regional (ARF) established in 1994 is the only multilateral security forum that includes both North and South Korea. In 2024, the ARF held its 31st session, focusing on preventive diplomacy and regional peacebuilding. Track II diplomacy, which involves civil society dialogues, complements Track I (official) efforts by enhancing understanding and reducing misconceptions. ASEAN's experience in resolving disputes, such as those in the South China Sea, can be applied to the Korean Peninsula. People-to-people exchange programs, along with cultural and sports diplomacy, can further foster goodwill. For instance, ASEAN's Youth Exchange Program in 2024 featured participants from both North and South Korea, fostering mutual understanding among younger generations. De-escalation of the Korean Peninsula requires addressing military and tensions security concerns. Can ASEAN promote transparency and risk reduction through joint initiatives such as management disaster exercises and military observer programs? In 2024 the ARF proposed a regional mechanism for crisis communication which if implemented could as a hotline for North and South Korea to prevent accidental conflicts. Moreover, ASEAN's principle of non-interference is advantageous because it allows both Koreas to engage without the fear of coercion. ASEAN's success in managing regional conflict, such as its role in resolving the Cambodian conflict in the 1990s, demonstrates its potential to mediate on the Korean Peninsula. However, ASEAN’s efforts are not without significant challenges. Politically the deep-seated animosity and mistrust between North and South Korea hinder dialogue. North Korea often views initiatives as multilateral with suspicion, fearing they serve as tools for international isolation. Additionally, within ASEAN there is a lack of consensus on how to engage North Korea. For instance, countries like Indonesia and Vietnam maintain diplomatic relations with Pyongyang while others such as the Philippines align more closely with U.S. policies. Economic challenges persist also primarily due to international sanctions on North Korea under United Nations Security Council resolutions. These sanctions limit ASEAN’s ability to promote economic cooperation restricting projects to engagement of humanitarian assistance. Security concerns are equally daunting with North Korea’s ongoing nuclear weapons program remaining a major obstacle to regional peace. In 2024 North Korea conducted missile tests that heightened tensions and fragile environment security. Lastly, ASEAN's interference policy, while a cornerstone of its diplomacy, limits its ability to intervene directly or mediate in Korean disputes. Despite obstacles, there are opportunities for ASEAN to overcome challenges that contribute to peace on the Peninsula of Korea. By strengthening ASEAN-led platforms such as ARF and East Asia Summit (EAS) ASEAN can sustain dialogue engagement between the two Koreas. ASEAN's economic engagement through humanitarian aid, educational exchanges, and public health cooperation not only circumvents sanctions but also fosters trust. Additionally, ASEAN’s ability to work externally with partners such as China the United States and Japan through the ASEAN+3 mechanism can enhance its influence and coordination in addressing the Korean Peninsula issues. In conclusion, ASEAN holds substantial potential to support peace on the Korean Peninsula through economic cooperation, confidence-building measures, and de-escalation strategies. Despite ongoing challenges like political divisions, sanctions, and security concerns, ASEAN's experience in regional diplomacy and its neutral stance position it as a credible facilitator for dialogue and cooperation. By leveraging existing platforms and fostering multilateral partnerships, ASEAN can help reduce tensions and establish a foundation for lasting peace between North and South Korea. The road to peace is arduous for ASEAN but’s consistent engagement and commitment to dialogue can play a crucial role in promoting stability on the Korean Peninsula.

Trump Lacks The Minerals For Ukraine Deal	By Aurélie Pugnet (EurActiv) -- Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of Donald Trump's offer to trade US military aid for access to half of Ukraine's critical raw materials has teed up a back-and-forth neogtiation that could become key to peace talks. The US president has honed in on the mineral riches of Ukraine, just as he has done with Greenland. In both cases, he has used the US's military might to try and stack the odds in his favour. While he refused to take an invasion of Greenland off the table, in the case of Ukraine Trump has used military support as a bargaining chip to coax the Ukranians into surrendering vast amounts of their critical raw materials – possibly to the value of $500 billion, he said on Tuesday. But a deal has so far eluded even the world's most self-assured negotiator. Though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had initially signalled interest in an arrangement, on Saturday the Ukrainian answer was 'no'. A 50-50 deal in which the US would take half the country's raw minerals was unsatisfactory for Kyiv, the Financial Timesreported.Ukraine ranks in the world's top 10 suppliers of mineral resources. The main issue in exploiting them is that most of the deposits are located in the east of the country, close to or in Russian-controlled territory. Zelenskyy is, however, pressed for time when it comes to military aid – and not just because the US wants a deal done in 'days and weeks,' not months. At the moment, the country’s forces struggle to make any significant advancement on the battlefield, a pre-requisite if they are to have the upper hand in any negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy is at a crossroads, as his army heavily relies on US military aid. The US provided 40% of all support last year, even despite the Republicans in the US senate blocking deliveries of fighter jets, air defence systems and long-range weapons.If Zelenskyy's efforts to entice Trump into a reasonable arrangement on raw minerals were sucessful, the floodgates could open for massive flows of weapons to Kyiv. According to the Financial Times, Zelenskyy is also interested in doing similar minerals-for-weapons deals with European countries, alongside the US. Europe has so far been relegated by the US to planning post-deal security guarantees, with no seat at the table in talks. A domestic bargaining chip Many of Trump's Republican allies have stood against more aid to Ukraine, in a nod to the views of their voting base. But the influential Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the mineral deal's major advocates, said on a panel in Munich on Saturday that a trademark Trump quid pro quo could see the American public get on board with keeping the aid tap running. 'President Trump can go to the American people and say 'Ukraine is not a burden, it is a benefit'', Graham said. 'They are sitting on top of a trillion dollars worth of minerals that we can benefit from… I do know [Putin] is going after the money, don’t let him steal what Ukraine has to enrich itself'. 'If those agreements happen, it's a nightmare for Putin because we have something to defend that we did not have before', he added. He did not explicitly mention the significant opportunity that such a deal would present for US industry – whose support is vital for the likes of Graham, up for re-election in 2026. Nonetheless, Zelenskyy seemed to agree with the latter part of Graham's assessment on Friday. 'We need to protect Ukraine and our resources,' he said. 'Why do we need to protect them? So that they do not fall into the hands of Russia and their allies.' Ukraine to compete against China and Russia? The critical nature of Ukraine's raw materials comes from surging demand as key components in vital technologies, especially for space, defence and electric vehicles. Control over those will give Western countries a major competitive advantage, especially against Russia and China. Despite the vice president's assertions to the contrary on Friday, the US administration sees China as the 'real' bad guy, said a source in direct contact with senior US officials. The NATO military alliance has listed 12 critical materials 'essential' for the defence industry, for a whole range of products, from fighter aircraft to missiles and submarines. Aluminium and graphite are on top of the list of at-risk supplies. China, the largest global and EU supplier of critical raw materials, cut off exports to the US of gallium and germanium in December. It already requires foreign importers to explain to the Chinese government how such materials should be used. Even though the US has alternative suppliers, Western countries are looking for reliable trade partners to guarantee them visibility in supply. When it comes to the environmental risks, they seem to be a secondary thought. 'If I have to choose between the threat of contaminating these territories with Russia or contaminating them with the byproducts of exploration of raw materials, I would definitely go for the second option,' former Ukrainian Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRadj5xVOforT	2025-02-16T16:13:42-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Challenges For New Chairperson Of The ...	Saturday the 15th of February 2025 will go into the annals of the history of the Horn of Africa States region. It marks the election of the first leader from the region to become the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. It is the main office of the Union which manages and runs the day-to-day affairs of the organization, which brings together some 55 member states, the largest grouping of countries in the world. Djibouti’s Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf was elected in a secret ballot and replaces the outgoing AU Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat of Chad. Mr. Youssouf was Djibouti’s foreign minister since 2005. He inherits an organization which has many bags full of troubles around the continent from its east to its west, from its north to its south and, indeed, in its center. These include among others the following main challenges: Streamlining the Regional Blocs H.E. Mahmoud Youssouf has ahead of him many challenges but the first is perhaps realigning the current regional infrastructure of the continent. He was elected on the basis of a set structure of the continent which composes of five regions – the Western region, the eastern region, the northern region, the southern region and the central region. Yet there are eight and growing other regional blocs, which sometimes overlap each other in the continent. This presents a confused map of the continent and complicates its administration, the job he is to do over the next four years. It looks mostly like quicksand the way these regions are structured. They include the ECOWAS of West Africa, which has now given an offshoot called the Alliance of the Sahel States. There is the SADC of Southern Africa, the EAC of East Africa, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), and of course the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), with a potential offshoot of this organization, the Horn of Africa States (HAS) region. Many countries are in multiple regional blocs, and this does not make sense, if one has to manage a streamlined organization. Economic Development The continent is said to be poor, but its poverty is not related to its rich natural resources both above soil and sub-soil and in its oceans and seas. It is mostly mismanagement, wars (civil or otherwise) and, of course, foreign interferences of different kinds, be it religious terrorism or mercenaries, and hypocritical aid. The United Nations reports that the continent holds some 30 per cent of all natural minerals, 12 per cent of all oil reserves and 8 per cent of natural gas. It is said to hold 40 percent of the world’s gold reserves and up to 90 percent of its platinum and chromium reserves (Al Jazeera.com – Mapping Africa’s Natural resources). The continent is home to some 1.5 billion youthful population which is still growing. These present themselves as both a large market and a large source of labor. It should not be a poor continent, and there it is, a more serious challenge for the newly elected and younger Chairperson. He has to work hard and put a lot of efforts in improving the economic status of the continent and bargaining for more reasonable returns for its natural resources in the place of dependency on foreign aid from other continents. There should be a revisit of the status quo. When the economic imbalances of the continent are corrected, the instabilities and the political upheavals of the continent will naturally disappear or be reduced drastically. It is all related to surviving from Dinosauric times to the present. Most troubles in the continent are rooted in the unequal distribution of the small economic pie that is currently available, as a result of mismanagement and wrong leaderships. It is where a common bargaining tool, the African Union, which he has just taken over, becomes a relevant organization than has hitherto been the case. It is a tough job ahead. Correcting the AU financing Capital is the original source of finance for any organization, be it private or public. Private businesses raise enough capital before they launch any business venture and public organizations raise capital through taxes to deliver the services they are supposed to deliver to a country. When there is a shortfall, different organizations raise the required capital and financing for a job through different means. Private business may raise capital and invite new investors through issuance of new shares or borrow from credit institutions at a price. Public organizations do also borrow or may raise taxes. International organizations are funded through the contributions of the member states, which should include a new heading in their budgets for the amounts they are supposed to pay and/or agreed that each country should pay and they should pay! It is a responsibility they have taken and they must fulfill their obligations. The African Union and many other African organizations are created in the hope that other countries will finance them not only for their economic initiatives, but even for their administrative machineries. This what has failed many African organizations, including the African Union. It is reported that approximately 75% of financing of the African Union’s financing come from foreign sources including European, American, and other countries. The 55 African member states hardly pay or pay little to the activities of the AU. How do they expect it to succeed in its endeavors? Do they expect the elected leaders, Mr. Youssouf, in this instance, to carry a begging bowl and go around the world to beg for more? This is a challenge, which H.E. Chairperson Youssouf will have to address, to ensure that governments in Africa should include in their budgets a heading with respect to the contributions they should be making and this should be a function of the financial needs of the organization, whether these are related to its administration or other initiatives on which the institution is working on. Financial independence of the African Union is a must. How much the new chairperson will deliver of the works in this respect will, of course, depend on how much effort he and his team will put on this matter. Avoiding the Old Pitfalls Most African leaders are kept busy on dealing with security issues, delivery of democratic values and other benign issues that do not add one iota to the lives of people. On the contrary, they only cause more problems. Should there be a better economic and financial infrastructure, better employment opportunities and educational and health services, most people would mind their lives and their businesses. It is when these are not delivered that volatility and violence, two issues which mark the continent, arise and keep leaders of the continent busy and occupied. The new chairperson would be well advised if he avoids these old pitfalls. He would also do better if he truly works on securing adequate and sustainable financing from the member states of the African Union. The member countries can provide such funding for they have the funds but waste it either on personal enrichments or other personal gains or in accounts beyond the reach of the continent in other continents – Dubai, London, Paris or Geneva and more recently in Shanghai and other Asian cities. Africa is a young continent when one looks at its population. The new Chairperson of the African continent should cater for the needs of that population. It is one of the main reasons the new chairperson was elected, as he was seen to be much younger than his rival from Kenya, more vigorous and more in line with the growing youthful population and leaders of the continent, who know what they want and have the capacity to attain and achieve them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRWi-9s6TRpQW	2025-02-16T16:10:29-08:00	
Gaza: Which Country Has Best Claim? – OpEd	President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed reporters at the White House last week, during which the president laid out his plan for the US to 'take over' Gaza. The president elaborated further that his plan is to temporarily relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries during rebuilding efforts of up to 10 years and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Before Trump proceeds, the issue of which country has the best claim to Gaza must be established. The Gaza Strip (roughly the size of Washington DC) was occupied in turn by the Ottoman Empire until 1917 and the British Empire until 1948. It forms the smaller of two territories inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. The other is the ancient land of Israel (Samaria and Judea) – termed the 'West Bank' by the international community and inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. Subsequent to the creation of Israel by the UN in 1948, Egypt controlled Gaza for nearly two decades. After Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War against 3 Arab nations which attacked it, Israel (having fought a purely defensive war) invoked its legal right (under customary international law at the time – prior to UN Resolution 242) to claim Gaza and the 'West Bank' as its territories. Israel, therefore, gained legal control over them. For the next 38 years, it controlled the strip and pursued the construction of 21 Jewish settlements there. Two Questions Before Trump proceeds, the issue of who has the best claim to Gaza must be established. There are two pivotal questions that must first be answered if Trump is to follow through with his plans for Gaza. An appropriate response to either of these could lead to his gaining legal control over that coastal enclave. The first interrogative deals with borders: What were the borders of Israel when it was first established? What defines this is the borders at the moment of independence. Israel was created, like many countries, after a successful war where no one came to its aid. In international law, there is a clear rule regarding the establishment of new countries: The country’s borders are determined in accordance with the borders of the previous political entity in that area. So, what legal entity existed before Israel – the British Mandate. And what were the established borders of the British Mandate? From the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. The UN General Assembly’s declaration on November 29, 1947, was a 'recommendation for partition' rather than an operative resolution. What actually defined the situation was what the Mandate did, and it neither accepted the recommendations nor put them into force. During Israel's War of Independence, Jordan and Egypt conquered territories from Israel illegally (by aggression – in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter). It was almost universally agreed that neither Jordan nor Egypt had any legitimate claim of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (West Bank) or Gaza – Israel did. When Israel liberated the territories in 1967 – a fortiori – it renewed its control over lands that it had sovereignty over based on the original Mandatory borders and consistent with international law. Gaza and the West Bank are not occupied territories. These are lands over which Israel has sovereign claims. In fact, there are many examples where a nation has sovereignty, but it provides a uniquely different governing arrangement with one of its territories. One example is American Samoa. It has its own administration, but without independence. The residents don’t have citizenship, and they can’t vote in U.S. elections. The second question that could be answered affirmatively for Trump to proceed is: Does the UN recognize the inherent right of self-defense if an armed attack occurred and there is loss of territory by the aggressor nation to the defending state? The signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945 marked a turning point in the international legal order. Two key provisions of the Charter influenced the discourse on territorial conquest: Article 2(4): Prohibited the use or threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Article 51: Recognized the inherent right of self-defense if an armed attack occurred. While these provisions emphasized the importance of territorial integrity, they did not explicitly prohibit land acquired in self-defense. By remaining silent on the matter, this left land acquisition ambiguous, especially when defensive wars were deemed necessary to ensure national security. Customary International Law Customary international law, historically, treated defensive wars as an exception to the total prohibition on territorial conquest. A state acting in self-defense could retain captured territory essential to its future security. This view was used to legitimize territorial acquisitions following defensive conflicts. Despite the growing focus on territorial integrity, legal precedents before 1967 demonstrated the legitimacy of territorial gain in defensive wars. For instance: World War II Aftermath The Allied Powers justified retaining or redistributing territory for security reasons, such as the division of Germany and the annexation of parts of Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union. China and Tibet China asserted control over Tibet after a military invasion in 1950, formalizing its claim through the Seventeen Point Agreement in 1951 India and Goa India’s annexation of Goa from Portugal was defended as a measure of self-defense, reflecting how states could have territorial acquisition in defensive terms. Indonesia and West Papua Following military pressure and a UN-brokered agreement, Indonesia took control of West Papua from the Netherlands under the 1962 New York Agreement. Israel’s Defensive Wars The 1948 Arab-Israeli War offers a notable example of how international law treated territorial gains resulting from defensive wars before the Six-Day War. Following its War of Independence, Israel retained territory beyond the boundaries outlined in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. While armistice agreements established ceasefire lines, they were not recognized as formal borders but indicated a degree of acceptance of territorial realities resulting from defensive actions. As the only emerging state after the end of the British Mandate and based on the principle of Uti possidetis juris the entire territory between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea is sovereign Israeli territory, according to customary international law. The Six-Day War marked a watershed moment in the discourse on land conquest in defensive wars. Israel, acting in preemptive self-defense, captured Judea, Samaria, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights. The international response dealt more with political agendas regarding the Middle East and oil than any basis in law. The result was UN Security Council Resolution 242 – declaring the 'inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,' reflecting the shift toward a rejection of Israel's right to defensive acquisition of territory. Before 1967, international law treated the conquest of land in defensive wars with notable ambiguity. While aggressive conquest was increasingly condemned, defensive wars often provided a legal basis upon which states justified territorial acquisitions. Yet, even after 1967, there are several examples where the UN did not strongly condemn territorial acquisitions, even when they were framed as 'defensive actions.' These include: Turkey's Invasion of Cyprus (1974): After a Greek-led coup in Cyprus, Turkey invaded the northern part of the island, citing self-defense and the protection of Turkish Cypriots. While the UN condemned the invasion and called for a ceasefire, it did not demand that Turkey withdraw immediately. This evolution of customary international jurisprudence reflects a double standard in the commitment to territorial integrity, peaceful conflict resolution, and the rule of law. Understanding this historical trajectory reveals politically driven inconsistencies in sovereignty under international law. Yet, the answer to the first question is controlling and sufficient to provide the basis for recognition of Gaza as Israeli territory. A country’s borders are determined in accordance with the borders of the previous political entity in that area. Even with the subsequentpromulgation of 242, when Israel liberated the territories (Gaza and the 'West Bank') in 1967, it renewed its control over lands that it had sovereignty over based on the original Mandatory borders: From the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Israel has the best claim to Gaza; thus, Trump needs Israel's acquiescence to legally proceed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRb9UNBIUD0HN	2025-02-16T16:07:27-08:00	
Transatlantic Twilight: European Public Opinion And The Long Shad...	By Jana Puglierin, Arturo Varvelli and Pawel Zerka Lamps going out On the evening of August 3rd 1914, a friend visited the British foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey in his office in London. They gazed out of the windows at the dusk street as the lamplighters moved along it. 'The lamps are going out all over Europe,' commented Grey, as he later observed in his memoirs. 'We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.' To draw comparisons between now and then might seem absurdly catastrophist. After all, Grey was referring to the imminent outbreak of the first world war. And yet that melancholic image captures something of the transatlantic alliance today as Donald Trump settles in for a second presidential term. Where once it burned bright, now it is dimming. The shadows are lengthening. Gloom is setting in—for how long is not yet clear. That, at least, is the mood captured by ECFR’s sweeping poll of Europeans conducted in November (after the US presidential election) and December 2024. It covered 11 EU member states and Switzerland, the UK and Ukraine—as well as ten other countries around the world as part of a wider exercise already covered in a separate ECFR report. Across those 14 European states, the poll found a newly pessimistic and transactional view of the transatlantic partnership. The growing shadows do not fall evenly. In some parts of the continent and its politics—especially its populist right, in power in states like Hungary—affection for the US burns on. Even elsewhere, as it fades, more moderate leaders like Emmanuel Macron in France and Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, rage against the dying of the light. They hope to use their personal ingenuity or charisma to keep the transatlantic flame burning. But as they do so, they should heed the twilight scene that our polling paints, constituted by four main findings. Firstly, Europeans see the US less as an ally sharing the same interests and values, and more as a necessary partner with whom they must strategically cooperate. They are broadly aligned on this, but the poll also finds evidence that respondents of different political outlooks view Trump quite differently. That could point to divisions on the sort of transatlantic relationship that they would like to see in future. Secondly, Europeans are largely united in expecting Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, a significant shift over the second half of 2024. But here too, the pattern of light and shade is uneven. Views on what those negotiations should entail and what approach to the theatre Europe should adopt in the long term vary greatly, in ways European leaders must heed if Trump increases the pressure for talks. Thirdly, a similar picture of division is already visible on China policy. Views among Europeans vary significantly and do not correlate neatly with views on America or Trump. That gives the US administration room to exploit differences. Finally, Europeans tend to see the EU in a gloomier light than most counterparts elsewhere in the world. But few believe that darkness has fallen entirely. Between the groups most optimistic and pessimistic about the union’s prospects and power are two other camps that recognise shades of grey. As the glow of the transatlantic alliance fades, leaders can turn to those groups for support as they seek to illuminate Europe’s own path. Twilight is usually understood as the period just after the sunset, when the light is fading. Technically speaking, however, it corresponds to any time of day when the sun is just below the horizon. Thus it can also refer to the dawn: the moment before a new day. That very ambiguity well describes current relations between Europe and America. The old Atlanticism is disappearing. But a new one will need to be born—either soon, or after a long night. For leaders favourable to European interests and cooperation, this marks an opportunity to set transatlantic relations on a new footing. It is a chance to make Europe a more autonomous, flexible and, ultimately, more secure and self-confident partner. But if Europeans allow Trump to transfix and divide them, they will cede the task of lighting a way forward to a new, nationalist, MAGA-style transatlantic project already emerging, confident, from the shadows. An unsentimental Atlanticism ECFR’s poll shows Europeans converging in their perceptions of the US. The most common view is that the US is not an 'ally' but rather a 'necessary partner' with which Europeans must strategically cooperate. This is even true in traditional Atlanticist strongholds—like Poland and Denmark—that one-and-a half years earlier saw the US primarily as an ally. Though our polling cannot confirm causality, we contend that Trump’s political return and ultimate election victory may be the main contributing factor. A notable sub-trend within this is that supporters of Europe’s far-right parties, many of them traditionally sceptical about the transatlantic alliance, buck the continental trend—but not all. Supporters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party now see the US in a more positive light, but attitudes among supporters of France’s National Rally (RN) remain largely unchanged. This reflects the parties’ leaders: Alice Weidel, the AfD’s chancellor candidate, welcomed Trump’s re-election with warm words, but the RN’s Marine Le Pen was more subdued in her reaction A more consistent shift is seen in the European political mainstream. Supporters of parties like the Christian Democrats (CDU), Social Democrats (SPD), and Greens in Germany, the Socialists (PSOE) in Spain, or Macron’s Renaissance in France have all revised their perception of America downwards since 2023. Further evidence suggesting that Trump’s election is part of this shift comes from respondents’ disinclination to view this event positively. In ECFR’s recent global polling paper authors Timothy Garton Ash, Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard noted that, among respondents from all over the world, Europeans are the least likely to consider Trump’s re-election a good thing for American citizens. Alongside South Koreans, they are also the least likely to consider it a good thing for their countries and peace in the world. There are differences between and within European countries—especially between supportive respondents in south-eastern Europe and detractors in northern and western parts. But the average European citizen is more likely to be pessimistic than optimistic about Trump’s return—on all three accounts. This apprehension could create the basis for a pragmatic European approach to the US over the next four years—neither starry-eyed nor entirely rejectionist—that commands broad majorities in most societies. But there is clear scope for greater divergence among Europeans over time if the internal political differences sharpen. For the moment, our polling shows that supporters of (for example) the AfD and RN chiefly see the US as Europe’s partner—rather than close ally. That restrained enthusiasm for the transatlantic alliance may be rooted in those parties’ traditional view that it is an elite project—the realm of NATO summits and Davos round tables—alien to ordinary European voters. But a Trump presidency that draws the European far-right closer, both personally and ideologically, could change that. After all, present in Washington for the inauguration on January 20th were few conventional European figures, but rather the likes of Giorgia Meloni, Viktor Orban, and the AfD’s Tino Chrupalla. Trump’s speech evoked favourite topics of those politicians and their European comrades: anti-'wokeism', anti-greenery and anti-migration. Elsewhere Elon Musk, for his part, has established friendships with the Italian prime minister as well as with Weidel. In January he interviewed the latter on X, his social media platform, and later beamed into her party’s election campaign launch to emphasise once again that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' This nascent realignment within Europe is seen, in ECFR’s poll, in the political breakdown of respondents’ optimism about Trump’s re-election. Most upbeat are supporters of right-wing populist parties: for example, not even a fifth of voters for Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) and Confederation (Konfederacja) parties, or Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (FdI), believe his re-election is a 'bad thing' for American voters, their own country, or peace in the world. Supporters of the AfD and RN are more split, with pluralities believing Trump’s election is a bad thing for their countries. But overall, our findings hold out the possibility that, while some lights go out on the traditional, mainstream European commitment to the transatlantic relationship, new ones start to flicker on what have until recently been the European margins. If Trump hits Europe with tariffs that hurt working-class European voters, or if his peace plan for Ukraine turns out be a disaster, he may lose some of the good will from the European far-right that he currently seems to enjoy. But for the moment, the trend points to a warm glow between Trump and his European followers, which could well evolve into a new, MAGA-style Atlanticism. United on Ukraine talks, divided on what comes next Arguably the most pressing transatlantic topic as the new Trump term gets underway is how the president acts on Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine. The president has indicated that he will pressure both sides to negotiate. That, combined with Ukraine’s struggles on the battlefield, could explain why the most prevalent expectation among European publics is a 'compromise settlement' between Kyiv and Moscow. This was the leading view in every country polled, including more hawkish ones like Estonia, Denmark, Poland, the UK and indeed Ukraine itself—where previous polls found greater confidence about Ukrainian victory. That could bode well for achieving common European positions on any such talks. But the backdrop—the transatlantic twilight that has set in since the US election campaign and result—colours that view. Europeans are broadly sceptical about the returning president’s peace-making efforts. In half of the countries polled, absolute majorities of respondents (or, in the case of France, 49%) believe that reaching peace in Ukraine will either become less likely under Trump or remain as unlikely as it was before. Admittedly, only a minority of respondents believe Trump will reduce the chance of peace in Ukraine; just 26% on average across the 11 EU countries polled. And in several European countries—not just in generally Trump-positive Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, but also in Estonia, Italy and Ukraine itself—quite a few people believe that he will make it more likely. But the overall picture is darker. In several countries, many of those who consider peace negotiations as the 'most likely' outcome of the war do not consider this the 'best' outcome for their own countries or for peace in the world. The tendency is particularly strong in northern Europe. There, respondents tend to believe that it would be better for Ukraine to win and, consequently, many of them want Europe to support Kyiv to continue fighting instead of pushing it to negotiate. In other words, pluralities (and in some cases, majorities) of respondents anticipate that Russia’s war in Ukraine will end in negotiations. But they do not necessarily trust Trump to help with that or to further the wider cause of peace globally. In some cases, they do not believe talks now are even desirable. There is therefore significant potential for transatlantic and intra-European splits, especially if negotiations either fail entirely or drift towards an outcome highly unfavourable to Ukraine. Within Europe the main rift is between countries that are keen to support Kyiv in continuing its fight (like Denmark, Estonia, Poland and the UK) and those that would rather push it towards peace negotiations. The latter are further divided between a select few (like Spain) where many would prefer to invite Ukraine to NATO first and others (especially Bulgaria and Hungary) where the largest group of respondents would rather push Kyiv to negotiate without such an offer. Those divisions should concern anyone who sees the need for a common European position on Ukraine—especially given the arrival of a less predictable and amicable partner in the White House. So too should divides that would matter particularly in the event that a peace deal is indeed reached between Kyiv and Moscow. Poll respondents in some countries (most notably, Bulgaria and Hungary again) are already fairly Russia-positive and tend to believe that Ukraine bears some, most, or all of the blame for the war’s continuation thus far. This points to the possibility that, after any peace deal, those countries’ governments would seek a reset with Russia that others (like Poland or Germany) might find unpalatable. Another question that could arise in that event—if not as part of the negotiations themselves—is Ukraine’s future integration into the EU. There too the scope for division is obvious, with a wide range of views on whether the country is even part of Europe. That around half of respondents even in two big western states, France and Italy, doubt this should be a particular concern to supporters of that integration process. The China conundrum If the poll makes it all-too-easy to imagine how Europe’s divisions over Ukraine could prevent it from establishing common positions towards Trump’s Washington, the same could also be true of China. At the time of writing, the president has fired the opening salvo of a new trade war with Beijing, imposing a sweeping 10% tariff on Chinese imports. He is also threatening the EU with tariffs. Does Europe, however unsentimentally, align with the president on China in order to placate him? Or does it turn to China as a new beacon as the transatlantic glow fades? Our poll suggests that neither course would enjoy resounding support among Europeans. True, a plurality of respondents agree that China is a 'necessary partner' more than an ally, rival or adversary. But the proportions vary greatly, with southern Europeans most positive towards it (perhaps a reflection of perceived economic advantages) and northern Europeans more dubious (perhaps the sign of cautionary lessons learned about interdependence with China, especially in Germany’s and Denmark’s cases.) Our poll also finds a slight negative shift in views towards China since May 2023 in countries like Denmark, France, Germany and Poland. That appears to reflect Europe’s ongoing reassessment of its relationship with the Asian giant, including a shift in emphasis at the EU level towards 'de-risking.' At the World Economic Forum summit in Davos on January 21st, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, advocated 'a more balanced relationship with China' overcoming 'economic imbalances.' Her address evoked a Europe capable of making its own choices on the relationship rather than (implicitly) being pressed into a course of action by either Washington or Beijing. Yet the poll also points to the challenges in doing so if, for example, Trump pressures Europeans to join the US in ratcheting up pressure on Beijing. Some of the most China-sceptic countries are also some of the most Trump-sceptic (though Germans are also divided internally, reflecting the varying interests and outlooks of the country’s different industrial sectors). Meanwhile some of those states most open to China, particularly in southern and eastern Europe, are most upbeat about Trump. Finding a consistent European way forward will therefore be difficult. Even if that middle way involves a transactional bargain—ongoing American security for Europe in return for some European support on China—this will strain elements of public opinion in much of the continent. The alternative, of course, is that Europe fails to find any such common position and allows others, whether Washington, Beijing, or both, to set its course. Avoiding that will mean preparing, and preparing electorates, for negotiation and compromise. From gloom to shades of grey Can Europeans light their own path forward during the era of Trump 2.0? The poll suggests a profound lack of self-confidence. Most respondents are either sceptical of the EU’s power, or believe the union could collapse within the next 20 years, or both. As such, they see the EU in a gloomier light than respondents in most of the rest of the world, as ECFR’s recent global polling report showed. Absolute majorities in Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa believe that the EU will have much more or somewhat more influence in the world over the next decade. By contrast, that expectation is shared by only 29% in the EU (taking an average across the 11 EU countries polled) and even smaller contingents in the UK and Switzerland. There are, however, differences within Europe. Notably, respondents in geographically marginal states outside the old core of the European project—Estonia, Portugal, Romania and Spain—see the EU’s power shining more brightly than counterparts in France, Germany and Italy. One possible interpretation of this finding is that newer and (in the past, at least) peripheral members are more likely to see the EU as strengthening their own voices in the world and helping to compensate for the limitations of national governments. Another, more dispiriting interpretation is that Europe’s old core is closer to the realities of the EU’s limitations and its struggle to reconcile national differences. To capture fully this complex picture, it helps to segment European citizens into four different groups reflecting their views of both the EU’s resilience and its great-power potential. Those who believe that the EU is a great power, and that its collapse is unlikely, are the largest camp, constituting 29% of the public, on average, in the 14 European countries polled. This group is particularly big in Denmark, Estonia, Portugal and Spain. Only in one country, France, does its size fall below 20%. We call these citizens 'Euro-optimists.' They dominate in the electorates of Macron’s Renaissance, Spain’s governing PSOE and its opposition Popular Party (PP), and the German Greens. But taken alone, this group’s sunny disposition would not be enough to light the EU’s way. The second-largest camp (22% on average) sees shadows consuming the union. It comprises those believing that the EU both is not a power and is doomed to collapse. We call them the 'Euro-pessimists.' They are preeminent in the electorates of some of the most radical far-right or otherwise Eurosceptic parties, like the AfD, RN, PiS, Confederation, as well as Orban’s Fidesz, and Vox in Spain. In five EU members from our sample—Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary and Poland—they make up at least a quarter of the national population. Between the bright outlook of the Euro-optimists and the despondency of the Euro-pessimists are two groups that need to be taken into consideration and that reflect different combinations of light and shade. Members of the third camp, the 'Euro-realists', have perhaps the least dramatic perspective. They do not think the EU is bound to collapse, but do not see it as a great power either. On average, they account for one sixth (17%) of the population in the European countries polled, and are particularly present in Denmark, Germany, Italy and Poland. This group is rarely ever the single-largest camp among any one political party’s electorate. But it is a significant contingent in several of the most powerful parties in the EU, from the CDU and SPD in Germany to Meloni’s FdI and Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition in Poland. Unlike the Euro-pessimists, many of the Euro-realists believe the EU’s power will grow in the future. This might suggest that, for them, the EU is simply not a great power yet. Alongside 'Euro-optimists', they are often (especially in Germany, Poland and the UK, among others) of the opinion that Europe should support Ukraine in continuing its fightback against Russia rather than pushing for peace talks. The fourth camp, which we call 'Euro-mortalists', is a mirror image of the Euro-realists. It is composed of people who believe the EU is vulnerable to collapse but, at the same time, view it as a great power comparable to the US or China. They are thus likely to agree with Macron when he warned at the Sorbonne in April 2024 that the EU is mortal and could die, because its geopolitical awakening is too slow and weak amid the 'generalised rearmament of the world'. This group accounts, on average, for 11% of the European populations polled, with particularly high numbers in Bulgaria, Portugal and Romania. But they do not dominate in any country or party. Identifying these shades of grey may help Europeans avoid shades of Grey (he of the catastrophist 'lamps going out' observation in 1914). In other words, as twilight settles over the transatlantic relationship and neither luminous boosterism nor the darkest fatalism offer viable ways forward, the nuances of the Euro-realists and Euro-mortalists may help light that path. By drawing them together with those Euro-optimists most confident about Europe’s future, pragmatic leaders can build broad majorities in favour of concerted action. Hopeful but grounded; aware of the limits of European power but not imprisoned by them; cognisant of the EU’s mortality but not transfixed by it: such nuances show the way. In a speech to France’s ambassadors on 6th January 2025, Macron warned against succumbing to a 'spirit of defeat'. This is as much of an imperative—avoiding Europe succumbing to its own shadows—as his earlier warning about the eventual death of the EU. The answer is found in reconciling the two. Glimpses of a new dawn If Grey’s 'lamps going out' comment resonates today, that is not necessarily because the world is on the brink of war, even though escalating conflict and big-power rivalry are a significant part of the crepuscular backdrop. More precisely, it captures the sense of the lights going out on a fading order born on the second world war battlefields of Europe and enshrined in the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. For decades, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have subscribed to the form—and broadly, the substance—of a values-based partnership of committed allies with deep shared interests. Donald Trump, along with the wider shift away from established Western liberalism, is putting an end to all that. Already in his first term in office he referred to the EU as a 'foe' and Brussels as being 'like a hellhole'. Since then, his willingness to tear up institutional conventions and norms has only grown. His 'America first' designs on Greenland, his demand that NATO partners spend 5% of GDP on defence and his moves towards unilateral trade tariffs (initially on others, seemingly with the EU up next) all confirm it. Darkness does indeed seem to be falling for some as-yet indeterminate period stretching into the future. This paper has made one argument with two sides. On the one side, it has made the case for recognising that the old transatlantic light is failing; that interests and values in America and Europe are diverging and that romantic notions about the Atlantic community have had their day. It has shown that European publics recognise that—whether they regret this or, in the case of Europe’s own rising radical right especially, view it as a positive. On the other side, we have argued for seeing the light and shade. Europe’s future is not uniformly dark, it is not doomed to succumb to Trump’s will, and the continent has a reasonable degree of agency over what comes next. America’s president sees everything as negotiable, so Europeans need to be ready to negotiate hard in support of their interests—on Russia and Ukraine, Europe’s disposition towards China, or its wider security and prosperity. Readers should take away from this paper a sober sense of the deep divisions the polling exposes, and their vulnerability to exploitation by a Trump administration whose disdain for European cooperation and integration is obvious. The risks of bilateralised relations, fragmentation, and even paralysis are real. Leaders should guard against them assiduously rather than seeking short-term gains by, for example, breaking with common European positions. No European country has the strength to deal on equal terms with the US administration. And European political and economic interests are so interlinked that one country’s problems will almost inevitably become problems for others, too. But it is on the opportunities, those bright spots in the darkness, that this paper concludes. ECFR’s polling shows room for collaboration across a broad coalition of voters that see Europe’s power and resilience (as well as its relationships with the US and China) in somewhat different ways, but not without hope. By bringing together Euro-optimists, Euro-realists and Euro-mortalists especially, leaders can rally together those Europeans with at least some degree of faith in the project. The weeks since Trump’s second election win have brought glimpses of European leaders, in Brussels and national capitals alike, grasping towards those coalitions. The French, German and Polish governments—whose political bases are dominated by 'Euro-optimists' and 'Euro-realists'—have started exploring new diplomatic formats based on their 'Weimar triangle', but also taking in Italy and in some cases Spain. Poland, the Nordic countries and the UK are working towards a coalition of forces aimed at sustaining Ukraine’s fightback. Even Meloni has declared herself willing to play a constructive bridging role between a demoralised Europe and an antagonistic Trump on topics like tariffs. A new emphasis on ambitious but hard-nosed collective action also marks recent interventions by EU leaders and upcoming developments like the European Commission’s white paper on defence. Speaking in Davos, von der Leyen announced that the EU would be pragmatic towards Trump’s US, but would 'always stand by our principles; to protect our interests and uphold our values.' Antonio Costa, the new European Council president, has told the EU ambassadors that 'despite geopolitical challenges, this is not a world for us to despair, but a world with opportunities for the European Union.' Their contribution, as well as that of Mark Rutte as NATO secretary general, will be vital to shaping European responses alongside national leaders. The transatlantic twilight is a moment of opportunity and clarification. It forces European leaders to relearn the art of pragmatism in foreign policy. It allows them to clarify to their voters the stakes associated with the different kinds of peace for Ukraine, and with Europe’s excessive dependency on the US for security. And it may let pro-European parties renew their bonds with voters by distinguishing themselves from the Trumpian far-right. All of that, however, will require a mix of practicality and creativity. It also allows Europeans to take the lead in moulding a new transatlantic relationship. This might well be less ideals- and values-based than what came before, and more based on calculations of concrete benefits. It will probably be a more distant one, in which Europe must more often defend its interests when they come under pressure from American actions. And it will certainly need to be one with more European leadership, initiative and responsibility for the continent’s own fate. There is not just peril but also possibility in this reset. The twilight can yet become a new dawn. Methodology This report is based on a public opinion poll of adult populations (aged 18 and over) conducted in November 2024 in 14 European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom). The overall sample included 18,507 respondents. The polls were conducted by Datapraxis and YouGov in Bulgaria (1,014; 7-29 November); Denmark (1,099; 7-26 November); France (2,017; 7 November-2 December); Germany (2,003; 7-28 November); Hungary (1,023; 7-28 November); Italy (1,531; 7-29 November); Poland (1,063; 7-29 November); Portugal (1,000; 7-27 November); Romania (1,010; 7-26 November); Spain (1,030; 7-27 November); Switzerland (1,082; 8-26 November), and the UK (2,073; 7-26 November). Polls were conducted by Datapraxis and Norstat in Estonia (1,061; 11 November – 5 December); and by DataPraxis and Rating Group in Ukraine (1,501; 15-20 November). In Ukraine, polls were conducted by DataPraxis and Rating Group (1,501; 15-20 November) via telephone interviews (CATI), with respondents selected using randomly generated telephone numbers. The data was then weighted according to basic demographics. Fully accounting for the population changes due to the war is difficult, but adjustments have been made to account for the territory under Russian occupation. This, combined with the probability-based sampling approach, strengthens the representativeness of the survey and generally reflects the attitudes of Ukrainian public opinion in wartime conditions. The segmentation into different 'EU camps' used in this paper is based on responses to two questions: 'Which of the following best reflects your view on the EU’s global standing?' (a) The EU is a power that can deal on equal terms with global powers, such as the US or China; (b) The EU is NOT a power that can deal on equal terms with global powers, such as the US or China; (c) Don’t know 'Looking ahead, how likely do you think it is that in the next twenty years the European Union will fall apart?' (a) Very likely, (b) Fairly likely, (c) Fairly unlikely, (d) Very unlikely, (e) Don't know Respondents were sorted into four different categories based on the following criteria: 'Euro-optimists'—if they consider the EU a power and think it’s unlikely to fall apart 'Euro-pessimists' —if they consider the EU as NOT a power and think it’s likely to fall apart 'Euro-realists'—if they consider the EU as NOT a power but think it’s unlikely to fall apart 'Euro-mortalists'— if they consider the EU as a power but think it’s likely to fall apart The remaining respondents—who responded 'Don’t know' to at least one of the two questions—were not put into any of these five categories, and were instead considered as 'The rest'.

Is Trump Giving US Companies The Green Light On Bribery? – Analys...	Trump’s suspension of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act turns back the clock 50 years on global anti-corruption efforts. By Peter Fabricius United States (US) President Donald Trump’s executive order this week suspending the operation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) will likely be felt particularly sharply in Africa, where corruption drains about US$10 billion a year. Some estimates are as high as US$140 billion. The FCPA was introduced in 1977 and prohibits US companies and individuals – as well as foreign entities with a US connection – from bribing foreign public officials. The ‘connection’ can be as minor as a telephone call, email or text sent or received from the US in a corrupt business deal, giving the law its broad scope. David Lewis, who founded South Africa’s Corruption Watch, told Currency that the FCPA was ‘the most effective anti-corruption instrument in the world, without a doubt,’ and said suspending it would definitely increase corruption. He was referring mainly to South Africa, but the act has been used to prosecute many cases across Africa. Trump suspended the FCPA for 180 days pending a review of its operations. He said the act had been increasingly ‘stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States.’ It had done so by reducing US companies’ competitiveness in ‘gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or assets.’ FCPA prohibits US companies, individuals and foreign entities with a US connection, from bribing foreign public officials In other words, Trump was saying the FCPA’s criminalisation of US companies that bribe foreign governments was putting them at a disadvantage against companies from other countries that don’t criminalise bribery. This decision was similar to other orders Trump has issued in his first three weeks in office, slashing restrictions, regulations and other controls on US businesses – and in doing so, putting their interests ahead of those of ordinary people in America and beyond. ‘[The FCPA] was the first law of its kind in the world,’ Transparency International (TI) said this week. It said that by suspending it, Trump had delivered a major blow to the fight against foreign bribery worldwide. ‘It risks undermining decades of progress in tackling cross-border corruption and puts international stability at risk. This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business actors around the world who until now feared US criminal pursuits.’ TI said the US had long been respected as a global leader in foreign bribery enforcement. In 1997 the FCPA was internationalised with the adoption of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 parties. According to TI Chair François Valérian, ‘US enforcement of the FCPA has long been a gold standard in the fight against corruption. Weakening it will empower wrongdoers and send a dangerous signal that bribery is back on the table. Foreign bribery is by no means, as suggested by last night’s decision, a routine business practice.’ Using the FCPA, the US has long been respected as a global leader in foreign bribery enforcement As an example of FCPA achievements, TI cited a recent case where a multinational mining company was found to have bribed officials in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria to secure lucrative business deals. Since the company was US-listed, authorities could take action for violating the FCPA. This appeared to reference the US Department of Justice (DOJ) case brought against the Swiss-based mining conglomerate Glencore for violations of the FCPA and commodity price manipulation. The DoJ said in 2022 that, among other bribery schemes, between 2007 and 2018, Glencore and its subsidiaries paid about US$79.6 million in bribes to obtain and retain business with state-owned and state-controlled entities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea. This included corrupt deals to buy crude oil and petrol from Nigeria’s state-owned oil company and to win crude oil contracts. ‘In the DRC, Glencore admitted that it conspired to and did corruptly offer and pay approximately $27.5 million to third parties, while intending for a portion of the payments to be used as bribes to DRC officials, in order to secure improper business advantages,’ the DoJ said. Glencore pleaded guilty and agreed to pay over US$1.1 billion to settle the cases. The FCPA has also been used to prosecute many other cases in Africa. Last December consulting firm McKinsey’s South African subsidiary was ordered to pay over US$122 million to settle an FCPA case in which the company bribed Transnet and Eskom officials to win contracts. This was part of the state capture saga under former president Jacob Zuma. McKinsey South Africa was ordered to pay over US$122 million in an FCPA case relating to Transnet and Eskom In 2023 the multinational mining company Rio Tinto agreed to pay a US$15 million fine under the FCPA for paying US$10.5 million to a Guinean government official to retain certain mining rights in that country. In 2018 the US DoJ used the FCPA to indict Jean Boustani, an executive of the international shipbuilding company Privinvest, for bribing, among others, then Mozambican finance minister Manuel Chang. This was to authorise US$2 billion of loans to Chang’s government to buy patrol and tuna fishing boats. Chang was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering in a New York court last year, and was sentenced to eight and a half years in jail, plus a US$7 million fine, with more to come. Adriano Nuvunga, Director of Mozambique’s Centre for Democracy and Human Rights and former chair of the Forum de Monitoria do Orçamento (Forum for Monitoring the Budget), which pursued Chang in the courts, lamented Trump’s decision to suspend the FCPA. ‘In vulnerable regions like Africa, especially Mozambique’s extractive sector, corruption has long exploited natural resources, damaging local communities,’ he told ISS Today. ‘Mozambique is already suffering from the consequences of corruption – embezzlement, mismanagement, underdevelopment, environmental degradation and widespread poverty. ‘Suspending the FCPA will only encourage further exploitation and corruption without accountability. Instead of promoting transparency and justice, this decision weakens crucial protections for human rights and sustainable development. It’s a dangerous step backward that deserves global condemnation.’ With a stroke of his overworked pen, Trump turned the clock back about half a century to an era when corporations mostly from the industrialised north routinely bribed officials mostly from the developing south to win natural resources or infrastructure contracts. Bribes that some European governments even allowed their companies to claim as tax deductions.

The EU And ASEAN Aim For A Smooth Landing In Aviation Cooperation...	By Louise Shania Sabela The Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement (CATA) between the EU and ASEAN is reshaping air travel between the two major economic regions. CATA is the first-ever air transport agreement negotiated between two regional blocs, replacing more than 140 bilateral air service agreements with a unified framework designed to simplify operations for airlines on both sides. It aims to create a smoother, more integrated aviation market, encouraging better collaboration and increased efficiency. While the vision is ambitious, the path to realising it is not without obstacles — especially for ASEAN. Achieving the vision requires balancing regional integration with national sovereignty. Article 1 of the Chicago Convention (1944) grants every state complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. As the legal foundation for CATA, this principle underscores the rights of individual nations to regulate and control activities within their airspace, including granting or denying access to foreign carriers (Article 6). The convention also ensures fair competition by establishing safeguards against market distortions and emphasising financial transparency among carriers (Article 44(f)). While the Chicago Convention respects each state’s sovereignty and allows them to negotiate access independently, varying national approaches have resulted in challenges for regulatory harmonisation. Under Presidential Regulation No. 12/2016, Indonesia applies the ‘open skies’ framework to only five cities — Jakarta, Bali, Medan, Surabaya and Makassar. This reflects a protectionist policy designed to safeguard domestic airlines, such as Garuda Indonesia, from regional competition. The regulation enables open access to these key airports, but access to other cities remains restricted and subject to bilateral negotiations — even for other ASEAN states. Airlines like AirAsia have had to establish separate regional units in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Their operations are mostly restricted to flights originating from their home countries. ASEAN–Europe connectivity is still largely dependent on country-pair agreements due to fragmented regional aviation policies. This raises questions about how international trade law principles regulate CATA, since CATA aims to improve air travel efficiency and create a more integrated aviation market between Europe and Southeast Asia. Academics argue that CATA is likely to benefit the EU more than ASEAN due to protective aviation regulations, insufficient supply, limited infrastructure and differing priorities in ASEAN countries. This imbalance allows EU carriers greater operational flexibility and strategic reach, while ASEAN airlines remain constrained by national-level restrictions. One of these imbalances is caused by the non-existence of single market regulations in ASEAN. ASEAN is still in the process of developing its ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM), which was initially set to launch in 2015. Two agreements — the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services and the Multilateral Agreement on the Full Liberalisation of Passenger Air Services — have so far been ratified. While this marks progress, other challenges hinder the full optimisation of ASAM. In Indonesia and the Philippines, domestic markets are much larger than international markets. Indonesia’s domestic market alone surpasses the entire international market of Singapore. This disparity is further reflected in the rankings of ASEAN airlines by seat capacity, where carriers from Indonesia dominate. Given these dynamics, airlines from Indonesia and the Philippines naturally prioritise serving their expansive domestic markets. This divergence in market orientation influences their positions in regional aviation negotiations. Unlike the EU, where train and road networks provide connectivity, ASEAN countries rely heavily on aviation to link their markets. Vietnam struggles with insufficient domestic flight routes and a severe shortage of aircraft, both of which threaten to limit its role to that of a destination for international carriers. Vietnam’s airlines also face financial instability, which has led to operational downsizing. Both Pacific Airlines and Bamboo Airways have had to reduce their fleets due to economic pressures. This shortage of aircraft affects the availability of both domestic and international services, further limiting Vietnam’s ability to capitalise on the opportunities presented by CATA. In Laos, airport infrastructure presents a significant challenge. The quality of air transport infrastructure in Laos was rated at 4 on a scale from 1 to 7, in comparison to the global average of 4.55 points. These infrastructure limitations can impede the ASAM from realising its full potential. Singapore has taken the approach of focusing entirely on the international market. Airlines operating from Singapore benefit from unrestricted Fifth Freedom Rights allowing an airline from one country to transport passengers or cargo between two foreign countries as part of its international route, which Singapore has successfully bilaterally negotiated. Singapore’s success shows the potential advantages of more open aviation policies as a model for other ASEAN countries considering deeper cooperation to boost their own aviation sectors. This approach not only enhances connectivity but also stimulates economic growth by attracting more airlines and increasing passenger traffic. To address these challenges, the EU has been actively supporting ASEAN through initiatives like the ARISE Plus Civil Aviation Project. This program focuses on improving regulatory capabilities, aligning safety standards with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines and enhancing air traffic management efficiency across ASEAN member states. The project also aims to establish mechanisms for mutual recognition of certifications and licenses, enabling smoother cross-border operations. Member states must align their aviation policies with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices and commit to transparent, non-discriminatory regulatory practices. The development of an ASEAN Air Traffic Management Master Plan seeks to create a seamless ASEAN sky similar to the EU’s integrated airspace. Investing in infrastructure and developing capacity-building programs are practical steps forward, with the EU’s Global Gateway Initiative providing strategic funding and expertise.

The Emerging Of Close Produce Model In Global Manufacturing – Ana...	By Zhao Zhijiang The impact of the wave of de-globalization on global trade is most directly felt, but its influence on the production and layout models of multinational companies is even more profound. During the peak of globalization, multinational companies focused on 'profit' and pursued profit maximization. However, the global market no longer exists as it once did, and outdated theories are simply ineffective. Therefore, adjustments are inevitable. The question is, how should these adjustments be made? Based on research on the changes in global market space and tracking the process of de-globalization, ANBOUND has proposed a new theory for multinational companies, namely 'close produce'. This theory represents the restructuring and re-layout of large multinational corporations. Regardless of the company, even if they do not adopt this model now, they will eventually follow its path. While supply chain layouts in the future will still prioritize 'profit', 'resilience' will be even more important. The global supply chain restructuring and the widespread adoption of the close produce model by multinational companies are actually not favorable to China's development. This is their voluntary adjustment, driven by an internal motivation to distance themselves from the Chinese market, which can even be seen as another way to explain 'decoupling'. Of course, some Chinese companies expanding overseas are also adopting the same model to expand their growth space. However, geopolitical pressures between the U.S. and China, as well as other factors will create significant uncertainty, disrupting the growth of Chinese companies overseas. I. Supply Chain Adjustments of Multinational Corporations in the Era of De-globalization The statement 'globalization is dead' is not an exaggeration, but an objective reality. As early as the beginning of this century, when protests against the World Trade Organization emerged around the world, a senior researcher at ANBOUND predicted that an era of fragmented global space had arrived. The world would become increasingly regionalized, the United States would move toward isolationism, and geopolitical crises would arise globally. Unfortunately, such predictions have now become a reality. The U.S.-China trade war in 2018, the global lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022, the Israel-Hamas conflict in 2023, and Donald Trump's second term leading the U.S. toward isolationism are all clear examples of this. Multinational companies that are accustomed to the benefits of globalization are the ones that struggle to adapt to the changes in the world order. In the past, multinational companies centered around 'profit', aiming for profit maximization and engaging in production and layout on a global scale. This was also the core idea of mainstream economic and supply chain theories. For example, Canadian economist Stephen Hymer and his American mentor Charles P. Kindleberger believed that multinational companies could leverage their monopolistic advantages in advanced technologies, industrial organization, and other areas to earn excess profits through direct foreign investment. Whenever the production costs in a particular place or region were lower, these multinational companies were highly motivated to set up industries and production there. Following this theory, during the peak of globalization, multinational companies made huge profits. Particularly, the period from the end of the Cold War in the 1990s to the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 is often referred to by some scholars as the 'golden age' of multinational corporations and supply chains. In less than two decades, political barriers between nations were eliminated, and political barriers were dismantled, paving the way for markets to play a decisive role in global industrial and supply chains. The result was the combination of low-cost labor from developing economies with abundant capital from developed economies, leading to production, with products easily crossing borders multiple times. From a business perspective, this meant that multinational companies could allocate resources globally based on economic costs. However, times have changed, and the world today is vastly different, now heavily constrained by factors such as geopolitics. Multinational companies, in their pursuit of extreme cost-efficiency and profit, are now facing attacks. Take the Red Sea crisis, which stemmed from the Israel-Hamas conflict, as an example. According to The New York Times, many companies are facing difficult decisions: If shipping companies want their vessels to use the Red Sea route, they risk being attacked by Houthi militants from Yemen and must pay significantly higher insurance fees. Alternatively, they could take a detour around Africa, adding over 6,400 km to their journey, which would increase travel time by 10 days and consume more fuel. Both options are less than ideal and raise costs, which will ultimately likely be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Therefore, multinational companies have started to realize that the traditional production and supply chain theories are outdated and need to be adjusted. Even professors from business schools, who have long been secluded in their ivory towers, admit that de-globalization has dismantled the classic textbooks used in classrooms. Companies need to change their models to adapt to the new global economic situation, and multinational production has evolved from a purely corporate behavior to a spatial production behavior constrained by complex spatial factors. In this process, geopolitical costs within transaction costs have risen significantly, and changes in costs due to spatial conflicts and contradictions have made geopolitics a risk factor that needs constant adjustment. Geopolitics now drives and even determines changes in overall costs. If companies only consider 'profits' without focusing on 'resilience', then in today's era of de-globalization, multinational corporations not only fail to make profits, but also cannot ensure their sustainable operation. Based on tracking research and analysis of the de-globalization trend, researchers at ANBOUND believe that there will be three significant changes in supply chains: First, supply chains will be shortened. In the new geopolitical and geo-economic environment, long supply chains represent uncertainty and high risk, making security and stability a higher priority than cost. Consequently, shortening supply chains has become a key trend in supply chain restructuring. Second, supply chains will place greater emphasis on regionalization. As supply chains face disruptions, distance from customers and markets introduces new risks, with companies potentially losing orders due to rising uncertainties. In response, global supply chains will likely be regionalized, forming multiple, distributed regional supply chain systems that cater to local market demands. Third, supply chains may become more selective. What was once a straightforward business model is now heavily influenced by geopolitical factors, including national security, alliances, ideology, values, and human rights. As a result, we are likely to see the emergence of selective supply chains in the future, where such factors shape global industry networks. In fact, since the Obama administration began promoting 'nearshoring' and 'friendshoring', some multinational companies have already been taking steps towards 'shortening' and 'regionalizing' their production layouts. This shift is also closely tied to the United States' desire to reduce its dependence on China. Mark Green, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security, Migration, and International Economic Policy, once proposed the 'Western Hemisphere Nearshoring Act'. Green claimed that the bill would achieve three goals at once: reducing America's reliance on Chinese manufacturing, creating more jobs and economic growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and alleviating the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border by reducing the number of illegal immigrants. Most importantly, this initiative would provide the United States with an effective path to counter China's growing influence in LAC. As for 'friendshoring', it is designed to achieve the aforementioned objectives. The term 'friend' refers to countries that share similar values with the U.S., including traditional allies. In this way, multinational companies have more options: they can establish supply chains in LAC or set up production in European countries like Denmark and Sweden, which are closer to the U.S. East Coast. Some viewpoints suggest that, despite the U.S. vigorously promoting 'friendshoring', Chinese capital still plays a crucial role. In early September 2023, at the annual meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, research presented by experts showed that despite changes in global trade patterns, the U.S. supply chain remains heavily dependent on China, albeit in a less direct manner. The dependence on Chinese supply chains has shifted from being overt to covert, but the path to fully breaking this dependency remains difficult. As a result, some commentators argue that whether it is 'decoupling' or 'de-risking', and whether outsourcing is 'nearshore' or 'friendshore', the U.S. and the West will not be able to truly break free from their reliance on Chinese supply chains, hence that this policy is unlikely to have a fundamentally 'negative impact' on China. However, a senior researcher at ANBOUND stated that the process of de-globalization will be very long and complex, and the adjustments in industrial chains, as a manifestation of this fundamental trend, will not follow a simple, linear path. It is crucial to summarize and analyze the stage-specific characteristics. Regarding the current wave of industrial chain adjustments, the most effective way to summarize its phase characteristics is not simply 'nearshoring' nor just 'friendshoring', but rather 'close produce', which combines certain aspects of both and presents a highly diversified form, a concept introduced by ANBOUND in August 2022. It serves as a macro tool for understanding and analyzing the adjustments in industrial chains within the de-globalization process. II. The Basic Theory and Core Principles of 'Close Produce' 'Close produce' refers to the deployment of major component industries around central markets and centers of productivity, forming a production system that is as closely integrated as possible. The term 'close' here has two aspects, namely spatial and social-environmental. It means that companies should choose to deploy and organize production in regions with minimal conflict and contradictions. While multinational companies in the past prioritized 'profit', under the 'close produce' theory, businesses must now strategically organize around three core factors: technology, capital, and consumption, all with the goal of reducing overall production and operational costs. (1) Technology as the core to reduce monopoly costs: As global competition intensifies, advanced technology plays a crucial role in leading the way and enhancing the comprehensive strength of multinational companies. On one hand, it helps businesses improve production processes and equipment, increasing production efficiency; on the other hand, it enhances product design, improving product quality and added value. However, the current global level of technological monopolies continues to rise, hindering the multinational flow and global sharing of advanced technologies. According to data analysis from 2004 to 2017, Associate Professor Lu Bing of the Beijing Normal University and his collaborators found that, compared to other products, high-tech products are more concentrated in certain countries, exhibiting higher levels of monopoly. This concentration has shown a self-reinforcing trend in recent years. For example, even in the past common bicycle production, there is a monopoly on gear mechanisms, with just two companies controlling the market. In semiconductor production, apart from the absolute monopoly of high-end photolithography machines, there are also numerous technological monopolies, such as photolithography resist chemicals, which are mainly monopolized by two companies from the U.S. and Japan. Therefore, multinational companies need to organize around the core of technology, focusing not only on their own technological research and innovation but also on strengthening cooperation with countries that possess advanced technologies. The goal is to narrow the gap with technological hubs as much as possible, maximize sustained technological leadership, and reduce monopoly costs. (2) Laying out surrounding the core of capital to reduce financing costs: This not only allows for broader financing channels, including stock issuance, bond issuance, etc., but also access to more financial support, thereby beneficial for global business expansion, research and innovation, and other strategic investments. However, in recent years, the global capital allocation pattern has become rather different due to dramatic changes in global conditions. Data shows that as of February 2025, the stock market capitalization rankings of various countries and regions are as follows: the United States with USD 60 trillion, ranked first; China with USD 10 trillion; Japan with USD 6.5 trillion; Hong Kong with USD 5.4 trillion; India with USD 4.5 trillion; the UK with USD 3.2 trillion; Canada with USD 3.2 trillion; Germany with USD 2.5 trillion; Australia with USD 1.6 trillion; and South Korea with USD 1.6 trillion. At the same time, the overall scale of global capital flows has shrunk. From 2022 to 2023, global capital inflows, compared to 2017 to 2019, dropped from 5.8% of global GDP to 4.4%, or from USD 4.5 trillion to USD 4.2 trillion. The trend of capital outflows follows the same pattern. In addition, the allocation structure of global capital has also undergone dynamic changes. From 2022 to 2023, the U.S. attracted 41% of global capital inflows, while its outflow share rose from 14% to 21%. China's capital flow decreased significantly, and the capital flows of financial centers also dropped sharply. Therefore, in the future, multinational enterprises will need to take various measures for industrial layout based on the new trend of global capital allocation, shortening the distance to the capital core and reducing financing costs. (3) Laying around the core of consumption to reduce logistics costs: This can make product sales more effective. Since products can reach consumers more quickly, it reduces distribution costs and time. On the other hand, it helps companies better grasp market dynamics, understand changes in consumer demand, and technological shifts, enabling the adjustment of production and marketing strategies when needed. However, more critically, this can significantly reduce the enormous costs of transportation and storage. During the era of globalization, global shipping costs continue to rise due to increasingly expensive human resources, threats from wars and conflicts, and rising port and canal tolls. The impact of geographical distance on costs has never been as significant as it is today. On February 6, Maersk released its 2024 financial report, reporting a revenue of USD 55.48 billion, an 8.65% year-on-year increase, and a net profit of USD 6.23 billion, up 59.47% compared to the previous year. It is worth noting that even though the Red Sea crisis is easing due to changes in the situation between Israel and Hamas, Maersk and other container shipping giants remain cautious about returning to the Red Sea. Many European shippers still refuse to ship goods via the Red Sea due to security concerns. Therefore, the layout around the core of consumption has become an inevitable choice for multinational enterprises for safety and stability reasons. In addition, 'close produce' has four other conditions: (1) Ideological emphasis on the same type of people; (2) Market space emphasis on consistency; (3) Logistics costs being relatively low; (4) Proportion of production costs in total costs being reduced. Considering the first condition, in recent years, as a set of values and ideas, ideology has gradually gained prominence worldwide. As it stands, ideology is manifested in the rise of nationalist thoughts, driving a broader politicization, securitization, and ethnification, becoming an objective fact that all countries and companies must pay attention to. Nationalism emphasizes the protection of national and ethnic interests and seeks equal economic rights and independent development. Economic nationalism is reflected in economics characterized by trade disputes and regional economies, and cultural nationalism is characterized by the protection and revival of national or local cultures. Meanwhile, political nationalism, marked by national division and ethnic opposition, is also on the rise, further strengthening economic and cultural nationalism. The experiences of Chinese companies in India serve as a clear example of this. A well-known Chinese mobile phone brand was forced to negotiate with a local Indian company to sell the majority of its shares and form a joint venture to comply with India's 'government requirements'. In 2023, India's law enforcement agencies arrested several senior executives of the Chinese mobile company's local office on charges of 'money laundering', including the temporary CEO and CFO. Such experiences mean that the global industrial layout in the future will largely have to be based on ideology, or else various uncertainties and risks will arise. Taking the U.S. as another example, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath pointed out that in recent years, geopolitical risks have risen, and the free flow of capital and goods is facing increasing threats. Geopolitics has widened trade rifts between groups. It has also caused the fragmentation of global supply chains, which in turn affects global trade and investment activities. According to WTO statistics, in the first half of 2023, the share of intermediate goods trade in global trade, which serves as an indicator of global supply chain activities, was 48.5%, 2.5 percentage points lower than the average of the previous three years. According to UN polling results also indicate that the proportion of parts trade between the U.S. and countries with similar political views fell to 73% in 2020, but this figure rose to 74% in 2022 and reached 77% in 2023. The WTO warns that signs of global supply chain fragmentation have begun to appear and will continue to pose a threat to global trade. Looking at the second condition, the market order and value principles followed by both parties are similar or the same, especially in terms of law and finance. In recent years, due to differences in market and value principles, legal risks for enterprises have become increasingly common. These risks mainly fall into four categories: (1) Market access risks, including tariff barriers, environmental standards, and the like; (2) Tax compliance risks, involving tax disputes and penalties; (3) Intellectual property management compliance risks, including accusations or lawsuits related to intellectual property infringement; (4) Human resources compliance risks, including labor contract disputes and project management issues. To provide an example, according to data cited in the Blue Book on Overseas Rights Protection of Chinese Enterprises (2023-2024), U.S. regulatory authorities have detained 9,791 batches of goods, with a value of approximately USD 35.6 billion, including electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, and industrial and manufacturing raw materials. It should be noted that countries around the world are at different stages of economic development, resulting in different legal systems and financial environments. Among them, the First World, primarily developed countries, has already established relatively complete legal systems and formed relatively open financial environments. The Second World, mainly developing countries, has established numerous legal systems but with more government control. The Third World is advancing industrial internationalization processes, with fewer legal and financial restrictions. The Fourth World, on the other hand, is relatively least developed in terms of legal and financial environments. Therefore, in the future, multinational enterprises will tend to choose countries or regions with market principles and orders that are similar to their own in order to reduce various risks, whether visible or hidden, in their production and operations. This will, in turn, create the basic conditions for a common market when globalization rises again. From the perspective of the third condition, based on the aforementioned factors, multinational companies may choose locations as close as possible to significantly reduce logistics costs. In recent years, with changes in the global economic situation, international logistics costs have experienced dramatic fluctuations, even showing a continuous upward trend. This is mainly due to increasingly expensive labor resources, threats of war and conflict, as well as various fees such as port and canal passage fees, ship maintenance fees, cargo insurance fees, and fuel costs. The impact of spatial distance on costs is becoming more and more significant. Therefore, multinational companies are bound to lean towards selecting countries or regions that are as close as possible. The United States promotes 'nearshoring', encouraging manufacturing to concentrate in North America through agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Inflation Reduction Act. Mexico benefits from these policy advantages and has seized development opportunities. Domestic manufacturing continues to experience high growth, with exports significantly increasing and becoming the largest source of goods imports for the United States. From 2021 to 2023, Mexico's foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow grew at an average rate of 8.6%, mainly flowing into sectors benefiting from the global industrial chain restructuring, such as transportation equipment, metals, computer equipment, and chemicals. In 2023, the share of FDI inflow into manufacturing industries was 41%, 13%, 9%, and 8%, respectively.' Looking at the fourth condition, production costs are placed last because smart factories are becoming increasingly common, which has led to a significant decrease in the proportion of labor costs in the total cost of finished products. In the past, one of the main considerations for developed countries to transfer industries to underdeveloped or developing countries was the cheap labor costs. However, as these underdeveloped and developing countries' economies have grown, their labor costs have risen year by year, significantly narrowing the gap with the labor costs in developed countries. Data shows that labor costs in China have now risen to about three times those of countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and India. At the same time, labor costs in Southeast Asia have also been rising. Since last year, countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia have all raised their minimum wage standards. Starting in July of last year, Vietnam's national minimum wage increased by an average of 6%. In major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, workers can now earn a minimum wage of VND 4.96 million (about USD 190) per month, an 80% increase compared to 10 years ago. Vietnam has set minimum wages in four regions, with wages in large cities being over 40% higher than in the least developed areas. Thailand plans to raise the minimum wage to THB 400 baht (about USD 11) per day, which is about a 14% increase from the current 300-350 baht. This new minimum wage means workers' monthly salary will be at least around USD 230. The Philippines has raised the minimum wage in the Greater Manila area since last summer, from PHP 610 (about USD 10.5) to PHP 645, a 6% increase, with a monthly salary of around USD 240. Malaysia already raised its minimum monthly wage from MYR 1,200 (about USD 254) to MYR 1,500 (about USD 340) in 2022, a 25% increase. It should be noted that while some analysts in these countries view wage increases positively, multinational companies may hesitate to establish operations locally in order to save costs. For example, business communities in Vietnam have indicated that due to concerns about rising labor costs, more and more companies are considering moving to areas outside the major cities, leading to instability in business development. At the same time, with the rapid development of modern internet technology and artificial intelligence, smart factories are becoming increasingly common. Traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany and the U.S. have made many explorations and practical attempts based on the concept of smart factories. China, along with other global industrial manufacturing giants, has also strongly promoted this development, introducing various digital development plans and documents. This has greatly facilitated the expansion of the scale and scope of global smart factories, further reducing the demand for labor. In the context of de-globalization, close produce represents a global production and supply chain layout and organization model that is different from the profit-centered approach of the past. Multinational companies will make remarkable reorganizations and realignments in the global market. This will be a significant structural adjustment and is likely to be accompanied by technological advancements, such as the establishment of more intelligent, labor-saving super factories. This adjustment is inevitable and may induce responses from the capital markets. Therefore, as a trend that has already occurred, it is crucial to pay attention to it and take prompt action. III. The Impact and Lessons of Close Produce to China The global supply chain restructuring and the increasing adoption of the close produce model by multinational companies are actually not beneficial to China's development. This can be viewed from two aspects. The first is from the perspective of multinational companies. This is a voluntary adjustment on their part, driven by an internal motivation to distance themselves from the Chinese market, which can even be seen as a form of 'decoupling' from another angle. For example, a number of foreign automotive companies are withdrawing from China. While many believe this is due to geopolitical factors, it is also the result of the 'close produce' reason. These companies no longer need to 'exchange market access for technology' familiar to China. Instead, they are reorganizing their production methods around new production hubs. The results of foreign companies adopting the close produce model are already evident. Taking the U.S.-China relationship as an example, China has long been the largest source of imports for the U.S., but this situation has changed. Data from 2024 shows that Mexico has surpassed China for the first time in 20 years, becoming the largest official source of imports for the U.S. In 2023, the U.S. trade deficit with China significantly narrowed, with imports from China dropping by 20% to USD 427.2 billion. While U.S. consumers and businesses have shifted to purchasing auto parts, shoes, toys, and raw materials from Mexico, Europe, South Korea, India, Canada, and Vietnam, a closer examination of trade relations among the U.S., China, Canada, and Mexico reveals an inverse correlation. As the U.S.-China trade relationship declines, trade between Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. is rising. This has effectively created a large 'close produce' zone, effectively creating the world's largest industrial park that can evade geopolitical influences, making it a haven for manufacturing. Despite tariff pressure being applied to Mexico and Canada following Trump's second term, it is clear that, as neighboring countries, these three nations will increasingly integrate their supply chains and production layouts in the future, leaving little to no opportunities or space for China. It has almost been a month since Trump took office as the President of the United States. Amid the intensifying competition between the U.S. and China, researchers at ANBOUND have found that multinational companies that have yet to adopt the 'close produce' model are now considering or accelerating the implementation of this strategy. According to a survey released by the Conference Board earlier this year, by the end of 2024, 85% of global business executives plan to make significant reforms to their supply chains, a 15-percentage-point increase from the previous year, and significantly higher than the levels at the beginning of the pandemic. The survey also shows that 45% of global CEOs believe trade wars represent the biggest geopolitical risk in 2025, a figure that is double that of the previous year. Among them, U.S. executives stand out with 47% listing trade wars as their biggest challenge. Dana Peterson, the Conference Board's chief economist, noted that 'there were a lot of executives, particularly CEOs, focused on changing their supply chains . . . it's returned to the top of the agenda'. The survey by the Conference Board found that executives from Southeast Asian companies are the most concerned about supply chain risks, with 90% of them planning to implement changes. In addition, 34% of business executives plan to use artificial intelligence to optimize supply chain performance and tracking capabilities, while also strengthening supply chain diversification. Recently, Taiwan's regional organization on economic development announced that it has launched several countermeasures and through the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), it will actively assist companies in adjusting their supply chain and investment strategies to ensure stable development. The organization stated that it will offer customized services to Taiwanese businesses looking to reorganize their operations overseas. For Taiwanese companies considering relocating their factories to the U.S. or shifting part of their production processes to Southeast Asia, India, and other countries, the organization will provide relevant information and insights into target markets, including potential states for U.S. investment, local investment laws, market opportunities, and assistance in finding business partners. For those deciding to convert part of their production capacity to supply local markets, it will provide information on local laws and help find potential partners. It will also establish task force teams at its overseas units in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, working with the main office to provide consultation and immediate services to affected businesses. Additionally, it will set up a direct service hotline. Furthermore, it plans to establish a 'Taiwan Investment and Trade Center' in the U.S. to assist Taiwanese businesses in evaluating the investment environment in U.S. states, supply chain relocation options, and local partner networks. It is understood that many Taiwanese businesses are also producing AI servers or related components in Mexico to be closer to the U.S. market. Some sources report that two Taiwanese companies are planning to move their production lines out of Mainland China. This highlights the need for China to pay close attention to the risks previously warned by ANBOUND's researchers, that Mainland China may not be part of the new global structure in the restructured globalization. This is, to some extent, caused by 'close produce'. The second aspect is viewed from the perspective of Chinese companies' overseas operations. 'Close produce' is also a supply chain model highly favored by many Chinese companies expanding abroad. To some extent, policymakers also encourage businesses to adopt this approach. A report from Bloomberg in September last year cited sources revealing that the Chinese government strongly advised the country's automakers to ensure that advanced electric vehicle (EV) technologies remain in China to prevent competitive pressure on the Chinese automotive industry after the loss of the industrial chain. The report stated that relevant departments encouraged these automakers to export component assembly kits to their foreign factories, meaning that key automobile parts would be produced in China and then sent to target markets for final assembly. Chinese automakers were also told not to invest in EV-related projects in India, to protect proprietary technology in China's EV industry and reduce regulatory risks. Furthermore, manufacturers wishing to invest in Turkey were instructed to first notify the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees the EV industry, and relevant foreign affairs departments. In fact, Chinese EV companies, from BYD to Chery, are finalizing plans to build factories in countries such as Spain, Thailand, and Hungary. It is reported that neither the relevant authorities nor the car companies have responded to requests for comment. Bloomberg's analysis, however, believes that this will have a significant impact on the global transfer of automotive manufacturing technologies, especially presenting major obstacles for emerging countries like India. Bloomberg's report perfectly illustrates the two key features of the 'close produce' model: First, in this model, the production of key components is crucial, and these components will be organized in a systematic way; second, 'close produce' means that businesses should choose to deploy and organize production in areas with minimal conflict and contradictions. BYD can be considered one of the most representative enterprises in China practicing 'close produce' models. On July 9, 2024, the Turkish government announced that BYD plans to invest USD 1 billion in building a factory in Turkey with an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles, set to start production in 2026. Data summarized from relevant research indicates that, as of last July, BYD's overseas layout and production capacity plans include 150,000 units in Thailand, 300,000 units in Uzbekistan, 150,000 units in Brazil, about 150,000 units in Hungary, 150,000 units in Turkey, with operations spread across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Central America, South America, Central Europe, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe. These factory-building plans highlight BYD's overseas expansion strategy and indirectly reflect its pursuit of a 'resilient' supply chain. Analyses show that, for example, BYD's strategy in Asia focuses on countries with relatively stable domestic politics and strong automotive industry ecosystems. Among Southeast Asian countries, Thailand, in particular, has experience as Toyota's industrial base in the region, with a well-established industry chain. The Uzbekistan factory not only supplies the local market but also covers Central Asia and, with the Belt and Road railway, it also supplies the Russian market to the north and Iran and other Arab regions to the south. The company currently has no plan to set up factories in Japan and South Korea in East Asia, nor is there a need for them, as Chinese production capacity can cover these regions. This way, its layout in Asia is relatively complete. Though some regions have slightly insufficient capacity, this can be addressed by expanding production. Regarding its market in the Americas, in February 2024, there were reports that BYD was considering building a factory in Mexico. The Wall Street Journal analyzed that such plans indicate that, despite the risks, the enthusiasm within China's automotive industry for expanding into North America is rising. Manufacturing cars in Mexico for the U.S. market would allow automakers to avoid the hefty import tariffs they would face when directly shipping cars from China to the U.S. At the time, BYD stated that the company had no urgent matters regarding new markets to announce. However, by mid-2024, BYD confirmed that it had identified potential factory locations in Mexico and was close to finalizing its decision. Yet, the resurgence of Trump in the presidential race significantly disrupted BYD's plans. Since the second half of 2024, reports have indicated that BYD has abandoned its search for a factory site in Mexico. Although BYD issued a statement saying it had not delayed its decision to build a factory in Mexico, it seems the company's 'Mexico plan' has effectively been put on hold. At the same time, in an effort to align with the new U.S. administration, Mexico has introduced a series of policies aimed at blocking Chinese companies, including BYD, from entering the local market. These policies target not only Chinese automakers but other industries as well. Since 2024, Mexico has imposed tariffs on Chinese steel and low-priced clothing. At the end of last year, Mexico even 'raided' markets where Chinese vendors gathered to sell goods. The newly-elected Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has promised a series of measures to support local manufacturing. It is foreseeable that Mexico will introduce more protectionist policies regarding Chinese and other Asian products. In other words, the path of 'close produce' for Chinese companies in Mexico is facing significant obstacles due to the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. This unfavorable trend for China is likely to manifest in other parts of the world as well. IV. Conclusion 'Close produce' is a new theory and concept for multinational corporations, with a wide-reaching impact. Today's multinational companies no longer only pursue 'profits'; 'resilience' is equally important. Specifically, in the context of de-globalization, the organizational methods and strategic directions of multinational corporations' global layouts focus on systematically addressing three core areas: technology, capital, and consumption, so as to reduce overall production and operational costs. With the deepening of geopolitical tensions and advancements in technology, structural adjustments in multinational companies are inevitable, and these changes will be reflected in the capital markets. When it comes to China's development, on one hand, the withdrawal of multinational companies and global adjustments may weaken China's position in the restructuring of globalization in the future. On the other hand, the process of Chinese companies implementing 'close produce' will be influenced by factors such as U.S.-China geopolitical pressure. As this trend has already emerged, for China, it would be crucial to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions and countermeasures. ______________ Zhijiang Zhao is a Research Fellow for Geopolitical Strategy programme at ANBOUND, an independent think tank.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZuoS0YcuoUPp	2025-02-15T16:43:56-08:00	
India’s AI-Driven Army: Smart Tech, Smarter Warfare – Analysis	India’s AI-powered military transformation is redefining modern warfare, reshaping defence operations, and redefining how battles are fought. In recent years, the Indian military has embarked on a transformative journey by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its operational framework. This technological evolution is reshaping modern warfare, particularly along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan, where enhanced surveillance and rapid threat assessment are paramount. AI is not merely an add-on but a force multiplier that improves situational awareness, decision-making, and operational efficiency across a variety of domains. The integration of AI into the military framework has been multifaceted, spanning surveillance, ground operations, cyber defense, and information warfare. The Indian Army now employs AI-powered surveillance drones, autonomous ground vehicles, cyber defense algorithms, and sophisticated battlefield analytics to enhance operational readiness. This technological infusion is not merely about improving efficiency; it represents a paradigm shift in defense strategy. In an era where algorithms, automation, and information warfare are as critical as traditional firepower, real-time situational awareness becomes indispensable, particularly along India’s volatile borders with China and Pakistan. The Line of Actual Control, a longstanding flashpoint with China that has witnessed heightened tensions since the 2020 Galwan clash, now serves as a testing ground for these innovative defense systems. Advanced machine-learning vision systems onboard autonomous surveillance drones now patrol the rugged, high-altitude terrains, detecting unauthorized incursions with unprecedented precision. This shift from a reactive to a predictive defense posture is transforming military operations. A senior Army official encapsulated the change by noting that AI is enabling forces to pre-empt threats before they escalate. This proactive approach is bolstered by multi-sensor data fusion technology, which consolidates satellite imagery, ground sensor data, and AI-driven analytics into a real-time digital map of potential threats. By merging diverse data streams into a single, coherent operational picture, commanders can make rapid, informed decisions under pressure, significantly enhancing field effectiveness. Artificial intelligence also plays a critical role in securing cyberspace and countering information warfare. Cyberattacks on military networks have become more frequent and sophisticated, with adversaries using state-sponsored hackers, espionage groups, and even AI-generated deepfakes to breach security. In response, India has deployed AI-enhanced cyber defense systems capable of identifying and neutralizing such threats in real time. Central to this digital transformation is the Situational Awareness Module for the Army (SAMA). Developed in collaboration with the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics, SAMA integrates inputs from the Army’s Command and Control Communication System, battlefield surveillance systems, and electronic situational reports to offer a unified, real-time decision-support tool for commanders. This comprehensive integration not only consolidates diverse information sources but also provides a strategic advantage in identifying and countering emerging threats. At the same time, the use of AI in disinformation warfare has led to military planners adapt. Adversaries now deploy AI-generated deepfakes and bot-driven propaganda to manipulate narratives and destabilize security. In response, the Indian Army is developing counter-disinformation measures designed to detect, trace, and neutralize deceptive efforts before they can influence decision-making or compromise public trust. The evolving battlefield now encompasses both physical and digital domains, compelling defense strategists to adopt a multifaceted approach that blends technological innovation with human expertise. Despite these significant advancements, challenges remain. One of the foremost concerns is the reliability of data used to train AI systems. Incomplete or biased datasets can result in misidentifications or erroneous threat assessments, potentially jeopardizing mission outcomes. Ethical debates surrounding autonomous weaponry also persist. Although the Indian Army has embraced AI-driven targeting and analytics, it maintains a strict 'human-in-the-loop' policy for lethal decisions, ensuring that critical judgments remain in the hands of experienced commanders. This commitment to human oversight reinforces the belief that while AI can enhance operational capabilities, it must not replace the instinct and judgment developed through years of field experience. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities further compound these challenges, as adversaries continuously seek ways to manipulate or corrupt AI models through sophisticated cyber techniques. In parallel with these technological strides, India is actively nurturing innovation through initiatives such as iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence). This government-backed program fosters collaboration among the military, startups, and academic institutions, driving rapid advancements in AI and other cutting-edge technologies. The momentum behind this collaborative approach was recently showcased at the AIDef Symposium 2024, where the Indian Army presented 75 AI-powered defense products. This event highlighted the rapid adoption of AI in decision-making, automation, and battlefield analysis, highlighting the nation’s commitment to integrating advanced technology into its defense architecture. Furthermore, the Military College of Telecommunication Engineering in Mhow has been designated as the Army’s AI Center of Excellence, further cementing India’s leadership in research areas such as autonomous warfare, cognitive electronic warfare, and AI-enhanced logistics. Looking to the future, India’s strategic deployment of AI is set to expand into new dimensions. The evolution of AI-powered Unmanned Ground Vehicles promises to introduce autonomous systems capable of patrolling conflict zones, identifying threats, and neutralizing hostile elements with minimal human intervention. Additionally, the application of predictive AI for strategic planning is poised to revolutionize military strategy by analyzing historical conflict data, enemy movements, and geopolitical trends to inform real-time operational decisions. While these technological advancements are profound, military officials should remain mindful of the enduring importance of human judgment. No algorithm can fully replace the instinct and experience honed through years of rigorous training and real-world engagement. Instead, the integration of AI serves as a force multiplier, enhancing capabilities and providing a critical edge on the modern battlefield while ensuring that human oversight remains at the core of strategic decision-making. This balanced approach, which fuses advanced technology with seasoned expertise, is key to navigating the complex and dynamic challenges of contemporary warfare. India’s AI-powered military revolution is reshaping the nation’s defense strategy by merging state-of-the-art technology with traditional combat doctrines. The comprehensive adoption of AI from advanced surveillance and multi-sensor data fusion to robust cyber defense and strategic predictive analytics is creating a dynamic and responsive battlefield environment. As India continues to embrace these innovations, it is poised to achieve a level of operational excellence that could redefine military supremacy in the Indo-Pacific region. Although challenges such as data bias, ethical concerns, and cybersecurity threats persist, the successful fusion of AI with human insight heralds a new era in military operations, one where rapid, informed decision-making and technological agility work in concert to secure national sovereignty in an increasingly complex global landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZu6mFSNniVz8	2025-02-15T16:41:39-08:00	
Banning Khmer Rouge Denialism Is A Bad Move For Cambodia And The ...	By David Hutt Quite soon, possibly to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover in April, Cambodia will pass a new law making it a jailable offense of up to five years to 'deny, trivialize, reject or dispute the authenticity of crimes' committed during that regime’s 1975-79 rule. The bill, requested – and presumably drafted – by Hun Sen, the former prime minister who handed power to his son in 2023, will replace a 2013 law that narrowly focused on denial. The bill’s seven articles haven’t been publicly released, so it remains unclear how some of the terms are to be defined. 'Trivialize' and 'dispute' are broad, and there are works by academics that might be seen as 'disputing' standard accounts of the Khmer Rouge era. Is the 'authentic history' of the bill’s title going to be based on the judgments of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia? If so, there will be major gaps in the narrative. Cambodia’s courts are now so supine that one presumes the 'authentic history' will be whatever the state prosecutor says it is, should a case come to trial. There are two concerns about this. First, the Cambodian government is not being honest about why it’s pushing through this law. There is some scholarly debate about the total number of deaths that occurred between 1975 and 1979, and estimates range from one to three million. There also remain discussions about how much intention there was behind the barbarism or how much the deaths were unintended consequences of economic policy and mismanagement. No nostalgia Yet, in Cambodian society, it’s nearly impossible to find a person these days who is worse off than they were in 1979, so there’s almost no nostalgia for the Khmer Rouge days, and the crude propaganda inflicted on people some fifty years ago has faded. There are no neo-Khmer Rouge parties. 'Socialism', let alone 'communism,' is no longer in the political vocabulary. Even though China is now Phnom Penh’s closest friend, there is no affection for Maoism and Mao among Cambodians. Moreover, as far as I can tell, the 2013 law that covers denialism specifically hasn’t needed to be used too often. Instead, the incoming law is quite obviously 'political', not least because since 1979, Cambodia’s politics has essentially been split into two over the meaning of events that year. For the ruling party – whose old guard, including Hun Sen, were once mid-ranking Khmer Rouge cadre but defected and joined the Vietnam-led 'liberation' – 1979 was Cambodia’s moment of salvation. For today’s beleaguered and exiled political opposition in Cambodia, the invasion by Hanoi was yet another curse, meaning the country is still waiting for true liberation, by which most people mean the downfall of the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) of Hun Sen and his family. The CPP is quite explicit: any opposition equates to supporting the Khmer Rouge. 'You hate Pol Pot but you oppose the ones who toppled him. What does this mean? It means you are an ally of the Pol Pot regime,' Hun Sen said a few years ago, with a logic that will inform the incoming law. Crackdown era The ruling CPP has finished its destructive march through the institutions that began in 2017 and is now marching through the people’s minds. A decade ago, Cambodia was a different sort of place. There was one-party rule, repression, and assassinations, yet the regime didn’t really care what most people thought as long as their outward actions were correct. Today, it’s possible to imagine the Hun family lying awake at night, quivering with rage that someone might be thinking about deviations from the party line. Now, the CPP really does care about banishing skepticism and enforcing obedience. What one thinks of the past is naturally an important part of this. Another troublesome factor is that, with Jan. 27 having been the 80th anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day, there is a flurry of interest globally in trying to comprehend how ordinary people could commit such horrors as the Holocaust or the Khmer Rouge’s genocide. The publication of Laurence Rees’ excellent new book, The Nazi Mind: Twelve Warnings from History, this month reminds us that if 'never again' means anything, it means understanding the mentality of those who supported or joined in mass executions. Yet we don’t learn this from the victims or ordinary people unassociated with the regime, even though these more accessible voices occupy the bulk of the literature. Listen only to the outsider, and one comes away with the impression that almost everyone living under a despotic regime is either a passive resister or an outright rebel. There are a few devotees who find redemption after realizing their own sins – as in the main character in Schindler’s List. Yet no dictatorship can possibly survive without some input from a majority of the population. Thus, it’s more important to learn not 'why they killed,' but 'why we killed' – or 'why we didn’t do anything.' Remembrance is vital The world could do with hearing much more about other atrocities, like Cambodia’s. For many in the West, there is a tendency to think of the Holocaust as a singular evil, which can lead one down the path of culture, not human nature, as an explanation. One lesson of the 1930s was that the people most able to stop the spread of Fascism were the same people least capable of understanding its impulses. The left-wing intelligentsia was content to keep to the position until quite late that Fascism was just a more reactionary form of capitalist exploitation, while conservative elites had a self-interest in thinking it was a tamable version of Marxism. Their materialism, their belief that life could be reduced to the money in your pocket and what you can buy with it, didn’t allow them to see the emotional draw of Fascism. These intense feelings brought the torch parade, the speeches, the marching paramilitaries, the uniforms and symbols, the book burnings, and the transgressiveness of petty revenge and bullying. Perhaps the best definition of Fascism came from Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, who said: 'there lives alongside the twentieth century the tenth or the thirteenth. A hundred million people use electricity and still believe in the magic power of signs and exorcisms.' Likewise, the same people now who were supposed to stop the rise of new despotisms have been as equally ignorant about the power of signs and exorcisms. Europe kidded itself that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin was as much a rationalist as Germany’s Angela Merkel. The notion that all the Chinese Communist Party cared about was economic growth blinded world leaders to its changing aspirations: Han supremacy, jingoism, revenging past humiliations, national rebirth and territorial conquests. In Cambodia, it is possible to find books by or about Khmer Rouge perpetrators, yet the curious reader must exert a good deal of effort. Those who do that find that a temperament for the transgressive and the cynical motivated the Khmer Rouge’s cadres. It won’t be long before the world marks a Holocaust Memorial Day without any survivors present at the commemorations. Cambodia’s horror is more recent history, yet anyone who was a teenager at the time is now in their sixties. We haven’t too long left with that generation. Even aside from the clear political reasons for introducing the new law, it might give historians pause before writing about the more gray aspects of the Khmer Rouge era – or exploring the motives of the perpetrators. Once it becomes illegal to 'condone' the Khmer Rouge’s crimes, whatever that means, revealing what one did as a cadre could skirt the border of criminality. My fear is that the law will confine history to the study of what the Khmer Rouge did, not why it did it. This would be much to the detriment of future generations worldwide.

Why DOGE Should Leave The Penny Alone – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen It’s been reported that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is looking at changing money forever. Musk’s plan? Kill the penny. Killing the penny is a popular idea, and it sounds like a no-brainer when you look at some of the details. After all, when was the last time you actually used a penny? For most people, it’s rare. Hardly anyone carries change anymore. It seems like pennies don’t have much upside. The downside of pennies also seems clear. According to the US Mint, producing one penny costs 2.72¢. In other words, the government loses money when it mints pennies. According to The Hill, 3.23 billion pennies were minted in 2024. Since 1.72¢ is lost per penny minted, that comes to a $56 million loss minting pennies. This seems like low-hanging fruit for a money-saving organization like DOGE. However, I think getting rid of the penny would be a mistake. Why would I defend the penny? Because I don’t want the government to get rid of cash. The last time the government stopped minting a coin was the half-penny in 1857. The US government and its officials aren’t used to halting production of coins, and the American public isn’t used to it either. If our politicians and bureaucrats start taking coins out of circulation, they’ll build up knowledge and experience about the process. Economists call investment knowledge and skills that help improve future productivity in doing a task human capital. I don’t want bureaucrats building human capital in removing coins from circulation because this same knowledge and experience could be used to remove cash more generally. After all, many of the arguments against the penny could apply to the nickel or dime. When was the last time you really needed a dime? And if you’re removing those, it may be time to consider doing away with change in general. You can see how this process could continue. Note, I’m not claiming that once you stop minting pennies, a cashless society becomes inevitable. It just becomes cheaper to go cashless once we build the capital necessary to do away with particular forms of cash. Some slopes are slippery. Some argue that a cashless society is inevitable and that it would be a good thing. You can already see society moving in that direction. In some cities, there are already restaurants that don’t accept cash payments. What percentage of your weekly transactions use cash? But why would a cashless society be a problem? The biggest issue is that it would be easier for Uncle Sam to invade our privacy. In a cashless world, every financial transaction you make is tied to your name. Any government agency with an ill-gotten warrant could scrutinize every payment you’ve made or received. The bigger fear is that the government may someday 'replace' cash in the form of government digital cash. The Trump administration has come out against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), but there’s no telling how future administrations will feel about it. In that case, the warrant point will be moot. The government will simply have access to every transaction you make outside of farmer’s market bartering. Ultimately, I’m not opposed to the idea of trying to minimize waste in minting pennies, either by slowing down production or making the underlying chemical formula even cheaper (something that has already happened in 1982). However, I prefer we hold off on taking 'useless' forms of cash out of our system. There’s no shortage of experts who think we could do without cash as a whole, and making it more difficult for them is more important than making the mint slightly more economical. Long live the penny. About the author: Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.

Is Our Five-Year Nightmare Finally Over? – OpEd	Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s confirmation as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the US is the ultimate repudiation of the Covid policy response. The scheme of lockdown-until-vaccination was the biggest effort of government and industry on a global scale on historical record. It was all designed to transfer wealth to winning industries (pharma, online retail, streaming services, online education), divide and conquer the population, and consolidate power in the administrative state. By 2021, RFK, Jr., had emerged as the world’s most vocal, erudite, and knowledgeable critic of the scheme. In two brilliant books – The Real Anthony Fauci and The Wuhan Cover-Up – he documented the entire enterprise and dated the evolution of the pandemic industry from its postwar inception to the present. There was simply no way to read these books and think about the corporatist cabal in the same way. The circumstances that led to his appointment at HHS are themselves implausible and remarkable. Perceiving President Biden to be a weak candidate – one who had forced masks and shots on the population and brutally censored tech and media – he decided to make a run for president, presuming that there would be an open primary. There wasn’t one, so he was forced into an independent run. That effort was chewed up by the usual political dynamic that befalls every third-party effort – too many ballot-access barriers plus the usual logic of Duverger’s law. That left the campaign in a difficult spot. At the same time, two huge political shifts had become clear. The Democratic Party had become a vessel and a front mainly for the administrative state with a veneer of woke ideology, while the Republican Party was being taken over by refugees from the Democrats, in effect creating a new Trump party out of the remnants of the other two. The rest is legendary. Trump linked up with Elon Musk to do to the federal government what he did when he took over Twitter, taking the company private, gutting the place of embedded federal assets, and firing 4 out of 5 workers. In the midst of this, and faced with a terrifying flurry of legal attacks, Trump dodged an assassin’s bullet. That triggered terrible memories of RFK, Jr.’s father and uncle, and thus sparked discussions about coming together. Within a matter of weeks, we had a new coalition that brought together old antagonists, as many people and groups seemingly in the same instant realized their conjoined interests in cleaning up the corporatist cartel. With the newly freed platform of X to reach the public, MAGA/MAHA/DOGE was born. Trump won and chose RFK, Jr., to lead the most powerful public health agency in the world. The barrier was Senate confirmation, but that was achieved through some incredible triangulation that made it extremely difficult to vote no. In the big picture, you can measure the size of this titanic shift in American politics by the way the votes in the Senate lined up. All Republicans but one voted for the most prominent scion of the Democratic Party to head the health empire while all Democrats voted no. That alone is striking, and a testament to the power of the pharma lobby, which, during the hearings, was exposed as the hidden hand behind the most passionate opponents of the confirmation. Is our nightmare over? Not yet. Writing not even a month into the second presidential term of Donald Trump, it is still unclear just how much authority he truly exercises over the sprawling executive branch. For that matter, no one can even agree on how large this branch is: between 2.2 million and 3 million employees and somewhere between 400 and 450 agencies. The financial bleed in this realm is unthinkable and far worse than even the biggest cynic can imagine. Five former secretaries of the Treasury took to the pages of the New York Timeswith a shocking claim. 'The nation’s payment system has historically been operated by a very small group of nonpartisan career civil servants.' This has included a career employee called 'fiscal assistant secretary—a post that for the prior eight decades had been reserved exclusively for civil servants to ensure impartiality and public confidence in the handling and payment of federal funds.' There is no reason even to read between the lines. What this means is that no person voted into office by the people and no one appointed by such a person has access to the federal books since 1946. This is startling beyond belief. No owner of any company would ever tolerate being barred from the accounting offices and payment systems. And no company can offer any public stock without independent audits and open books. And yet almost 80 years have gone by during which time neither has been true for this gigantic enterprise called the federal government. That means that $193 trillion has been spent by an institution that has never faced granulated oversight from the people and never met the normal demands that every enterprise faces every day. The usual habit in Washington has been to treat every elected leader and their appointments as temporary and transitory marionettes, people who come and go and disturb little to nothing about the normal operations of government. This new administration seems to have every intention to change that but the job is inconceivably challenging. As much public support as MAGA/MAHA/DOGE enjoy for now, and as many people from those groups are getting embedded in the power structure, they are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by millions of agents of the old order. This transition will not be easy if it happens at all. The inertia of the old order is mighty. Even on the issue of health and pandemics, there is already confusion. CBS News has reported that Fauci-loyalist and mRNA pusher Gerald Parker will head the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response or OPPR. The report cited only unnamed 'health officials' and the appointment has been celebrated by Scott Gottlieb, the Pfizer board member who nudged Trump into backing lockdowns in 2020. All the while, this appointment has not been confirmed by the White House. We do not know if OPPR, created by Congressional charter, will even be funded. The reporter will not reveal his sources – raising the question of why any appointment having to do with health should be surrounded by such cloak-and-dagger machinations. If Dr. Parker becomes ensconced in this position and another health emergency is declared, this time for Bird flu, HHS and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., will not be in any kind of decision-making position at all. The larger problems have to do with a broader question: is the president really in charge of the executive branch? Can he hire and fire? Can he spend money or decline to spend money? Can he set policy for the agencies? One might suppose that the whole answer to these questions can be found in Article 2, Section 1: 'The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.' And yet that sentence was written almost 100 years before Congress created this thing called the 'civil service' that nowhere appears in the Constitution. This fourth branch has grown in size and power to swamp both the presidency and the legislature. Courts are going to have to sort this out, and already an avalanche of lawsuits has hit the new administration for daring to presume control over agencies and their activities of which the president is and must necessarily be held accountable. Lower federal courts seem to be demanding that the president be that in name only, while the Supreme Court might have a different opinion. The much-ballyhooed 'constitutional crisis' consists of nothing other than an attempt to reassert the original constitutional design of government. This is the background template in which RFK, Jr., takes power at HHS, and oversees all the sub-agencies. These agencies played a huge role in covering for the attack on liberty and rights over five years. His confirmation is a symbolic repudiation of the most egregious public policies on record. And yet, the repudiation is entirely implicit: there has been no commission, no admission of error, no one truly held responsible, and no real accountability. The trajectory on which we find ourselves affords many reasons for champagne celebrations, but sober up quickly. There is a very long way to go and enormous barriers in place to get us to the point that we are really safe again from the marauding corporatist/statist complex and their plots and schemes to rob the public of rights and liberties. In the meantime, to invoke a common phrase, keep these new appointees in your thoughts and prayers.

The Fed Has Stopped Pretending That Price Inflation Is Going Away...	By Ryan McMaken At its September 2024 meeting, the Fed’s FOMC cut the target federal funds rate by a historically large 50 basis points and then justified this cut on the grounds that 'The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.' The FOMC again cut the target rate in November and then again in December. Each time, the FOMC’s official statement said something to the effect of '[price] inflation is headed to two percent. Specifically, the November statement said '[Price inflation] has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.' The December statement said exactly the same thing. It remains unclear what motivated the FOMC to slice the target rate so drastically in September. Was it a cynical political ploy to stimulate the economy right before an election? Or was the Fed spooked by weak economic data? We don’t know, and the Fed is a secretive organization. But whatever the Fed actually believes, the committee’s claims about 'greater confidence' in falling price inflation is now gone. The FOMC announced in January that it would not lower the target rate, and the FOMC also removed from its official statement the line about making progress 'toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.' That sentence disappeared from the written statement, although Powell, in the press conference, apparently felt the need to remind the audience that 'Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal…' He nonetheless failed to mention anything about continued progress. It looks increasingly like all that confidence about 'sustainable progress' on price inflation back in September—in the heat of election season, of course—was just one of the Fed’s many bogus, politically motivated forecasts. Even if the Fed truly is motivated by the official data, though, it’s clear that the Fed now has good reason to downplay talk of declaring victory on the Fed’s two-percent inflation goal. Recent official data—which generally reflects the best scenario that government bean counters can muster—shows plenty of bad news in this area. According to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure—PCE inflation—year-over-year price inflation reached an eight-month high in December, at 2.6 percent. (December is the most recent available number on PCE.) If we look at January’s headline CPI inflation, released on Wednesday, the picture is even worse. Year-over-year CPI inflation hit a nine-month high in January, at 3.0 percent, and month-to-month growth was at an eighteen-month high of 0.5 percent. Thanks to the Fed’s unrestrained embrace of monetary inflation from 2020 to 2022, American consumers are still facing the grim reality of rising prices on basic necessities. In January’s CPI report, some of the largest jumps in prices were in food (2.5 percent), energy services (2.5 percent), other services (4.3 percent) and shelter (4.4 percent). Wholesale prices also suggested that we won’t be seeing much relief from price inflation. According to new producer price index numbers, released on Thursday, year-over-year growth in the PPI reached a 24-month high of 3.5 percent. This is bad news for those hoping that the Fed’s predictions of falling prices might somehow come true. CNN delivered the bad news on Thursday: 'The stronger numbers seen in Thursday’s PPI will tend to translate into continued consumer price inflation through the middle of the year.' So much for the Fed’s dog-and-pony show of late summer 2024 when Jerome Powell repeatedly assured the public that the economy was in great shape and that price inflation was rapidly disappearing. What the Fed Should Do So, what should the Fed’s FOMC do now? The answer: 'nothing.' Observers of Fed policy often speak in terms of the Fed 'setting' interest rates or 'raising' the target rate. In truth, the Fed doesn’t set rates, and it doesn’t raise interest rates, either. The Fed can allow interest rates to rise by intervening less in debt markets. If the Fed just backs off from its endless manipulations through its open market operations, the Fed won’t be buying assets with newly created money and directly driving more price inflation. After so many years of forcing down interest rates, if the Fed just took a break from its constant meddling, interest rates would naturally rise. That would lead to bankruptcies among zombie companies and other enterprises that can’t survive without a constant infusion of new, cheap money. On the other hand, the bubble economy would start to heal, prices would fall, and prospective first-time home buyers might have a chance of actually buying a home. Ordinary people who can’t afford hedge fund managers might be able to actually make some money on investments again as interest rates on ordinary investments rise to more normal levels. This is what the Fed should have been doing in September instead of manufacturing new excuses as to why it needed to cut rates again. Of course, the Fed never just sits back and lets the market function freely, because it is a political institution. It does what the regime asks of it, whether it’s for short-term stimulus, or when the federal government asks the Fed to push down interest rates to keep interest payments on the huge federal debt manageable. With Trump in office, it looks like there’s no break in the usual politicians’ calls for easy money. Indeed, it only took six weeks in office, and Donald Trump is back to demanding that the central bank force down interest rates. According to Bloomberg on Wednesday: 'President Donald Trump called for lower interest rates, seeking to raise pressure on the Federal Reserve as he moves to implement a second-term economic agenda high on tariffs and expanding tax breaks. ‘Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs,’ Trump said Wednesday in a post on social media.' Is this a tacit admission that tariffs are a tax and will therefore slow the economy? Is Trump admitting he needs more easy money to keep up the appearance of a growing economy? Whatever the thinking is, forcing down interest rates even further will not benefit ordinary people. They’ll just bring price inflation, malinvestment, and more of the same stagnation that that only looks like growth thanks to runaway government spending and record-breaking deficits.

As Cubans Flock To Russia’s War, Is Havana Playing Dumb? – Analys...	By Valeria Yehoshyna, Olya Ivleva, Kyrylo Ovsyaniy, Kira Tolstyakova and Schemes (RFE/RL) -- In a room far behind the front lines in central Ukraine, a Cuban man wearing Russian military fatigues smiles widely as he taps out a rhythm on a table. But his mood soon turns somber. Frank Dario Jarrosay Manfuga, 36, joined Russia's army in January 2024.By March he had been captured by Ukrainian forces, and he is now hoping for a way out of a desperate situation.'I never intended to kill anyone. I never wanted to participate in a war. I have a family,' said Manfuga, who claimed he was tricked into boarding a Russia-bound plane with the promise of a job in construction.'Maybe some organization could save me,' he said, adding he has no desire to return to Russia or Cuba.Manfuga's claim that he was duped could not be verified. A former geography teacher who later became a professional musician to increase his income, he is now a captured mercenary. His interview with Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was arranged through contacts in the Ukrainian military, which is keen to demonstrate just how wide the Russia has cast its net in a search for foreign manpower to bolster the invasion and offset an unpopular conscription drive at home. In Manfuga's case, that distance is more than 9,500 kilometers from Moscow. And he is not alone. 'Based on passports obtained by Ukrainian hackers, our own information from Cuba, numerous videos we've seen, and reports of some Cubans killed in combat, we can estimate that around 5,000 Cuban soldiers are fighting for Russia,' Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, co-founder of the Cuban Democratic Directorate, a U.S.-based NGO advocating for democratic change in communist Cuba, told Schemes. 'This network could not function without the Cuban regime's approval.' If that figure is accurate, it would amount to under half the number of soldiers from North Korea reportedly participating in Russia's war with their government's open backing -- most notably in the effort to counter Ukraine's shock offensive in Russia's Kursk region. But unlike North Koreans, Cuban fighters in Russia have left a significant social media footprint, with many openly embracing the Kremlin's militarism and ideology, a Schemes investigation found. Those posts helped Schemes identify hundreds of mercenaries, find previously unreported training facilities with the aid of satellite imagery, and discover the location and the nature of some of the Cubans' military activities in Russia and on Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. They also raise questions about how hard Cuba's pro-Russian government is 'working to neutralize and dismantle a human trafficking network,' as its Foreign Ministry claimed in September 2023, when evidence of Cubans fighting in the war was beginning to emerge. Dead In The Battle For Bakhmut Important indications of the scale of Cubans' involvement in the war came just days after the Cuban Foreign Ministry's statement, when a document hack unearthed nearly 200 Cubans serving in the Russian military, initially posted to the Tula region south of Moscow. That trove was first discovered by the Ukraine-focused investigative group InformNapalm, with the documents proving the Cubans' service coming from the e-mail account of a Russian major hacked by Cyber Resistance, a Ukrainian hacker group. Since then, RFE/RL journalists have found new evidence of hundreds of other apparent Cuban mercenaries on the Russian social network VKontakte. In many cases, their accounts were created in 2024 -- seemingly the year they arrived in Russia for pre-deployment training. The Schemes investigation tied many of the Cuban mercenaries with an online presence to the 106th Airborne Division. In one example, a photo posted in July 2023 by a man named Aliesky Anache included the geotag Promyshlenny Proyezd, an area of the city of Tula known to host the 106th Airborne Division and its 51st Parachute Regiment.Journalists were subsequently able to geolocate the blue-walled military building where that photo was taken. Satellite imagery of the region suggests there is no other military unit stationed anywhere in the surrounding area. Units of the 106th Airborne Division participated in the battle for Bakhmut. Known grimly as 'the meat grinder,' the monthslong battle concluded with the Russian occupation of the city in May 2023 and was the one of the bloodiest chapters of the war to date. And at least one Cuban, a 41-year-old fighter with the call sign Chiki, appears to have died there before being buried in Moscow, according to a post on VKontakte found by RFE/RL journalists. Another Cuban with the same call sign became a minor celebrity in Russia after appearing on the military TV channel Zvezda.In a segment of a Zvezda program on August 2, 2024, the fighter, whose real name is Rafael, was seen scrawling 'Hasta la vista, baby' ('Goodbye, baby' in Spanish) on military projectiles and informed the interviewer that he had 'fallen in love with buckwheat,' a Russian staple, during his military service.Rafael's VKontakte profile features photos of him wearing patches associated with Russia's Wagner Group.From August on, Rafael posted several images from combat positions in Ukraine's Kherson region. But many of his social media posts before then featured photos with other Cubans during training exercises and outings to bars in Tula. The bar photos and the fighters that featured in them helped RFE/RL journalists geolocate a second military facility used by the Cubans of the 106th. This previously unpublicized facility in the Tula region is the paratrooper training ground, unofficially called Krym (Crimea) in VKontakte geotags. Rush For Rubles, Assist For Russia Grueling poverty in Cuba helps explain the appeal of Russian military service to Cubans. Historically friendly ties with Moscow dating back to Soviet times mean that citizens of the island nation can enter the country as tourists without a visa. A typical monthly salary for a foreigner enlisting in the Russian army on a yearlong contract is the equivalent of $2,000. That was seemingly enough for Odin Rivas, who featured in one of Rafael's posts from Tula, to swap running a small business in Cuba for active military duty. Rivas has been posting frequently from military positions, promoting Russian and Soviet propaganda symbols. Back in 2022, he was being celebrated as a hero in the Cuban press after he volunteered as a firefighter to help extinguish a giant fire at the Matanzas oil terminal. Matanzas is at the heart of Moscow's patronly ties to Cuba, since it receives large oil deliveries from Russian tankers. Using the ship-tracking service Marine Traffic and satellite images from Planet Labs, RFE/RL journalists found satellite images showing that Russian oil tankers had docked in Cuban ports in 2022, 2023, and 2024. According to data obtained by Schemes from the KSE Institute and Kpler, in 2024, tankers transported more than 1.8 million barrels of Russian oil products to Cuba. From the beginning of 2025, they carried more than 700,000 barrels to the Caribbean island. One of those deliveries came at a vital time as Cuba witnessed its worst protests in several years in March 2024 amid energy and food shortages. Havana has never formally endorsed Russia's invasion. But on March 1, a day when Russia targeted civilian infrastructure and killed hundreds of civilians in cities across Ukraine, its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Pedro Luis Pedroso Cuesta, criticized the West for 'assuming that Russia would remain defenseless in the face of direct threats to its national security.' And in May 2024, Russian state media reported Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel had wished Russian President Vladimir Putin success in 'the special military operation,' as the Kremlin calls the war, during talks in Moscow that coincided with Russia's May 9 military parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. In comments to Schemes, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Cuba 'has clearly chosen Russia's side in the full-scale war because of its anti-American stance.' In addition to extensive open-source research, Schemes journalists obtained copies of Russian military documents from Ukrainian military sources concerning other Cubans who are serving in Russian military units. One of the documents was a questionnaire belonging to Julio Pelaez, a 38-year-old man who last September appealed in Russian on VKontakte for help getting a plane ticket to Moscow in order to report to 'any recruitment center.' In the questionnaire, Pelaez, who said he had never been abroad before, appeared to lean into a Kremlin propaganda trope concerning Ukraine when stating his motivation to join the war. 'I consider it the duty of every free person who hates Nazis,' Pelaez wrote.By the end of October, according to his profile page, Pelaez was in Russia, and had posted a photo of his military gear complete with the pro-war 'Z' symbol, a patch featuring the Cuban flag, and a document resembling a Russian passport Valeria Yehoshyna is a journalist for Schemes (Skhemy), an investigative news project run by RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. Yehoshyna was recognized as one of the 'Top 30 Under 30' by the Kyiv Post in 2019 and has won a number of awards, including the top prizes at the V.

Trump’s Ukraine Envoy: EU Won’t Be Part Of Peace Talks	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- US President Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, told Europeans on Saturday that their inclusion in talks to end the war in Ukraine was 'not going to happen'. Kellogg dropped the bombshell at the Munich Security Conference after Europeans for a week had scrambled to emphasise no Ukraine peace talks should happen without Kyiv or them. Asked whether Europeans should have a role in future talks, Kellogg said he was 'from the school of realism, and that is not going to happen'. The comments are the most explicit confirmation yet by a senior US administration official that they intend for Europe to follow the talks from the sidelines, beyond preparing any post-deal security guarantees for Ukraine. 'To my European friends, I would say: get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending,' Kellogg said. Kellogg is expected to soon embark on a tour to Ukraine and around all NATO countries to discuss the talks. Washington had also sent a request to European capitals to provide detailed proposals on the weaponry, peacekeeping troops and security arrangements they could provide to Ukraine as part of any security guarantees, the FT reported earlier on Saturday. Kellogg said the involvement of too many countries has wrecked the process in previous peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow – including those under the Minsk Format in which France and Germany were at the table. 'What we don't want to do is get into a large group discussion,' Kellogg said. Instead, he added, Trump's strategy was to have a deal in 'days and weeks' rather than a longer timeframe. Kellogg also said he sees Washington as an intermediary, not a Ukrainian ally or partner. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, had earlier this week confirmed to reporters he had spoken to Kellogg before the envoy’s anticipated Ukraine trip this month. No exact date has been announced yet. Kellogg’s upcoming visit is expected to 'provide comprehensive information on Russian aggression against our country,' Yermak said over Telegram, adding he had briefed Kellogg on the battlefield situation, the safety of Ukrainian civilians and meetings at the Munich Security Conference. After Trump’s election in November, Ukrainian officials had been racing to establish relations with the new administration fast, but things have dragged on. An initial trip that was announced to take place before Trump’s inauguration did not happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZi6vLuj96nsM	2025-02-15T16:15:59-08:00	
Mass Protest On Serbia’s Statehood Day; President Stages Counter-...	By Milica Stojanovic Tens of thousands of people blocked streets in the central Serbian city of Kragujevac on Saturday in support of ongoing student-led protests calling for official accountability for the Novi Sad railway station disaster that left 15 people dead in November. In the country’s north-west, meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic held a counter-rally in the city of Sremska Mitrovica as he struggled to regain control over the political agenda after three months of mass protests sparked by anger over perceived institutional corruption. One of the protesters in Kragujevac, Rajko Bozic from Novi Sad, told BIRN that there was an 'atmosphere of solidarity and optimism' in the streets of the city. Bozic said he travelled to Kragujevac for the rally because he thinks 'the students have finally led this society in the right direction and they are leading a strong, thoughtful and important struggle, and we are here to support them'. He described how local residents warmly welcomed the demonstrators and were 'making sure that no one is hungry, no one is cold' amid freezing temperatures in Serbia on Saturday. The protesters’ blockade of Kragujevac, named 'Sretnimo se na Sretenje' ('Let’s Meet on Sretenje') – a religious holiday as well as Serbia’s Statehood Day – started at 9am and was due to continue until seven minutes past midnight. Fifteen minutes of silence in the memory of the 15 Novi Sad victims were observed at 11.52am, the time the disaster happened, and were due to be observed again at 11.52pm. On Saturday morning, long columns of vehicles were seen headed for Kragujevac, Serbia’s fourth-largest city, from around the country. Students and members of the public then blocked Lepenicki Boulevard, the city’s main street. Groups of students from Novi Sad, Belgrade, Uzice, Kraljevo, Novi Pazar and Nis went to Kragujevac on foot, some of them walking for 150 kilometres. They were warmly greeted by locals in the city on Friday evening, after being hailed along the way in almost all the towns and villages they passed through. The rally in Kragujevac came 15 weeks after an outdoor canopy at Novi Sad railway station collapsed and left 15 people dead. Students have been blockading their universities since the end of November as well as holding mass protests and street blockades. The Kragujevac protest came two weeks after mass gathering in Novi Sad and some 20 days after a mass blockade of one of the major Belgrade intersections, the Autokomanda. Serbian President Vucic’s rally in Sremska Mitrovica also drew large crowds, although many of the attendees were public sector employees, some of whom are reported to have faced pressure to go to the pro-government rallies. It was the latest in a series of counter-protests aimed at reasserting Vucic’s authority in the face of the protests that pose a growing threat to his grip on power, which is facing its greatest political challenge since his Serbian Progressive Party came to power in 2012. Vucic told the crowd that the ongoing protests are a foreign-backed attempt at staging a 'colour revolution'. He said that 'the goal is to destroy Serbia', not just to overthrow his rule. The Novi Sad railway station deaths have fuelled anger over a perceived lack of transparency about how the state runs large infrastructure projects and a belief that public bodies are stuffed with party apparatchiks. The students leading the protests say they have four demands: the publication of all documents concerning the renovation of Novi Sad railway station; the prosecution of everyone involved in attacking students and professors during their protests and their dismissal if proven to be public officials; a halt to the prosecution of students arrested during the protests; and a 20 per cent increase in the budget for higher education.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZpudE0KpbDHJ	2025-02-15T16:11:56-08:00	
Robert Reich: Say What This Is, A Coup – OpEd	I want to talk today about the media’s coverage of the Trump-Vance-Musk coup. I’m not referring to coverage by the bonkers right-wing media of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News and its imitators. I’m referring to the U.S. mainstream media — The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, National Public Radio — and the mainstream media abroad, such as the BBC and The Guardian. By not calling it a coup, the mainstream media is failing to communicate the gravity of what is occurring. Yesterday’s opinion by The New York Times’ editorial board offers a pathetic example. It concedes that Trump and his top associates 'are stress-testing the Constitution, and the nation, to a degree not seen since the Civil War' but then asks: 'Are we in a constitutional crisis yet?' and answers that what Trump is doing 'should be taken as a flashing warning sign.' Warning sign? Elon Musk’s meddling into the machinery of government is a part of the coup. Musk and his muskrats have no legal right to break into the federal payments system or any of the other sensitive data systems they’re invading, for which they continue to gather computer code. This data is the lifeblood of our government. It is used to pay Social Security and Medicare. It measures inflation and jobs. Americans have entrusted our private information to professional civil servants who are bound by law to use it only for the purposes to which it is intended. In the wrong hands, without legal authority, it could be used to control or mislead Americans. By failing to use the term 'coup,' the media have also underplayed the Trump-Vance-Musk regime’s freeze on practically all federal funding — suggesting this is a normal part of the pull-and-tug of politics. It is not. Congress has the sole authority to appropriate money. The freeze is illegal and unconstitutional. By not calling it a coup, the media have also permitted Americans to view the regime’s refusal to follow the orders of the federal courts as a political response, albeit an extreme one, to judicial rulings that are at odds with what a president wants. There is nothing about the regime’s refusal to be bound by the courts that places it within the boundaries of acceptable politics. Our system of government gives the federal judiciary final say about whether actions of the executive are legal and constitutional. Refusal to be bound by federal court rulings shows how rogue this regime truly is. Earlier this week, a federal judge excoriated the regime for failing to comply with 'the plain text' of an edict the judge issued last month to release billions of dollars in federal grants. Vice President JD Vance, presumably in response, declared that 'judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.' Vance graduated from the same law school I did. He knows he’s speaking out of his derriere. In sum, the regime’s disregard for laws and constitutional provisions surrounding access to private data, impoundment of funds appropriated by Congress, and refusal to be bound by judicial orders amount to a takeover of our democracy by a handful of men who have no legal authority to do so. If this is not a coup d’etat, I don’t know what is. The mainstream media must call this what it is. In doing so, they would not be 'taking sides' in a political dispute. They would be accurately describing the dire emergency America now faces. Unless Americans see it and understand the whole of it for what it is rather than piecemeal stories that 'flood the zone,' Americans cannot possibly respond to the whole of it. The regime is undertaking so many outrageous initiatives that the big picture cannot be seen without it being described clearly and simply. Unless Americans understand that this is indeed a coup that’s wildly illegal and fundamentally unconstitutional — not just because that happens to be the opinion of constitutional scholars or professors of law, or the views of Trump’s political opponents, but because it is objectively and in reality a coup — Americans cannot rise up as the clear majority we are, and demand that democracy be restored.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZl8i5kwdxT2n	2025-02-15T16:09:14-08:00	
The Legacy Of Abandoned US Military Equipment In Afghanistan: A S...	The precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in August 2021 was a watershed and controversial moment in the history of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. While the decision to end the almost 20-year conflict was made with a desire to return American forces home, it has come hand in hand with an unwanted legacy: that of leaving behind an unfinished problem and a huge stock of American military hardware. This reservoir, whether it is high-level defense machinery, armor tanks, helicopters, and fighter aircraft, puts not only Afghanistan's future security but also American policy, international community relations, as well as war ethics to an extremely high degree of test. The Scope of Abandonment: From Advanced Technology to Tactical Equipment As the American troops left Afghanistan, they took with them approximately $7 billion of equipment, including more than 70 aircraft, 100,000 rifles, and a few hundred vehicles. Among the more visible equipment abandoned were Black Hawk helicopters, Humvees, and other cutting-edge surveillance and communications equipment, much of which has since made its way into the hands of the Taliban. It made people ask questions about the craziness of letting this cutting-edge equipment go to waste on the table to be picked up by the insurgents, potentially to be used for its capabilities by fueling an outfit that was notorious for both its human rights atrocities and destabilizing nature. To leave the tools behind like that was determined while in the grip of an fast-disintegrating security landscape within Afghanistan. The Biden administration had vowed to end America's longest war, but the precipitous fall of the Afghan government and military did not leave much time for thoughtful contemplation of what would be done with the gear. The US military responded that it would be logistically unfeasible to move all this enormous amount of material out of the country in the time allowed and under threat from the Taliban. But this wholesale abandonment of American arms is a simple question of morality: should such military critical equipment ever be left behind, even in withdrawal? It is faulted that the U.S. could have done more in disabling or destroying sensitive equipment to avoid unauthorized access. Others even deride the action to leave behind the equipment as a sign that the decision had not been given due thought by way of comparing the cost of the pace of withdrawal with detailed scrutiny of long-term stability of the region. Strategic Consequences: A New Reality for the Region The U.S. pullout and subsequent transfer of military hardware to the Taliban has radically altered regional power dynamics. For the Taliban, the provision of advanced American weaponry has emboldened its position as the de facto Afghanistan ruler. The group's ability to now employ military-grade technology can reasonably lock down its authority domestically, ward off regional neighbors, and menacingly challenge international counterterrorism initiatives more credibly. Apart from the Taliban, other U.S. military hardware is bound to land on the black market or be in the hands of other players in the region with interests in undermining the region. Pakistan, Iran, and Russia have a historical stake in Afghanistan's war effort and politics, and introducing advanced weaponry under the control of militia units would further strain already tense relations and complicate efforts at international diplomatic peace. Also, the presence of such advanced weapons of war by friendly or allied forces to terrorist groups poses an open danger to global security. The potential for such weapons to be employed in terrorist operations in the wider region or even beyond Afghanistan proper is one that cannot be ruled out. It is thus with a sense of grim foreboding that the majority foresee the security vacuum created by the American withdrawal echoing far beyond Afghan shores. Domestic and International Consequences: Responsibility and Prospective Policy The ditching of the military equipment sent shockwaves overseas but also set off hot debate at home within the U.S. itself. Military commanders, defense strategists, and politicians have all weighed in. To some, such a waste of this resource is an intolerable strategic error, undermining American credibility and America's ability to shape things on the planet. For others, it's the challenge of getting out from under today's military deployments and the complications involved in removing significant arms from use. What now for the United States regarding Afghanistan and national policy on being part of militaries in the fray? While some advocate more focus on diplomatic outreach and global cooperation, others argue that weapons abandonment highlights the need for a more guarded, measured approach to future military disengagement. Whether the U.S. will pursue further policy of disengagement or take more assertive measures to prevent future recurrences is unclear. Conclusion The record of American military materiel left behind in Afghanistan is a cautionary tale of the dangers of foreign intervention, military defeat, and the unintended consequences of hastily crafted policy decisions. As America tried to extricate itself from a twenty-year war, the aftereffects of its departure have bequeathed to Afghan security and foreign policy a deeply destabilizing legacy. The Taliban acquisition of the most advanced weapons, and the regional and global implications for security generally, are subjects for serious concern on the part of both America and its friends. With the dust beginning to settle on war, the international community is forced to confront that the baggage of war cannot easily be packed up in a duffel bag and abandoned. The question now is whether the U.S. can assume responsibility for what it has done and, in doing so, chart a path toward increased accountability and more responsible foreign policy in the years to come.

US-Europe Differences Come To The Fore At Munich Conference – OpE...	By Dr. Amal Mudallali The Munich Security Conference brought the fault lines between Europe and the US over Ukraine, the international order and the transatlantic relationship to the view of world leaders and political and security experts from the opening session of the conference on Friday. I was in the room to listen to the anticipated speech by US Vice President J.D. Vance and I saw the disbelief on people’s faces when he started speaking. The room was packed, with dozens of people standing on staircases and balconies to hear Vance in person for lack of seating availability. He did not disappoint in shocking them. When he was received with applause, he joked: 'I hope this is not the only applause I get.' He predicted correctly, and received polite applause only a couple of times. What shocked people most was not his lecturing them on democracy, especially free speech, and attacking them on immigration, but the fact that the American vice president’s speech in the foremost international security conference did not mention Ukraine even once, and did not talk about any security and foreign policy issue. He just put the Europeans on notice: There is a new sheriff in town. The Europeans were there for the message, and actually got it during their meetings with Vance before the opening of the conference. Their concern was evident in their speeches to the crowded halls of the conference venue. All the speeches were indirect or direct comments on the state of America and how Europe and the world should confront the phenomena called Donald Trump. From the opening statement of the conference’s chairman, Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, which highlighted 'the rule of law and not the law of the strongest,' to the strong messages in the speech of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, it was obvious that Europe is readying itself to push back. What rattled Europe most was the American president’s quick moves toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and their fears that they will be cut out of negotiations over ending the Ukraine war. You hear it everywhere: Europe and Ukraine should be at the table, and nothing about the war should be decided without Ukraine’s involvement. Some criticized the new US administration’s negotiating style, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius taking issue with giving everything at the start of talks. 'If I were (negotiating), I would know that I don’t take any essential point of negotiations off the table before the negotiations begin,' he said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that 'authoritarians are watching whether you have impunity if you invade your neighbor,' in a reference to Europe’s fear that the US administration’s peace overtures to Putin may embolden others to invade their neighbors and get away with it. Steinmeier highlighted how important it is not only to end the war, but to settle the conflict in a way that benefits Ukraine, Europe and the US. 'That outcome — an end to this war — is what we all hope for. How this war concludes will have a lasting impact on our security order and on the influence of both Europe and the US in the world,' he said, adding: 'I firmly believe that simply ‘making a deal and leaving’ would weaken us all: Ukraine and Europe but also the US. For this reason, every scenario — be it before or after the end of fighting — requires our combined power of deterrence and strength. That is why, in every scenario, support for Ukraine must continue — namely from Europe and the US.' This sentiment was also echoed by Von der Leyen, who said that Ukraine 'needs peace through strength.' But despite their warnings and aversion to the new US administration’s approach, they highlighted the importance of stepping up defense spending, a key ask by Trump. Steinmeier said: 'Expenditure on security must continue to rise. Our Bundeswehr must become stronger. Not to wage war — but to prevent war.' He seemed to respond to Trump’s request when he said: 'The 2 percent (defense spending) target, which we formally agreed in Wales in 2014, belongs to another era that was confronted with different threats. A decade on, we will need to spend considerably more than what was agreed back then.' Von der Leyen also called for stepping up military spending, and warned that Europe had outsourced its defense. The calls for Europe to stand up for itself were everywhere, as were the calls for unity but with the acknowledgment that Europe does not have the deterrent capability needed to confront the Putins of the world. But they seemed willing to resist. The words of the German president created the outlines of the push back by calling on Europe not to be intimidated by what is coming out of Washington. He said: 'We are subjects, not objects, in the international order. We must not allow ourselves to be paralyzed by the flood of announcements. We must not freeze in fear, or as the English saying goes: We cannot be like a deer in the headlights! It is clear that the new American administration holds a worldview that is very different from our own — one that shows no regard for established rules, for partnerships or for the trust that has been built over time.' This was only the first day of the conference but it set the tone for what is awaiting the transatlantic relationship in the era of an even stronger and more 'populist' US administration. This fear is real for Europe, and especially Germany, which faces crucial elections next week and where Vance met the far-right AfD leader and criticized efforts by German officials to avoid working with the party. It is a new era of what Europeans consider American election interference and America calls defense of democracy, which rests 'on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters.' It is the dawn of a new uncharted transatlantic fist fight.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZkMqhbXSisRU	2025-02-15T15:51:37-08:00	
Hamas Releases 3 More Israeli Hostages; Israel Frees More Prisone...	Hamas released three more hostages Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding despite recent tensions. Israeli American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, a resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel, reportedly was taken captive when he confronted Hamas militants during their Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack in southern Israel. Two months after his capture, his wife, Avital, gave birth to their third daughter. Also released was Israeli Russian Sasha Troufanov, 29, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was taken prisoner in the Hamas attack, along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother Irina Tati and girlfriend Sapir Cohen. All three women were released in a hostage deal a month later. His father, Vitaly, was killed in the attack. The family emigrated to Israel from Russia 25 years ago. The third hostage released was identified as Israeli Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was kidnapped in the Hamas attack, along with his brother Eitan, who is not part of the current phase of the hostage deal. The three men were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis before being transported to Israeli forces. In Tel Aviv, family members and supporters watching the release via video cheered as the men emerged from vehicles at the site of the handover. Meanwhile, the first bus carrying freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees arrived in Ramallah to a cheering crowd waving Palestinian flags. Hamas said some 369 Palestinians were set to be released Saturday. It is the sixth swap of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners as part of the Jan. 19 ceasefire agreement between the two sides. Hamas said the hostages would be exchanged for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The militant group named the three hostages on Friday after threatening earlier in the week to not release them, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement. During the first phase of the ceasefire, set to last six weeks, Hamas is to gradually free 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Twenty-one hostages and more than 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed, so far, during the first phase of the truce. Concerns in Israel have grown about the condition of the remaining hostages after the last three hostages, released a week ago, came home looking emaciated. On Thursday, Hamas spokesperson Abdul-Latif al-Qanou indicated the militant group would abide by the ceasefire. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation [Israeli forces] adheres to it fully,' he said. Qanou also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. The Israeli government later reiterated that Hamas must release three hostages this weekend. 'If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end,' Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed Saturday. Also Friday, at the United Nations headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council that more than 630 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Thursday, with at least 300 of them heading to the northern section of Gaza. He urged the Security Council and all U.N. member states to support efforts to implement the ceasefire and bring about a permanent cessation of hostilities. He also called for the international media to be allowed into Gaza to report on the situation on the ground. Meanwhile, U.N. ambassadors from the 22-nation Arab Group rejected Trump’s proposal Friday for the U.S. to take over control of the Gaza Strip and for Palestinians to be relocated elsewhere. They also expressed their own desire to see Gaza rebuilt for Palestinians. Speaking at U.N. headquarters in New York, the group’s chairman, U.N. Ambassador from Kuwait Tareq Albanai, said the suggested displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would constitute 'a clear violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, prohibiting the forcible transfer of protected populations from occupied territories, irrespective of motive.' U.N. Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said Palestinians would like to see Gaza rebuilt as Trump imagined, only for the Palestinians. 'We have no homeland except Palestine,' he said. 'We love Palestine. We will rebuild the Gaza Strip. We will rebuild Palestine.' Mansour said the group also was strongly united behind the current ceasefire agreement and to make it permanent, and for it to be expanded to include not only Gaza but the occupied West Bank as well. The Arab Group also extended an invitation to the U.N. Security Council to visit Gaza.

Pakistan’s Recent PECA Amendments: A New Threat To Free Speech An...	The new Pakistan Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) amendments have raised a great deal of concern regarding the nation's devotion to free speech and democracy. Although the amendments cut back the three-year imprisonment for spreading false information via the internet to three years, they are followed by a chain of contentious provisions that have triggered alarm at increasing repression of dissent and freedom of speech. The amendments invoked huge protests and outrage from journalists, civil society, and opposition forces, who branded the new laws as instruments of state oppression. A Step Towards Greater Government Interference Four institutions will be created by the government through amendments: the Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, the National Cybercrime Investigation Authority, the Social Media Complaint Council, and the Social Media Protection Tribunal(s). They are to silence false news, but the open federal government process of selection has raised alarms of government intrusion and censorship. These appeals will directly go to the Supreme Court and not to the high courts, and this has raised concerns from critics that this will be centralizing power and denying access to independent judicial appeals. The new legislation also subjects those convicted of spreading false news on the internet to severe punishment, up to 2 million rupees (about $7,000). Although the actions might be seen as a move to limit the spread of false news, they also open doors for political and social activists, journalists, to be arrested in the guise of limiting the spread of false news. A Suppression-of-Free-Speech Law Signed in 2016, PECA was signed into law initially to combat cyber crime, yet it has been characterized as one of the steps towards suppressing free speech for a number of decades. The bill has been criticized for containing extremely vague and broad language, which has been employed in harassing media professionals and journalists. Over 200 cases have been reported against journalists since its inception, and the majority of individuals convicted argue that the government is employing PECA in order to silence opposition voices. The new amendments, the critics alleged, will again maximize the chocking effect of the law on freedom of expression. The Pakistan Human Rights Commission (HRCP) protested as a move toward direct violation of fundamental human rights. The HRCP noted that the three years' imprisonment for broadcasting unsubstantiated news was disproportionate and sounded an alarm that four new watch-dogging institutions can be utilized to choke independent media. Mass Protests and Increasing Resistance Journalists and media employees' protests against the PECA amendments have been ongoing in Pakistan since they were implemented. Protests were held on January 28 in major cities across the country, demanding the bill be withdrawn. The PFUJ condemned the amendments as a 'black law' that would silence the media and choke democratic rights. International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) also extended its support in the form of protests, and it issued a solidarity statement for the PFUJ and appealed for the rollback of the legislation. The IFJ, while issuing a statement, referred to the need for safeguarding freedom of expression as an organic right. Civil society organizations have also criticized the amendments, saying that they are a step backward. Human rights activist Ammar Ali Jan's tweets asserted that PECA amendments were one of 'many ways in which the government is attempting to criminalize dissent' and silence state critics. Political parties on both sides of the political spectrum have also condemned the amendments. The opponents within the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party have vowed to form a political alliance in order to vote against the law, stating that the law would be employed to harass civil society and the media. That it occurred at this worst possible time is particularly shameful to Pakistan's record regarding human rights in matters of freedom of expression and the press, too. In 2024, the country scored 152 out of a total of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, and the proposed amendments will certainly further tarnish its image globally. Politicians, journalists, and even the ordinary citizen would be heavily penalized for the articulation of an opinion other than the one articulated by the state in the new PECA. The threat of ending up in prison or heavy punishment for simply disseminating information or criticism regarding the government would cause mass-level self-censorship, eliminating whatever is left of the freedom to discourse for the masses. The government action also seems to go against Pakistan's democratic tradition. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who had criticized PECA in the previous government while his opposition party was in power, has been accused of hypocrisy after supporting the same contentious bill as a ruling party. His seeming u-turn has fueled rumors that the government is abusing the law to further centralize power and silence the opposition. A Bad Precedent Pakistan's media space is already under attack with routine suspension of the internet and rising restrictions on social media. The PECA amendments offer the window for the malevolent precedent by placing unchecked power in the hands of the state on the expression on the internet and transforming the law into a tool of muzzling the opposition voice against the regime. As protest intensifies and demos mount, it was only time which could determine whether the law had been overturned or even modified so as to make speech as free. However, as increasing authoritarian bent dominates the Pakistani political arena, it is every reason to believe that the nation is being inched towards a trajectory of increasing state repression and control.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZpevdTdSs13G	2025-02-15T15:46:42-08:00	
Ecumenical Initiative Calls For Unity To Celebrate Easter Togethe...	By Victoria Cardiel The First Ecumenical Council, the meeting of Christian bishops that was held in 325 in Nicaea (today İznik, Turkey), laid the groundwork for reaching consensus within the Church through an assembly representing all of Christendom. This event marked a key moment in the history of Christianity, 17 centuries ago this year, in which, among other decisions, the way of calculating the date of Easter was established. However, over the centuries, changes to the calendar resulted in discrepancies between the Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox churches, differences that still persist. While Latin-rite Catholics follow the Gregorian calendar, in the East the tradition of calculating liturgical dates according to the Julian calendar has been maintained. The difficulties of changing the calendar 'The process of changing the calendar, which began in 1582 with Pope Gregory and was completed to a certain extent in 1923 with the adoption of the new calendar by some Orthodox churches, was not without difficulties,' Kostas Mygdalis, consultant to the Orthodox Interparliamentary Assembly (IOA), explained in an interview with ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. 'It provoked controversies among the faithful and between the churches and state authorities, consolidating polarizing divisions' that still persist, he added. Mygdalis is also one of the key figures of the interfaith working group Pasqua (Easter) Together 2025, which seeks to promote the common celebration of Easter between Orthodox and Catholics. Last September, Pope Francis received the members of this ecumenical initiative and expressed his desire to agree on a common date for the celebration of Easter between Catholics and Orthodox. Interestingly, this year both Easters — Catholic and Orthodox — fall on the same date, April 20, due to the alignment of the Julian (used by the Orthodox) and Gregorian (followed by Catholics and other Christian denominations) calendars. A step toward Christian unity For Mygdalis, the joint celebration of Easter in 2025 should not be seen as just a calendar agreement but as an opportunity to place Christ at the center of the Christian faith. 'The time has come to make a strong appeal to the churches to unify the date of Easter,' he said. He also emphasized that the central message must be the need for unity in the world: 'The world needs unity. A common date for Easter is a step toward this unity.' However, he noted that 'the administrative structures of the churches, composed almost exclusively of clerics, seem reluctant to address this issue, perhaps for fear of creating new extremism and divisions in a world already facing multiple challenges.' He also pointed out that 'dialogue between Christian churches is moving so slowly that, for ordinary faithful, it seems a fruitless process.' For Mygdalis, the effort to celebrate the resurrection of Christ together must be part of a 'pilgrimage of reconciliation and unity' that will continue beyond 2025. He emphasized that the importance of the Resurrection is not only theological but also existential: 'Without the Resurrection, all the suffering in the world is absurd.' A mandate for unity from Nicaea 'The celebration of Easter on a common date is not only necessary but a mandate for unity established by the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea, whose 1,700th anniversary we commemorate this year,' he emphasized. 'Through the Pasqua Together 2025 initiative, we seek to demand that the churches comply with what was established by the Council of Nicaea: to celebrate together the resurrection of Christ, the pillar of the Christian faith. It is unacceptable that this division should continue,' he pointed out. Toward the jubilee of 2033 Beyond Easter 2025, the JC2033 initiative was also mentioned, which proposes an ecumenical journey toward the year 2033, when the 2,000th anniversary of the resurrection of Christ will be celebrated. It is suggested that the date of Easter for Orthodox and Catholics coinciding in 2025 could be a first step toward greater unity on the occasion of this historic celebration.

Iran Confirms Exchange Of Messages With Syria	A special envoy of the Iranian foreign minister acknowledged that messages have been exchanged with Syria. The Iranian foreign minister’s special envoy for Syria, Mohammad Reza Raouf Sheibani, confirmed the recent comments from the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Syrian Transitional Government Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani about the exchange of positive messages between Tehran and Damascus. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran is indirectly in contact with Syria’s current officials, and we have also received messages,' the Iranian diplomat said. He said Iran has a forward-looking attitude to the developments in Syria and the restoration of ties with the Arab country. Iran is closely and patiently monitoring the situation in Syria and will make its appropriate decisions in due time, Sheibani said. Stressing the need for all political currents to have a role in shaping Syria’s future, the Iranian special envoy said, 'Iran’s stances on the Damascus developments are clear. Considering Syria’s special position in the Middle East region, we believe that its future and fate must be decided by its own people with the participation of all political currents.' Expressing Iran’s opposition to any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Syria, Sheibani said he has discussed Syria with the representative of Russia’s president and the Russian deputy foreign minister during a recent visit to Moscow. Iran and Russia share views about a series of issues regarding Syria, he stated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZnd6e_eLfHF8	2025-02-15T15:41:45-08:00	
The Taliban’s War On Women: A Nation’s Daughters In Peril – OpEd	Since the Taliban’s swift and brutal takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the country has experienced profound shifts in every facet of life, particularly for women. The collapse of the U.S.-backed government marked the beginning of a new, grim chapter for Afghan women, whose rights have been systematically stripped away. Under the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic law, women face unprecedented levels of repression, which have led to their near-total erasure from public and private life. The situation for women in Afghanistan is complex, shaped by a combination of cultural, religious, and historical factors that have entrenched patriarchal norms and restricted women's roles in society. However, it is the recent, increasingly absurd measures enforced by the Taliban that truly highlight the extent of their control and disregard for women’s fundamental human rights. One of the most striking examples of the Taliban's misogynistic policies is the imposition of stringent rules on women’s visibility, even in their own homes. The Taliban have now taken the extraordinary step of banning windows that allow women to be seen from outside. This decree, dubbed the 'window test,' mandates that homes should not have any windows overlooking places where women might be seen, including kitchens and courtyards. According to a Taliban spokesperson, 'seeing a woman working in kitchens, in courtyards, or collecting water from wells can lead to obscene acts.' While it is absurd to claim that the mere sight of women going about their daily tasks can provoke immorality, this new rule reflects the Taliban’s obsession with controlling every aspect of women’s existence, even their private, domestic spaces. These extreme measures follow a long list of restrictions that have been imposed on women since the Taliban regained power. Afghan women are no longer allowed to attend school beyond primary education, with secondary and higher education completely banned for girls. Employment opportunities for women have been drastically reduced, with the government ordering thousands of women to leave their jobs, especially in government offices. Women are not permitted to travel without a male chaperone, and they are forced to cover their faces fully when in public. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs has been dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Vice and Virtue, a clear indication that the Taliban see women as subjects to be controlled, not as individuals with rights to be respected. The Taliban's strict rules are not limited to women's mobility or education, they also extend to healthcare. Women in Afghanistan are prohibited from seeking medical care unless it is provided by a female healthcare worker. This restriction has led to a shortage of essential medical services, particularly for women who are already suffering from the devastating effects of the Taliban's policies, including an increase in maternal mortality rates and a growing suicide epidemic among women. The country’s healthcare system, already fragile before the Taliban’s return, has been further crippled by the absence of women from the workforce. The oppression of Afghan women under the Taliban is not only a violation of their rights but also a self-inflicted wound on the country’s economy. By excluding women from the workforce, the Taliban have effectively reduced the country’s labor force by half, plunging Afghanistan into deeper poverty. The economy, already suffering from decades of conflict and international sanctions, has been dealt a further blow by the systematic exclusion of women from key sectors such as education, healthcare, and governance. This gender-based discrimination is not only a moral failure but also an economic one, as it prevents the country from fully utilizing its human resources. The international community has largely condemned the Taliban’s actions, but the regime has found ways to maintain its grip on power despite the widespread outcry. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, but the group has made significant diplomatic strides. Several countries have welcomed Taliban diplomats, and there have been discussions about removing the group from international terrorism lists. These diplomatic victories represent a troubling reality: while the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the horrors women face under the Taliban, the regime is gaining recognition on the global stage. For Afghan women, this is nothing short of a betrayal. They are denied basic human rights, subjected to violence and oppression on a daily basis, and yet the world continues to engage with the Taliban as though they are a legitimate government. More than 300 women have been killed by men since the Taliban’s return to power, and over 840 women have been victims of violence. The Taliban themselves are often implicated in these crimes. The world’s failure to hold the Taliban accountable for these atrocities sends a chilling message to Afghan women: their suffering is invisible and irrelevant. In addition to the physical and psychological violence they endure, Afghan women are also forced to confront the constant fear of being punished for even the smallest transgressions. Women who are found begging in the streets for food or money can be arrested, detained, and subjected to brutal treatment by the Taliban. The Taliban's repressive measures have left Afghan women with little recourse but to retreat further into isolation, where they are often left to fend for themselves in a society that views them as little more than second-class citizens. The question that many Afghan women are asking is simple yet profound: why are they being silenced and erased from public life? Are they not human beings? Are they not entitled to the same basic rights as men? The international community must not ignore the cries of Afghan women, who are living under a regime that seeks to strip them of their dignity, their rights, and their futures. The situation in Afghanistan may have become a forgotten war, but it is a war in which one group of people, Afghan women, continues to lose. The world must wake up to their suffering and take concrete steps to support them in their struggle for freedom and equality. The Taliban's treatment of women in Afghanistan is a grave injustice that must be confronted by the global community. If we continue to turn a blind eye to their plight, we are complicit in their oppression. It is time to stand up for the women of Afghanistan, whose voices have been silenced, whose rights have been stripped away, and whose futures have been stolen. Only by recognizing their humanity and supporting their fight for freedom can we hope to end the suffering of Afghan women.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcO-Hi0amYmZvhg6exDPqRd	2025-02-15T15:38:41-08:00	
Build Defence ‘Indic’ AI-Language Models In India – Analysis	By Jui Marathe and Chaitanya Giri India's Ministry of Defence (MoD) started 2025 by deeming it the ‘Year of Reforms’. This year, it has pledged its focus on emerging technologies, especially robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). The theme, of course, is an organic continuation of its 2024 theme, the ‘Year of Technology Absorption, Empowering the Soldier’. The usual perception is that the soldier needs only to be empowered on the battlefield and during combat; But that is not entirely true. Assisting the soldier in diverse non-battlefield use-cases - internal administration, allocation of business rules, logistics, command and brigade level procurement, personnel re-education and training, wargaming, disaster search and rescue, military doctrine and technology ethics - goes a long way in making the military more efficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) absorption has already begun within the Indian Armed Forces for non-battlefield use cases. But it cannot be merely users of AI; its ability to cultivate and enhance national AI capabilities must be exploited. Since its establishment in 2018, the MoD’s Defence Artificial Intelligence Projects Agency (DAIPA), along with the Indian Armed Forces, created a pipeline of bespoke AI tools, such as chatbots, audiobots, and videobots, used as non-battlefield soldier virtual assistants, at par with militaries worldwide. In April 2024, the Indian Army Southern Command, as part of its technology absorption drive, built an AI chatbot called SAMADHAN that assists commissioned officers with queries related to public procurement and related policies. Another Indian Army-led chatbot, SAMBANDH, is built purposefully to assist war veterans and war widows in addressing, through one-on-one communications, their queries and grievances and disseminating relevant information amongst them. Similar to SAMADHAN and SAMBANDH, in 2023, the US-based information technology services company World Wide Technology Inc. introduced ‘SergeantAI’, an AI virtual assistant that helps soldiers, particularly non-commissioned officers, adhere to the US Army regulations. The China’s Joint Operations College, National Defence University has created a ‘Virtual AI Commander’, an AI avatar of a real-world Chinese commander, to assist soldiers at lower ranks with table-top simulations and virtual war games when the real-world commander is unavailable for simulations. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Sciences has also developed an AI chatbot called ChatBIT to assist soldiers and intelligence officials in support of their military intelligence operations and enhance their decision-making ability. After the assimilation of AI virtual assistants in phase 1 of AI adoption, phase 2 involves the construction of bespoke defence large language models (LLMs). The US AI company Scale AI, in November 2024, announced the launch of Defense Llama, an LLM built on Meta’s Llama 3, that is customised to serve US national security missions, particularly carrying out intelligence operations, preparing for counter operations, and comprehending vulnerabilities of adversaries. The Defense Llama LLM is said to have been trained on an enormous dataset, including military doctrines, DoD policies, guidelines and Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence. The end-users of Defense Llama are the operators of command and control platforms, intelligence agencies, and decision-support systems. The Chinese PLA, now armed with the confidence of the indigenous DeepSeek V3 LLM’s success, may not want to depend on Meta or any other American foundational models for its military applications. Mandarin-language LLMs, built by Chinese AI companies, such as Yi, Qwen, Baichuan, XVERSE, are already performing well in Simplified Mandarin, Traditional Mandarin, Chinese ethnic minority languages like Kazakh, Jinghpo, Lhasa Tibetan, and a few other East Asian languages. The PLA could soon use its Sinic language superiority to create Sinic language defence LLMs for itself. Such Sinic language defence LLMs could be used for the enormous diversity of non-battlefield defence applications. Taking cues from this, the Indian MoD should consider being the benefactor of bespoke multilingual Indic-language defence LLMs. Any AI language model is usually based on parameters such as ontologies, grammar, lexicons, and corpora,derived from databases of commonsensical facts written in a certain spoken and written language. Depending on the scale and size of the databases, the parameters in it are determined. As of January 2025, the current state-of-the-art LLMs have as many as 1.56 trillion parameters, of course, based on English language databases. However, India is in an advantageous position to have world-leading India-built Indic language LLMs. To attain such an advantageous position, it would be important to give such Indic LLMs enormous parameters from the richness of textual and audiovisual data in the possession of public sector entities. The MoD, being the largest employer in the country, could have its own Indic language defence LLM initiative given the enormous Indic and English language repositories it holds. Although there has been some unwanted scepticism about India pursuing indigenously-built LLMs, there is considerable potential for Indian AI companies to dominate the niche of Indic languages. In the context of this article and its ideation, Indic languages include Hindi and other 21 official languages in the country. The Indian open-source AI startup Sarvam 2B’s Indic language small language model (SLM), although based on a modified Llama architecture, is performing much better in Indic languages than models from American foundational SLMs. So, if the MoD chooses to be the benefactor of Indic language LLMs—as closed-source models given the data sensitivity and network security—and offer its massive database, to set up parameters, it would not only end up building a closed-source defence LLM for its intramural usage, but also encourage a massive use-case for wider use of Indic language across other sectors. But how should the MoD do it? The Indian military’s first major steps in emerging technology upskilling and capacity building, including those for AI, were announced in 2025, when the Indian Army stated its ongoing plans to induct emerging technology domain specialists mid-2025 onwards through the Army Education Corps, which was recently renamed the Army Knowledge & Enablers Corps. Domain specialists with postgraduate degrees will be inducted into the commissioned officer ranks, while experts with graduate degrees will be inducted at the junior commissioned officers’ ranks. Within the MoD, it is the junior-commissioned and non-commissioned ranks, a sizable portion of the MoD non-military personnel, Agniveer, Territorial Army, and National Cadet Corps that generate and consume voluminous official content and data in the Indic language, particularly Hindi. This data consumption and generation aligns with the Official Language Act of 1963, and it is this voluminous content gathered over many decades and across all MoD and other Indian governmental institutions that could be digitised and used to set parameters for the closed-source Indic language defence LLMs. Of course, the English language data repository could be translated the way STEM academic textbooks are being translated to Hindi and other Indic languages under the AI Project Udaan carried out by IIT Bombay. This will further add to the enormity of parameters, a necessity for a richly fed LLM. The Army Knowledge & Enablers Corps could create an ecosystem in partnership with DAIPA, DRDO, private AI companies, and civilian government laboratories. If our soldiers are to fight time-space-force-informationwars, if they have to be the human-in-loop of sophisticated systems, their acquaintance with the operations of AI systems is crucial. The AI system they work on must operate in the language they think in and speak. Furthermore, the Indic language defence LLM could also benefit the ‘Project Udbhav’ - the Indian Army’s program to synthesize ancient scripted wisdom on warfare, statecraft, historical missions, and ethics with modern-day military operations. Bringing such Sanskrit and other Indic language texts into the training and upskilling curriculum of the Army Training Command and College of Defence Management will have a tremendous impact on empowering the soldier. An Indic language LLM will be a milestone development towards the Indian government’s extant commitment to promoting Indic languages.

How Trump’s Gaza Plan Could Hand The Middle East To Russia And Ch...	U.S. President Donald Trump recently called the Gaza Strip a 'demolition site,' and said the Palestinians would be evacuated to Jordan and Egypt, where they would be 'thrilled' to live. The U.S. would then take possession of Gaza ('We'll own it’), and would develop it, creating 'thousands of jobs,' making it the 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted the project, 'it’s something that could change history,' and it will, but probably not the way he and Trump think. Netanyahu called Trump’s idea to deport the Gazans 'remarkable' and the 'first good idea I've heard,' but just about everyone, everywhere reacted negatively to the plan. The White House quickly clarified the U.S. won’t pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, and it hasn’t made any commitment to send U.S. troops there, but an American private security company will be manning a key Gaza checkpoint and armed American military veterans wearing military-style garb will be as big a target as serving troops and will be valuable hostages. In the U.S., many Arab American voters wondered if they made a mistake supporting Trump in 2024, and one Arab-American group rebranded, removing 'Trump' from its name. According to Pew Research, Muslims will become the second-largest religious group in the U.S. by 2050 and is a demographic the Republicans needs to capture. Jews continued voting for Democrats in 2024 (79% voted for Democrat candidate Kamala Harris; 21% voted for Trump, 'the lowest proportion of Jewish votes for a Republican presidential candidate in 24 years.') Thus, the GOP may secure no net gain in votes and may suffer in the 2026 mid-term elections, so why bother doing this? In the Middle East, every leader, even the philosemitic Mohamed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, denounced Trump’s idea and Netanyahu’s suggestion that Saudi Arabia host a Palestinian state. The Saudis added they would never normalize relations with Israel if the Palestinians are deported: 'the Kingdom’s position is nonnegotiable.' (Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman previously boxed in the kingdom by declaring Israel’s actions in Gaza as 'genocide,' precluding a quiet policy reversal at a later date.) Jordan and Egypt, which Trump expects to host nearly 2 million Palestinians, have the most to lose by receiving angry, involuntary emigrants that will be a destabilizing element. And any bridge funding to support the resettlement will soon dry up, sticking Cairo and Amman with the bill, while the investors in Gaza (who will demand government guarantees) reap the rewards, a sure example of 'socializing the costs but externalizing the benefits.' The Israel Defense Forces are drawing up plans for the departure of Palestinians from Gaza though it remains to be seen how 'voluntary' the departures will be if there are no early takers, especially as the refugees will probably land in a refugee camp but with little support from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). If the Soviet deportation expert, Ivan Serov, wrote a how-to guide they are probably reading it at HaKirya. Trump threatened to stop all financial aid to Egypt and Jordan if they refuse to accept the Palestinian deportees from Gaza. King Addullah of Jordan met Trump and held the line by committing to take in 2,000 Palestinian orphans for medical treatment; President el-Sisi of Egypt was slated to meet Trump in mid-February but now will not travel to Washington if the Gaza deportations are on the agenda. El-Sisi may try to assuage Trump temporarily be accepting some sick refugee kids, but Egypt or Jordan probably don’t have the housing stock or social services to accommodate two million angry refugees. Then there will be the opprobrium of being an accomplice to the Second Nakba which will present physical risk to the two leaders, both of whom have predecessors who were assassinated in office. The Nakba of 1948 has been laid at the feet of Israel, but the Second Nakba will attach itself firmly to America, allowing Israel to escape any accountability. Executing this plan will cause the deaths of more Israelis and Palestinians, but that is a sacrifice Netanyahu is willing to make. And the U.S. knows a thing or two about deportations, so it should avoid recommending that policy to others. In the late 1800s it used its army to force the Plains Indians from the grasslands where they lived for 8,000 years onto reservations where many of their descendants still live in poverty today. Key to the success of this strategy was killing off the buffalo the Indians relied on for food. In the words of an U.S. Army officer, 'Kill every buffalo you can! Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone.' When asked if the Palestinians would have a right of return, Trump replied, 'No, they wouldn’t…I’m talking about building a permanent place for them,' though the Palestinians would say they have a 'permanent place' already. Hamas responded that the Trump plan is 'a recipe for failure,' and on this the region’s kings and emirs agree with the Islamist insurgents. In the future, the U.S. will find little support in the region for fighting terrorism, suppressing the Houthi attacks on shipping, partnering with American businesses, and stopping Iran’s nuclear program. And as 10 of the 12 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are majority Muslim, Washington won’t get any help with oil prices. Even if this situation freezes today, America’s competitors will still take gains as confidence in the U.S. has been hurt, perhaps permanently. If the U.S. stops aid to Jordan and Egypt, they may still make up the loss by soliciting funds from China, Russia, India, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf petrostates, giving the donors more sway in the area. The U.S. may no longer be viewed as the region’s key political partner, but just as the security provider, the 'hired muscle' that can be assuaged by regular purchases of weapons. But China will be the preferred investor and technology provider, Russia will be a source of foodstuffs and military aid, and India and Turkey can be providers of other engineering and technology goods and services. For a guy who is social media savvy, Trump is hurting himself. He promised Khabib Nurmagomedov, the popular Russian (and Muslim) champion martial arts fighter, 'We will stop it. I will stop the war [in Gaza].' This is what an influencer look like: Khabib has 39.6 million followers on Instagram, 8.6 million followers on X, 5.5 million followers on Facebook, and 1.23 million subscribers on YouTube. If Khabib is disappointed with Trump, he can move the needle with the region’s youth and not to America’s gain. Who benefits? Aside from Israeli extremists and their American supporters, Russia and China will appear as beacons of principle and friendship. Islamist groups will say 'I told you so' and start new fundraising and recruiting drives, and Iran can head into negotiations with America for a new nuclear deal declaring the U.S. is only reliable when it comes to backing out its commitments, to wit, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and the two-state solution. And the future Arab and Muslim position on the two-state solution may change: no more of that 'pathway to Palestinian statehood' stuff; in the future, there will be no recognition of Israel until the Palestinian prime minister is in office, the parliament is in session, the borders are secure, and the postage stamps are in circulation. Washington could have avoided this by forcing Israel and Palestine into negotiations after the announcement of the Abraham Accords, but everyone just pocketed their winnings and moved on. If the two sides had been locked in a room in Dayton, Ohio with an overbearing American overseer and no hope of appealing to the White House, the Accords momentum and the prospect of outsized economic gains may have worked, but that moment was lost, and Hamas reaped the benefits. And speaking of Hamas, we keep hearing they lost, but the last Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, confessed Hamas has recruited almost as many fighters as it lost. Obviously, Washington and Tel Aviv do not understand the math: Palestinian orphans = Hamas recruits. And the Hamas handovers of Israeli hostages have been media spectacles that raised the group’s profile as undefeated defenders of the Palestinian people and underlined the reputational damage America has suffered by its laissez-faire reaction to the Israeli attack on Gaza. The American idea will engender resistance, some violent, that Washington will call 'terrorism' to avoid any discussion of the immediate idea or its long-term history in the Middle East. There is nothing good here for America, and the American people agree; only 13% think it’s a 'good idea,' and 47% think it’s a 'bad idea,' according to a CBS News/YouGov poll. This may cost the Republicans seats in the 2026 mid-term elections, will isolate the U.S., give Russia and China more opportunity in the region, and possibly engender support for Iran when it faces off against the U.S. and Europe in nuclear negotiations, or grapples with the next round of sanctions. Trump’s best next step is to noisily pivot to something else and leave this bad idea on Netanyahu’s doorstep.

Will The Putin-Trump Meeting Surpass The Yalta Agreement? – Analy...	Its not just about an agreement to end the Russo-Ukraine conflict With US president Donald Trump’s one and a half hour call to Russian president Putin and Munich being the neutral place both parties are planning to meet, there is expectation of a new Yalta type understanding being agreed to by both parties. This is the first a US president has spoken to Putin since February 2022. In an interview with Russia 1 television on Thursday, Peskov described the conversation as constructive, adding that the two leaders concurred that the administration of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden had done 'enormous damage' to US-Russian relations. Putin and Trump agreed that 'even the most complex problems should be resolved through peace negotiations,' according to Peskov. Aside from extending invitations to each other to visit their respective nations, the two heads of state 'agreed to quite swiftly organize and hold a working meeting somewhere in a third country,' the official stated. Hours after the phone call on Wednesday, Trump told journalists at the White House that the talks would take place in Saudi Arabia. The location has been changed to Munich. Meetings between high level officials of both Russia and the United States are due to occur later today at the Munich Security Conference. The Munich Security Conference is taking place from February 14 to 16 in Munich, Germany. US Vice President J.D. Vance will lead the American delegation at the MSC, where he is expected to meet with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the conference is an opportunity for American officials to 'lay out a broad path forward' on Ukraine. Meanwhile, US presidential envoy for the Ukraine conflict Keith Kellogg is reportedly expected to make it clear that the US has no intention of deploying troops to protect Ukraine and wants European NATO allies to increase their defense spending. Over the last couple of days Russia and the United States have exchanged prisoners are expressions of good will. President Trump has said that Ukraine will never join NATO and that Russia should rejoin the G8. Former Russian president Medvedev has said that it was the former US administration that made a ‘grave mistake’ with Russia, setting Russian-US negotiations for a fresh start. It looks like Trump is stirring US foreign and defence policy away from Europe. Some pundits even say the US is abandoning them. The US has cut free of Ukraine, and NATO countries for these negotiations. This leaves discussions open between Putin and Trump, with only their respective advisors present. A new Yalta understanding There is a possibility that this upcoming meeting may become just as significant than the Yalta meeting between Winston Churchill of Great Britain, Franklin D Roosevelt of the United States and Joseph Stalin of the USSR, on the southern coast of the Crimean Peninsula back in 1945, when the post WWII world was shaped and defined. Both Putin and Trump have a sense of destiny that may not only influence the end of the Ukraine war and how Ukraine will look, but shape and define Russian and US spheres of influence in Europe and Central Asia in the future. If such an agreement is met, then Putin and Trum will go a long way to shaping what the world will look like from 2025 onwards. Such an agreement would secure Russia’s position in Asia and allow the US to refocus upon the western hemisphere. Its very likely Putin is well aware of Chinese and Iranian interests and will steer the agreement towards a direction, where an even more comprehensive agreement might be made further in 2025. Defining spheres of influence will open the doors to multi-polar national cooperation between nations. However, this mish be speculating to far ahead at this stage. However, there might be some thinking along those lines in the heads of both leaders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP5jCAGuT2RmQ	2025-02-14T18:22:28-08:00	
Military Infiltrations Undermine Thailand’s Democratization – Ana...	Since the abolition of the absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand has alternated between periods of relatively democratic rule and military coups. Officially, there have been 13 successful coups, but the attempted coups, which have been extensively gossiped about in the media, are countless. The last official coup took place in 2014 and brought to power General Prayuth Chan-Ocha, now a Privy Councillor to the king. The democratically elected government led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck Shinawatra was accused of fiddling with rice subsidies. She, like her brother, fled abroad. After five years of military rule, Thailand returned to a military-dominated, semi-elected government in 2019. The combination of economic and political decline, and frustrations over the role of the monarchy, military, and political elite in governing Thailand, led to large demonstrations in 2020 and 2021. In response, the authorities used repressive tactics, including arbitrary arrests, intimidation, and accusations of lèse-majesté. The May 2023 elections called by the military-conservative coalition brought little relief, with two opposition parties -- the Move Forward Party (MFP) with 14 million voters and the Pheu Thai Party (PTP) with 10.6 million -- winning the most votes. Led by the charismatic Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, a Harvard graduate with a background in business, the MFP sought to reform Thailand’s strict royal insult laws, leading to a clash with the kingdom’s powerful royalist-military elite. Although the 2023 elections were relatively open and competitive, the leading opposition party, Move Forward (MFP), was blocked from forming a government by the military-appointed Senate. The other opposition group, Thaksin’s Pheu Thai Party (PTP) (of so-called red shirts), entered the government in a coalition with 11 (yellow) military-affiliated parties, which resulted in the Srettha coalition government on August 21, 2023. Alternative newssite KhaoSod called it a 'silent coup.' Pheu Thai, which appealed to voters with populist promises such as tackling corruption, raising the minimum wage and providing a digital wallet for the less wealthy, has not been able to achieve much of that. It did succeed in bringing Thaksin back to Thailand, and in having his relatively inexperienced daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra appointed Prime Minister after a tug-of-war in front of and behind the scenes. Trouble over a book Those who only occasionally follow the political goings-on in Thailand are sometimes in for a surprise. Apart from some positive reviews, hardly anything has been said in Thailand about the academic book 'Infiltrating Society: The Thai Military’s Internal Security Affairs', which was published in 2021 by the renowned Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. It was available in better bookstores (such as Asia Books) and online. The author is Puangthong R. Pawakapan, Associate Professor at the Department of International Relations, Faculty of Political Science, at the rather conservative-royalist Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. Her work focuses on the Thai military, including internal security affairs. She also maintains a digital archive of documents on the October 6, 1976, massacre. 'It takes not only skill but courage for a Thailand-based scholar to explain so clearly how the military infiltrated society in an effort to build support for its conservative, royalist policies,' argues Andrew J. Nathan, in Foreign Affairs. However, when a forum was announced in late September 2024 to launch the Thai version of Puangthong’s book, published by Same Sky Books (ฟ้าเดียวกัน), it was suddenly cancelled by Chulalongkorn University. The event was moved to the Jim Thompson Museum. Maj Gen Winthai Suwari, the spokesman for ISOC (Internal Security Operations Command), the military’s political wing, strongly criticized the book’s content, claiming it was poorly researched and contained a lot of misinformation. He called for the book to be stopped from being sold. Maj Gen Suwari said the book damaged the image of the military and questioned the author’s qualifications and academic background. He said Puangthong had no experience in security matters. In her response, posted on Facebook, Puangthong argues that her book is based on research and information provided and endorsed by both Thai and foreign experts in Thai political and security affairs. She suggested that the military address the concerns raised in the book through a formal written response or public debate, to promote open dialogue and transparency, rather than a ban. The Bangkok Post agreed, also citing the Prime Minister, and calling it censorship: 'Ms Paetongtarn, as head of the ISOC, has remained silent on the matter. Her silence clearly implies her approval of censorship, which, while unacceptable, is not surprising.' Indeed, on August 27, the government passed a draft decree that will allow the authorities to curtail academic freedom in the interests of what it calls 'ethics.' Under the controversial decree, a panel is charged with examining all research proposals 'to ensure that they do not violate ethical rules relating to religions, cultures, beliefs, traditions and societal norms.' 'It is baffling how Pheu Thai, which bills itself as a ‘progressive’ party, and Ms Paetongtarn can support censorship, as in the case of the ISOC and the decree,' the Bangkok Post observes. Infiltrating Society In 'Infiltrating Society: The Thai Military's Internal Security Affairs,' Puangthong Pawakapan argues that the Thai military has used infiltration tactics to indoctrinate Thai citizens into accepting military ideologies and securing their preferred political order. Puangthong begins by discussing the Thai military’s most important function. She argues that since the Thai military was modernized by King Rama V, the military has little experience in fighting interstate wars, but has plenty of experience in oppressing its own citizens. Historically, the military has used armed repression to suppress civilian resistance, whether it was millennial rebels during the reign of King Rama V, Muslims in the Deep South, or the Communist Party of Thailand during the Cold War. As Puangthong Pawakapan points out in this book, the bureaucracy of internal security is always present on a routine basis, whether Thailand is under military rule or not. By the word 'infiltration,' Puangthong does not mean only that soldiers disguise themselves and spend time or spy on civilians. Infiltration includes any military project that contributes to the expansion of the political domain into civilian society. The Thai military has devised various ways to do this: village development projects, community and mass organizations, military scholarships, and paramilitary intelligence services. Puangthong points out that cases where the military resorts to violence as a last resort, such as the Thammasat University massacre of 1976, the 2010 crackdown on Red Shirts, and perhaps the People's Party Movement today, all demonstrate that infiltration cannot win the hearts and minds of Thai citizens. Most academic readers of the English-language version consider the book an important contribution. Although several other analyses are already available (see e.g. here and here ), a more holistic approach was needed. According to Pasit Wongngamdee, 'Infiltrating Society is that missing work. The book illustrates how deeply the military has infiltrated civil society and the impact on civil-military relations in Thailand.' The US was never far away According to Sinae Hyun of the Korean Institute for East Asian Studies, Sogang University, the main arguments of Infiltrating Society about the role of the Thai military during the counterinsurgency (1960s-1980s) and the post-insurgency period (1980s to present) can be summarized in three thematic statements. (1) The US-led anticommunist counterinsurgency projects during the Cold War modernized and expanded the role of the military in Thai politics and society, and gave the monarchy the role of political legitimator, allowing the military to continue to play the role of security force and leader of socio-economic development in the post-Cold War period (Chapter 2). (2) At every turning point in Thai political history, the military has acted as protector of the nation and has been involved in socio-economic development projects and the spread of Thai democracy, with the monarch acting as head of state (Chapter 3). (3) Despite many attempts by the military to authoritarianize Thai civil society, the latter continued to harbor a deep distrust of the Thai military. The lack of professionalism in development plans and policies also contributed to this distrust (Chapters 4 and 5). Indoctrination and censorship The examples of infiltration examined in this book are often overlooked in other research. When it comes to state indoctrination channels, the literature tends to focus on media and education. However, the Thai military’s infiltration is often highly covert. It extends into rural and border areas far from the spotlight. Sometimes it is disguised under bureaucratic organizations such as the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. It can also disguise itself under the promotion of religious minority groups, such as Catholics, Muslims, and Sikhs. Thailand’s restrictive political environment encourages self-censorship. Legal sanctions are often imposed for criticizing the government or businesses online. The government has announced that it monitors social media to control political expression. 'The Thai judiciary is independent under the constitution, but in practice the courts suffer from politicization and corruption and often fail to protect freedom of expression,' according to Freedom House. Censorship in Thailand operates through a combination of government and non-government mechanisms, which together shape the landscape of freedom of expression, or the lack thereof. Central to these efforts is the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), which is responsible for policing digital spaces and implementing policies that restrict access to certain online content deemed harmful to public order or national security. The MDES uses various tools, such as web filtering and content removal, to control online information deemed inappropriate. This broad authority allows the government to maintain significant influence over digital discourse in the country. Add to this a variety of regulatory bodies for media regulation and censorship. The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) plays a crucial role in supervising broadcast media, and the Press Council of Thailand and the National Press Institute engage in self-regulation among journalists and media organizations, often influencing standards of reporting and expression within the industry. The combination of state and non-state actors creates an extensive censorship framework that limits the rights of individuals to express themselves freely. Thus: a complex interplay between legal frameworks, societal norms, and political dynamics Thailand’s landscape of freedom of expression and censorship laws stands in stark contrast to the approaches taken by several other countries, both in Southeast Asia and beyond. Thailand is characterised by a complex interplay between legal frameworks, societal norms, and political dynamics. Historically, the country has struggled with strict censorship laws that have affected both traditional and digital media platforms. Recent developments, however, have indicated a gradual shift in public discourse and a growing demand for greater openness and tolerance of diverse viewpoints. Yet, the future of freedom of expression regulation remains uncertain. Ongoing political reforms could potentially pave the way for greater respect for individual rights and the liberalisation of freedom of expression. However, this depends on the authorities’ willingness to amend existing laws that currently prioritise stability over open dialogue. Therefore, the general Thai public has become increasingly aware of the importance of freedom of expression in promoting a democratic society.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP1qy-bgTdmU8	2025-02-14T18:21:22-08:00	
AMAN 2025: Pakistan’s Naval Diplomacy Or China’s Strategic Chess ...	As the Pakistan-led AMAN 2025 multinational naval exercise concluded this week in the Arabian Sea, its significance extends far beyond the official narrative of 'Together for Peace.' While the exercise brought together over 60 participating nations, including the United States, China, and Bangladesh, its deeper geopolitical ramifications highlights China’s growing influence in South Asia’s maritime security architecture. At first glance, AMAN appears to be a multilateral confidence-building initiative, fostering international naval cooperation. However, the increasing dominance of China within the exercise, coupled with Pakistan’s economic and military dependence on Beijing, raises pressing questions about AMAN’s true strategic intent. Rather than serving as a neutral forum for maritime collaboration, AMAN 2025 exemplifies how Pakistan is enabling China’s steady encroachment into the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). AMAN’s Evolution: From Maritime Cooperation to Strategic Instrument The AMAN series, first launched in 2007, was initially conceived as a platform to address maritime security challenges, anti-piracy operations, and humanitarian assistance coordination. Over time, however, the exercise has evolved into a geopolitical tool that reflects Pakistan’s shifting alliances and growing dependence on China. This year’s exercise witnessed the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) making its strongest showing yet, sending a naval formation including the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the Type 903A replenishment ship Gaoyouhu. Pakistan’s Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, personally visited the Chinese warship, reinforcing the symbolism of deepening China-Pakistan naval cooperation. While Pakistan portrays AMAN as an inclusive platform, highlighting the participation of NATO members such as the United States and Turkey, the reality is more complex. The increasing presence of the PLAN in AMAN exercises demonstrates Beijing’s ability to institutionalize its role in South Asian naval affairs under the pretense of regional cooperation. In AMAN 2025, PLAN fielded one of the largest contingents, second only to Pakistan, signaling China’s determination to integrate itself into regional security mechanisms. Pakistan’s Maritime Dependence on China Pakistan’s financial and military reliance on China has grown dramatically in recent years, with Beijing serving as Islamabad’s largest arms supplier and principal economic backer through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Over 75% of Pakistan's defence imports between 2018 and 2022 came from China, including advanced warships, submarines, and missile systems. Chinese-built warships dominate Pakistan’s navy, including the Type 054A/P frigates and Hangor-class submarines, which significantly enhance Pakistan’s naval capabilities while fostering greater PLAN-Pakistan Navy interoperability. The recent induction of Chinese-made J-10C fighters into Pakistan’s Air Force further underscores the growing military dependence on Beijing. Gwadar Port, a flagship project under CPEC, is quietly transforming into a strategic outpost for Chinese maritime operations, offering Beijing a foothold in the Arabian Sea. With over $62 billion invested in CPEC projects, China has effectively locked Pakistan into a long-term strategic partnership that extends beyond infrastructure and into military cooperation. Pakistan’s economic crisis has further tightened Beijing’s grip, forcing Islamabad to accommodate China’s strategic ambitions in the Indian Ocean in return for financial lifelines. By serving as a willing host for China’s naval expansion in AMAN 2025, Pakistan effectively cements its status as Beijing’s key partner in counterbalancing India’s regional influence. Strategic Implications for India and the Indo-Pacific For India, the growing China-Pakistan maritime nexus poses a direct challenge to its strategic position in the IOR. While New Delhi has traditionally dominated South Asian waters, China’s systematic expansion through AMAN exercises, naval bases in Djibouti, Hambantota, and Gwadar, and regular submarine deployments in the IOR signals a shift in regional power dynamics. The participation of Bangladesh’s BNS Samudra Joy in AMAN 2025 is particularly significant. This marks the first time in over a decade that Dhaka has sent a major warship to a Pakistan-hosted naval exercise. Given China’s role as Bangladesh’s largest defense supplier, accounting for nearly 74% of Dhaka’s arms imports, Bangladesh’s involvement in AMAN signals a growing tilt towards Beijing’s regional security architecture. Bangladesh’s decision to join the exercise raises concerns about China’s long-term influence over smaller South Asian navies, potentially drawing them into Beijing’s strategic orbit at India’s expense. For the broader Indo-Pacific, AMAN 2025 exposes the limitations of the U.S. and its allies in countering China’s soft power in multilateral naval diplomacy. While the U.S. Navy participated in the exercise, Washington risks legitimizing China’s growing influence by engaging in events that subtly reinforce Beijing’s leadership in regional security frameworks. China’s Long-Term Maritime Strategy in the IOR AMAN 2025 is not an isolated event; it fits within China’s broader strategy of establishing a permanent maritime presence in the IOR, where it has historically had limited operational reach. Since 2008, China has steadily expanded its presence in the Indian Ocean under the pretext of anti-piracy operations. Djibouti, Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port, and Pakistan’s Gwadar Port provide Beijing with a 'String of Pearls' for logistical support and power projection. PLAN submarines have made periodic appearances in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, signaling an intent to challenge India’s maritime dominance. A lesser-known but significant aspect of China’s strategy is its seabed mapping operations in the Indian Ocean. Over the past decade, China has deployed multiple research vessels, such as Xiangyanghong 06 and Shiyan 6, to conduct detailed hydrographic surveys. These surveys, conducted under the pretext of scientific research, are crucial for China’s submarine operations, as they help map underwater topography, identify potential submarine routes, and enhance PLAN’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The Xiangyanghong series vessels alone have conducted over several missions in the Indian Ocean, including unexplained surveys near India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands. By embedding itself into Pakistan-led naval initiatives, China is creating a low-cost, high-impact mechanism to integrate South Asian navies into its sphere of influence while using exercises like AMAN to familiarize itself with regional waters and potential conflict zones. What’s Next? As AMAN 2025 concludes, its legacy is less about maritime security and more about China’s strategic maneuvering in South Asia. While Pakistan continues to project the exercise as a symbol of inclusive naval diplomacy, it is increasingly clear that Beijing is the real winner. By leveraging Pakistan’s economic and military dependence, China has successfully expanded its footprint in the IOR under the guise of multilateral naval cooperation. For India, the challenge is no longer just about countering China’s presence in the South China Sea but about confronting an assertive Chinese naval presence in the Indian Ocean. The broader Indo-Pacific, including the U.S. and its allies, must recognize that China’s engagement in AMAN is not merely symbolic but part of a long-term strategy to reshape South Asia’s maritime order. AMAN 2025 serves as a stark reminder that China is no longer just a distant maritime power; it is now a direct actor in shaping South Asia’s naval future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP9OquzvuSidQ	2025-02-14T18:20:32-08:00	
The Second Matrix: Break The Controlled Awakening – OpEd	Beyond the First Veil In ‘Reading Between the Lies,’ we explored how to recognize patterns of institutional deception—the carefully crafted narratives that keep humanity trapped in a matrix of perceptions. Theodore Dalrymple identified how this first matrix of control operates in totalitarian regimes: 'In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.' This principle of forced participation hasn’t disappeared—it has evolved. Today’s system doesn’t merely demand silence but active complicity in its narratives, weaponizing resistance itself as a means of influence. Watching trusted voices expose real corruption, only to redirect into managed solutions, reveals an even deeper pattern: The system doesn’t just create propaganda—it creates contained paths for those who see through propaganda. Breaking free from mainstream programming is only the first step. What follows is both subtler and just as disturbing. Untethering from institutional narratives creates an immediate vulnerability—the need for new answers, new leaders, new direction. Those who steer the first matrix wouldn’t leave the off-ramps unsupervised. This illuminates the deeper mechanics of the second matrix: capturing awakening through sophisticated channels of inauthentic opposition. The Mechanics of Controlled Opposition The pattern becomes clear when we examine how systemic criticism is managed: Those who expose corruption are permitted to speak, but only within careful boundaries. Take banking for instance—even those who reveal central banking’s predatory nature rarely demand abolition. The 2008 crisis pushed financial fraud into mainstream awareness through popular exposés like The Big Short. Yet understanding bred only mistrust—no accountability, just bailouts for perpetrators and a more fragile system for everyone else. Like any sophisticated confidence game, it works in stages: first gain trust through real revelations, then build dependency through exclusive 'insider' knowledge, finally redirect that trust toward constrained outcomes. Watch how alternative media platforms follow this pattern: expose genuine corruption, build a devoted following, and then subtly shift narrative focus away from systemic accountability. Each revelation seems to lead deeper into a labyrinth of coordinated awakening. Note: I’m deliberately avoiding naming specific targets—this analysis isn’t about creating new heroes or villains, but recognizing patterns that transcend individuals. What makes this model so effective is that the same institutions that transformed money from gold to paper also convert genuine resistance into managed opposition. As I wrote in ‘Fiat Everything,’ just as synthetic currency replaces real value, fiat opposition movements offer synthetic versions of independent awakening—containing just enough truth to feel real while keeping opposition within safe boundaries. Understanding these patterns of controlled opposition can feel overwhelming. Each revelation seems to lead to another layer of deception. It’s like discovering you’re in a maze only to realize there are mazes within mazes. Some get lost documenting every turn—debating financial system minutiae, arguing over medical protocols, dissecting geopolitical chess moves. Or in ‘conspiracy circles’—was the virus isolated? How did the Towers really go down? What’s really on Antarctica? While these questions matter, getting stuck in endless maze-mapping misses the point entirely. Healthy debate and disagreement are natural, and even healthy, in truth-seeking movements, but when these debates consume all energy and attention, they prevent effective action toward core goals. The Research Journey For the last few years, I’ve been deeply immersed in uncovering the mechanisms of control—not as an abstract exercise, but alongside a team that includes some of my closest friends, following trails that seemed to lead to truth. The revelations have been staggering—fundamental ‘facts’ we grew up accepting have been exposed as complete fabrications. We’ve been humbled twice over—first in unlearning what we thought we knew, then in discovering our own certainties about new paths were wrong. Paths that appeared revolutionary led to sophisticated dead ends. Communities that felt authentic revealed themselves as engineered channels. The hardest truth isn’t just recognizing deception—it’s accepting that we might never know the full story while still needing to act on what we can verify. What began as research into specific deceptions revealed something far more profound: While devastating physical wars rage in multiple regions, a deeper conflict unfolds silently across the planet—a war for the freedom of human consciousness itself. This is what World War III looks like—not just bombs and bullets, but the systematic engineering of human perception. This pattern of building trust before redirection reflects a deeper system of control, operating on the ancient alchemical principle of Solve et Coagula—first dissolve (break apart), then coagulate (reform under control). The process is precise: When people begin recognizing institutional deception, natural coalitions form across traditional divides. Workers unite against central bank policies. Parents organize against pharmaceutical mandates. Communities resist corporate land grabs. But watch what happens next—these unified movements get systematically dissolved. Consider how quickly unified resistance fractured after October 7th, how the trucker protests dissolved into partisan narratives. Each fragment splinters further—from questioning authority to competing theories, from united action to tribal infighting. This isn’t random fragmentation; it’s calculated dissolution. Once broken apart, these fragments can be reformed (coagulated) into controlled dialectical channels, as people revert to prior programming about issues that supersede their unity. Watch how the confidence game operates in truth movements: First comes legitimate revelation—real documents, genuine whistleblowers, undeniable evidence. Trust builds through authentic insight. Then subtle redirection begins. Just as they slice society into ever-smaller fragments along political, racial, and cultural lines, they splinter truth movements into competing camps. Unity becomes division. Action becomes debate. Resistance becomes content. This systematic fragmentation of awakening movements reflects a deeper historical pattern—one that traces the evolution of mass perception control from crude propaganda to sophisticated biodigital manipulation. From Propaganda to Programming The first matrix-shaped thoughts through direct programming. The path from Bernays to biodigital oversight follows a clear progression: first manipulate mass psychology, then digitize behavior, finally merge with biology itself. Each phase builds on the previous—from studying human nature, to tracking it, to directly engineering it. From Bernays discovering how to manipulate mass psychology through unconscious desires, to Tavistock refining social engineering, to algorithmic behavior modification—each phase brings more sophisticated tools for reality manipulation. Digital technology accelerated this evolution: social media algorithms perfect attention capture, smartphones enable constant behavioral monitoring, AI systems predict and shape responses. Now, as these digital tools merge with biological interventions—from mood-altering pharmaceuticals to brain-computer interfaces—they approach complete governance over human perception itself. What began with crude propaganda evolved into precise digital manipulation of attention and behavior. The second matrix creates approved channels for those who break free—an engineered ecosystem of controlled alternatives. Just as coordinated media narratives trained the professional class to outsource their thinking to ‘authoritative sources,’ the biodigital matrix now offers to outsource their sensibility itself—promising enhanced cognition while delivering deeper programming. This represents the latest evolution in perception management: At first, they simply denied conspiracies existed. When that became impossible due to undeniable evidence, they created orchestrated channels for awakening minds to follow. The OJ Simpson trial marked a crucial shift in this strategy—it trained society to process serious investigations as entertainment spectacle. As Marshall McLuhan famously observed, ‘the medium is the message‘—the format of spectacular media entertainment itself reshapes how we process truth, regardless of content. What began as legitimate questions about police corruption and institutional bias became a ratings-driven soap opera. The same pattern continues today—Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes become Netflix entertainment while his clients remain free, and the alleged Mangione shooting spawns multiple streaming productions within days of the event, even before the investigation concludes. The Las Vegas and New Orleans incidents last week offer a stark demonstration: within hours, potentially disruptive events are channeled into competing narratives, while the entertainment apparatus stands ready to transform any serious investigation into consumable content. Real revelations about trafficking networks and institutional crime have become binge-worthy content. Whistleblowers become influencers. Declassified documents become TikTok trends. With limited attention spans and infinite content, truth-seeking becomes another form of consumption that pacifies rather than empowers. Watch how enough time passes and ‘conspiracy theories’ become limited hangouts—JFK’s death gets attributed to ‘the mob,’ a convenient decoy from the institutional forces behind it. Similar patterns emerge with 9/11 revelations. Here’s my position—extreme as it may seem to my friends still steeped in conventional narratives: we have to consider the possibility that the power structure controls both sides of most major debates. Every mainstream narrative has its approved opposition. Every awakening gets its sanctioned leaders. Every revelation leads to administered channels. Understanding this pattern could lead to paralysis—but it shouldn’t. Instead, it means recognizing we need new ways of thinking and organizing entirely. As researcher Whitney Webb observed on X the other day: Screenshot Only the designated enemy changes—the push for greater surveillance and oversight remains constant. Each ‘side’ gets its turn feeding fear to its base while the same institutions expand their power. Nixon opens China. Clinton pushed NAFTA. Trump accelerates Operation Warp Speed. I’m observing a pattern here—not alleging conspiracy, but noting how political figures often act contrary to their public personas: Nixon, the anti-communist, opens the door to China; Clinton, who campaigned on protecting American workers, pushes through the biggest free trade agreement; Trump, the populist outsider, advances Big Pharma’s agenda. Whether through institutional pressures, political realities, or other forces, these contradictions reveal a sophisticated pattern: the system scripts both sides of major political transformations, ensuring controlled outcomes regardless of who appears to hold power. Many of these figures may themselves be responding to forces they barely understand—useful or manipulated actors rather than conscious orchestrators. This dynamic isn’t limited to politicians. Consider Twitter/X, which has spent the last couple of years branding itself as a bastion of free speech while just this week introducing algorithms to amplify ‘positivity.’ Framed as promoting constructive dialogue, it mirrors the same subjective moderation policies once criticized as censorship. This pattern of controlled opposition extends through every level of awakening movements. Consider how many of my friends still caught in the first matrix dismiss QAnon followers as complete fools, mocking them as cartoon characters while ignoring the documented institutional corruption the movement has exposed. What they don’t understand is that beneath the theatrical elements lie significant evidence of systemic criminality. I remain open-minded about examining these claims—after all, pattern recognition requires considering evidence without prejudice. But the movement’s core message of ‘trust the plan’ reveals how awakening gets redirected. It transforms active resistance into passive spectatorship, waiting for hidden ‘white hats’ to save them instead of taking meaningful action. This is where I draw the line. I can’t outsource my family’s well-being to unknown entities or secret plans. This requires constant vigilance—alert to both obvious threats and subtle misdirection. The most dangerous aspect of managed opposition isn’t the information it shares, but how it teaches learned helplessness disguised as hope. The Capture of Authentic Movements Each new theory and movement adds another layer of complexity, drawing seekers further from meaningful action. The 1960s counterculture went from questioning war and authority to ‘tune in, drop out’ passivity. By the 1980s, former hippies became yuppies, their revolutionary awareness neatly channeled into consumer capitalism. Even today, the anti-war movement shows this pattern—one political side opposes war in Ukraine while supporting it in Gaza, the other reverses these positions. Each side claims to be anti-war when it’s not their preferred conflict. Occupy Wall Street followed the same pattern: beginning with potent exposure of financial corruption, it fragmented into competing social justice causes that left the banking system untouched. The seduction lies in the truth content. Environmental movements expose corporate pollution but push carbon credits and individual guilt. Social justice movements expose real inequities but redirect into corporate DEI programs. The organic food revolution began as resistance to industrial agriculture but became a premium product category—redirecting real concerns into boutique shopping choices. Each movement contains enough truth to attract awakened minds while setting careful guardrails on acceptable solutions—identifying real problems but advocating solutions that expand institutional power. This pattern repeats at every level. Throughout history, power structures have understood the principle of supplying controlled leadership to emerging movements. This pattern continues today across every awakening movement. The template is consistent: A politician 'bravely' questions vaccines while taking pharma money A pundit 'exposes' deep state corruption while defending intelligence agencies A celebrity 'fights cancel culture' while pushing digital passports A financial guru 'warns' about banking collapse while selling CBDCs These patterns of redirection play out vividly today. The medical freedom movement demonstrates this dynamic: Valid concerns about vaccine injuries risk getting redirected into competing theories and circular debates, while accountability remains elusive. The recent MAHA controversy shows how even valid food sovereignty concerns can potentially redirect focus from this urgent crisis of vaccine injuries and accountability. The crypto world illustrates this pattern: Valid criticism of central banking transforms into tribal warfare between token communities. Each claims exclusive truth while potentially extending the system’s reach. Even reasonable debates about monetary solutions become religious devotion to competing coins. Meanwhile, the original promise of Bitcoin—the first cryptocurrency and its vision of financial autonomy—risks getting co-opted, as blockchain technology is repurposed for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), digital IDs, and automated compliance. The very tools meant to free us from banking surveillance are being repurposed to perfect it. But the fusion of financial control with digital identity creates something far more insidious—a system that can enforce social compliance through access to basic resources, monitor thoughts through transaction patterns, and ultimately merge with our biological existence itself. This architecture isn’t just about controlling money—it’s about programming minds. The Biodigital Convergence: Engineering Human Reality The fusion of digital and biological control isn’t just changing how we interact—it’s redesigning human perception itself. As social connections move increasingly online, authentic human awareness is being systematically replaced with engineered experiences. Beyond attention hijacking and emotional manipulation, the deepest cost hits us where it hurts most—in our human connections. Every day we see people together physically but separated by screens, missing moments of genuine connection while scrolling through manufactured realities. This artificial construct is set to deepen further—Meta has announced plans to populate Facebook feeds with AI-generated content and bot interactions by 2025, raising questions about authentic human connection on these platforms. Big Pharma brought the ability to chemically alter cognizance; Big Tech perfected the ability to digitally direct attention and shape behavior. Their merger isn’t about market share—it’s about complete spectrum dominance over human cognition itself. The same companies that pushed pills to numb a generation now partner with platforms that addict us to digital stimulation. The corporations that profited from ADHD medication collaborate with social media giants that deliberately engineer attention deficit. The entities that market antidepressants join forces with algorithm makers who scientifically manipulate emotional responses. As Whitney Webb observed about the shifting enemy narrative from ‘Russians’ to ‘Islamists,’ the designated threat changes while surveillance expansion remains constant. The digital ID agenda follows this pattern: while the World Economic Forum presents it as humanitarian aid for financial inclusion, it builds the architecture for comprehensive behavioral monitoring and oversight. Each crisis—whether health, security, or financial—adds new requirements that merge identity, banking, health records, and social tracking into a single unified system. What begins as voluntary participation inevitably becomes mandatory as digital surveillance extends into monitoring and shaping human behavior itself—the perfect staging ground for Central Bank Digital Currency. This surveillance architecture represents the merging of two foundational pillars. What began with chemical alterations of mood and thought, then evolved into digital manipulation of attention and behavior, is now fusing into a single architecture for human experiential management. Watch how mental health apps collect behavioral data while promoting medication. Social credit scoring merges with health tracking. The same companies developing digital identity systems partner with pharmaceutical giants. This isn’t future speculation—it’s happening now. While we debate the ethics of AI, they’re quietly building the infrastructure to merge human cognition with digital systems. The transhumanist promise of enhanced awareness through technology masks a darker reality—each integration diminishes natural human perception, replacing genuine consciousness with an engineered simulation. This technological colonization of the human brain seeks to sever our connection to natural awareness and spiritual sovereignty. In one of his later lectures, Aldous Huxley, the renowned author of Brave New World, offered a chilling prediction about the future of social control: 'There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it.' We’re at a crucial juncture where technological capture of human consciousness is becoming irreversible. Each new generation is born into deeper digital integration, their baseline reality increasingly synthetic. But recognizing this pattern reveals both the threat and its weakness. While they perfect technological tools for control, they can’t fully replicate the power of direct human connection. Every instance of genuine interaction, every moment of unmediated presence, demonstrates what their system can’t capture. The answer isn’t just seeing through lies—it’s creating spaces of human connection that exist outside their control architecture. What makes this moment unprecedented isn’t just the sophistication of control, but its method of implementation—not through force, but through seduction and convenience. Each convenience we embrace, each digital enhancement we accept, brings us closer to their vision of managed awareness. Liberating Consciousness, Reclaiming Connection Understanding these mechanisms doesn’t mean rejecting technology or retreating into paranoid isolation—it means recognizing that real power begins with autonomy and learning to engage with modernity on our own terms. The battle for our minds requires both awareness and authentic action. While they attempt to engineer behavior through chemicals and algorithms, our power lies first in liberating ourselves, then extending through direct human connection. Their endgame—absolute mastery over human perception and cognition—reveals a fundamental weakness: they cannot fully contain liberated minds and authentic human relationships that exist outside their mediated channels. This comprehensive system requires managed opposition at every level, steering us away from genuine awakening and direct engagement. The crucial insight is this: The opposite of globalism isn’t nationalism or political movements—it’s individual liberty expressed through local action. Real awakening can’t be programmed or scheduled. It emerges through clear recognition and spreads through genuine connection. When intellectuals at think tanks like Brownstone Institute found common cause with firefighters, the system recognized a dangerous precedent. Unity across traditional societal divides—between intellectuals, professionals, and working people—demonstrates how truly free people can bridge manufactured divisions. While digital networks can facilitate organization, true power manifests in physical community. Speaking from experience, these digital networks have been invaluable in my journey—I’ve found kindred spirits, shared insights, and built lasting friendships through online communities. These connections have helped me understand patterns I might never have seen alone. But information sharing is just the first step. The real transformation happens when we take these shared insights off the screen and into our communities, turning digital connections into flesh-and-blood relationships and shared local action. This means: Freeing our minds while they push programmed thinking (creating local learning circles to counter their digital-pharmaceutical engineering of thought) Building connections while maintaining individual agency (establishing real communities to resist their social credit systems) Taking action without waiting for consensus (bypassing their arranged opposition channels) Growing food while they push synthetic alternatives (maintaining biological autonomy as they push lab-created dependencies) Building community while they sell digital tribes (creating genuine connection as antidote to technological isolation) Healing ourselves while they market dependencies (developing natural resilience against their biodigital convergence) The most powerful truth isn’t a revelation—it’s the recognition that consciousness can transcend its constructed boundaries entirely. The way out requires stepping beyond their endless distractions and reclaiming grounded, authentic action. Their biodigital convergence can only capture souls that follow their prescribed paths. Our essence was never truly bound by their walls. ​​Stay vigilant. Question everything. Free your mind and act with intention. The revolution begins with sovereign spirits and grows through genuine connection. Build where they destroy. Create while they deceive. Connect while they divide. The way out of their matrix is with eyes wide open and feet planted firmly in local soil.

Neighboring Countries Should Be The Focus Of China’s Diplomacy – ...	By Zhou Chao For a long time, relations with the United States have always been a top priority in China's diplomatic work. Relevant experts in the field have repeatedly pointed out that maintaining stable development of U.S.-China relations is one of the most important elements in China's diplomatic strategy. Previously, China actively proposed building a new type of major-power relationship, reflecting its expectations for the development of the relations. According to the essence of this new type of major-power relationship, i.e., 'no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation', China focuses on three main aspects in developing relations with the U.S.: First, strengthening strategic mutual trust, effectively managing differences, and ensuring no conflict and no confrontation; Second, enhancing exchanges at all levels to promote mutual respect between the two countries; Third, advancing pragmatic cooperation in various fields to continue achieving mutual benefits. China has consistently emphasized that the focus of its policy toward the U.S. should be on strengthening strategic mutual trust and effectively managing differences. There is no doubt that the easing of U.S.-China relations and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries have been important external factors for the smooth advancement of China's reform and opening-up efforts. With the support and recognition of the U.S. within certain limits, the global economic-technical-financial network controlled by the U.S. and the West eventually accepted China's integration. Additionally, significant capital investment and technology transfer from the U.S. and the West have been crucial driving forces behind China's rise in economy and technology. It is also indisputable that in recent years, the deepening of the negative aspects of U.S.-China relations has been a major reason for the deterioration of China's relations with the U.S. and the West. A series of actions taken by the U.S. has significantly challenged China's interests in many third-world countries, with Panama recently officially announcing its full withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It seems that the only way to effectively resolve the series of challenges China is facing at present is to continue to make every effort to improve diplomatic relations with the U.S. However, a senior researcher at ANBOUND pointed out that, in order to effectively safeguard China's overseas interests and global position, neighboring countries should become the key focus of China's diplomatic efforts in the future, at least within the next 3 to 5 years. First, making every effort to deepen and optimize diplomatic relations with neighboring countries is an objective requirement in the era of de-globalization. Up until now, globalization driven by capital, which has overly focused on the economic aspect, has shown a series of problems and signs of fatigue. Economically, the comprehensive expansion of globalization in the past has not fulfilled its earlier promise of universal prosperity. The gap between rich and poor, both between nations and within nations, continues to widen, triggering global dissatisfaction. On the social and cultural level, the full promotion of globalization has not effectively bridged the gaps in culture and ideology. The degree of opposition between different cultures and ideologies has even intensified, while the wave of migration caused by past globalization has sparked strong discontent from the dominant national groups, even in developed countries, leading to the rise of right-wing populist forces. Moreover, the lengthening of global industrial and value chains has made the international economic system highly vulnerable when faced with major pandemics, natural disasters, or regional conflicts. ANBOUND has already emphasized that regionalization will be the dominant trend in the future, with major powers gradually shifting their development focus to their geographically adjacent regions. After Donald Trump took office, he repeatedly requested Denmark to cede Greenland and asked Canada to join the U.S., which were not just mere jokes. Second, the latest series of developments in China's neighboring countries indicate that its interests in these nations are increasingly facing urgent and direct threats. As a key area of interest for China's BRI, namely the security situation in Pakistan has become more turbulent. The actions of separatist and terrorist forces are growing in strength and their destructive power is escalating, along with a deepening of anti-China sentiment. The Pakistani authorities, constrained by their own capabilities and internal political struggles, face challenges to respond, and the performance of the Gwadar Port project has also been unsatisfactory. In Myanmar, the conflict between local armed groups and the military government is intensifying, and China's interests in this Southeast Asian country are facing increasingly severe threats. In Cambodia, the future of the major canal project, previously agreed upon with China's heavy investment, remains uncertain. U.S. and Japanese capitals are likely to replace Chinese investment, and Cambodia-China relations face more unpredictability. In the South China Sea, regarding disputes over islands and reefs, the Philippines has become increasingly adamant in its stance against China, and Vietnam has not fully reversed its confrontational position toward China. The South Sea issue could further escalate at any time. In northern China, factors such as terrorism and social unrest in Central Asia continue to pose significant threats to China's interests. Recently, Russia has implemented strict screening of goods along the China-Europe Railway, citing the need to 'prevent sensitive materials from transiting'. The focus is on inspecting dual-use military and civilian items and sensitive goods, while also seizing various civilian essential goods, hindering normal trade between China and Europe. Additionally, there are reports that Russia plans to build a bridge over the Tumen River, directly connecting to North Korea, but the height of the bridge will effectively block the potential for Chinese vessels to pass through the Tumen River to the sea. Although further verification is needed, considering Russia's long-standing obstruction of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project and attempts to form a natural gas export alliance with Central Asian countries to influence gas exports to China, this development should not be underestimated. All in all, due to the complex geopolitical and ideological factors, the surrounding regions, which are critical to China's development and home to many significant projects, are increasingly facing risks and challenges that require more attention from China. Third, the relative withdrawal of the U.S. attention in the region provides China with a window of opportunity to strengthen its influence over regional situations. Both Trump's victory speech and his actions after taking office indicate that domestic issues will be the primary focus of the U.S. government. Recently, Trump's proposal to offer civil servants a 'buyout' of their years of service has faced joint resistance from legislative bodies across multiple regions, and the long-standing establishment of the U.S. government suggests that Trump's efforts to reorganize the government will not be smooth. As a result, the U.S. government's foreign attention and resources are likely to be adjusted or even reduced, with its focus shifting more toward matters in the Americas. When it comes to China's surrounding situations, the U.S. is likely to adopt a more opportunistic approach, using offshore balancing to exert influence, while its willingness and capacity for direct involvement may decrease. For China, this represents an opportunity that should not be overlooked. Final analysis conclusion: One important point to recognize is that the complexity of the surrounding situation China faces is far greater than that of the U.S. At the same time, neighboring countries concentrate a large portion of China's major interests, yet its relations with these countries are facing increasingly severe challenges. As the U.S. tends to further retract, China should, at least in the next 3 to 5 years, devote more attention to its diplomacy with neighboring countries, dedicating time and effort to address and resolve the series of issues in the surrounding situation.

Trump And Modi Meet Half Way To Put Indo-US Relations On An Even ...	In the larger interest of Indo-American relations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed willingness to adjust India's policies to enable President Donald Trump to carry out his plan to get America a fair deal in international trade and revitalise its economy. US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Washington on Thursday to iron out differences in the larger interest of Indo-American relations. Strong Indo-US relations area a critical necessity for both India and the US given their adversarial relations with the common challenger China. The optics at the White House parleys were excellent. The two leaders shook hands and hugged each other before they addressed the international press at the White House immediately before holding bilateral talks. 'I appreciate how President Trump always keeps his country first. I do the same - that is something that we have in common,' Modi said. And complementing Modi, Trump said: 'He is doing a great job in India and he and I share a great friendship. We will continue to build on ties between our nations.' Trump emphasized that US and India have a 'great friendship' and added that he thought that 'it's only going to get closer'. The fact that Modi's party the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had swept the Delhi elections only a few days before, would have enhanced his profile in the Trump camp and boost his efforts to 'deepen the India-US partnership' in key areas such as technology, trade, defence and energy as sought by Modi. Trump offered to sell state-of-the-art fighter jets to India as he and Modi vowed to ramp up trade, rekindling a bond that defies the new US administration's punitive approach to much of the world. Trump said that he found a 'special bond' with Modi and India and, in an uncharacteristic, if ironic show of humility, complimented Modi as being a 'much tougher negotiator' than he is. US$ 500 billion Trade Modi said that US and India are targeting US$ 500 billion bilateral trade by 2030. He further said that the US and India would work together on Artificial Intelligence and semiconductors and focus on establishing strong supply chains for strategic minerals. Trump said that he expected 'wonderful trade deals' and noted that India is reforming its laws to welcome US nuclear technologies. Tariff Issue Modi would have to give his nod to a significant hike in American tariffs on imports from India and lower Indian tariffs on US goods coming to India to narrow the significant trade gap now in favour of India. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totalled around US$ 190.1 billion in 2023. US exports to India were worth US$70 billion and imports US$120 billion. The US is India's largest trade partner, but the two countries have a trade deficit of US$ 50 billion which is in India's favour. Even as he referred to Modi as a 'great friend,' Trump on Thursday signed increases on tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries, including India, charge on imports. Earlier,Trump had indicated that he was going to be hard on India which he called a 'Tariff King.' He said: 'India is a very hard place to do business because of the tariffs. They have the highest tariffs.' Indeed, among Asian economies, India has a 9.5% weighted average effective tariff on US exports, while there is a 3% rate on India's exports to the US. Thailand has a 6.2% rate and China a 7.1% rate on US products. Trump has already signed a round of what he called 'reciprocal tariffs' to create a level playing field between US manufacturers and foreign competitors. He slapped 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, to boost local production. The 25% tariff applies to India too. India is not a particularly large supplier of steel to the US, but it is one of the world's largest primary producers of aluminium and America is its top export market. India's aluminium exports to the US, therefore, could see a drop. Trade Agreement India has no option but to grin and bear the tariff hikes. One way to cushion itself against the US tariff blows is to enter into a broad trade agreement with the US. India and US are working to finalizing such an agreement by the end of 2025. A trade agreement, appropriately packaged, will enable India to sell to the Indian public the idea of paying high tariffs in the US and charge less on imports from the US. Anticipating Trump's moves, in February, India slashed custom duties on import of American products, such as high-end motorcycles and cars, and smartphone components, in a move that is expected to benefit American corporate giants like Harley-Davidson, Tesla, and Apple. In 2023 itself India had dropped retaliatory tariffs on US almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts. More recently, India allowed US-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India itself, and the sale of US-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. Prior to meeting with Trump, Modi had met Elon Musk, the SpaceX founder and top Trump administration official. It is expected that Musk's Starlink satellite system for transmitting commercial programmes, will be allowed to operate in India. Earlier, India had feared that Starlink might compromise India's security. Adani Case Earlier, in a move that would help Modi and his protégé billionaire businessman Gautam Adani, Trump signed an Executive Order directing the Department of Justice (DoJ) to pause enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) that prohibits American companies and foreign firms from bribing officials of foreign governments to obtain or retain business. Under the Biden administration Gautam Adani and his company were charged for paying with US investors' money, US$ 265 million as bribes to Indian officials to secure solar power contracts. This charge may now be dropped as Trump has paused actions based on FCPA. About FCPA Trump said: 'It sounds good, but it hurts the country.' If FCPA is strictly enforced, US companies may not be able to do business in the Global South. It is widely known that the Biden administration did not favour Modi because of his bonhomie with Russian President Putin. Adani suffered on account of this when he was indicated in a US court for alleged bribery. Trump is now trying to negotiate a deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine and save money for the US. And Modi has always been calling for an end to the war. This convergence of interest has led to Adani's getting off the hook. To suit Trump, Adani has announced a plan to invest billions in the US. Illegal Immigration Illegal immigration is a key political issue bedevilling Indo-US relations since Trump came to power. The US says that there are 700,000 illegal Indian immigrants in the US. Recently, 104 of them were bound hand and foot, piled into a military aircraft and flown to India. The video footage of these poor Indians spoiled the image of America in Indian eyes. And the Modi government was seen as weak-kneed in its response to the US action. Getting US to take a more humanistic approach to this issue would have been one of the aims of Modi's talks with Trump. But to help Trump, India has already said that it will take back verified citizens of India though it insists that the number of illegals is only about 470. Modi would have made a pitch for maintaining the H-1B visa regime, a cause dear to India's burgeoning middle class. Sections of the US right wing are against these visas. Defence and Geopolitics For the Trump administration, India is an integral to the US strategy of containing China in the Indo-Pacific. India will be hosting a summit of Quad made up of the US, India, Japan and Australia later this year. The US had declared China as the strategic competitor in its Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS-2022) in February 2022, and simultaneously designated India as its strategic partner and counter weight to China. Ever since, India is being granted exceptionalism and preferential treatment to enhance its technological and military potential against China. The USA not only granted unprecedented CAATSA waiver to India for purchasing S-400 from Russia but also facilitated access to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). The US had entered into 123 civil nuclear agreement besides exporting niche military capabilities to India and concluded a number of military agreements including General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA); Logistic Support Agreement (LSA); Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Intelligence (BECA) with India. Modi would like Trump greater substance to these agreements and also see that US products are not prohibitively priced. During the Biden era in 2022, the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) was launched. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it. Modi would have sought assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they would remain committed to this. Blow to Pakistan In a blow to Pakistan, Trump approved Tahawwur Rana's extradition to India. Rana, a Pakistani, had masterminded the Mumbai terrorist attack. 'I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters (Tahawwur Rana) and one of the very evil people of the world, having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India. He is going back to India to face justice,' Trump said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP6RCDuDRJ0Mw	2025-02-14T18:14:09-08:00	
Iran: Power Outages And Economic Paralysis Deepen Crises – OpEd	Power outages and the electricity crisis have exacerbated the suffering of people across Iran, especially as many regions are already paralyzed due to air pollution or struggling with heavy snow, icy roads, and road closures. According to the regime’s media, on Wednesday, February 12, schools, government offices, and banks were closed in Tehran and 25 other provinces. Widespread power outages, despite all the problems they bring, are just a small part of the people’s suffering. The lack of electricity cripples daily life, forcing factories and businesses to shut down, leading to heavy financial losses. A simple example is bakeries, which provide daily bread for people in every city and neighborhood. With power outages, they are unable to serve customers, and even the dough prepared for baking goes to waste. Other businesses, such as metal workshops, carpentry shops, repair centers, and stores, also face similar problems. Instead of making a living, they suffer financial damage. In a video clip from Isfahan on Wednesday, February 12, a local resident says: 'Look at the situation they’ve created for people. I was filming something for a customer, and suddenly the power went out. We were packing an order for a customer, but it’s been an hour now, and the power is still out, leaving our work unfinished. What kind of situation is this? There’s no electricity at home, and there’s no electricity at the workshop either.' Other videos from Tehran also depict powerless neighborhoods and the frustration of residents in the streets. A local woman says: 'The power in my shop has been cut off, and this is my peak working hour. When the electricity goes out, neither our life is a life nor our business is a business. I’m disappointed in this government for failing to provide electricity. How long is this going to continue? How long do we have to live like this? This is our shop and our income, but at the end of the month, we still have to pay for electricity, water, gas, and taxes.' The electricity crisis is a reflection of the overall crisis within the clerical regime, which is struggling in the swamp of its destructive policies and comprehensive failures. Internally, the regime is also in turmoil, plagued by infighting and factional disputes. The ongoing conflict between the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Oil, both responsible for resolving such issues, is a scandal in the cabinet of regime president Masoud Pezeshkian. The Ministry of Oil, blaming the Ministry of Energy, stated in a report, 'While statistics show that proper fuel management could have prevented the recent problems, the Ministry of Energy, instead of focusing on sound policymaking and implementing regulations related to liquid fuel consumption, is attempting to shift the blame by portraying gas shortages as the primary cause of power outages.' Fatemeh Mohajerani, Pezeshkian’s spokesperson, attempted to justify the situation that has frustrated people by making a ridiculous statement: 'As the Tavanir electricity company announced, due to difficulties in supplying power plant fuel, which is rooted in fuel imbalance, we were forced to cut power to some residential areas. This is certainly not desirable for the government, nor are we really happy or satisfied with it, but when we are stuck in difficult conditions, we have to get through it together. We are in a situation where we are forced to do this—meaning that power outages are not our first choice, but given the circumstances, we have no other option.' The reality, however, is that this regime is not the solution to the problem but the root of all problems. This is why the only true solution for the people of Iran is an uprising and the overthrow of this anti-Iranian regime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP9pYy2wYO37D	2025-02-14T18:12:28-08:00	
Why Europe’s Security Must Be A Key US Aim – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Last week was a busy one in US-European relations. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth made his first official visit to Europe for a NATO meeting in Brussels, Vice President J.D. Vance also made his first visit to deliver a speech on artificial intelligence in Paris — and Americans woke up to the surprising news that an American long held by Russia had been released as part of a prisoner exchange. President Donald Trump also held lengthy phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to jump start Ukraine peace talks between the two countries. These events all led up to the annual Munich Security Conference, beginning on Friday, at which Europeans, Americans, and many from all corners of the world were eager to hear what Vance had to say about the future of US-European ties, NATO, and relations with Russia. This busy week will set the tone for the new Trump administration and its approach to the continent. As Trump develops that approach, he should look back at his first term as a blueprint. What many in Europe remember about that first term was repeated by Vance in his speech in Munich on Friday — criticism of European allies for their inadequate funding of defense and relying too much on the American military presence on the continent. However, the actual policy outcomes differed greatly from the rhetoric. Despite the attacks on Europeans for not spending enough, Trump’s first term in the White House delivered an increase of more than 40 percent in American spending on European defense compared with the Obama administration. By the time Trump left in 2021, there were more US forces in Europe and more training exercises across the continent than before he took office. Trump also took significant steps to strengthen Europe’s energy security and stability. He ramped up US exports of LNG, reducing European reliance on Russian gas. He also imposed sanctions Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which was undermining Europe’s energy security. Trump was the first to provide advanced anti-tank weapons to Ukraine after the Obama administration repeatedly failed to do so. He also oversaw the largest expulsion in history of Russian spies and diplomats from US territory, and closed down two Russian consulates in Seattle and San Francisco along with two trade mission annexes in Washington and New York. These were not the actions of someone indifferent to Europe or weak on Russia. If anything, they demonstrated a strong commitment to European security and US leadership in transatlantic affairs. It is this kind of strategic thinking that should inform the second Trump administration’s approach. One significant change since Trump’s first term is the growing bipartisan awareness of the challenges China poses to US national interests. As a result, many in the Trump administration believe that East Asia should be the focus for national security. However, as a global power in what Secretary of State Marco Rubio describes as a multipolar world, the US cannot afford to focus on one region at the expense of others. Regardless of discussions about reprioritizing Asia and drawing down US forces in Europe and the Middle East, geopolitical reality makes such a shift nearly impossible. Europe remains crucial to the well-being of the American economy. Together, North America and Europe account for about half of the world’s GDP. Two-thirds of all foreign investment into the US is from Europe. Additionally, Europe is collectively America’s largest export market, with 48 out of 50 US states exporting more to the continent than they do to China. Trump, with his background in business, understands better than anyone that when an American product is exported, that secures an American job. Right now, Russia is actively trying to undermine stability in Europe, which threatens the economic prosperity that has long benefited both the US and the American worker. Essentially, America’s military presence in Europe, along with NATO, is the primary security guarantor of America’s largest export market and source of foreign investment. The idea that America could simply walk away from Europe is not only naive but also geopolitically dangerous. If the world is reemerging as a multipolar system, as Rubio suggests, then many of these geopolitical poles are converging in eastern Ukraine, where Russia continues its aggression with the assistance of North Korean soldiers and Iranian drones. The security of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia is interconnected, whether policymakers like it or not. As Trump’s second administration unfolds, maintaining strong transatlantic relations will be essential to ensuring that the US remains an influential player on the world stage. While there will undoubtedly be discussions about shifting priorities, the geopolitical realities of the modern world make it clear that Europe must remain a key pillar of US foreign policy. The administration should take a strategic, long-term approach to strengthening NATO, supporting Ukraine, and maintaining US leadership in European security. Ultimately, the Trump administration’s approach to Europe should not be defined by campaign rhetoric but by practical policy measures that align with US strategic interests. As history has shown, a strong and engaged America in Europe is not just beneficial for the continent — it is also vital for US national security and economic prosperity. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

How Trophic Cascades Devastate Ecosystems And Endanger Human Heal...	Bats and vultures may not be widely loved, but their decline has profound negative implications for humans. All organisms in an ecosystem are interconnected, and any imbalance in this complex relationship can have irreversible consequences for both humans and nonhumans. Numerous examples illustrate how the destruction of one species can lead to unforeseen and devastating impacts on others. 'Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning do matter to human beings. ... And it's not always the charismatic and fuzzy species,' said Eyal Frank, an environmental scientist and economist at the University of Chicago, in a New York Times interview in July 2024. Frank is one of the authors of the study 'The Social Costs of Keystone Species Collapse: Evidence from the Decline of Vultures in India,' published in the American Economic Review in October 2024. Various studies have shown how this lack of natural harmony has affected biodiversity and human health. For instance, the loss of trees in the United States due to the invasive emerald ash borer increased human deaths related to cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, according to a 2013 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. The study, conducted in 15 U.S. states from 1990 to 2007, examined the effects of this imbalance on biodiversity and human health. Another example is the extinction of gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park in the 1920s, which led to an explosion in the elk population. The elks, in turn, devoured the vegetation, triggering a trophic cascade or ecosystem collapse. The loss of prey often forces predators to find new food sources, which can have unpredictable environmental consequences. By definition, trophic collapse must affect a minimum of three feeding levels. Trophic cascades frequently occur during periods of climate stress. 'Our results... suggest that increasing environmental stress... as a result of climate change may decouple species interactions,' noted Brian S. Cheng and Edwin D. Grosholz, environmental scientists at the University of California, Davis, in a 2016 article in Ecosphere. The public pays attention when a species considered 'adorable'—like polar bears, dolphins, or pandas—is threatened with extinction. However, the same risks faced by underappreciated species—such as bats and vultures—are often overlooked, underscoring the threat posed by trophic cascades to the world's ecosystems. The devastation affecting bat populations in the U.S. and vultures in India has largely escaped notice, as neither species inspires much affection. Instead, they often evoke fear and disgust. However, their decline has dire implications for humanity. Healthy Bat Populations Support Human Health 'Bats are a fantastic example of a species that we like to keep a distance from, but that are truly impactful in terms of the role they play in ecosystems,' Frank told the Washington Post in September 2024. He was referring to a study he authored and published in Science that same month. The study documented how biodiversity degradation negatively affects human health. He found that the declining bat population was linked to an 8 percent increase in infant mortality rate in certain U.S. counties. This link is due to the positive impacts of bat's diets. Every night, a single bat consumes up to 40 percent of its body weight in insects. In agricultural areas, this means that when bats disappear, farmers might use more insecticides on their fields,' explained Rudy Molinek, a fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in a September 2024 article in Smithsonian Magazine. According to the study, the decline in the bat population resulted in 1,334 infant deaths between 2006 and 2017. Essentially, the loss of bats, which led to a rise in insect populations, directly impacted human health. In areas with a marked decline in the bat population, U.S. farmers increased their use of insecticides by 31 percent. White-Nose Syndrome The principal culprit behind the bat die-off is white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by a fungus that attacks bats during hibernation. WNS disrupts the hibernation cycle in winter, leading to energy depletion and death. Researchers first identified the disease in 2006 when they observed dying bats in the Northeast U.S. with white fuzz on their noses, ears, and wings. It is believed that the fungus responsible for the syndrome, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, originated in Europe and was transported to the U.S., possibly through cavers traveling between continents. As of November 2024, white-nose syndrome has been confirmed in 40 states and nine Canadian provinces. The disease has wiped out more than 90 percent of three North American bat species. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, 6.7 million bats have died from WNS since 2006. According to State of the Bats: North America, a 2023 report by experts from Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., 52 percent of North American bat species are at 'risk of severe population decline' through at least 2038 due to various factors, including WNS, habitat loss, climate change, and collisions with wind turbines. 'They need our help to survive,' Winifred Frick, chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, one of the groups that participated in the State of the Bats report, told the Associated Press. 'We face a biodiversity crisis globally, and bats play a vital role in healthy ecosystems needed to protect our planet.' The syndrome's mortality rate averages around 70 to 90 percent. 'In some cases, the mortality rate has been 100 percent, wiping out entire colonies,' stated the Center for Biological Diversity. Researchers are still searching for an effective treatment for it. Polyethylene glycol 8000 has shown promise when applied as a spray to coat fungal spores and prevent their spread. Additionally, a vaccine experimentally used in Wisconsin has reduced infections in affected bat populations. 'Fungal disease killed bats, bats stopped eating enough insects, farmers applied more pesticides to maximize profit and keep food plentiful and cheap, the extra pesticide use led to more babies dying,' Eli Fenichel of Yale University told the New York Times in September. 'It is a sobering result.' Frank told the Guardian that during his research, he ruled out all other causes of infant mortality, including 'the opioid epidemic, parental unemployment, genetically modified crops, and even the weather,' Molinek of AAAS reported in Smithsonian Magazine. Frank further stated that the results provide 'compelling evidence... that farmers did respond to the decline in insect-eating bats, and that response had an adverse health impact on human infants.' Vanishing Vultures Cause Human Deaths to Rise in India Bats aren't the only species that benefit humans—a phenomenon some scientists call 'ecosystem services.' In another study co-authored by Frank, he found that '[a]fter vultures nearly went extinct in India, an extra 500,000 people died' on the subcontinent between 2000 and 2005. 'Vultures are considered nature's sanitation service because of their important role in removing dead animals that contain bacteria and pathogens from our environment—without them, the disease can spread,' Frank told the BBC. 'Understanding the role vultures play in human health underscores the importance of protecting wildlife, not just the cute and cuddly,' he added. 'They all have a job to do in our ecosystems that impacts our lives.' The first reports of the vulture die-off came from villagers in northern India. Hindus consider cows sacred and do not eat their meat; instead, they leave the carcasses for vultures to strip and consume. The people then harvest the bones to make bone meal and fertilizer. The villagers' warnings foreshadowed the catastrophe to come. The white-backed vultures, once abundant, are now on the brink of extinction. As they sicken, their long bald necks droop into the shape of nooses; death soon follows. 'By the mid-1990s, the 50 million-strong vulture population had plummeted to near zero because of diclofenac, a cheap non-steroidal painkiller for cattle that is fatal to vultures. Birds that fed on carcasses of livestock treated with the drug suffered from kidney failure and died,' stateda BBC article. According to a New York Times article published in July 2024, vulture populations in India have declined to less than 1 percent of their previous numbers. The disappearance of vultures has not only resulted in the loss of their critical environmental role but has also had severe consequences for human health and mortality. The 'half a million excess human deaths' occurred because rotting livestock carcasses polluted water supplies and contributed to a rise in feral dog populations, which spread waterborne diseases and rabies, according to the New York Times article. 'It was 'a really huge negative sanitation shock,'' said Anant Sudarshan, an economics professor at the University of Warwick in England, who co-authored the study with Frank. Sudarshan and Frank compared human death rates in Indian districts that once had thriving vulture populations to those with historically low vulture numbers, both before and after the vulture collapse. They examined rabies vaccine sales, feral dog populations, and pathogen levels in the water supplies. The researchers revealed that human death rates increased by more than 4 percent in districts where vultures had previously thrived. The effect was most significant in urban areas with large livestock populations, where carcass dumps were common. For years, the cause of the vulture deaths remained a mystery. However, in 2004, researchers identified the culprit: diclofenac, a widely used anti-inflammatory drug. A decade earlier, the steroid's patent had expired, leading to the production of cheaper generic versions that farmers began using extensively. This unintentionally triggered a mass extinction of vultures. In their study published by the American Economic Association, Frank and Sudarshan found a direct correlation between the rise in diclofenac sales and the subsequent collapse of vulture populations. The researchers used range maps to determine where vultures had lived and where they had not, allowing them to draw their conclusions. They discovered that '[i]n districts where vultures had lived, human death rates started ticking up in 1994, the year after the price dropped on diclofenac,' noted the New York Times. Human deaths continued rising over the following years in those districts, in stark contrast to areas where vultures were never present. Alarmed conservationists pushed for a ban on the drug's veterinary use. Although they succeeded in 2006, the 2023 State of India's Birds report revealed that at least three vulture species in India have suffered long-term losses of 91 to 98 percent. In ecological terms, they are now functionally extinct. The decline of both bats and vultures is already disrupting ecosystems and negatively impacting human health. To prevent further devastation, we must take urgent steps to preserve biodiversity and recognize the far-reaching consequences of our actions on other species.

Charles Barkley Calls Out San Francisco – OpEd	This year’s NBA All-Star Game will take place on February 16 at the Chase Center in San Francisco, but NBA hall-of-famer Charles Barkley won’t be attending. As the TNT commentator explained, 'I’m not going to that rat-infested place out in San Francisco,' a city where 'you can’t even walk around down there.' Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors countered, 'Yes, you can walk around.' Barkeley responded, 'Yeah, with a bulletproof vest.' One athlete who might agree with Barkeley is Ricky Pearsall, the San Francisco 49ers’ first-round draft choice. Last August 31, the wide receiver attended an autograph session in downtown San Francisco where a man demanded his watch. Pearsall refused to give it up and in the ensuing struggle, the assailant shot Pearsall in the chest. Incredibly enough, the bullet passed through his body, hitting no vital organs, and Pearsall was able to walk to the ambulance. The shooter was described as a 17-year-old high school student from Tracy, about 70 miles inland, but in a video, the attacker looks like a full-grown man. The shooter’s name and booking photo were not released. At this writing, no new information or court proceedings have been reported. As Charles Barkley and Ricky Pearsall’s family should know, Proposition 57, the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, eliminated the direct filing of juvenile cases in adult court. The state Supreme Court ruled it retroactive to all cases that were not yet final. Others who might agree with Charles Barkley include Kate Steinle’s family and friends. On July 1, 2015, the 32-year-old was walking with her father and a friend on San Francisco’s Pier 14 when Jose Inez Garcia Zarate, a previously deported Mexican national, discharged a firearm. The bullet struck Steinle, who died at the scene. In November of 2017, a San Francisco jury found Garcia Zarate not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle. The jury also acquitted the shooter on a manslaughter charge and found him guilty only of felony possession of a firearm. In 2020, federal judge Vince Chhabria ruled that Garcia Zarate suffered from a 'mental illness that is not presently being treated' and was therefore incompetent to stand trial on federal gun charges. In March 2022, Garcia Zarate pleaded guilty to 'being a felon in possession of a firearm and to being an alien unlawfully present in this country in possession of a firearm.' As Charles Barkley should know, dangerous felons are hardly San Francisco’s only problems. By 2019, San Francisco was something of an open-air latrine, with maps marking out favored defecation zones. In 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former mayor, cleaned up San Francisco for the visit of China’s Communist dictator Xi Jinping. The city quickly reverted to the sort of conditions Charles Barkley now decries, particularly the need for a bulletproof vest. Under Senate Bill 1391, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018, any person under age 16 could commit any number of murders and be prosecuted only in juvenile court and gain release at age 25. To adopt a phrase from Scott McKenzie’s 1967 hit, all those who come to San Francisco should know that public safety and hygiene are not top priorities for California’s ruling class.

And Still Growth Is All They Talk About – OpEd	Every year of the past 10 has been the hottest on record, with 2024 topping the heat chart. It’s not only air temperatures that are climbing; in 2024, the oceans of the world also reached a new daily high. 2024 was the first year on record where global average temperatures exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 'From January to September, the global mean surface air temperature was 1.54°C above the pre-industrial average.' The reason the planet continues to heat up is because not enough is being done to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Arising principally from burning fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas), it is GHG emissions that are clogging the lower atmosphere, resulting in global warming. Limiting global warming to 1.5˚C was the target agreed upon by 196 countries at the Paris Climate Accords in 2016. The Paris Agreement 'sets long-term goals to…. hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.' President Trump has taken the US out of the legally binding landmark agreement. This reckless and irresponsible step sets a dangerous example for other nations that wish to flaunt environmental commitments, and should be strongly condemned by governments throughout the world. If the current warming trajectory continues, by the early 2030’s 1.5˚C is likely to become the norm, with higher temperatures a real risk. Increases in average ground temperatures of 1.5 or 2 degrees centigrade doesn’t sound like much, but every additional fraction of a degree can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall. 'Every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,' explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. Once established a 1.5˚C world would be hard to reverse, and the risks are manifold: an increase in extreme weather events – more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall and storms; rising sea levels, which in turn increases the risk of costal flooding and erosion; coral reef loss – its estimated that 70-90% of coral reefs could disappear due to ocean warming and acidification; arctic ice loss, affecting ecosystems and global climate patterns; biodiversity loss – up to 14% of land species could face high risk of extinction. If warming of 1.5˚C is normalised and becomes 2˚C (or higher), the impacts would be much worse — doubling the extinction risks, intensifying extreme weather, and making some regions uninhabitable, leading to mass displacement of people. In addition to the environmental impacts, rising temperatures affect communities and economies. A heating planet means food and water shortages and increased risk of heat related illnesses and deaths. Businesses are impacted in affected areas and climate disasters cost trillions of dollars in infrastructure damage and reduced productivity. Its all interconnected Climate change is one aspect of the man-made environmental catastrophe, which is the biggest crisis humanity has ever been confronted with. It is unprecedented in seriousness and impact, short, medium, and long-term. The speed of change is surprising everyone, including climate scientists. 'Both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists— we didn’t think we’d be seeing a year above 1.5˚C this early,' says Dr Hausfather. In all developed and emerging countries, the environmental emergency should be the central issue around which all other matters— economy, development, geo-politics, etc.— are decided. How does this policy, this proposal, impact the planet? Does it have a negative or positive effect on the climate, on local ecosystems, on pollution, etc., or is it neutral? If the proposal increases greenhouse gas emissions, further weakens an endangered species or ecosystem, adds to air/water/soil pollution, or expands desertification. Then the proposal should immediately be dropped; this is what would happen in we were living in a world where responsible governance was standard practice. Sadly we are not. The current crop of political ‘leaders’ are weak, unprincipled, and on the whole, completely inadequate to the colossal challenge that the man-made environmental catastrophe presents. Compromised by their indebtedness to big business, personal ambition, blind adherence to ideology, and complete lack of vision, not only do they consistently fail to address the issues of the day, but their actions routinely intensify the problems. Far from environmental concerns sitting at the forefront of policy-making, irrespective of country or ideology, it is securing economic growth that exercises the minds of politicians, and the drive for profit that determines the actions of corporations. Growth that is strongly dependent on consumerism, and it is unconstrained consumerism within and by rich nations, that is in large part responsible for the environmental catastrophe. Along with competition and social injustice, consumerism is one of the cornerstones of market fundamentalism. Excess is celebrated, selfishness and greed promoted. Not only has this crude materialistic way of life vandalised the natural world, it has encouraged narrow unhealthy behaviour and a set of social norms that have created unhealthy societies populated by frightened, confused people. The health of the planet and the well-being of humanity, as well as the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms are all interconnected. It is one integrated eco-system, one life; infection in one area affects all other parts. There is no such thing as separation, on all levels life is one. Try telling that to the Clown In Chief ensconced in the White House. Whilst governments and (most) corporations/businesses are not interested in putting the environment at the centre of everything, we as individuals can. This means protesting environmental abuse and taking personal responsibility for the way we live. Every decision – shopping, travel, heating, etc., should take into account the environmental impact; if everyone decided to only patronise environmentally responsible businesses, companies large and small would quickly change their strategies. The same applies to politicians, local and national, who are trying to persuade the electorate to vote for them. Given the scale of the crisis such steps may appear tiny, but when adopted by enough people they can have an impact, and doing something rather than nothing alleviates to some degree the feeling of despair. Hope, which is so badly needed at this time, is not based on wishful thinking, but comes about through sustained action.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fPyCPTXDW2KOw	2025-02-14T17:55:36-08:00	
No Agreement On Rare Earths After First Rounds Of US-Ukraine Talk...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused to sign an agreement to grant the United States 50 percent of all future reserves of rare earth metals in Ukraine, according to news reports following a meeting between Zelenskyy and U.S. leaders at the Munich Security Conference on February 14. Zelenskyy 'politely refused' when members of the U.S. Congress proposed the agreement, the Washington Post reported. Zelenskyy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance also discussed a critical minerals deal at the conference, but their meeting ended without an announcement. 'Our teams will continue to work on the document,' Zelenskyy said on X. 'We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace. We deeply value President [Donald] Trump’s determination, which can help stop the war and secure justice and security guarantees for Ukraine.' Trump said last week that he wants Ukraine to supply the United States with rare earth minerals as a form of payment for U.S. financial support. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earths and other things,' Trump said on February 3 at the White House, discussing how his administration intends to fulfill his campaign promise to quickly end the war in Ukraine. Dozens of rare earth minerals are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense, and Ukraine has large deposits of many of them. Zelenskyy said in February 4 that Ukraine would be 'open to the fact, that all of this can be developed together, along with our partners who can help us protect our lands.' At their Munich meeting, Ukraine gave the U.S. delegation a revised agreement on rare earth metals amid concerns in Kyiv over a U.S. version that was presented to Ukraine on February 12. The revised draft of the deal could open up its vast resources of key minerals to U.S. investment, according to Ukraine. Two members of the Ukrainian delegation told Reuters that 'some details' still needed to be worked out. It was not immediately clear what the sticking points are. The U.S. draft version was presented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who traveled to Kyiv earlier this week with a view to reaching an agreement in Munich. Bessent told Fox Business Network that the Trump administration's plan to end the war would 'intertwine' the Ukrainian economy with the United States and make sure that 'U.S. taxpayers receive the return for the money they put in.' Meeting for 90 minutes with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators behind closed doors in Munich, Zelenskyy voiced concern about the U.S. proposal presented by Bessent, according to Reuters, quoting three sources familiar with his presentation. He 'felt he was being asked unreasonably to sign something he hadn't had a chance to read', one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. 'I don't think he appreciated being given a take-it-or-leave-it thing.' Zelenskyy discussed his own proposal for a mineral deal with the United States, the source said, saying it was drafted to comply with the Ukrainian constitution. Two other sources characterized the proposal delivered by Bessent as 'one-sided,' but declined to elaborate. Zelenskyy’s office said in a statement after the talks that Ukraine and the United States 'agreed to continue their work on drafting the document on economic partnership between the two countries.' The statement also repeated Ukraine's demand for 'real security guarantees.' Zelenskyy said on X that also met with a delegation of members of the U.S. House of Representatives led by Representative Michael Turner (Republican-Ohio) and informed the members about the situation on the battlefield, the results of the Kursk operation, and the threats posed by North Korea's involvement in combat operations. He stressed the need for 'reliable security guarantees,' adding, 'It is important to achieve a guaranteed and lasting peace as soon as possible through our joint strength.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP2LfZrvquG-s	2025-02-14T17:53:37-08:00	
How Israel Can Boost Saudi Vision 2030 – OpEd	A symbiotic relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is within reach. It could be of huge mutual benefit. Often overlooked in discussions about a possible Abraham Accords deal with Saudi Arabia is the fact that the kingdom is more than halfway through a vastly ambitious and extremely costly redevelopment program called Saudi Vision 2030, initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in 2016. The benefits that a normalization deal with Israel could bring to the program could be vital in helping MBS meet the goals he has set himself. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is less than a hundred years old. It was only in 1932 that Abdul Aziz ibn Saud emerged from many years of political and military struggle against the Ottoman empire and other local chieftains, and was able to name the area he had conquered 'Saudi Arabia', and proclaim himself its monarch. It was doubtless with an eye to the eventual centenary celebrations of the monarchy and the kingdom that in April 2016 MBS launched Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious plan to revitalize the nation state. If it succeeds, by 2032 Saudi Arabia will have been transformed from virtual total dependence on oil revenues into a modern, liberalized, thriving society, its prosperity underpinned by flourishing industrial, financial, economic and commercial sectors. When first announced, Saudi Vision 2030 envisaged, among hundreds of initiatives, privatizing entire sectors of the economy, cutting subsidies, courting investors at home and abroad, streamlining government services, and going public with the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer and most profitable company. This last step was achieved in 2019, when Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) raised $29.4 billion, the largest in history, Yet it was only 1.5% of the company that was sold to the public; the Saudi state and its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, still own 98.5% of Aramco. The most recent progress report, published in April 2024, marked the eighth anniversary of Vision 2030’s launch. A major aim of the program is to achieve economic diversification, and by 2024 non-oil GDP was already contributing 50% to the economy, a record high. To reduce the kingdom’s dependence on oil, Saudi Arabia is also investing heavily in renewable energy projects. The kingdom has become the fastest-growing renewables market outside China. The program also includes nearly 50 large-scale construction and development projects aimed at transforming the nation's infrastructure. A cornerstone of Vision 2030 is Neom, a $500 billion futuristic city sited in the northwest of Saudi Arabia. Envisioned as a hub for innovation and sustainability, it aims to incorporate smart city technologies and renewable energy sources. Recent reports indicate that Neom is facing significant financial challenges, with rising costs and delays leading to concerns about the project's feasibility. This is one obvious area where Israeli hi-tech know-how could help the development. The Red Sea Project is an initiative focused on developing a luxury tourist destination along Saudi Arabia's west coast. With environmental conservation built into the concept, it features resorts across an archipelago of pristine islands and inland sites. When all phases are completed it will comprise 50 resorts offering 8,000 hotel rooms in addition to more than 1,000 residential properties. Saudi Arabia hosts millions of Muslims each year on their Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, but Israeli expertise in global, as opposed to Islamic, tourism could be of invaluable assistance in realizing the project. Positioned near Riyadh, Qiddiya is envisioned as a vast entertainment city, encompassing theme parks, sports facilities, and cultural venues. It aims to become a major tourist destination, contributing to the diversification of the economy. Construction of a variety of parks, performing arts centers. sports stadiums and other projects is forging ahead, with several attractions planned to open well before 2030. Recently announced, the Mukaab is set to be the largest building in the world, featuring a unique cube-shaped design. It is part of the New Murabba development in Riyadh and aims to offer a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment spaces. Construction has commenced, with the first phase expected to be completed by 2030. Mohammed bin Salman Non-Profit City 'MiSK City', it is claimed, will be the first non-profit city of its kind in the world. It aims to be a city focused on youth, to empower young people, develop their skills, and support young entrepreneurs. A Saudi normalization deal with Israel could have profound implications for Saudi Vision 2030, positively affecting economic growth, regional stability, and technological advancements. For example, Israel is a global leader in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, while Saudi Arabia aims to be an active AI player by 2030. Collaboration in these fields could accelerate Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation. Given Saudi Arabia's desert environment, Israeli expertise in desalination, water conservation, and desert agriculture could enhance food and water security, aligning with Vision 2030's desalination projects and sustainability goals. Saudi Arabia, its urban centers sited between Israel and the Gulf, could become a logistics hub, linking Israel to Gulf markets, particularly through Neom, the planned high-tech city near the Red Sea. A formal Saudi-Israel relationship could open the door to increased Western and Israeli investments in Saudi Arabia, particularly in sectors like technology, cybersecurity, and renewable energy, helping the kingdom achieve even greater economic diversification. Just as in the case of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a normalization deal could bring Israeli tourists flooding into the country, and Israel becoming a key tourist market, helping the program’s aim of increasing tourism’s contribution to GDP to 10% by 2030. A Saudi-Israel deal would likely be accompanied by US security guarantees and incentives, such as advanced defense systems, security guarantees, and potential support for Saudi Arabia’s civil nuclear program, boosting Vision 2030’s energy sector and reinforcing Saudi’s position as a regional power. Saudi Arabia has historically tied normalization to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Any viable deal would need to take this position into account. President Donald Trump's recent suggestions regarding Gaza's future have not, as yet, touched on future Palestinian autonomy, but thinking on this matter is fairly advanced by the Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution, a body co-chaired by Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide. The alliance, launched in September 2024, has convened multiple times to advance the idea of a development program, phased over several years, leading toward Palestinian sovereignty. The mere existence and continued activity of the alliance may be sufficient to allow the process leading to an Abraham Accord deal to proceed. Saudi-Israeli normalization could undoubtedly help Vision 2030 reach its objectives by attracting investment, fostering technological growth, and expanding tourism. The pace at which these benefits might accrue would inevitably depend on a variety of factors, but the potential for a Saudi-Israeli partnership of enormous mutual advantage could certainly follow the formal induction of Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP5kqqfhnNjbd	2025-02-14T17:47:09-08:00	
Argentina Court Calls For Arrest Warrant For Myanmar Junta Chief	A court in Argentina has ruled that international arrest warrants be issued for Myanmar’s self-appointed president and junta chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, and 22 other military officials for crimes committed against the Rohingya Muslim minority, the plaintiff and attorney in the case told Radio Free Asia on Friday. The Burmese Rohingya Organization UK, or BROUK, filed a petition in Argentina in 2019 on behalf of Rohingya victims of a 2017 military crackdown that the group says amounted to genocide. Argentina became the first country to open an investigation into serious crimes against the Rohingya under the principle of universal jurisdiction, a legal principle allowing for the prosecution of serious crimes no matter where they were committed. In a statement, BROUK said a court in Buenos Aires had ruled that arrest warrants be issued for Min Aung Hlaing and the other Burmese military officials. The court said that the officials’ identity should first be confirmed and they be called to testify. 'This is a historic step towards justice for Rohingya and everyone in Burma suffering under the Burmese military,' said Tun Khin, president of the BROUK, referring to Myanmar. Myanmar government troops led a bloody crackdown in Rakhine state in 2017 in response to Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces and some 740,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya community fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where most remain. U.N. experts later said the military carried out mass killings and gang rapes with 'genocidal intent.' The United States in 2022 determined that the violence committed against the Rohingya amounted to genocide and crimes against humanity. The Myanmar military has always insisted it was engaged in legitimate security operations. A spokesperson was not immediately available for comment on the arrest warrants. Hope for action Military leaders rarely travel abroad and then only to close allies like China, but Tun Khin said he was hopeful there would be action. 'As the warrant will be sent to all countries, Interpol will probably implement it. We wholeheartedly believe this,' Tun Khin. 'This arrest warrant isn’t only to get justice for us Rohingya. I want to say it’s to get justice for all our citizens. Speaking to RFA, Tomas Quintana, the attorney representing BROUK’s complaint, said that once the court in Buenos Aires confirmed the identities of the suspects, it would send a communication to the global police organization Interpol, requesting that it issue red notices, which are alerts seeking the arrests of wanted persons with a view to extradition. 'And then, it will be for Interpol to enforce these arrest warrants,' said Quintana, who served as United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar between 2008 and 2014. In the meantime, he said, the Rohingya community has welcomed the first decision by a court of law to issue warrants for the perpetrators of the crackdown. 'And even though we will have some challenges to enforce the arrest warrants, it’s a very important thing now to those who have been committing crimes not only in Burma, but also around the world,' Quintana said. 'If you commit a crime against humanity, if you commit genocide, then you will have to be held to account, whether in your country or in any country in the world, because we are talking about a crime that affects the conscience of all humanity,' he added. Warrant requested for Suu Kyi Among the 22 other top military officials named in the warrants, is the deputy commander-in-chief, Soe Win. Others include officers operating in Rakhine state at the time. It is not the only legal effort aimed at bringing to justice those responsible for crimes against the Rohingya. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan requested an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing in November. However, it has yet to rule on whether to grant it. A Rohingya community leader welcomed the ruling in Argentina. 'We’re glad. Our people were being killed illegally and the people who were committing genocide will never be free,' said Khin Maung, spokesperson for the Rohingya Youth Organization in Bangladesh. In total, the Argentinian court called for issuing warrants for 25 people, not all of whom are military officials, such as the leader of the former civilian government, Aung San Suu Kyi, and former President Htin Kyaw. In its initial 2019 petition, the BROUK included Suu Kyi and Htin Kyaw. But after they and their government were ousted in 2021 the BROUK requested that the court consider if warrants for their arrests 'serves the best interests of justice at this time.' Tun Khin said the military leaders were the main target of his group’s petition.' Within the arrest warrant in BROUK’s application, the established military personnel were the ones requested in the warrant,' he said. Suu Kyi, trying to ensure the survival of her fragile government in the face of a looming threat from the military, went to the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 2019 to rejected accusations of genocide committed against the Rohingya as 'incomplete and misleading.' For years Suu Kyi had been feted in the West as a heroine of democracy but her statement at the U.N.‘s highest court, in which she described the military action in Rakhine state in 2017 as a 'clearance operation,' did serious damage to her reputation. It also failed to protect her elected government from a military coup just over a year later.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fPzz6UQInD2wU	2025-02-14T17:41:52-08:00	
Arab World-Arab American Collaboration Could Be A Game-Changer – ...	The driving force behind nearly every major conflict in the Arab and Muslim worlds, from Syria to Iraq and Afghanistan to Sudan, has been or is US foreign policy, in conjunction with individual American allies. Washington leverages its influence over the Arab and Muslim worlds through billions of dollars in annual foreign aid, through trade including oil and through the manipulation of pro-American media outlets that have influence throughout the Middle East. Foreign aid has long been provided to several Arab countries, including $1.3 billion per year to Egypt, $1.5 billion to Jordan, between $200 million and $1 billion to Iraq and more than $1 billion to help the Syrian people, to name just a few. Mainstream American news media outlets — several of which receive direct US government assistance through massive subscription purchases and hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising — help advance America’s interest through propaganda that impacts how the rest of the world sees the country’s policies. Only one Middle East nation has orchestrated a sophisticated, multilevel strategy to manage all that influence, define media reporting to reflect its narrative and secure America’s unwavering support. That is Israel, which has a record of killing and injuring more Arabs and Muslims than any other country. So, why do the Arab and Muslim worlds not do what Israel has done through its lobbying apparatus to strengthen American support for its interests? Why have they not turned to Arab Americans to help make US politicians more sympathetic to their concerns, policies and needs? Arab and Muslim Americans played an important role in Donald Trump’s election victory last year, as acknowledged by the president himself. In the left-leaning and very pro-Israel mainstream American news media, however, Arab and Muslim voters are often blamed for electing Trump, whose recent policy announcements have riled the political establishment. Media critics generally ignore the fact that, while Trump may make frequent shoot-from-the-hip policy announcements that anger or perplex them, his predecessor funded, armed and protected at the UN the 15-month Israeli genocide that took the lives of almost 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza. On the face of it, American foreign policy and its double standards when it comes to applying principles and justice fairly are perplexing. But it is only thus because the Arab world and Arab Americans are estranged and do not work together. Israel’s immorally excessive response to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack and American’s blind embrace of the false propaganda narrative Israel uses to justify its violent actions, which the International Criminal Court alleges can be described as 'war crimes,' has created an opportunity for the relationship to be reset. Now is the time for Arabs in America and the Middle East to come together, set aside their differences, speak with one voice and change the destructive pattern that has engulfed so many Arab countries. A partnership like that can refocus responsibility for the region’s troubles on the one country that claims to want to be 'accepted' in the Middle East, but which seeks to redefine and control it: Israel. Israel is most vulnerable to a powerful countercampaign to influence the American understanding of Middle Eastern events. In 1973, Saudi Arabia demonstrated how powerful the Arab world was when it led the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in imposing an oil embargo on the US in response to its one-sided bias toward Israeli violence. Israel claimed to be the victim but in fact it was the provocateur, initiating violence that it then redefined through US-driven media propaganda. That moment created a major shift between the West and the Arab world. America went through a crisis. Since then, Arab world oil prices have been managed in a one-sided relationship with America, resulting in the lowest possible gasoline prices for Americans, who only pay a little more than $3 per gallon on average — less than half the cost in many other countries. Israel has an equivalent to the oil power of the Arab world, but it is far less expensive. In the last national election cycle, pro-Israeli political action committees donated almost $5 million into the campaign coffers of candidates for some of the most influential American political offices, from state governors to members of Congress. These donations helped pro-Israel candidates win office, thereby giving Tel Aviv enormous influence. Instead of fueling the anger of Americans by imposing higher oil prices, Israel’s campaign addresses a political need in a positive way, building political devotion to its needs. The Arab world can easily do the same thing through the right Arab American activists. A few million dollars could shift the vote in Congress away from Israel’s narrow interests to embrace the interests of the Arab world. And a few million more to fund a pro-Arab public relations campaign via the media could significantly alter American public attitudes. We are talking about a campaign through Arab American activists costing maybe $10 million to $20 million to alter America’s intrinsically anti-Arab, anti-Muslim policies. It will not happen overnight. But the dynamics of today’s world and the increasing violence in the Middle East create an opportunity that must be grasped in order to stop the destructive spread of Western-backed violence throughout the Middle East and to undermine the growing anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia sweeping through the US. It would cost so little, why would we not try?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP_9eaE-o_WFl	2025-02-14T17:33:01-08:00	
Pope Francis Hospitalized At Gemelli For Bronchitis	By Hannah Brockhaus Pope Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on Friday to undergo testing and treatment for bronchitis, the Vatican said. 'The Holy Father, as a result of the recent exacerbation of bronchitis, has carried out specialized examinations and started a hospital drug therapy,' read a Holy See Press Office statement updating the pope’s condition Friday evening Rome time. 'The first examinations performed show a respiratory tract infection. The clinical condition is fair; he presents mild febrile alteration.' The pope is serene, his mood is good, and he has read a few newspapers, according to Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized in the late morning on Feb. 14 following meetings with a number of people, including the prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico. 'This morning, at the end of his audiences, Pope Francis will be admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Hospital for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue treatment for bronchitis, that is still ongoing, in a hospital setting,' the Holy See Press Office said in a message sent shortly before 11 a.m. Rome time. The Vatican said that due to Pope Francis’ hospitalization, his appointments for the following three days were canceled. In particular, he will no longer hold a jubilee audience at the Vatican on Saturday, Feb. 15, or a meeting with artists at the historic Cinecittà film studios south of Rome on Feb. 17. The pope was also scheduled to participate in a Mass in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday for the Jubilee of Artists and the World of Culture, part of the Church’s wider 2025 Jubilee of Hope. The Vatican said Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, will celebrate the Mass. Pope Francis has been sick with bronchitis for over a week. On Feb. 6, the Vatican announced the pope would hold most of his meetings that day and the following days in rooms at his Vatican residence in order to rest more. Despite the illness, which has largely prevented the pontiff from reading his own speeches and homilies, Francis presided at a jubilee Mass for members of the police and armed forces in St. Peter’s Square on Feb. 9 and participated in his weekly general audience on Wednesday. Pope Francis was also hospitalized for a respiratory infection in March 2023 and canceled a November 2023 trip to Dubai due to a 'very acute infectious bronchitis.' The pope, who has been suffering from visible breathlessness during recent meetings, has more and more frequently declined to read his prepared remarks to audiences or opted to have the remarks read by a priest aide. He has faced several health challenges in recent years, including knee problems requiring a wheelchair, respiratory infections, and a fall resulting in a forearm contusion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdH5ewPRu7fP0c9vuLKzxCG	2025-02-14T17:31:52-08:00	
Vance Warns European Allies Of Threat From Within’	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the security conference in Munich, Germany, against 'the threat from within,' arguing that European governments are exercising extreme censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on 'out-of-control migration.' 'The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' he said Friday. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of presidential election results over evidence of Russian disinformation. 'If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,' he said. 'I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.' He also appeared to voice support for right-wing anti-immigration parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe, including the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls,' he said, referring to Berlin’s 'firewall' effort against extremism in a country still haunted by the role of the Nazi party in the past. Vance met with AfD leader Alice Weidel on Friday, according to an official in the vice president’s office. Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S. 'there is nothing more pressing than migration.' He blamed the 'series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world,' and he highlighted the Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd, injuring at least 30 people. The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The vice president only made a passing remark on the issue. The Trump administration is 'very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine,' Vance said. 'And we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.' Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies. 'If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions ... that is not acceptable.' Vance’s remarks are 'an effort to flip the script,' on Europe’s concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North. 'There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine. Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy days before the German election,' she told VOA. In his meeting with Vance on the sidelines of the conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more discussion is needed 'to prepare the plan [on] how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and finish the war.' 'Really, we want peace very much, but we need real security guarantees,' he said. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the conference. Ukraine said its delegation will present its position on ending the war. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine. Peace talks with Russia Speaking to reporters from the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump said Vance’s speech was 'very brilliant,' and warned Europe 'to be careful.' On Wednesday he spoke with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and the Russian president have 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' to end the war. Trump told White House reporters Thursday that Kyiv’s NATO membership bid is 'impractical' and its desire to win back Russian-occupied territories 'illusionary.' His comments mirror remarks made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed. Hegseth also called Ukraine's desire to regain territory that it lost to Russia an 'unrealistic objective.' Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. 'I'd love to have them back,' Trump said, adding that he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations' and added that they would 'probably' meet in Saudi Arabia soon. Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow. 'I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,' senior Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday. European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a potential settlement of the conflict. 'A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the United States,' warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich. It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even 'military tools' if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine's long-term independence. Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that Palestinians should leave Gaza and that the U.S. will take over the enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence.

Robert Reich: Profiles In Courage – OpEd	Sometimes it takes a crisis to reveal one’s true character. This is especially true of people who occupy positions of leadership, both in the private and public sectors. Are they courageous, or are they cowards? Worse yet, are they complicit in doing grave harm? During the current crisis of American democracy, we know who’s in the complicit category: House Speaker Mike Johnson and almost all other Republican lawmakers. Several CEOs: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Rupert Murdoch. And many Fox News personalities. History (to the extent future historians have access to the truth) will judge them harshly as traitors to America. As to the cowards, I’d include Jamie Dimon, chair and CEO of JPMorganChase, the largest bank in the United States, who likes to think of himself as a spokesperson for American business. Dimon and others like him are playing along with Trump and Musk. What about the courageous? A few Democratic lawmakers are finally showing some spine. But today I’d like to honor unsung heroes whose courage in the face of the Trump-Musk takeover of America deserves our profound thanks. They are public servants who have chosen to fight rather than submit to Trump’s treachery, contesting his blatantly illegal attempts to fire them. They include: 1. Phyllis Fong, the former inspector general of the Department of Agriculture. When she got notice that the Trump regime was terminating her employment, Fong informed her colleagues that she intended to remain in her position because Trump had not followed proper legal procedures in terminating her. When security guards told Fong — a 22-year veteran of the department — she had to leave, she did not go quietly. She had to be dragged out of her office. The inspector general of the Department of Agriculture has a broad mandate to protect the public — pursuing consumer food safety, consumer health (such as tracking the bird flu that’s been spreading among cattle and chickens and killed at least one person so far), and auditing and investigating government payments to a large number of contractors. In 2022, Fong’s office launched an investigation of Elon Musk’s brain implant startup,Neuralink. With Fong out of the picture, that investigation now appears on its way to being closed. For her long-standing dedication to the people of the United States and her steadfastness in seeking to remain in her important job, Fong deserves to be known as a profile in courage. 2. Brian Driscoll, acting FBI director. Driscoll has refused a Justice Department order that he assist in firing FBI employees involved in investigating the people responsible for violence in the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. When Driscoll notified his staff about the Justice Department’s order, he wrote, 'I am one of those employees.' Driscoll took part in the arrest of Samuel Fisher, an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, in Manhattan two weeks after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. FBI agents found in Fisher’s Upper East Side apartment and car over a thousand rounds of ammunition and several weapons, including an illegally modified AR-15 rifle and machetes. In 2022, Fisher was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a gun possession charge in Manhattan Supreme Court. He also pleaded guilty in federal court to illegally entering the Capitol on January 6. Trump pardoned Fisher on January 20. In a defiant email sent last Friday night, James Dennehy, the top FBI agent in the New York field office, warned his staff that the FBI was 'in the middle of a battle of our own.' Praising Driscoll and Driscoll’s deputy, Robert C. Kissane, as 'warriors,' Dennehy said they were 'fighting for this organization.' FBI agents have anonymously sued to block dissemination of the names of agents who worked on the January 6 cases. For his refusal to furnish the names of FBI agents who helped investigate the January 6 assailants, Driscoll deserves to be seen as a profile in courage. 3. Ellen L. Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission. Trump tried to fire Weintraub last Thursday, but she is fighting the dismissal. Weintraub wrote in an X post, to which she attached Trump’s dismissal letter: 'Received a letter from POTUS today purporting to remove me as Commissioner & Chair of FEC. I’ve been lucky to serve the American people & stir up some good trouble along the way. That’s not changing anytime soon. There’s a legal way to replace FEC commissioners — this isn’t it.' According to federal law, FEC commissioners are appointed to six-year terms. Because the FEC is an independent agency with a highly sensitive mission, its commissioners can be removed only for cause. Trump’s communication did not invoke any cause for the removal. Commissioners can remain at the FEC past their term’s expiration date until a replacement is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Trump’s attempt to fire Weintraub comes just as the FEC was considering complaints involving the 2024 Trump campaign and Elon Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC. In comments to The New York Times, Weintraub said she wasn’t surprised to be targeted by Trump. She had publicly complained that the FEC’s structure of six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from the same political party, ensures 3-3 gridlock on enforcement matters, including ones involving the president’s campaigns. For her courageous stand, Weintraub deserves to be seen as a profile in courage. 4. Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel. Dellinger runs the office that enforces federal whistleblower laws and the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in most political activity. In the 1978 law that established Dellinger’s job, Congress provided that the special counsel can be removed only for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' Trump fired Dellinger on Friday. On Monday, Dellinger sued, calling his removal illegal, arguing that nothing about his performance could possibly meet the standard Congress laid out for dismissing a special counsel. 'Since my arrival at OSC last year, I could not be more proud of all we have accomplished,' Dellinger said. 'The agency’s work has earned praise from advocates for whistleblowers, veterans, and others. The effort to remove me has no factual nor legal basis — none — which means it is illegal.' Dellinger continues to police the government against Hatch Act violations, even when they involve federal workers who allegedly discriminated against Trump. In a complaint filed Tuesday, Dellinger alleged that, during a hurricane response in October, an aid supervisor for the Federal Emergency Management Agency illegally instructed FEMA workers not to visit homes with Trump signs. On Monday night, Judge Amy Berman Jackson blocked Dellinger’s dismissal at least through today, as she hears arguments in the case. For choosing to fight, Dellinger is a profile in courage. 5. Gwynne Wilcox, chair of the National Labor Relations Board. After being dismissed by Trump last week, Wilcox sued, arguing that the statute governing her position allows removal 'for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.' By firing her, Trump also made the NLRB inoperative, because it no longer has the number of commissioners needed to make rulings. Not incidentally, when Trump fired Wilcox, 24 separate cases were pending against Musk before the NLRB. For choosing to sue Trump, Wilcox is a profile in courage. 6. Federal workers who are peacefully resisting. I also want to salute other federal workers who are resisting Trump’s arbitrary and illegal orders terminating their employment. The staff of the General Services Administration have flooded online communications channels like Slack with spoon emojis in response to Musk’s 'Fork in the Road' buyout offer. Scores of other federal workers have marked the buyout memo and other emails from Trump and Musk as 'spam.' Thousands of federal workers in agencies that collect or analyze sensitive data have launched encrypted chats to discuss how they can best shield the data from Trump and Musk. Also meriting our profound thanks are federal workers who are showing up to and leading the protests at USAID, the Department of Labor, and other agencies targeted by the Trump-Vance-Musk regime. The 'fednews' subreddit, an online forum popular with government workers, has seen multiple highly upvoted posts urging fellow workers to 'hold the line' and 'support the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic' by NOT resigning. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, now has the highest number of dues-paying members in its 92-year history. Four thousand federal workers joined the union in the first five days of February. *** The public servants who are defying and contesting the Trump-Vance-Musk coup are putting themselves, their jobs, their careers, and in some cases the well-being of their families on the line. They are doing so because they believe in the importance of their jobs in protecting and helping the American public, and they justifiably believe Trump and Musk are violating the law. In sharp contrast to those who are complicit in the Trump-Vance-Musk coup and those who are too cowardly to speak up against it, these men and women are today’s true patriots.

Washington Must Control The Panama Canal To Guarantee Regional Se...	With President Donald J. Trump at the White House, the golden age of America has begun. Global Security Governance will be extremely enhanced under the America First Strategy of President Trump. In the Americas the revival of the Monroe Doctrine under the magnificent leadership of President Trump, will generate a cautious reliance of Latin American nations towards other economies across the Pacific. As the world is moving from the Industrial to the Intelligence age, the United Nations continues to be an obsolete and highly corrupt organization; it suffers from the very endemic syndrome of corruption demonstrated by the USAID and its incompetent bureaucrats operating within its rotten administrative capillaries. The dismantling of USAID offices at home and abroad by the Trump – Vance administration is historic, will save billions of U.S. Dollars to American taxpayers, and uphold the U.S. National Security Interests in the International Stage. President Trump has emerged as the best U.S. Head of State since the early days of President Abraham Lincoln. Guided by the legendary conservative principles, shaped under the leadership of President Ronald Wilson Reagan; the current White House will also, and legitimately so, take control of the Panama Canal that was built under the leadership of President Theodore Roosevelt who oversaw the realization of a long-term objective of the United States —a trans-isthmian canal. For American and British entrepreneurs and governments it was imperative to ship goods efficiently and quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts during the 19th Century. Panama Canal continues to be the principal engineering marvel in the Americas and Washington has the legitimate right to exert full operational control and ensure its safety by employing all tools of statecraft and military technology as well as tactics. It is disturbing to listen how a renowned Latin American businessman Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego (founder and President of Mexico’s Grupo Salinas) is giving a talk at the World Government Summit 2025 in Dubai calling 'North Americans stupid'. The United States is blessed to be governed by the Trump – Vance Administration which is highly committed to restore America’s privileged position in the world stage, so that foreign entrepreneurs including Salinas would not dare to scoff at Americans again. In this context the Panama Canal has been the principal resource of wealth and income for all Panamanians and remains a vital logistical corridor for global shipping more than a century after its construction. It is the lifeblood of the Panamanian economy, generating US$5 billion in the last fiscal year. However, previous administrators of the Canal, Ricardo Martinelli (Former Panamanian President) and former President Juan Carlos Varela, are both under investigation for corruption and money laundering, at home and abroad. It is evident that both former top officials of the Central American nation have massively abused with the Canal’s impressive revenues and financial resources. The posture of the White House with regards to the Panama Canal will bring high levels of accountability, regional security measures that were never seen before as well as reduce fraud and waste within the canal’s operations. The United States established diplomatic relations with Panama in 1903 following its declaration of independence from Colombia. Panama’s location and role in international trade make it an indispensable actor that ensures the U.S. prosperity and national security. Panama’s location in central America has made the nation to become a major land and sea transit route where illegal drugs destined for the United States can be stopped and destroyed. While Panama’s economic growth rate is among the highest in the hemisphere, the country faces the challenge of making this growth more inclusive; and the willingness of Washington to take full control of the Canal, will generate more resources and further increase the microeconomic levels within the Panamanian society. On February 2nd, 2025, the U. S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino and Minister of Foreign Affairs Javier Martínez-Acha in Panama City at the Palacio de Las Garzas. U. S. foreign policy chief addressed critical regional and global challenges. In his latest visit to Panama City, Secretary Marco Rubio stated in a press conference: 'Panama is a country that is a friend, a brother, that we have many ties with and a great deal of cooperation. What’s happened in this hemisphere with mass migration is quite unfortunate. It’s a tragedy, and we have people who – as part of this process – in many cases people are victims or have been victimized through this irregular path that has created issues for many countries in the region. We also understand from the United States that most people who come in here have as a goal eventually making it to the United States, so you could say that at a certain point our border doesn’t begin at Texas or Mexico; it begins a lot farther down.' Secretary Rubio underscored the desire for an improved U. S. – Panama investment climate and brought to the attention of President Mulino that the current 'position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal area is a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.' Secretary Rubio made it clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the Treaty. Furthermore, the U.S. – Panama cooperation program that helps to stop people with criminal histories, from going forward and creating problems in Panama, has been working well. In the same vein, Panama and its government must take decisive actions, and be fully transparent, towards ensuring the fulfillment of the two bilateral treaties that it signed with the United States. As the Carter administration shaped the public opinion in favor of turning in the Canal to Panama’s leadership; Washington would soon find out that this mega project would favor illicit enrichment for only a few local politicians as the rest of the population continues to live in misery. A very similar approach to USAID projects in Latin America and Africa, where corrupt government officials extract all foreign donations and drain the public coffers. These negotiations in the 1970s were endorsed by Actor John Wayne and Torrijos hosted U.S. Senators in Panama, where he stressed that he was neither an enemy of the United States nor a communist. The negotiators in Washington decided that their best chance for ratification was to submit two treaties to the U.S. Senate. The first, called The Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, or the Neutrality Treaty, stated that the United States could use its military to defend the Panama Canal against any threat to its neutrality, thus allowing perpetual U.S. usage of the Canal. The second, called The Panama Canal Treaty, stated that the Panama Canal Zone would cease to exist on October 1, 1979, and the Canal itself would be turned over to the Panamanians on December 31, 1999. These two treaties were signed on September 7, 1977. Just as the fruitful cooperation on successfully tackling illegal immigration, Panama is obliged to respect the Treaty and invite Washington to take control of the Canal; a move that would greatly benefit its people and ensure a greater economic growth and stability for all Panamanians and the Central American region overall. Panama’s Canal administration deserves a greater scrutiny by Washington, being a major global trade hub that has not fared well within the latest geostrategic hurdles. Nevertheless, the Trump – Vance Administration has the unbridled courage, brilliant statecraft, competency, intrepidity and steady determination to bring the administration of the Canal back on track and ensure all massive revenues that it generates do not leave the hemisphere. The Panama Canal is an enduring investment – built completely with the money and labor force of the United States of America – for the bright future of U.S. National Security, Washington’s geopolitical interests and is the fulcrum of Central America’s economic prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm17w0etrt4Eps	2025-02-14T15:56:08-08:00	
Trees Might Need Our Help To Survive Climate Change	A new Colorado State University study of the interior U.S. West has found that tree ranges are generally contracting in response to climate change but not expanding into cooler, wetter climates – suggesting that forests are not regenerating fast enough to keep pace with climate change, wildfire, insects and disease. As the climate becomes too warm for trees in certain places, tree ranges have been expected to shift toward more ideal conditions. The study analyzed national forest inventory data for more than 25,000 plots in the U.S. West, excluding coastal states, and found that trees were not regenerating in the hottest portions of their ranges – an expected outcome. More surprising to the researchers was that most of the 15 common tree species studied were not gaining any ground in areas where conditions were more favorable, indicating that most tree species likely will not be able to move to more accommodating climates without assistance. 'Trees provide a lot of value to humans in terms of clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat and recreation,' said lead author Katie Nigro, who conducted the study as a CSU graduate student. 'If forest managers want to keep certain trees on the landscape, our study shows where they can still exist or where they might need help.' Shrinking ranges were prevalent across undisturbed areas as well as those impacted by wildfire, insects and disease. Using 30 years of disturbance data, the researchers tested the idea that disturbances – particularly wildfire – might catalyze tree movement into cooler, wetter areas by killing adult trees and eliminating competition for seedlings to establish in their preferred climate zone. 'Just like us and every species, trees can only function within a certain climatic tolerance, and different species have different climatic tolerances,' Nigro said. 'I thought we would find more shifts into cooler zones, especially in burned areas.' Results of the study, published in Nature Climate Change, give a broad overview of the predominant pattern – an overall failure to regenerate in the hottest, driest portions of a tree’s range, but also failure to expand along the range’s cooler, wetter border. Nigro cautioned that it’s possible not enough time has passed to see new tree establishment in cooler, wetter areas, especially for slow-growing subalpine species. She added that more, local studies are needed to determine which species will survive where. The paper makes the case for human-assisted tree migration because rapid warming from climate change is likely to outpace regeneration. 'One of the potential issues is that we may get bigger and bigger mismatches between where trees are living and their ideal climate,' Nigro said. Trees seeking cooler temps face uphill battle Increasing wildfire, insect and disease disturbances due to climate change also can prevent regeneration by removing seed sources, and seeds literally have an uphill battle in trying to gain ground upslope, where conditions are cooler. 'There's a lot of things that prevent a seed from moving uphill, including gravity,' said co-author Monique Rocca, an associate professor of ecosystem science and sustainability. 'A lot of conditions need to be in place for a tree to be able to move to cooler, wetter sites.' She continued, 'This study digs into some of the details of where trees are staying on the landscape on their own versus where we may need to intervene if our goal is to keep Western landscapes covered in trees.' A few species fared better than others. Of the four species that continued to regenerate in the areas they already occupied regardless of climate change, wildfire, and insect and disease outbreaks, three of them are rarer on the landscape, so it is harder to accurately gauge their response, and one, Gambel oak, is a resilient, heat- and drought-tolerant resprouting species. The study used long-term field data from the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program, sometimes referred to as the national 'tree census.' Study plots on forested areas across the nation are surveyed continuously to track individual tree growth or losses through harvest, disease or death. Kristen Pelz, analysis team lead with the inventory and analysis program, co-authored the study. 'Dr. Nigro harnessed the power of our field-collected data to show how forests are changing across the interior West – not theoretically, but today,' Pelz said. 'Her work is important because it considers how things like fire and native insects interact with climate, which is essential where natural disturbances have been a primary driver of forest dynamics for millennia.' Rather than looking at changes in the average tree range, as past studies have done, this study went a step further and examined the cold and warm margins of species’ ranges – the leading and trailing edges – which specifies how tree ranges are shifting in more detail and provides actionable insights for forest managers. If trees were expanding into cooler areas on their own, assisted migration wouldn’t be as important. 'This research can help land managers and foresters decide whether to hang on to trees in the hottest portions of their ranges for as long as possible or to transition to a more heat- and drought-tolerant system,' Nigro said, adding that sometimes assisted migration can be done with seeds of the same species that are adapted to a warmer environment. In her current research as an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education postdoctoral fellow with the Rocky Mountain Research Station, Nigro is trying to identify which seeds from a single species might have the best odds of surviving under harsher climate conditions. Co-author Miranda Redmond, who was Nigro’s Ph.D. adviser at CSU, is also following up on this research by studying tree species adaptations at UC Berkeley. 'These efforts are becoming increasingly critical due to the rapid pace and scale of tree die-offs from wildfires, drought and other climate-driven disturbances, coupled with tree regeneration failures observed in many areas,' Redmond said. Nigro added, 'Planting likely will be required to keep trees on the landscape where they are most valued, and we may need to accept new ecosystems in areas that are inevitably going to change. Our future forests might look different and contain different trees than they do today.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm10i83i92uZvE	2025-02-14T15:53:34-08:00	
Remembering Emperor Babur, Descendant of Emir Temour And Genghis ...	The Taj Mahal, known as a wonder of the world, was built by a Timurid (Mughal) Turkish ruler. The Mughals were a Turkic dynasty from Central Asia. The founder of the Mughal Empire, Babur, was of Turkic origin and descended from the Timurids. Today marks Babur’s 542nd birthday. Happy birthday! The Mughals (or Baburids) were a Timurid (Uzbek) dynasty. Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, was of Uzbek Turkic origin and descended from the Timurids (Timurid Empire). As a result, the Baburids, descendants of Timur, ruled the Indian subcontinent until British colonization. Babur would have turned 542 years old today. He was born on February 14, 1483, in Andijan, in present-day Uzbekistan. Zahir ud-Din Muhammad Babur was a descendant of Emir Timur on his father’s side and Genghis Khan on his mother’s side. He was the founder of the Mughal Empire. As a Timurid prince, he followed in the footsteps of his ancestor Timur and carved his name into history. At the time of his death, his empire stretched from Afghanistan to Bengal in India. In addition to his military genius, Babur was also renowned for his literary works. Inspired by the great poet Ali-Shir Nava’i, he wrote his masterpiece, the Baburnama, in the Chagatai Turkic language. During his reign, poetry, biology, geography, and history flourished, making him a key figure of the Timurid Renaissance, who deserves greater study in the West. Despite his conquest of India, Babur was known for his religious tolerance, which made him far ahead of Western rulers of his time. He never forced anyone to convert to Islam, making him a central figure of Timurid humanism. In summary, the Mughal Empire lasted until the 19th century. Even the Taj Mahal is a Mughal creation, as this magnificent monument was built under the orders of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor. Recognized as one of the world’s greatest wonders, the Taj Mahal is a testament to the extraordinary cultural achievements of the Timurid Renaissance. Thus, although structures like the Taj Mahal were built by the Mughal Empire, these projects were deeply influenced by Uzbek’s cultural and architectural heritage, giving them a distinctly Timurid artistic and architectural character. This magnificent monument was constructed during the Mughal era. The Mughal Empire was an Uzbek-Turkic state that ruled India from the 16th to the 18th century. The Taj Mahal’s construction was carried out under the reign of Shah Jahan, the fifth emperor of the Mughal Empire.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm1xb3CZfNdiFE	2025-02-14T15:51:03-08:00	
New Blood Test Could Improve Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis	Up to half of all people living with Alzheimer’s Disease in Ireland remain undiagnosed. Now, a new blood test may have the potential to transform patient care, allowing for better diagnosis, earlier interventions and more targeted treatments. Researchers at Trinity College Dublin, the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition and St James’s Hospital, Dublin are exploring the ability of a new blood test, plasma p-tau217, to detect Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This test could potentially replace the current diagnostic method, a lumbar puncture/spinal tap (which is invasive and poses risks and challenges) in over half of patients with early symptoms, thus allowing more patients to be diagnosed more accurately and with greater efficiency. The study is published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment and Disease Monitoring. In Ireland, over 60,000 people live with dementia, with Alzheimer’s Disease accounting for about 70% of cases. In order to enable accurate diagnosis, biomarkers are currently measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained using a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) procedure. An accurate clinical biological diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is valued by patients and aids future medical care. Of those in Ireland currently living with Alzheimer’s Disease, up to half do not have a formal diagnosis, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods which are accurate and can be used at scale. The study is one of the first in Europe to examine the 'real-world' performance of one of the leading automated blood tests for Alzheimer’s Disease, plasma p-tau217, in patients with mild symptoms undergoing assessment in a specialist memory service. 148 patients attending Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) generously donated blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples at the time of their LP, enabling researchers to directly compare new blood tests to established CSF biomarkers. Crucially, this was performed using fully-automated technology (Lumipulse®), which already exists in clinical diagnostic laboratories. The use of a fully-automated system increases reliability over time in the laboratory as well as reliability between different laboratories. The Trinity College study was a collaboration between the Immunology Department at St James’s Hospital (led by Chief Medical Scientist Dr Jean Dunne & Consultant Immunologist Professor Niall Conlon) and the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition at Tallaght University Hospital (Dr Adam Dyer, Specialist Registrar in Geriatric Medicine & Professor Seán Kennelly, Director). The study found that measuring plasma p-tau217 using a fully-automated system, was >90% as accurate as results obtained from LP. Integrating the blood test into clinical pathways could potentially avoid the need for over half of diagnostic LPs. This has clear implications for the diagnosis and management of early Alzheimer Disease. From their results, the research team believe that this new blood test could replace over half of the 150-200 diagnostic LP procedures that they currently carry out in the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition every year. Dr Jean Dunne, Chief Medical Scientist, Department of Immunology, St James’s Hospital and Trinity Translational Medicine Institute (TTMI) said: 'This blood test is not available currently in Ireland and the findings from this research will lend support to making it available in the future. This ‘translation’ from a research to a diagnostic test is dependent on the scientists, the clinical teams and the support from hospital management. Using this automated analyser the scientists at St James’s will be able to deliver a reliable and reproducible diagnostic test result. The quality assurance carried out in the diagnostic laboratory includes comparison of results achieved to those reported internationally. All of this research will benefit the patient and the clinical teams and combines the research and diagnostic expertise to deliver a world class, patient centred service.' Dr Adam Dyer, Specialist Registrar in Geriatric Medicine & Clinical Lecturer in Medical Gerontology, Trinity College Dublin said: 'This study brings us one step closer to using diagnostic blood tests, such as plasma p-tau217, to assist in the clinical-biological diagnosis of early Alzheimer’s Disease. Importantly, this research assessed plasma p-tau217 using fully-automated technology already available in clinical laboratories and used samples from a 'real-world' clinical cohort. We are incredibly grateful to the 148 patients who contributed to this research by donating their blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples at time of their diagnostic workup in the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition.' Professor Seán Kennelly, Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition in Tallaght University Hospital & Clinical Associate Professor, Trinity College Dublin, said: 'Our research, conducted in collaboration with colleagues from Trinity College Dublin and St. James Hospital Dublin, represents a further significant step forward in the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. By demonstrating the clinical utility of blood-based biomarkers, we are moving closer to a future where diagnosing this condition is less invasive, more accessible, and available to a broader population. This has the potential to transform patient care, allowing for better diagnosis, earlier interventions and more targeted treatments. At the Tallaght Institute of Memory and Cognition, we are extremely grateful to all our patients who contributed to this project, and remain committed to advancing research that improves the lives of those affected by Alzheimer’s and other cognitive disorders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSkfqeTzsm1-Hzuf4i5kwW	2025-02-14T15:48:44-08:00	
Aortic Dissection: Origin, Causes, Precautions And Treatment – Op...	An aortic dissection is a serious medical condition in which the inner layer of the aorta (the large blood vessel that branches off the heart) tears. Blood surges through the tear, causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect). If the blood-filled channel ruptures through the outer wall of the aorta, it can result in life-threatening bleeding. In the body the aorta is composed of three layers: Intima (inner layer), Media (middle layer) and Adventitia (outer layer). It typically begins with a tear in the intima. The high-pressure blood flow within the aorta forces its way into the media, creating a false lumen, which can lead to: Rupture of the aorta. Impaired blood flow to organs. Increased strain on the heart. a. Causes: Chronic Conditions: Hypertension (high blood pressure): The most common contributing factor. Atherosclerosis: Hardening of the arteries. Genetic Disorders: Marfan syndrome: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Trauma, and Blunt chest trauma (e.g., car accidents). Iatrogenic Causes: Complications from medical or surgical procedures, such as cardiac catheterization or aortic surgery. Other Factors: Cocaine or stimulant abuse: Increases blood pressure dramatically. Pregnancy: Rarely, due to hormonal and hemodynamic changes. Bicuspid aortic valve or coarctation of the aorta. b. Symptoms: Symptoms of an aortic dissection depend on its location and severity but often include: Pain: Sudden, severe chest or upper back pain. Described as tearing, ripping, or stabbing. Pain may radiate to the neck, jaw, or abdomen. Signs of Compromised Blood Flow: Weak or absent pulses in the arms or legs. Difference in blood pressure between the arms. c. Neurological Symptoms: Fainting. Stroke-like symptoms if blood flow to the brain is reduced. d. Other Symptoms: Shortness of breath. Sweating. Nausea or vomiting. Difficulty speaking or swallowing (rare but possible). Aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and treatment. It is often confirmed through imaging tests such as a CT scan, MRI, or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Diet and Precautions Proper management of aortic dissection involves lifestyle changes, including a heart-healthy diet and strict adherence to precautions to prevent complications. A diet focused on controlling blood pressure and maintaining heart health is essential. Below are the key dietary guidelines: a. Low-Sodium Diet: Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg/day (ideally 1,500 mg/day). Avoid processed and canned foods, which are often high in salt. Use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. b. Heart-Healthy Foods: Fruits and Vegetables: Rich in potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure (e.g., bananas, oranges, spinach, and broccoli). Whole Grains: Choose oats, brown rice, quinoa, and whole-grain bread. Healthy Fats: Focus on unsaturated fats like those in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Lean Proteins: Include fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel), skinless poultry, and plant-based proteins like lentils and beans. Low-Fat Dairy: Opt for low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese. c. Other diet guideline include: Limit Saturated and Trans Fats: Avoid fried foods, fatty cuts of meat, butter, and processed snacks. Use alternatives like olive oil or canola oil for cooking. Reduce Added Sugars: Avoid sugary drinks, desserts, and sweets. Limit consumption of refined carbohydrates like white bread and pasta. Moderate Alcohol Intake: Limit alcohol consumption to 1 drink per day for women and 2 for men, if permitted by your doctor. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to support overall cardiovascular health. Precautions: Blood Pressure Management: Keep blood pressure strictly within the target range prescribed by your doctor (often d. Avoid Stimulants: Stay away from caffeine, nicotine, and drugs like cocaine, which can raise blood pressure. d. Prevent Infections: Maintain good oral hygiene to reduce the risk of infections that could affect the heart or blood vessels. Get vaccinated as recommended (e.g., flu, pneumonia). e. Maintain a Healthy Weight: Achieve and maintain a body weight within a healthy range to reduce cardiovascular strain. f. Quit Smoking: Smoking damages blood vessels and increases the risk of further complications. Seek support to quit if needed. g. Emergency Preparedness: Be aware of symptoms like severe chest or back pain and seek immediate medical attention if they occur. By adhering to these dietary and lifestyle measures, patients with aortic dissection can reduce the risk of complications and improve overall outcomes. Advancements and future treatment The treatment of aortic dissection has evolved significantly with technological and medical innovations. Research is ongoing to develop safer, more effective, and less invasive methods for managing this life-threatening condition. Current Advancements include: a.Endovascular Repair (TEVAR):Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR): A minimally invasive procedure where a stent-graft is inserted via a catheter to reinforce the damaged section of the aorta. Particularly effective for Type B dissections (involving the descending aorta). Advantages: Shorter recovery time, reduced risk of complications, and lower mortality compared to open surgery. b. Hybrid Procedures: Combine open surgical techniques and endovascular repair to treat complex cases, particularly for Type A dissections (involving the ascending aorta and arch). Useful in cases where conventional TEVAR alone may not suffice. c. Advanced Imaging Techniques: High-resolution CT angiography, MRI, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) improve the diagnosis, monitoring, and surgical planning. 4D flow MRI tracks blood flow dynamics in real-time, helping predict areas at risk of rupture. d. Improved Surgical Techniques: Modern open surgical approaches, like the Bentall procedure or David valve-sparing procedure, offer better outcomes with reduced risks. Use of bioengineered or synthetic grafts for repairing the aorta is now more durable and biocompatible. e. Medical Management Enhancements: Newer antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), more effectively lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the aorta. Advances in anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory therapies reduce risks in chronic dissection cases. Future Directions: a.Personalized Medicine: Genetic testing for conditions like Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome may allow for earlier detection and targeted treatments. Tailored therapies based on patient-specific risk factors, anatomy, and genetic profiles. b. Bioengineered Grafts and Stents: Development of grafts and stents that adapt to the patient’s anatomy and promote natural healing of the aorta. Use of drug-eluting stents to reduce inflammation and scar tissue.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-AxVBoCMm6bzdeg1qAiu3	2025-02-14T15:45:15-08:00

CAF In The Baltics: A Test Of Strength And Strategy – Analysis	The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)-led Latvia Multinational Brigade (MNB-LVA) recently completed its first major field training exercises in a resolute show of NATO deterrence and collective defence in the face of rising tensions and uncertainty about Russia’s long term intentions. However, with the CAF grappling with significant structural challenges, many NATO allies are seeking reassurance from Canada about its ability to uphold its commitments as a reliable leader during periods of geopolitical instability. With war drums beating on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the Baltics, Canada, under Operation REASSURANCE, has set about playing a leading role in the Latvia Multinational Brigade [MNB-LVA], a group consisting of detachments from 13 NATO member states, which forms part of NATO’s 'Enhanced Forward Presence' (eFP) in the country. Canada first assumed the lead for the then battle group (BG) back in 2017, and NATO's strategic evolution to an 'Augmented Forward Presence' (aFP) has required transitioning from a battle group to a brigade (BDE) structure, significantly expanding Canada’s commitments. This is an ongoing process, with full operational capability (FOC) targeted for 2026. Significant issues in procurement and maintenance But this shift presents numerous challenges. The CAF faces structural personnel shortages and training gaps, both of which hinder its ability to meet expanded operational demands. Interoperability with the diverse forces of allied nations further complicates operations, requiring enhanced coordination and integration. Additionally, the transition demands substantial investments in equipment to meet NATO standards and operational expectations. Persistent issues around accurately estimating needs and costs exacerbate these challenges, as does the CAF’s limited human resources capacity. Colonel Vince Kirstein, Commander of Task Force Latvia, acknowledged the CAF’s limitations in this regard, noting, 'Canada does not have some of those capabilities that would inherently be required in a brigade.' A 2018 article by a serving army officer highlighted significant issues with Canada’s Leopard 2 tank fleet. At the time, only 15 to 20% of the fleet was operational, with the potential to increase to 30% with substantial effort. The article attributed these problems to a critical underestimation of the maintenance needs for the Leopard 2 tanks. Maintenance estimates had been based on experience with the simpler Leopard C1 from the earlier Leopard 1 series, leading to inadequate preparation for the more complex demands of Leopard 2. Additional challenges compounded the issue, including a lack of qualified maintenance personnel, insufficient dedicated infrastructure for tank upkeep and overhaul, and chronic shortages of spare parts. This scarcity often led to the cannibalisation of some tanks to keep others operational, further diminishing the fleet’s effectiveness. In early June 2023, shortly before Defence Minister Anita Anand announced the deployment of 15 Leopard 2 tanks to Latvia, CBC News published an article revealing another layer of equipment shortages faced by Canadian troops. According to the report, soldiers stationed in Latvia were purchasing their own modern ballistic helmets with integrated hearing protection, along with rain gear, vests, and belts to carry water and ammunition. The article also highlighted growing complaints about poorly fitting body armour for female soldiers. 'In general, it was concerning verging on embarrassing to see the differences in issued soldier equipment between us and the Danes,' said Lt.-Col. Jesse van Eijk, the Canadian battle group commander in Latvia, in a May 12, 2023 email as reported by CBC News. This trend of soldiers turning to commercial suppliers for higher-quality clothing and equipment is unsurprising, given the often superior options available on the market. In response to the CBC report, a Department of National Defence spokesperson acknowledged these issues and stated that efforts were underway to introduce new helmets, combat clothing, boots, and other gear in the near future. eFP equipment needs As Canada transitions its NATO commitment from eFP to aFP, addressing equipment needs has become a critical challenge. While some requirements are covered under Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) and receive appropriate funding (see Portable Anti-Tank Missile Systems and Counter-Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (CUAS), significant gaps remain—particularly in artillery capabilities, which are essential for large-scale state-on-state conflicts like those involving Russian forces. Artillery is a glaring, unfunded priority for the Canadian Army. The UORs are also seeking to procure up to twenty 155mm self-propelled howitzers, along with essential resupply equipment and ammunition. However, these plans remain unfulfilled. Canada’s current inventory of M777 towed artillery systems, which demonstrated their relevance in counterinsurgency operations against adversaries lacking comparable capabilities (a situation referred to by the military as asymmetry), is simply not suited to the context of high-intensity conflicts. Modernisation efforts need to prioritise platforms that offer both survivability and operational effectiveness on the battlefield, and in sufficient quantities to withstand loss rates that the CAF has not experienced since WWII. Major-General Rob Dundon highlighted the ongoing debate over stock replenishment versus replacement, indicating that decisions regarding long-term capability upgrades are still unresolved. Many options are on the table, including the paradoxical one—given its unsuitability to the operational realities of facing Russia—of reopening BAE's production lines for the M777, but such a move would require significant international demand to justify its profitability, an unlikely prospect. Each option presents unique challenges and trade-offs in terms of cost, timeline, and operational effectiveness. Potential solutions and interoperability testing in Latvia The CAF face significant uncertainty about how to address these critical equipment and capability gaps in the Baltic region. However, leveraging the deployment in Latvia for testing new systems could offer valuable insights. Platforms like the K9 Thunder heavy tracked artillery or CAESAR truck-mounted howitzers—already fielded, either by Estonia or Lithuania—are potential candidates for future CAF acquisitions. These systems align with NATO standards, some of them have been successfully battle proven in Ukraine and could address Canada’s persistent artillery shortages. General Joe Paul, Commander of the Canadian Army, described the Baltic theatre as an 'amazing laboratory' for refining tactics and testing equipment. The lessons learned from operating within a multinational brigade environment could heavily influence future doctrine and procurement decisions. This collaborative setup allows Canada to evaluate not only its own capabilities but also how its systems integrate with those of its allies. Interoperability, however, presents its own challenges. Effective coordination across Slovak, Polish, and Canadian forces, for instance, requires harmonising artillery and fire support doctrines. Differences in procedures and equipment can lead to significant risks during live operations. Major Matt Stickland, 1 RCHA Battery Commander, underscored the potential for mistakes, emphasising the catastrophic consequences of miscommunication or procedural mismatches during combat. 'It has been a challenge to make sure we have a common understanding. While there are NATO TTPs and STANAGS (standardization agreements) for everything we do within the artillery, sometimes the interpretation of these by different counties in their language makes a difference,' he said. 'With artillery, those differences in procedures when you are shooting a round 20 kilometres down range can have a big impact on making sure that round lands on target.' Testing allied systems like the K9 Thunder and CAESAR would also provide critical data for Canada’s Indirect Fire Modernisation project. This initiative aims to replace the aging M777 towed artillery with more agile, modern platforms capable of withstanding high-intensity conflicts. Such testing in Latvia would directly contribute to identifying solutions that enhance both operational readiness and compatibility with NATO standards. The deployment in Latvia highlights the CAF’s pressing equipment and personnel challenges. Addressing these issues requires a dual focus: investing strategically in modernisation and leveraging interoperability testing with NATO allies. By aligning its systems and practices with those of allied forces, Canada can ensure greater operational effectiveness in the Baltic region. Success hinges on closing gaps in artillery capabilities and refining joint operations to maintain credibility and readiness in an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PI9NN1UtASiM	2025-02-13T17:38:07-08:00	
Blackout Nation: How Myanmar’s Energy Crisis Is Crippling Lives –...	By Htet Khaing Min In Myanmar, darkness no longer just falls after sunset—it has become an everyday reality, an uninvited guest that lingers well beyond nightfall. Key Takeaways: Severe Power Shortages Cripple Myanmar – Blackouts for up to 20 hours disrupt businesses, healthcare, and daily life, worsening economic hardships. Gas Dependency and Infrastructure Damage – Failing gas plants, stalled solar projects, and grid attacks force reliance on costly alternatives. Urgent Reforms Needed – Expanding renewables, repairing infrastructure, and improving governance are crucial for energy stability. As the country grapples with one of its most severe power shortages in decades, the lights of progress have flickered and dimmed under the shadow of the military junta's regime. With rolling blackouts, widespread infrastructure damage, and a fractured power grid, Myanmar's citizens find themselves in the dark—literally and figuratively. Widespread socio-economic challenges, including higher household expenses, job losses, business closures, disruptions in education and healthcare, rising poverty, and long-term economic and environmental damage, are growing due to persistent power shortages. This article examines the causes and far-reaching consequences of Myanmar’s energy crisis, offering insights into the political, social, and economic toll it continues to exact on the nation. 1. Background of Myanmar Power Industry Over the past decade, Myanmar's power industry has experienced notable growth, followed by an abrupt decline following the 2021 military coup. Between 2015 and 2021, Myanmar saw significant strides in electricity generation and electrification. The country's energy infrastructure expanded with foreign direct investment (FDI) support and progressive government policies like the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan 2018-2030. The total installed power capacity grew from 5,125 MW to 6,830 MW, while power output increased from 15,965 GWh to 23,643 GWh annually. Gas-fired power plants like Thaketa Power Plant (400 MW), Thanlyin Power Plant (350 MW), and Thilawa Power Project (1,250 MW, expected online in 2024) were developed, and the electrification rate surged, benefiting both urban and rural areas. However, the 2021 military coup marked the beginning of a rapid decline in Myanmar’s electricity production. Major foreign investors exited the market, conflicts disrupted infrastructure, and economic instability set in, bringing the country's energy growth to a halt. These disruptions have since spiraled into one of the worst power crises in Myanmar’s history, one that continues to have far-reaching social and economic implications. 2. Brief Situation of Power Resources In a crisis, Myanmar’s energy sector faces widespread disruptions affecting all primary power sources. As demand outpaces supply, the country’s energy infrastructure faces mounting challenges. Let’s take a closer look at the current state of power resources. 2.1 Natural Gas: Declining Dominance Once the backbone of Myanmar’s power generation, supplying 55% of Myanmar’s electricity in 2022, natural gas generation has plummeted due to supply shortages and investor exits post-2021. Foreign companies like Voltalia, Posco, Total Energies, Chevron, and VPower ceased their operations due to political instability, ethical concerns, economic mismanagement, security risks, and financial losses, further weakening the energy sector. The shutdown of VPower’s Thilawa (350 MW) and Thaketa (400 MW) LNG plants in July 2021 resulted in a 1,200 MW capacity loss. Gas-fired plants operate below capacity, dropping efficiency from 17% in 2023 to 19% in 2022. State-owned plants struggle with rationing, while private facilities receive priority. 2.2. Hydropower: Overuse and Declining Efficiency Hydropower, accounting for 43.4% of the country's electricity in 2022 and almost 62% in 2023, has become the fallback as gas declines. Despite an estimated 100,000 MW potential, installed capacity remains at only 3,262 MW. Major plants like Yeywa (790 MW) and Shweli-1 (400 MW) are disrupted by conflicts and transmission damage. The Baluchaung cascade plants (243 MW) are in decline, with Baluchaung 1 and 3 no longer operational. Overuse has stressed water resources, causing seasonal fluctuations. The Nation’s heavy reliance on hydropower leads to severe electricity shortages during the dry season when water levels drop, reducing generation capacity. In 2022, maintenance shutdowns of key hydropower units, declining gas production, and halted LNG imports worsenedpower cuts, highlighting the urgent need for energy diversification. 2.3. Solar: Limited Impact and Stalled Expansion Myanmar’s solar capacity is minimal, with only six operational plants generating 182 MW. Government efforts to scale up solar through IPP tenders have largely failed, with only 142 MW commissioned out of a planned 2,150 MW. Most projects post-2021 remain stalled or canceled. Even functional solar plants provideinconsistent generation and are limited to daylight hours. 2.4. Coal: Minimal Contribution, Environmental Concerns Coal power remains marginal at 0.5% of total generation, with just two operational plants (138 MW). Myanmar has 488.7 million tons of coal reserves, yet only 1% has been confirmed, limiting its immediate contribution to the energy mix despite the potential. Environmental concerns have stalled coal expansion, with coal-related emissions accounting for 5.1% of total power sector emissions in 2022. 2.5. Power Grid: Conflict and Infrastructure Decay The national grid has suffered 229 attacks since 2021, severely disrupting transmission. In early 2025, power generation fell below 2,000 MW per day, far from the 4,400 MW demand. Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyidaw endure blackouts lasting 5-20 hours daily. Power distribution remains unequal, with Yangon receiving 48%, Mandalay 17%, and the rest of the country 35%. 2.6. Mini-Grids: Rural Electrification at Risk Developed under the National Electrification Plan (NEP), 73 mini-grids serve22,500 households and 15,800 public facilities. However, sustainability is threatened by conflicts, theft, and soaring fuel costs, which have tripled since 2021. Fixed tariffs fail to cover operational expenses, causing financial distress for operators and frequent outages for rural communities. 2.7 Worsening Current Nationwide Power Shortage As of early 2025, Myanmar’s power generation has plunged to around 2,800 MW daily, meeting just 50-55% of demand. Peak output sometimes drops below 2,000 MW, causing severe blackouts—up to 20 hours daily in major cities like Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyidaw. Rural and conflict-affected areas face near-constant outages. In Yangon, power cuts begin as early as 1 AM, with electricity available for only eight hours daily. Businesses and households increasingly rely on solar panels, charcoal stoves, and generators, further straining the economy and infrastructure. Recently, on 5th February 2025, Thailand cut power to Myanmar scam compounds linked to forced labor and fraud. Still, some remain operational using generators and satellite internet, while diplomatic efforts with China and Myanmar aim to curb these crimes. 3. Socioeconomic Impacts As a result, this persistent power shortage has caused severe socio-economic repercussions across Myanmar at every level. Household Hardships: Families face cooking, water access, and refrigeration issues, raising daily expenses. Job Losses: Power outages force businesses to cut operations, leading to unemployment, especially in industrial zones. Business Struggles: High generator costs raise production expenses, forcing some factories to shut down. Education & Healthcare Disruptions: Schools and hospitals struggle without stable electricity, affecting learning and medical services. Transportation Disruptions: Power shortages limit CNG supply, reducing public transport availability. Rising Poverty: Limited electricity reduces income opportunities, increases living costs, and hinders progress in education and healthcare. Long-Term Damage: Development slows, investment declines, and reliance on unreliable energy sources worsens environmental and health risks. 4. Junta's Mitigation Action Fell Short In response to the crisis, the military junta has attempted short-term fixes like infrastructure repairs and LNG projects, but sanctions and technical issues have slowed progress. Hydropower overuse has worsened water shortages, reducing capacity. Long-term plans for new hydro and solar plants remain stalled, with pre-coup projects largely unfulfilled. Despite doubling electricity tariffs, revenue has not improved power generation or grid stability. On the other hand, the National Unity Government (NUG)'s ability to address Myanmar’s energy crisis in liberated areas is hindered by the ongoing fragmentation among resistance forces, the lack of participation from key ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and the challenge of establishing inclusive, accountable governance systems necessary for sustainable energy infrastructure. 5. Future Prospects and Consequences The power crisis persists without addressing these governance inefficiencies and investing in renewables, threatening severe economic, social, and political consequences. Economically, industrial output will decline as businesses face high costs of diesel generators, deterring foreign investment. Socially, the crisis will disrupt healthcare, education, and water supply, worsening poverty and inequality. The country's infrastructure and economic systems may suffer lasting damage, reversing years of progress. Politically, the junta's failure to address the crisis could fuel public dissatisfaction and civil unrest, deepening instability and challenging its legitimacy, further exacerbating Myanmar's decline. 6. Mitigation Plan To address this alarming crisis, Myanmar must adopt a multi-pronged approach. The immediate priority is the restoration of infrastructure, focusing on repairing damaged transmission lines and rehabilitating key gas plants. Expanding renewable energy sources, particularly solar, wind, and hydropower, is crucial for reducing the nation’s dependency on gas and mitigating future power shortages. Moreover, Myanmar’s energy policy must be reformed to attract foreign investment and improve governance. An independent Energy Regulatory Commission could ensure transparency, boost investor confidence, and combat corruption. Strengthening the financial management of the energy sector will also be vital for sustainable growth. In the longer term, Myanmar should explore regional energy cooperation, particularly with neighboring countries like Laos and Thailand, to ease supply constraints and expand the grid. For instance, Laos and Myanmar are advancing a 2024 MOU on power cooperation to supply 300-400 MW via northern grids. Still, past struggles with domestic energy projects and ongoing feasibility studies will determine pricing and implementation within two years. Mini-grids and decentralized solutions must be prioritized to ensure that rural areas continue to have access to reliable energy. Ultimately, political stability is key to the success of any energy reform. Without a return to peace and stability, foreign investments, technical expertise, and infrastructure improvements will remain out of reach, prolonging Myanmar’s energy crisis.

Breaking The Cycle Of Old Politics In Sri Lanka – Analysis	By Neil DeVotta Sri Lanka’s 2024 elections have ushered in a seismic shift, with Anura Kumara Dissanayake (often known by his initials ‘AKD’) of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) becoming president in September 2024 and the JVP-led National People’s Power (NPP) alliance winning a parliamentary supermajority in November 2024. The two elections represent a political realignment, empowering a new class of elites while marginalising long-dominant politicians. The Marxist-Leninist JVP was responsible for two bloody insurrections in 1971 and 1987-89 that killed tens of thousands of Sri Lankans. This violent past was long an electoral albatross, but creating the NPP alliance with twenty other groups helped transform the JVP into a more conventional left-leaning party. AKD’s winning personality and articulate, rational discourse held sway over now former Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in the presential election. Educated professionals who contested for the NPP in the parliamentary election further softened the JVP’s prior radical image. The splintered opposition also helped. But the main reason for AKD’s and the NPP’s victories was the island’s bankruptcy. The alliance effectively linked the resulting economic crisis to the corruption, nepotism and impunity of previous regimes and promised more accountable and transparent governance. Systemic change requires that Sri Lanka’s political structure and political culture must now be transformed. The NPP has promised a new constitution, which could appreciably change the political system. But transforming the political culture would require weakening ethnocracy in ways that may sideline powerful constituencies like the military and Buddhist clergy. A new political culture would also require accountability for crimes committed by security personnel — often hailed as war heroes —against Tamils, journalists and detractors of the former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family. Few minorities voted for Dissanayake, but many voted for the NPP. The NPP is the first political grouping from the predominantly Sinhalese south to win Tamil and Muslim districts in the northeast. Both the presidential and parliamentary elections took place without the ethnoreligious dog whistles of the past, helping the NPP bridge the ethnoreligious divide. Post-election, the government has embarked on a three-pronged development plan — eliminating poverty, creating a digital economy and a Clean Sri Lanka initiative which emphasises anti-corruption and the rule of law to resuscitate the island’s environment, ethics and culture. It has also promised to recruit more Tamils into the police force and return additional Tamil lands — long occupied by the military — to their original owners. Such measures could help AKD and the NPP strengthen their appeal among minorities. To ensure stability, the new government agreed to stick with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout and completed the sovereign debt restructuring agreement spearheaded by the Wickremesinghe regime, despite the NPP wanting to renegotiate both. NPP supporters who vilify the IMF and neoliberalism have been disappointed, but the government had little choice. In any case, the NPP is not the JVP. And the new elite, while left-leaning, are products of the island’s post-1977 open market milieu. The JVP’s Marxist dogma has also long lapsed. Since AKD’s election, tourism has ramped up and the stock market is at its highest level yet. The IMF has also approved its third review of the US$2.9 billion bailout, which will add US$333 million to government coffers. Yet the euphoria has subsided and the NPP is struggling to meet expectations. Farmers protest for not receiving sufficient assistance and many people complain about the cost of living — especially coconut and rice prices. This is an inexperienced government, which partly explains it disagreement with bureaucrats for supposedly stymying reform efforts. The JVP used to emphasise the dangers of Indian expansionism and the party was among the most anti-Indian groups in Sri Lankan politics. But its leaders have gradually changed their attitude, as reiterated when Dissanayake made a successful visit to India in December 2024. The government is committed to pursuing a neutral foreign policy, consistent with claims made by previous leaders — even if Mahinda Rajapaksa tilted toward China and Ranil Wickremesinghe toward the West. Most proposed Indian investment projects are designed to facilitate connectivity between the two countries. But Sri Lanka’s politicians worry whether India’s strong geostrategic position could lead to dependence and undermine the island’s sovereignty. Yet it makes sense for the country to try and piggyback on the growing economic development in South India. India cannot afford an estranged neighbour to its south — not with a hostile Pakistan, the pro-India regime in Bangladesh being ousted, Nepal reviving the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or China spreading its influence throughout the region. Sri Lanka will have some leverage when engaging its giant neighbour. The JVP’s origins are also rooted in Maoism and Dissanayake visited China in January 2025. In a dozen of many interviews with people close to the matter over the last decade, I have been told that money from Chinese and Indian sources has been channelled towards political parties in Sri Lanka. China has most likely supported the party financially and it wants to further its BRI via Sri Lanka. Dissanayake’s team signed 15 Memorandums of Understanding with their Chinese counterparts , including a US$3.7 billion oil refinery project in Hambantota that will ensure more Chinese shipping entered the region’s port. The government’s challenge will be to balance China’s BRI designs with India’s Neighbourhood First agenda. The NPP’s election manifesto promised Sri Lankans ‘a thriving nation [and] a beautiful life’. It will be a long time in the making. If Dissanayake and the NPP can avoid scandals while pursuing policies — both domestic and foreign — that improve the island’s economy, they will stay relatively popular and at least provide Sri Lankans a dignified life in the years ahead.

Rising Rates May Trigger Financial Instability, Complicating Figh...	Before the pandemic, investors worried about how persistently low inflation and interest rates would crimp bank profits. Paradoxically, they also worried about bank profitability when post-COVID reopening sent inflation and central bank interest rates soaring. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and other US lenders in early 2023 appeared to validate these fears. Our new research on the relationship between inflation and bank profitability helps us make sense of these concerns. Most banks are largely insulated from shifts in inflation—the exposure of income and expenses tend to offset each other. Yet some have significant inflation exposures, which may lead to financial instability if concentrated losses lead to wider panics in the banking sector. As several major central banks are reassessing their monetary policy frameworks in the aftermath of the post-pandemic inflation surge, a deeper understanding of the links between inflation and bank profitability can help design better monetary policy frameworks. Our findings imply that central banks may need to consider financial stability when setting their policy stance to combat inflation. Inflation matters Does inflation matter for bank profitability? This question has received surprisingly little attention. We answer it by combining balance sheet and income data for more than 6,600 banks in advanced and emerging economies with nearly three decades of IMF economic data. Most lenders appear largely hedged against inflation with both bank income and expenses rising with inflation to similar degrees. Income and expenses tied to borrowing and lending are exposed indirectly to inflation, because they primarily react to policy rates that fluctuate in response to inflation. In contrast, other income and expenses—revenues from non-traditional banking activities, services, salaries, and rent—are exposed directly to price changes. At the country level, the impact of inflation on bank income and expenses individually varies widely across banking systems. Shifts in inflation are reflected in income and expenses much more rapidly in some countries than in others. But, again, since both income and expenses rise with inflation to similar degrees in most countries, most banking systems appear largely hedged to inflation. Concentrated exposures So, can inflation be a cause for concern? Our research identifies specific vulnerabilities: some banks are particularly susceptible to inflation due to different risk management and business models. Outliers in both advanced and emerging market and developing economies stand to see large losses when inflation and interest rates spike. Strikingly, 3 percent of banks in advanced economies and 6 percent of banks in emerging economies are at least as exposed to elevated interest rates as Silicon Valley Bank at the onset of its failure. Banks in emerging economies also appear more exposed to inflation directly, possibly due to more widespread price indexation. Policy implications Amid high inflation, tightening monetary policy, while necessary, could lead to meaningful losses for banks with large exposures. Customers and investors may then reassess risks across all banks, which could lead to panics and financial instability. Strengthening prudential regulation and supervision, heightening required risk management at banks, improving transparency, and using granular risk assessments accounting for key factors our research highlights for a broad set of banks would all help to systematically contain inflation exposures. Despite these improvements, if losses at individual banks leave room for wider contagion, central banks may need to balance raising rates to contain inflation against the potential for financial instability.

Resettling Gaza: Trump’s Empire-Building Agenda? – Analysis	In his signature style, President Donald Trump has doubled down on his vision for the future of Gaza, suggesting that the United States could assume control of the embattled territory once hostilities subside. Speaking on December 6, Trump outlined a plan in which Israel would transfer the Gaza Strip to U.S. oversight, emphasizing that the move would involve resettling Palestinians into what he described as 'far safer and more beautiful communities' across the region. Notably, he assured that no American troops would be required to execute this vision. The proposal, however, has sparked immediate backlash. Critics have accused Trump of endorsing a form of ethnic cleansing, a charge vehemently denied by his administration. The United Nations, human rights organizations, and Arab leaders have condemned the idea, while analysts remain skeptical of its feasibility. Trump’s initial remarks, made during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, framed Gaza’s transformation into the 'Riviera of the Middle East' as a permanent shift. Yet, subsequent clarifications from his officials have painted a different picture, suggesting that any displacement would be temporary and would allow for reconstruction and debris clearance. The contradictions within Trump’s camp have only deepened the controversy. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Rubio both emphasized the interim nature of the plan, directly contradicting Trump’s earlier implications of permanence. Meanwhile, Trump’s post on Truth Social left key questions unanswered, particularly whether Gaza’s two million residents would eventually be permitted to return. Under international law, the forced transfer of populations from occupied territories is explicitly prohibited, adding another layer of complexity to Trump’s proposal. Trump’s vision, though ambitious, appears mired in legal, logistical, and ethical challenges, raising doubts about its viability. In advocating a prolonged U.S. occupation of Gaza and the expulsion of Palestinians, President Donald Trump is not only aligning himself with the far-right vision of Israel’s supremacist factions but also endorsing what can only be described as a war crime. This stance betrays any commitment to peace he might have professed during his inaugural address. Trump, who took an oath to uphold the U.S. constitution, has now proposed on February 4 that the United States take control over Gaza under the pretext of reconstruction—a thinly veiled prelude to a predatory real estate venture that explicitly excludes Palestinians. Trump’s unwavering support for Israeli policies is well documented. His unilateral decisions, such as moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, thus recognizing the city as Israel’s capital, and legitimizing Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, set a precedent during his first term (2017-2021). In advocating for the forceful displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, Trump has taken a significant step towards solidifying his alignment with the Israeli far-right. This segment of Israeli politics envisions the conflict in terms of absolute dominion and subjugation. Furthermore, Trump’s shocking announcement about Gaza might soon be followed by similar stances on the annexation of significant portions of the West Bank. By denying Palestinians their legitimate right to self-determination in the land that is rightfully theirs, Trump is essentially rewriting history to fit a narrative of dominance and control. This distortion of historical facts into a narrative of supremacy risks being endorsed as official policy by the world’s leading power. This trajectory must be halted. Peace is achievable only through compromise and mutual recognition, not through the oppression of a beleaguered people. The pursuit of such a catastrophic project would undoubtedly incite dangerous Israeli messianism, to the detriment of both sides. Trump is also disregarding how this announcement will affect the ongoing normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which hinge on the creation of a Palestinian state. The expressed refusal by Egypt and Jordan to be complicit in this proposed ethnic cleansing by taking in displaced Palestinians similarly falls on deaf ears. Trump appears convinced that the force he wields from the White House supersedes all other considerations. This conviction harkens back to the misadventures of another Republican administration in the wake of 9/11, which saw the United States engage in disastrous military endeavors across the Middle East. The resulting damage to America’s global standing, the loss of countless lives, and the squandering of vast resources were all counterproductive to the intended outcomes. Trump entered the political arena a decade ago by criticizing these very missteps, yet now he champions a form of neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism that demands a physical presence in foreign lands. Far from restoring America’s greatness, as he claims, Trump risks dragging the nation back into a bloody quagmire from its past. The public sentiment in Arab countries has been overwhelmingly negative towards the plan. Many perceive it as an imperialistic act that negates Palestinian self-determination and threatens regional stability. The geopolitical consequences of this proposal are likely to be severe. The displacement of Palestinians could ignite riots and violence, not just in Gaza, but throughout the Middle East. Countries in the region are already grappling with socio-economic challenges and political risks, and may not be able to manage the additional burden of displaced Palestinians. Moreover, this plan could strain relations between the United States and key Middle Eastern allies. Strategic partners like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan might reconsider their diplomatic ties with the United States if it pursues such a policy. The broader Muslim world, including Turkey and Iran, would likely amplify their objections to America’s role in the region. The challenges of implementing such a transformation are immense, even though Trump envisions Gaza as an economic hub. Relocating more than 1.8 million people is not feasible. Neighboring countries, already dealing with their own economic and political issues, are unlikely to open their borders to such an influx. The lack of options for the Palestinians exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, security risks would deter investors, even if the land were cleared for redevelopment. Transforming Gaza economically would require substantial foreign investment, but the displacement of its population would discourage many international businesses. Yet, the cost of demolishing and rebuilding Gaza would be prohibitively high, necessitating immediate and long-term involvement from a reluctant if not openly hostile international community. Another significant issue is security. The evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza would provoke strong resistance from local militias and other regions and countries. Hamas and other militant groups would likely launch counterattacks, leading to further conflict. The U.S. control of Gaza would necessitate a sustained military presence, resulting in prolonged insurgency and terrorist activity. Past experiences of military occupations in volatile regions like Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that such interventions often lead to significant losses, financial strain, and long-term instability rather than successful outcomes. Trump’s proposal to seize the Gaza Strip and relocate its Palestinian residents raises numerous legal, ethical, and geopolitical questions. Mass deportation of people is not only a violation of international law but also a practice that could lead to further conflict and strained relations with other nations. Ultimately, any effort to address the Israeli-Palestinian issue must begin with the recognition of the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. A multilateral and sustainable approach, grounded in the principles of international law and involving all parties in the conflict, is essential for establishing lasting peace in the region.

Foreign Companies Driving The Global Privatization Of Domestic In...	Foreign entities have secured profitable positions in once-public domestic infrastructure. The pursuit of short-term cash has sacrificed long-term revenue streams to a variety of foreign investors. On February 4, 2025, Chicago's business community pushed back against Mayor Brandon Johnson's proposal to raise real estate transfer taxes, adding to the city's ongoing economic struggles. Besides a struggling pension fund, high home prices, and other factors, a significant contributor to the city's woes lies in the controversial privatization initiatives from the 2000s, known as the 'Great Chicago Sell-Off.' Over the past two decades, these decisions have siphoned an estimated $3 to $4 billion from Chicago. The privatization trend began under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, starting with the Chicago Skyway. In 2005, the 7.8-mile toll road was leased to a consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial and Australia's Macquarie Group for $1.83 billion. Tolls were raised immediately, and in 2016, the 99-year lease was sold to 'a trio of Canadian pension funds' (the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP)) for $2.8 billion. Australia's Atlas Arteria Ltd. then acquired a two-thirds stake for $2 billion in 2022, while OTTP retained the remainder. In 2006, four downtown parking garages with more than 9,000 spaces were leased for 99 years to Morgan Stanley for $563 million. After Morgan Stanley defaulted on its debt tied to the lease agreement, control was transferred in 2014 to lenders, including France's Societe Generale, the German government, and Italy's UniCredit S.p.A. In 2016, Australia's AMP Capital and Canada's Northleaf Capital Partners acquired the garages. Abu Dhabi came into the picture in 2008. In a $1.16 billion deal, 36,000 parking meters were sold to Chicago Parking Meters (CPM) LLC for 75 years, a consortium led by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley's Infrastructure group soon restructured CPM's ownership, transferring major stakes to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany's Allianz through complex investment vehicles. Over the next five years, parking fees more than doubled. By 2022, CPM recovered its entire $1.16 billion investment, while the city had spent $78.8 million buying back parking spots to cover the revenue it would have generated until 2084. As of 2024, the investment has returned $700 million, with 60 years left on the lease. Daley's goal was to balance the city's budget without raising property taxes before leaving office. However, the one-time payments resulted in long-term consequences. In addition to financial losses, the privatization deals have hindered Chicago's ability to modernize infrastructure by limiting efforts to build bike lanes and reduce car dependence downtown, and people even need to get permission or make payments to companies thousands of miles away for local street parades. Growing Privatization Profit-driven entities argue that privatizing public infrastructure leads to greater efficiency through expertise and investment. However, their focus is on profit maximization, not service improvement, leading to long-term rent-seeking behavior. Furthermore, in contracts with limited liability companies, the government assumes the losses, while private companies reap the profits. Companies can walk away or demand renegotiations, while governments are left to maintain services, absorb long-term revenue losses, and burden the public with higher costs. As Chicago's experience shows, privatization has extended beyond domestic markets to become an international phenomenon. Starting in the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank reforms encouraged the privatization of public infrastructure to attract investment, leading to its internationalization. 'A 2006 study by the Norwegian government of IMF conditionality revealed that 23 out of 40 poor countries still have privatization and liberalization conditions attached to their IMF loans,' stated an Oxfam Briefing Paper. By 2000, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and multinational corporations began treating infrastructure as a global asset class, involving extended leases that frequently change hands. Foreign companies operate under bilateral investment treaties or trade agreements, allowing them to bypass local courts. Disputes are often mediated in foreign courts or through international arbitration, such as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and the World Trade Organization. By exploiting legal loopholes like offshore subsidiaries and tax havens, companies can also shield profits while facing little public scrutiny. Despite these issues, domestic infrastructure continues to be increasingly available on international markets. United States While Chicago remains the most prominent American example, similar deals are widespread across the country, primarily involving companies from allied or dependent nations. In 1998, Atlanta became one of the first cities to enter into an international privatization deal over public services, signing a 20-year and $428 million contract with United Water, a subsidiary of France's corporate conglomerate Suez, to operate the city's water system. Celebrated as the biggest privatization contract in the U.S. at the time, it led to claims of quality decline, delays, and other mismanagement before the contract was terminated, leading to the infrastructure being returned to public control in 2003. Nonetheless, the trend continued. By 2006, foreign companies were leasing and operating 80 percent of U.S. port terminals along with a smaller share of the nation's airports. The UK's National Grid owns and operates electric transmission networks in the northeastern U.S. Indiana has since become a prominent example of experimenting with international privatization. France's Veolia entered a 20-year contract to manage Indianapolis's waterworks in 2002. The deal was, however, eventually canceled in 2010. Meanwhile, its airport was managed by Britain's BAA from 1994 to 2007. In 2006, the Indiana Toll Road was leased to a foreign consortium led by Spanish and Australian companies for 75 years for $3.8 billion. It was later sold for $5.7 billion to Australia's IFM Investors in 2015. United States entities have purchased some infrastructure abroad, such as in 1999, when a subsidiary of Bechtel privatized Cochabamba's water system in Bolivia before controversy forced its exit. But for a major economy, the U.S. owns surprisingly little foreign infrastructure. It has few state-owned enterprises for overseas infrastructure investment, though some private entities like Blackstone's Infrastructure Partners division and Corsair Capital are active. Instead, extensive domestic privatization opportunities have made U.S. infrastructure a prime target for American and foreign investors. Canadian and Australian Companies Canadian and Australian pension funds and other entities, driven by well-funded systems, consolidation, government support, and early privatization experience, have become major infrastructure investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. The CPPIB owns toll roads worldwide, the OTPP holds stakes in airports across Europe, along with the Channel Tunnel, while the Canadian company Brookfield Infrastructure Partners owns telecom infrastructure across Europe. Roughly half of Australia's pension pool is invested outside the country. But Australia's Macquarie Group, in particular, has seen its assets surge, emerging as the 'world's largest infrastructure asset manager.' Since the 1990s, Macquarie Group has focused on identifying underperforming or undervalued public assets to acquire and restructure, and it established its Global Infrastructure Fund in 2001 'to invest in infrastructure financing opportunities in the U.S., Canada, UK, and the European Union,' according to its website. In addition to Chicago's Skyway, Macquarie holds long-term operational licenses for the Dulles Greenway toll road in Virginia and the Foley Beach Expressway in Alabama, among others. Macquarie's toll road portfolio in India is worth an estimated $2 billion, and it took a 49 percent stake in Greece's largest utility, Public Power Corporation (PPC) in 2021. It also led the push for privatizing the UK's Bristol Airport in 2001, while Britain's largest water utility was sold to an international consortium led by Macquarie Group from 2006 to 2017. Macquarie also took full ownership of the UK's National Gas Network in 2023. According to a July 2023 Guardian article, 'Macquarie is well known for taking advantage of volatile markets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it bet big on non-investment grade loans, known as junk debt. The debt was cheap, but the quality was decent and the returns turned out to be excellent.' Europe The UK has been a major market for infrastructure investors since the global wave of privatization in the 1980s. Beyond Macquarie's infrastructure holdings, the UK's largest electricity generation company was privatized and acquired by France's EDF in 2009. Foreign investors have continued to diversify, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) poised to take over Newcastle Airport, after acquiring a 37.6 percent stake in Heathrow with French co-investor Ardian in 2024. Europe's collective experience with infrastructure privatization has been marked by controversy, largely due to Western European corporate dominance. As the EU expanded, some Western EU companies bought control of critical infrastructure in Eastern EU member states. In 2015, Greece privatized 14 regional airports handing them over to a consortium led by the German company Fraport. This move was unpopular in Greece, especially following the austerity measures imposed by the EU and Germany during Greece's economic crisis. However, the EU also provides safeguards in such deals, including profit sharing and economic support to member states. Outside the EU, resolving disputes is even more challenging. French water companies like Veolia and Suez are leaders in global privatization efforts but have ended up in court over dealings with Argentina in the 1990s, Egypt in the 2000s, and Gabon in the 2010s. Argentina renationalized its oil company from Spanish company Repsol in 2012 after domestic backlash, damaging relations between the two countries. Such cases can be particularly sensitive when they involve former colonial powers and their former colonies, as economic disputes risk being seen as extensions of past dominance, with former ruling states accused of leveraging privatization to maintain influence. China China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) predominantly focuses on building infrastructure in non-Western countries, though the 2020 takeover of Laos' electric grid shows an exception. In contrast, Europe's existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China's COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021. China's competitive pricing, substantial financial and productive resources, and strategic interests have extended its infrastructure influence to countries with their own expansive foreign infrastructure portfolios. Chinese firms hold stakes in Belgian, Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian ports, as well as European energy and telecommunications infrastructure. In Australia, the Port of Darwin was leased for 99 years in 2015 to China's Landbridge Group, with the Australian government resisting pressure to cancel the deal. The State Grid Corporation of China and its subsidiaries, meanwhile, hold large stakes in Australia's electricity and gas infrastructure, raising national security concerns due to its close ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies. Furthermore, China's control over Australian agricultural land has granted it valuable water rights. The geopolitical implications of these foreign investments in infrastructure are undeniable, with national security concerns forcing China to sell its stake in the U.S. Port of Long Beach in 2019. Yet such investments are only becoming more common globally. While they may strengthen economic ties between countries, they reduce accountability, risk undermining sovereignty, and disconnect public services from local oversight, sidelining effective public planning in favor of enriching foreign entities. This trend appears likely to continue, requiring more responsible approaches to maintaining a healthy balance between the necessity for infrastructure investment and public needs. Shorter contracts, profit-sharing models, and performance-based agreements could help countries and companies showcase their development models and expertise—potentially even at lower costs than local providers. However, profit maximization remains the driving force, particularly when financial entities dominate the field. About the author: John P.

How We Distribute Power Will Influence Our Future – Analysis	As we head into a future shaped by climate change, we must find ways to stabilize societies and reduce conflict. Solutions may lie in the archaeological record. Power in human societies is often viewed as hierarchical, meaning that it's tiered and ranked. This view doesn't fully capture the complexity of how power is managed in different cultures. Some societies are not strictly hierarchical but heterarchical, where power is distributed among various groups or individuals who work together without a clear ranking. There is ample evidence for the existence of heterarchy for a variety of forms of social and political power, including in the archaeological record.1 Historically, the idea that more complex societies are superior to simpler ones has justified racism, colonialism, and domination. However, research conducted since the end of the 20th century increasingly shows that all human societies are fluid and interconnected, with power often shared among different groups. Understanding these power dynamics helps us see how societies change over time. For example, when an elite group loses control of trade, new power structures may emerge, such as guilds or associations. These changes affect the entire society and can lead to more distributed power and democratic institutions. The combined study of heterarchy and hierarchy allows us to trace how societies adapt and respond to challenges. It shows that power can shift and evolve into new forms of social organizations that help societies survive and thrive, even if they may face new tensions or conflicts later. A Closer Look At Authority Structures Heterarchies are self-organizing systems in which elements engage and affect one another. In the context of social systems, the relative power of groups can change based on the situation, which often depends on the degree of communication and collaboration among entities with different sources of power. When power is consolidated in a society by merging distinct entities (for example, religious, political, or economic) into a single, tightly controlled system (hyper-hierarchy or hypercoherence), there is less flexibility in dealing with surprise.2 The term polity is preferred to include the gamut of political organizations. Keep in mind that no polities are entirely hierarchical or heterarchical but instead are diverse and have changing packages of governance. For example, some organizations (armies, police, and firefighters) are necessarily quite hierarchical to clarify chains of command but can serve a polity in which all citizens have free access to health care. Hierarchical Polities Administrators in strong hierarchies (authoritarian states, oligarchies, and hyper-hierarchies) have several advantages. Due to a clear decision-making chain, they respond well to fast-developing crises (such as a military attack or insurrection). Because the rules and responsibilities are familiar, political interactions among decision-makers are fewer and more formalized, and political maintenance of the system is low. Administrative hierarchies are equipped with powerful security forces that can successfully defend the state perimeter and suppress internal dissent. Polities that are strongly hierarchical are at a disadvantage, however, because data-gathering techniques, tied to the pyramidal decision-making framework, slow or stop the arrival of important information (especially subversive activity) at the apex of the pyramid. This necessitates the formalization and elaboration of internal security forces. Decisions are not necessarily popular; dissatisfaction is high and there must be considerable investment in coercion or propaganda. This also leads to high security costs. An example of this can be seen in most military dictatorships. In Chile under Augusto Pinochet, for example, the regime held onto power through the systematic suppression of opposition parties and the persecution of dissidents. Heterarchical Polities Administrators in polities with a strong heterarchical organization receive good quality information from many sources within and outside the decision-making lattice. In general, decisions are fair and reflect popular consensus. Decision-makers hear of a variety of solutions to problems. Because heterarchies are more likely to value the contributions of disparate segments of the community (ethnic groups and women, for example), their society is better integrated and the workforce is proud and energized. Heterarchical polities are at a disadvantage because consensus is slow to achieve. Decision-makers must engage with constituents, requiring considerable time, energy, and constant maintenance. The cacophonous voices and choices a decision-maker hears complicate the search for workable solutions. The greater the groups' involvement and trust in the system, the greater the possibility of consensus, but the response time is slower, and long-range planning is more difficult. Trade-offs Heterarchies value spontaneity, flexibility, and a definition of state power that involves balancing diverse elements. Individuals gain status through merit (rather than through inheritance or loyalty). State power should be used to improve citizens' safety and well-being. Hierarchies, by contrast, value rule-based authority, rigid class lines linked to ascribed as well as achieved status and rank, a control definition of state power, and once achieved, the status quo. State democracies exhibit characteristics of both, which explains in part why they are more stable than authoritarian states. Key Issues for Future Research In all societies, the power of various individuals and factions fluctuates relative to changing circumstances. Today, as resources worldwide are being depleted and environmental conditions deteriorate, new ways to stabilize societies and reduce conflict must be found. One of the most important conditions for reducing conflict is to ensure inclusive and equitable conditions for everyone, particularly as regards food and water security, personal and group safety, and a satisfying quality of life. In human societies, heterarchy is a corrective to power theories that conflate hierarchy with (civil) order, thereby creating a conundrum: will you submit and be safe or resist at your peril? To reenvision an equitable future for humankind, there must be a means to conceptualize and evaluate shifts between exclusive and inclusive power relations in diverse spatial and temporal scales and contexts. There must also be a way to assess the implications of each type of relationship in terms of how beneficial it is to society and how suitable it is for the future. Created in the process of building nation-states around the globe, analytic tools that measure efficiency illuminate only hierarchical political, economic, and social forms and ignore the stabilizing power of heterarchical forms; in this way, hyper-hierarchical and other inherently unstable forms of wealth distribution and political power accumulate. The controlling model of hierarchy-as-order, ubiquitous and all but invisible, exacerbates growing tensions. Bioarchaeology as a Window to Political Relationships Public policies, systems of exchange, subsistence strategies, and social roles structure how people obtain resources and how they experience the result of toil and violence. Bioarchaeology (the scientific study of biological remains from archaeological sites) and genomics have become invaluable to the study of early political relationships. It is now possible to reconstruct many aspects of an individual's life by extracting DNA and evaluating trauma in human remains. In addition to much more reliable identification of sex and age at death, we can now know the region where a person was born, if they traveled widely or emigrated to another region, and we can find clues to what they ate, the kind of work they did, and how they were treated. Together these pieces of information can form a picture of life as lived, marking stressful and tranquil periods that the person and/or the group survived. These new tools produce reliable determinations of historic risk and vulnerability across various scales, from the individual level to large populations. While community-wide governance in smaller-sized groups is no surprise, this was also seen in cooperative states, regions, and urban agglomerations (Callejón de Huaylas/Requay, central Thailand, Mimbres, Tiawanaku, and Marroquíes) and even empires (Xianbei and Genghis Khan's Mongols) that were collaboratively organized.3 Future Thinking This is important information for the human future: the old paradigm that asserted competition and conflict to be the primary motors of civilization can now be reconsidered. In the course of human history, societies engaged in cooperative activities that advanced their well-being, and they also fell into conflict or under the rule of tyrants. If we begin with the premise that the tension between competition and cooperation exists in all human societies, it then behooves us to explore the ways rules and norms permit or deny each other, and how both interact with history and changing conditions to forge institutions.4 The political climates of the past demonstrate that human accomplishment is not on a rising staircase culminating in the state; instead, we find a long history of diverse experiments and their results, to which we now have access. In the contemporary world, we face an important question: How can the equity and effectiveness of coalitions, federations, leagues, unions, and communities in societies of all sizes help us construct and strengthen societies of the future?

When The Marketplace Of Ideas Goes Broke – OpEd	By David Volodzko Advocates of free speech champion it because they believe in the marketplace of ideas. The notion is that open discourse allows all perspectives to be heard and tested. When ideas are challenged, we cut through the clutter of bad thinking with the benefit of arguments sharpened by other minds. At least, that’s what the brochure says. But what happens when media bias, political propaganda, bot armies, troll farms, and deep fakes become so sophisticated that we can no longer trust our own eyes? What happens when the marketplace of ideas goes broke? When sunlight no longer disinfects? The easy solution is to censor the harmful things you don’t want to hear. But this raises two problems. First, whom do you entrust with such immense power? Who gets to determine the truth? Second, censorship doesn’t actually eliminate bad ideas but rather drives them underground—now with the dissident’s badge of respectability. The moment people are censored, we begin to wonder if they’re onto something. But if we feel that all views have been given due consideration, we’re more likely to trust the truth as it unfolds. Even when we agree, some truths must be tested and sharpened against the whetstone of rebuttal. In Areopagitica, John Milton argues that censorship prevents us from stress-testing bad ideas. If we’re worried about harmful lies, we need not restrict speech, he says, because if we simply let people talk freely, the truth will out. Over 150 years later, Thomas Jefferson echoed this sentiment in his first inaugural address, saying, 'Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.' But even if truth does not prevail, John Stuart Mill later argued, we still hone our critical faculties by engaging each other. In other words, you benefit by playing chess even when you lose. This tradition of thought was finally crystalized with the marketplace metaphor, first used by the Supreme Court in the 1919 case Abrams v. United States, in which the Court upheld the conviction of five Russian immigrants for handing out leaflets opposing US involvement in World War I. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., wrote, 'The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.' This turn of phrase was later rendered in its modern form by Justice William O. Douglas, who wrote in United States v. Rumely of a publisher who 'bids for the minds of men in the marketplace of ideas.' Recently on X, the political commentator Richard Hanania shared a list of the top podcasts in the United States—Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and the 'Hawk Tuah' girl Haliey Welch. Hanania wrote, 'If you’re a smart person who believes in free speech, you need to have your eyes completely open as to the likely winners in a free marketplace of ideas. The next project for liberals is what to do about the fact that humans are this stupid.' Claire Lehmann, founder of Quillette magazine, replied, 'It’s not our job to police the entertainment of plebs. But it is our responsibility to build institutions which maintain high standards—& keep the riffraff out.' They’re both onto something. Hanania is correct that in a truly open marketplace of ideas, many awful propositions will be put forward. Recently, for instance, we saw claims that Hurricane Milton was created by Jews, or that it was geo-engineered to target red states. But Lehmann is correct that we shouldn’t micromanage art in order to engineer the souls of citizens. Any history book on communism provides a ready education on where that winding path inevitably leads. So where does this leave us? One problem is that our institutions are crumbling. As I have argued elsewhere, our universities and news outlets, two of the most important sources of education, have been subverted by Marxist ideology. To Hanania’s point, what can we do about the fact that given enough rope, Americans may well hang themselves? The answer is staring us in the face. As philosopher John Dewey put it, 'The only solution to the ills of democracy … is more democracy.' But you may be wondering, what sense does that make if you’re saying the system we have isn’t working? How will doubling down solve anything? It won’t. There will always be a rattling noise built into the machinery—some of it born of ignorance, some of folly, and some of outright malice. Ours is not a perfect union, nor will it ever be. The misguided notion that we can engineer perfection is not only wrong but evil, for in order to rebuild the human soul, first, you must break it. But this does not mean we cannot strive for perfection. Such was the message our Founding Fathers left us in the preamble to the Constitution when they wrote of creating 'a more perfect union.' Better than before, yet never flawless. We must set legal boundaries, and within those boundaries, allow the kids to play. There will be bruises. There will be bullies. But we want our kids to learn resilience by handling their own problems—because if you coddle them, you will protect them from harm here and now, but create a brittle constitution that’s ultimately more susceptible to damage. To paraphrase Winston Churchill’s famous line on democracy, the marketplace of ideas may be the worst arena for discerning truth, except for all the others.

German ‘Democracy’: The Regime Bans Political Parties It Doesn’t ...	In democracies, parties are supposed to rise and fall at the ballot box. However, in Germany a provision of the postwar constitution allows for political parties to be banned if they are deemed a 'threat to democracy.' This unique constitutional mechanism has been used only twice, first against the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and later against the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. Today, this legal tool is once again at the center of political debate, with growing calls to ban the 'right-wing' Alternative for Germany (AfD). This effort raises profound questions about the nature of democracy, in Germany and everywhere else. Can a party that wins millions of votes in free elections truly be a threat to democracy? Or is the German establishment using constitutional provisions to stifle political opposition under the guise of protecting democratic order? Germany’s History of Party Bans Germany’s constitution, called the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), adopted in 1949, includes Article 21, which allows the Federal Constitutional Court to ban parties that are deemed to 'seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order.' The first case of Article 21’s use came in 1952 with the banning of the Socialist Reich Party (SRP), a successor to the Nazi Party. The SRP openly opposed the legitimacy of the Federal Republic and so the court ruled that the party posed a direct threat to the constitutional order and ordered its dissolution. A few years later, in 1956, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) faced the same fate. Although it did not advocate violent overthrow, it was seen as fundamentally opposed to the principles of liberal democracy and too closely aligned with Soviet communism. The court again ruled in favor of a ban, cementing the idea that political extremism of any kind had no place in postwar Germany. Since then, there have been only two serious attempts to ban parties, both against the National Democratic Party (NPD), in 2003 and 2017. The first attempt failed due to procedural errors, and the second was dismissed on the grounds that the party was too small and insignificant to pose a real threat. The AfD and the New Debate on Party Bans Now, in 2024 calls to use this extraordinary legal measure against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) have gained momentum. The AfD, founded in 2013 as a Euroskeptic party, has since shifted to a more nationalist and populist platform. It has gained substantial electoral support, particularly in eastern Germany, and regularly polls above 20% nationwide. Its rise has deeply unsettled Germany’s political establishment, which views it as a threat not only to domestic politics but also to the European Union. The push to ban the AfD has been some time in coming. In 2021, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), classified the AfD as a 'potential extremist threat' and placed it under surveillance. A recent ruling by a German high court in May 2024 upheld this classification, granting security services the continued right to monitor the party’s activities. In January 2024, the Bundestag debated the possibility of formally requesting that the Constitutional Court rule on an AfD ban. This motion, initiated by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz and backed by 124 MPs from various parties, sought to examine whether the AfD’s platform and rhetoric violate the Basic Law. The timing was striking, coming just a day after the CDU, under Friedrich Merz, had controversially cooperated with the AfD on an immigration vote. This moment revealed deep fractures within Germany’s political right, as well as the establishment’s increasing willingness to consider extreme measures against its nationalist challenger. The AfD is not a fringe group; it has won millions of votes in free and fair elections. In a functioning democracy, unpopular or even radical parties are meant to be countered at the ballot box, not through judicial fiat. Proponents of a ban argue that the AfD’s rhetoric and policies, particularly its hardline stance on immigration, opposition to EU integration, and alleged ties to extremist groups, make it an existential threat to Germany’s democratic order. Critics, however, point out that similar nationalist parties exist elsewhere in Europe, such as Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France or Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (currently in power in Rome), yet they operate within the democratic framework without being outlawed. Furthermore, banning the AfD would not eliminate the sentiments that fueled its rise. If anything, it could further radicalize its supporters, reinforcing a narrative of elite suppression and deepening divisions within German society. The EU and the Bigger Picture The movement to ban the AfD cannot be separated from the broader European context. The party has positioned itself as a fierce critic of the European Union, advocating for Germany to reclaim national sovereignty and even leave the euro. This places it in direct opposition to the pro-EU consensus that dominates German elites in politics. From Brussels’ perspective, the AfD’s rise represents a serious challenge. Germany is the economic and political backbone of the EU, and a nationalist turn in Berlin could threaten the bloc’s cohesion. The EU has already clashed with nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland; a strong AfD presence in Germany would take these tensions to a new level. For this reason, many in the German establishment, as well as in European institutions, likely see banning the AfD as a preemptive strike against a growing anti-EU movement. Yet, resorting to legal mechanisms to suppress dissent only raises more concerns about the health of democracy in Europe. We will all be watching the elections in Germany later this month with great interest to see whether the AfD continues its rise.

Egg Prices And The Cause Of Harris’ Defeat – OpEd	Since everyone else has given their two cents on the cause of Harris’ defeat, I guess I will weigh in with my two cents. This comes with the warning; I am an economist, so everything looks like a nail to me. First, there is one point that should be front and center in every discussion of the election results. Harris won overwhelmingly among more informed voters who follow the news closely. She got clobbered among less informed voters, people who, by their self-description, say they follow the news little or not at all. This is important because it is not plausible that a big factor in Harris defeat could have been positions she took long ago, like when she was running for president in 2019. Whether those positions helped her or hurt her, the fact is that Harris almost certainly won by a large margin by people who were aware of her 2019 presidential campaign. Rather, insofar as issues mattered in a very close election (Trump’s popular vote margin was less than Hilary Clinton’s in 2016), it had to be issues that the least informed voters could be aware of. This is where the price of eggs, or more generally the cost of living comes in. The cost of living did rise rapidly under the Biden-Harris administration. We know this was almost entirely due to the pandemic, since almost every other country had similar inflation. It isn’t plausible to argue that France, Germany, and Australia all had high inflation because of Biden’s recovery package. But that is not what the public saw or heard. The public heard Donald Trump endlessly harping on high grocery prices and that he would bring them down. The media (I mean the NYT and CNN, not Fox and OANN) largely went along with this line, rarely pointing out that it was pandemic inflation, as opposed to Biden inflation. We were told the public blames Biden for inflation not the pandemic. This really meant that it was the media that blamed Biden.They didn’t report on inflation from the pandemic as being 'pandemic inflation' in the same way they felt the need to always refer to the withdrawal from Afghanistan as the 'disastrous withdrawal' from Afghanistan. In effect, since Trump and the Republicans’ charges went largely unanswered, and even reinforced by the media, the vast majority of the public believed them. Biden certainly deserves much blame on this account since his physical and mental state left him unprepared to make the aggressive defense of his policies that was needed. I will also add a point that should be obvious but has confused many of our elite pundits. It’s true that the people who voted for Trump in large numbers do not follow the major media outlets, but this does not mean their views were not affected by what the NYT, NPR, and the rest report. Contrary to what these pundits seem to believe, people do not live in hermetically sealed worlds. Even if people get their news from TikTok influencers or what their friend rants about over a beer, it’s likely that their sources views were in some ways affected by what appears in the major media outlets. If these outlets were regularly reporting on 'pandemic inflation' and highlighting the many successes of the Biden administration (half-century lows in unemployment, record rates of new business formation, fastest real wage growth at the bottom since the 60s), some of this would have percolated through to the least informed voters. Instead, they were invariably hyping the negative. For example, last summer the New York Times told readers about a 'two-tiered' economy highlighting a low-wage worker whose pay had not kept pace with prices, even as the piece itself acknowledged this person was atypical. The pay of most low-wage workers had substantially outpaced prices. The NYT also told readers that recent college grads couldn’t find jobs. This was at a time when the unemployment rate for recent grads was near a 20-year low. And the NYT, CNN, and the rest repeatedly highlighted the claim that young people were giving up on ever being able to own a home. They were doing this even when homeownership rates among the young were above their pre-pandemic peak. My argument is that this bad news about the economy became part of the message that millions of least informed voters had in their heads when they cast their votes in November. To be clear, I don’t mean this was the only factor. Many of these people heard Trump’s rants about DEI, and they noticed that the Democratic candidate was a Black woman. That surely mattered. I’m sure the devastation in Gaza also bothered many voters and likely discouraged many young people from voting. But if we’re looking for a single factor that had a large impact of many low-informed voters, I would argue that inflation topped the list. Again, I would point to Trump’s fixation on grocery prices. I am not one to defer to Trump’s genius, but he does have a successful political track record. If he felt it was important to talk about grocery prices, it is reasonable to believe that he had good polling data indicating that this would resonate with voters. I’ll also add as an aside my Twitter experience. I would frequently post notes on Elon’s site about good economic news, such as low unemployment, rising real wages, or slowing inflation. These posts would invariably provoke a rash of responses about how everyone had to work three jobs and still couldn’t pay for their rent or groceries. After the election, the starving masses disappeared from Twitter. To be clear, I know tens of millions of people are really struggling, so I am not mocking them at all. The point is just that they were not on Twitter in 2019, and they are not there now. Obviously, someone working with Musk felt it was politically useful to have a bot army constantly trash the economy on his site. Of course, Trump and Musk can be wrong about what matters to voters, but I would take their insights seriously. They both felt that inflation was a very big deal. I think they were right. Lessons for the Battle to Save Democracy Trump is engaged in an unprecedented attack on our democracy, ignoring all sorts of laws and the Constitution itself. I would never tell people not to confront this head on in every way we can. This is absolutely necessary, but I would also talk about the price of eggs. Trump promised people that he would lower the price of groceries beginning on day one. While we know he has been busy making plans to take over Canada, Greenland, and Gaza, and sending Elon into our personal banking and medical records, we haven’t heard much about his plans to lower prices. Of course, Trump has no such plans. The claim that he would bring down prices was always a lie. And not only is he not bringing down prices, the cost of some items, such as coffee and eggs, is going through the roof. This seems a great point to drive home. There may be many people who don’t know about the Constitutional issues or take seriously Trump’s plans for his resort in Gaza, but they do see skyrocketing egg prices at the supermarket and the egg surcharge they pay at Waffle House. And, for what it’s worth, Elon Musk seems to agree with my political assessment. My posts on Twitter in the last couple of months had been getting very little engagement, however my posts on egg prices have led to a flock of outraged responses. Obviously, the site has some sort of algorithm designed to trigger responses to this sort of complaint about Trump. I will add that I know the criticism is not entirely fair. The jump in egg prices was due to an outbreak of Avian flu that occurred before Trump took office, although how he deals with the outbreak going forward is on him. But this is very similar to the story of the pandemic and Biden. The media kept telling us that people don’t blame the pandemic for inflation, they blame Biden. If Biden can be nailed for inflation caused by the pandemic, we should be able to nail Trump for soaring egg prices caused by Avian flu. After all, people don’t see Avian flu, they see high egg prices. Again, we have to hit Trump head on for his law-breaking and its consequences. But for my money, I’m listening to what Elon Musk is telling us. I’m going to talk about egg prices.

President Trump Provides Reason for Hope The Ukraine War May End ...	The change in tone is night and day from the Joe Biden administration to the Donald Trump administration. Biden refused to talk with Russia President Vladimir. At the same time, Biden escalated US efforts against Russia, including in the Ukraine War. Trump, in contrast, ran for president proclaiming his desire to end the Ukraine War promptly and Wednesday morning posted at Truth Social a recounting of a conversation he had just completed with Putin. That post by Trump is bursting with optimism about negotiating to soon end the war, as well as with kind comments regarding Putin and Russia. Here is Trump’s statement in his Truth Social post: 'I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects. We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering, that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, 'COMMON SENSE.' We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now. I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful. Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost! I want to thank President Putin for his time and effort with respect to this call, and for the release, yesterday, of Marc Fogel, a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House. I believe this effort will lead to a successful conclusion, hopefully soon!' Wow. What a refreshing message. Let’s hope this war is ended quickly and peace between Russia and the US ensues. Putin seems amenable to this, having declared on day one of Trump’s presidency his desire to enter into dialog with Trump with objectives including ending the war and bringing about a peaceful relationship between Russia and the US. Trump is on a deadline. If this war keeps dragging on with US support, it will increasingly become understood as Trump’s war as well as Biden’s war. Even if he is then able to help bring the war to an end, Trump will be remembered in this instance as a warmaker instead of the peacemaker he presented himself as in his campaign.

Germany: Ukraine War, Impact Of Rearmament, Economic Woes Loom Ov...	By Michael von der Schulenburg The war in Ukraine and its consequences will have a long-lasting negative impact on the political, security, economic and social future of Germany. It is the biggest war on European soil since the Second World War; a war which has brought us dangerously close to a nuclear catastrophe in recent months. For the West, this war has now been lost; Ukraine is its blood sacrifice and EU countries, above all Germany, are the losers. The main German parties of SPD, CDU/CSU, the Greens and FDP, as well as the established German media, bear a heavy blame for this. However, questions about their responsibilities in this war have been mysteriously muted during the ongoing German election campaign. Similarly, the German government’s huge rearmament efforts and its attempts to make Germany ‘fit for war’ are barely discussed. There is no word about the dangers of deploying powerful US missile systems on German soil. The election posters of the established parties say nothing about any of it. The mainstream media are silent about the disastrous military and political situation in Ukraine and remain equally mute about the fundamental shift in US policy on Ukraine since Donald Trump became US President. It is as if there is a deliberate effort to keep German voters in the dark about these highly controversial issues; issues that could greatly impact their and their children’s future ability to live in peace. Sliding into a German decline All of this happens at a time when the war in Ukraine has reached its final and decisive —and probably also its bloodiest—phase. Militarily, the Ukrainian army is likely on the verge of collapse, and it is to be feared that this could result in a political collapse of the country too. For three years, Germany has fueled this war as the second largest supplier of weapons. And still, the main German parties continue their rigid war policies and pretend to believe in a victory over Russia. Apart from an inconclusive telephone conversation by the German Chancellor with Putin, they have made no efforts to find a negotiated solution. Germany will now have to pay a high price for its pro-war, no-negotiation strategies . Now, neither the EU nor Germany, but an American and a Russian president will negotiate a peace settlement to end the war in Ukraine. The negotiations have already begun, and Trump and Putin are expected to meet in person in just a few weeks. This has become possible because of a significant shift change in US foreign policy priorities under President Trump. Unlike his predecessor Biden, Trump no longer sees Ukraine a geopolitical asset for the USA—his attention appears to have moved closer to home: to Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. He will therefore seek a quick solution to the Ukraine war and be prepared to accommodate most Russian interests, while largely ignoring Ukraine’s. We must have no illusions—neither of these two presidents will have any sympathy for Zelensky, the EU, and especially not for Germany. Why should they? Zelensky is considered a spent force, while German and EU policy continues to be characterized by a refusal to face the reality of a lost war. And haven’t German political elites treated Putin and Trump with a moral arrogance that is so typical for them? So, neither Germany nor the EU will have a say in these negotiations. This is bad for the EU and bad for Germany—this war is taking place on European soil, and the decisions taken by Trump and Putin will have serious consequences for the future of both Germany and Europe. One such consequence will be that the EU, and above all Germany, will have to pay for the enormous costs of rebuilding Ukraine and keeping a faltering Ukrainian government afloat. If Ursula von der Leyen were to succeed in her ill-advised desire of fast-tracking Ukraine’s membership into the EU, the total price tag could easily add up to a trillion euros. Whether such astronomical sums would help a collapsing and depopulating Ukraine remains questionable. But it would wreck Germany’s already weakened economy and could put the entire EU project into jeopardy. In addition, Germany would continue to be blocked from access to the raw materials and markets in the East and Asia that would be so important for the recovery of its economy. After a US-Russian peace agreement, Russia will control the entire border from the Barents Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. And the government would not even be in a position to cancel the EU’s self-crippling economic sanctions. Germany’s road to further economic decline with all its political consequences appears unstoppable. Escaping into ‘fit for war’ fantasies With defeat in the war in Ukraine looming, the SPD, CDU/CSU, Greens, and FDP, supported by much of the German media, seem to prefer to hide from tough realities and to escape into the fantasy that Putin is going to attack NATO. If Germany does not massively and quickly upgrade its defences, they say, he will soon be marching through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Such claims, bordering on madness, are used to distract from a lost war and to justify spending hundreds of billions of euros on a German rearmament that could make Germany, once again, the largest military power in Europe—in conventional forces even larger than Russia. All this will inevitably be financed largely through a reduction in social services. To justify all of this, the German political parties cling to their Russophobia and ideological-moralistic ‘narratives’ of needing to defend democracy and freedom. But those justifications now begin to wear thin. While German politicians and their supporters in the media continue mantra-like to blame Putin for an 'unprovoked war of aggression', Trump is blaming his predecessor Biden for the war and accusing Zelensky of having provoked the Russian attack. And while the German narrative remains that Putin is driven by imperialistic desires, Trump is saying what we have always known: it was the push for NATO expansion into Ukraine, driven by the US neocons and continued by Biden, that led to this war. Trump has gone even further and declared that he can ‘even understand Putin’. In Germany, one would probably lose one’s job for saying that! The new US government does not share our fantasies about an impending Russian war against NATO. As early as last year, the seven US intelligence services stated in a joint report that a Russian attack on a NATO country could be ruled out with a high probability. What now? German mainstream politicians, most being transatlantic loyalists to the core, have lost their lord and master, a troubling development so shortly before the federal election. That is why the lost war in Ukraine, along with massive Germn rearmament efforts, are kept out of the national election campaign. With all the money those established parties have, this will help to secure the reelection of a Merz and Kiesewetter, a Scholz and Pistorius, a Habeck and a Baerbock or even a Lindner and a Strack-Zimmerman; all politicians who maintain an uncompromising pro-war posture towards Russia and who are taking an increasingly aggressive attitude towards China. According to the opinion polls, this is what is going to happen. Germany is therefore likely to be governed once more by politicians who supported a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people and made Germany one of its main losers. In other words, Germany will continue to have a government unable to adjust to a changing world around it. It will now also be increasingly at odds with the new US government. It will be unable to mend fences with Russia and China or build relations with the increasingly important association of BRICS countries. Hence, Germany is likely to slide further into global isolation—a terrible prospect for a nation that depends on international trade for its economic well-being. At the same time, the mainstream media’s uncritical support for the established parties drives disappointed voters into the arms of the right-wing AfD. This could divide German society even further and make Germany’s future even more unpredictable. Apart from concerns about its radical nationalist wing, the AfD wants to outdo the other parties by demanding Germany to commit a staggering 5% of GDP to rearmament; something which could only be financed by a neoliberal economic policy, further gigantic debts, and massive social cuts. And their flirtation with American oligarchs will certainly do no good either. The price for the ideological-moralistic and pro-war policies of German politicians from Merz to Weidel and from Scholz to Habeck, will be paid above all by pensioners and low-income earners, workers and employees, families and children, as well as small and medium-sized industries. The big companies and the rich are simply moving their businesses abroad; the USA has already created the necessary incentives for them. German policies need to break with the past If we want to save what can still be saved, Germany needs a definitive turnaround in all of areas of its policy. It must find a way back to a peace policy and finally formulate its own interests and act accordingly. To do this, we must get along with our eastern neighbors again; we must build a trusting relationship with Russia and China and engage in trade with them. For the EU member states, the BRICS countries are increasingly important partners not only structurally and economically, but also politically. The opportunity is there to create a new geopolitical constellation through which these two communities of states could work towards a more peaceful, multipolar world order based on the UN Charter and without military alliances. At the same time, we must maintain internal peace by making social justice the most important goal of our policies. Rearmament and the arms trade, military interventions, or the deployment of US medium-range missiles on German soil will not help at all. We need a radical new beginning urgently. To do that, we need politicians who have always stood up for peace and social justice. The federal elections would be an opportunity to make a start on this. We should think very carefully about who we vote for on 23 February.

Russia-Bound Chemicals Seized By Spain Critical For Kremlin’s Mil...	By Mark Krutov and Sergei Dobrynin (RFE/RL) -- In the fall of 2024, Spanish authorities announced they had uncovered a supply chain to Russia for sanctioned chemicals, including compounds that could be used to make chemical weapons and nerve-agent poisons. EU exports of such chemicals to Russia would be certain to raise alarm bells given the links of Russian security services to nerve-agent attacks on Kremlin enemies, including the late opposition leader Aleksei Navalny. Spanish authorities did not release details about the specific chemicals in the 13,000 tons they seized, or the types of chemical weapons they could help produce. But an RFE/RL investigation found that the haul included a compound that plays a key role in Russia’s war machine.RFE/RL’s Russian Service analyzed a video of the bust released by Spanish police and found that the listed contents of barrels they seized has wide application in Russia’s military industry, including the production of drones, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and batteries for nuclear submarines. The compound in question is a strong chemical solvent called N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, whose abbreviation, NMP, is visible on the labels on some barrels shown in the Spanish police video. Widely used in the petroleum and pharmaceutical industries, NMP was included in the EU list of goods prohibited for sale to Russia in April 2022, six weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine.Global consumption of NMP has also grown due to its use in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries and microcircuits.The labels on the barrels shown in the Spanish police video also indicate the seized NMP was produced by a Chinese chemicals company, and the container number indicates the shipment arrived in Barcelona three months after departing the Chinese port of Qingdao in June, an analysis of shipping records by RFE/RL’s Russian Service found.Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Chinese-produced NMP has been purchased by a subsidiary of sanctioned Russian state-owned conglomerate Rostec that is a supplier to a unit of Russia’s Kurchatov Institute, a sanctioned nuclear-weapons developer, involved in drone production.It is unclear whether the cargo shown in the video is the only shipment that Spanish police and customs officers detained during their two-year investigation into illicit trafficking of dual-use goods. Spanish authorities have not released the names of the individuals or companies suspected in the case, and Spanish police did not respond to RFE/RL’s inquiry about what substance or substances were seized in the October raid in the port of Barcelona. A ‘Critical’ Chemical Russia does not produce its own NMP, leaving it reliant on imports of a compound included in the country’s list of critical products for its chemicals sector.Prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there were cases of Russia’s military-industrial complex purchasing Western-produced NMP. For example, Russian procurement records show that the sanctioned Russian company Uralelementin 2018 purchased 1.5 tons of German-made NMP from another Russian firm, Uraltekhimport. Uralelement, which describes itself as 'a strategic enterprise of the military-industrial complex,' is part of the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Tactical Missiles Corporation, which was also hit with Western sanctions in 2022.In July 2021, Deputy Defense Minister Aleksei Krivoruchko visited the Uralelement plant. A message on the company’s website states that Krivoruchko 'signed important decisions related to the production of special-purpose batteries by Uralelement for Military Unit 40056.' Open-source records show that military unit 40056 is part of what is now the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (GUGI). It was under the auspices of the GUGI that a secretive surveillance submarine known informally as the Losharik suffered a catastrophic accident in 2019 while conducting tests in the Barents Sea. A short circuit in the battery compartment was later blamed for the accident.Another buyer of NMP before Russia’s all-out war against Ukraine was the Arzamas Research and Production Enterprise Temp-Avia, also part of the Tactical Missiles Corporation, which produces electronics for Russian military aircraft and drone missile systems, government procurement data shows.In the spring of 2023, Temp Avia’s director said that 'the workload of production in connection with' Russia’s war on Ukraine 'has increased multiple times.'Still another buyer of NMP was the Central Design and Technology Bureau of Polymer Materials with Pilot Production, which supplied materials to the Votkinsk Plant, a manufacturer of Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles.Around half of the 29 publicly available government purchases of NMP prior to 2022 that RFE/RL’s Russian Service reviewed are from state-owned companies linked to the military-industrial complex.Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chinese-made NMP has also been purchased by the Petrov Institute of Plastics, a Rostec subsidiary. Corporate records show that one of the institute’s key customers is VIAM, the aviation-materials unit of the Kurchatov Institute, a nuclear-weapons developer headed by close Putin associate Mikhail Kovalchuk. At a roundtable last year, a senior VIAM scientist discussed the 'development of state unmanned aircraft for special purposes, taking into account air defense systems' and spoke 'about the experience in the development of materials and additive technologies for the production of structures of unmanned aircraft systems.' Tracking The Shipment Analyzing the labels on the barrels shown in the Spanish police video, RFE/RL’s Russian Service identified the manufacturer of the seized NMP as the Chinese company BYN Electronic Material, whose product range includes the solvent. The video also shows the container’s number, YMLU3377990, which indicates it is owned by the Chinese shipping company YangMing Marine Transport Corp. The company’s website reveals the route of the seized shipment: It left the Chinese port of Qingdao on June 19 and arrived in Singapore on July 10. On July 28, it left for Barcelona, where it arrived on September 21 -- three weeks before Spanish police announced the seizure. Records reviewed by RFE/RL’s Russian Service show that NMP produced by BYN was purchased in 2023 by the Russian company Aventel RUS. Prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Aventel RUS sought to become a supplier of NMP to the Sverdlov Plant, a Russian explosives manufacturer under U.S. sanctions, but was unsuccessful in its bid. ‘Operation Test Tube’ The Spanish investigation, conducted with assistance from the European Anti-Fraud Office, began in 2022 under the code name Operation Probirka, the Russian word for 'test tube.' Spanish police say they zeroed in on a Spanish company 'managed by citizens of Russian origin' who developed a complex network to supply 'illegal chemical products to Russia.' The Spanish firm had a subsidiary in Moscow that was the ultimate recipient of the chemicals, though their final destination was obscured by shell companies in third countries, including Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, that served as intermediaries, Spanish police allege.They said shipments were diverted to Russia en route by land to these fictitious recipients, a scheme that has been used to funnel sanctioned dual-use electronics to Russia through Central Asia in circumvention of U.S. and EU efforts to choke off global supply chains for Russia’s military. Spanish police, who said in their October announcement of the raid that their case was ongoing, did not respond to a request for comment about the current status of the investigation.

Pashinyan Promotes New Ideology To Guide Armenia’s Geopolitical T...	(Eurasianet) -- Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is pushing for an ideological transformation to establish what he calls 'real Armenia.' To succeed, he will have to win a three-front fight to overcome opposition from Azerbaijan, Russia and a powerful bloc of domestic critics. Having returned from a foreign tour that took him to Washington and Paris, Pashinyan answered questions in parliament on February 12 about his 'Real Armenia' vision. The tenets of the ideology are still being fleshed out, he explained. But the broad outline is the promotion of a Westernized, democratized nation that has drawn a line on the past and is firmly fixed on forging a prosperous future. The prime minister stated that a written platform for the Real Armenia concept would be finalized and published soon. Once published, he added, the government would launch an effort to sell the vision to the electorate. 'From that point,' Pashinyan stated, referring to publication of the platform, 'we must begin the formation and formulation of a consensus around the concept of 'real Armenia.'' Pashinyan told MPs that he has received assurances of support from US and French officials for what he is trying to accomplish, describing an impromptu meeting with US Vice President JD Vance in Washington in early February as 'very important and very productive.' Parliament took immediate action on the real Armenia vision February 12, approving in its first reading a bill authorizing the government to seek European Union membership, a process that could take decades to accomplish. The prime minister’s efforts to achieve an identity makeover for Armenia is rooted in the country’s decisive defeat to Azerbaijan in the Second Karabakh War in late 2023. The military disaster prompted the collapse of the country’s traditional strategic partnership with Russia, which many Armenians believe failed to fulfill security commitments to defend Armenian sovereignty. Since then, Pashinyan has sought to strengthen ties to US and European political, economic and security institutions, while striving to conclude a peace deal with Azerbaijan. Peace, Pashinyan holds, is a prerequisite for the formation of a prosperous domestic economy. The real Armenia concept seeks to tie all its policy goals together. Pashinyan may have the backing of the United States and France, as well as many MPs, but how far he gets in pursuit of the real Armenia project is uncertain given the scope of opposition he faces from three directions. Russia, Armenia’s main trade partner at present, is firmly opposed to the country’s efforts to move into the Western geopolitical camp, especially its pursuit of EU accession. 'We consider the West's line in the South Caucasus to be absolutely destructive, because it is not aimed at stabilizing the situation in this strategically important region for Russia, but at trying to ‘contribute’ to inflicting a strategic defeat on us from this flank,' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview published February 10 by the Russian outlet Izvestia. Armenia remains a member of the Russia-dominated trade group, the Eurasian Economic Union, giving the Kremlin economic leverage over Yerevan. Following the Armenian parliament’s EU accession vote, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded by noting that Russian officials 'proceed from the fact that Armenia continues to receive dividends from membership in the EAEU in the processes of Eurasian economic integration, and these dividends are more than obvious.' Elsewhere, the Armenian-Azerbaijani peace process that had until recently seemed tantalizingly close to reaching the finish line, now is moving in the wrong direction. Both sides have traded accusations of late that the other intends to restart armed conflict. And on February 13, Baku filed a new lawsuit in the International Court of Arbitration in the Hague, seeking to hold Armenia responsible for causing environmental damage in Karabakh. The issue of handling international court cases involving Armenia and Azerbaijan has been one of the points holding up finalization of a peace treaty. Perhaps the most determined opposition to the real Armenia vision is coming from critics within Armenia and among Diaspora groups. A major source of discontent within these constituencies is Pashinyan’s willingness to recognize Azerbaijan’s lasting sovereignty over Karabakh. 'Pashinyan is trying to deprive Armenians of the right to even dream of restoring 'historic Armenia' someday in the future,' stated a commentary published in late January by the Armenian Weekly, which is operated by Armenian Revolutionary Federation. 'He naively thinks that by announcing that Armenia does not have any territorial demands against its neighboring countries, he will convince Azerbaijan to sign a meaningless peace treaty with Armenia.' Pashinyan seems clear-eyed about the daunting obstacles standing in his way. In parliament, he said it will be up to Armenian voters to decide whether the 'real Armenia' blueprint is fully implemented. 'This ideology must be tested in the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2026,' Pashinyan told MPs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PDfWpNJh9WLg	2025-02-13T16:26:23-08:00	
Europe Insists It Must Be Included In Ukraine Peace Talks	By Alexandra Brzozowski and Aurélie Pugnet (EurActiv) -- European defence ministers made clear on Thursday they did not want to be sidelined in Ukraine peace talks as the US is still yet to signal willingness to bring Europe to the table. Since Wednesday evening, Europeans have implored the future of Ukraine should not be decided without Europe or Kyiv, after Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed to 'immediately' hold peace talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy then spoke with Trump shortly after. The move gave the Europeans a glimpse of what the negotiations could look like: a US-Russia deal with no Europeans at the table – despite the fact the war is on their continent, they have contributed vast amounts of military aid to Ukraine, and slapped Moscow with package after package of sanctions. This came just after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth detailed the US lines for the negotiations: any return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is 'unrealistic', Ukraine’s NATO membership is unlikely, and no US troops on the ground. In the weeks prior, European diplomats had voiced concern about a scenario where Trump would be inclined to hold bilateral talks with Putin over Ukrainian and European heads. Between worry, denial and acceptance The first reactions came from a group of European foreign ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, the EU and the UK on Wednesday evening, saying any future peace deal could not be achieved without the involvement of Ukraine and its European partners. They said that they were 'looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies.' 'There will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans,' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told ministers. Germany's Annalena Baerbock and Spain's José Manuel Albares both said that 'no decision on Ukraine can be made without Ukraine' and called for EU unity. 'We believe that America’s strength, together with Ukraine and all our partners, is enough to push Russia to peace,' Zelenskyy also said on X, in a nod to Europe. Europe justifies its inclusion European minds did not settle overnight. Several NATO defence ministers offered further justification for Europe’s inclusion on Thursday morning, just a few minutes before a meeting in Brussels with Hegseth. Europe will be the ones providing security guarantees to the Ukraine, hence there is 'no option to not be at the table' Ruben Brekelmans, Dutch defence minister said. Asked who should represent the Europeans at such talks, he did not provide details. Others suggested Europe should be included on the grounds that their support for Ukraine has been substantial and impactful. 'Europe has to be part of these negotiations... Europe has put sanctions on Russia, Europe is investing in Ukrainian defence and Europe is rebuilding Ukraine with European Union money, with our bilateral aid, etcetera,' Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said. 'For us, it's very natural also that we as European allies are engaged into these discussions. Last year, we provided about 60% to the military support,' Pål Jonson, Sweden’s defence minister said. For the Lithuanians, being included is about military strength. 'It's up to us whether we will be sidelined or whether we will stand up to the expectations and to our actual capacity to fight for Ukraine, to fight for our own freedom,' Dovilė Šakalienė said. Some, such as Canada’s Bill Blair or Luxembourg’s Yuriko Backes, preferred to emphasise only Ukraine’s role at the table, and did not comment on Europe. The British Defence Secretary John Healey said in a brief statement that 'there can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine, and Ukraine's voice must be at the heart of any talks.' Brussels, meanwhile, was quick to assert itself on Wednesday evening. 'Any agreement that excludes Europe won’t work. Europe will not be sidelined,' an EU official told Euractiv. Next stop: Munich The tactics behind Hegseth’s public clarification of the US’s red lines on Ukraine, immediately before Trump announced the opening of negotiations, were called into question by some. 'The positions expressed by the US Secretary of Defense were well expected, but in negotiations with Russia, it's unwise to play your cards too soon,' the EU official said. Nonetheless, the comments set the tone for a flurry of further meetings, with NATO defence ministers meeting for a second day in Brussels on Thursday and the Munich Security Conference starting on Friday. European diplomats told Euractiv they would use the Munich talks to seek out American counterparts in various constellations and try to hammer in their points when it comes to Ukraine. Trump implied that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would meet Zelenskyy in Munich on Friday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PCQ09XT7DuMv	2025-02-13T16:15:47-08:00	
Trump Hosts India’s Leader, Pushes US Defense, Energy Sales	By Anita Powell U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Thursday, where administration officials say he will seek to boost U.S. defense and energy sales and further strengthen Washington’s relationship with the world’s most-populous nation as China flexes its muscles in the region. 'We will aim to build on defense sales to India to ensure they are prioritizing the use of American technology,' said an administration official in a briefing with reporters Thursday morning. As is custom when briefing journalists, the official is not being named. 'The president is also focused on unleashing American energy to the rest of the world and will prioritize India as a key importer of America's natural resources to power their economy,' the official said. 'The two leaders will discuss how we can improve our trade relationship that brings down our bilateral trade deficit and ensure an expanded fair-trade relationship.' When asked directly about New Delhi’s largest concern — of being caught in the wave of reciprocal tariffs Trump has recently imposed as part of an escalating trade war with the world — a second administration official said, 'What you'll see coming out of a meeting today is further momentum towards a solidified, fair — and I emphasize that word ‘fair’ — bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies. And the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025.' That official also touted announcements on 'semiconductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification.' Modi said on X that he was 'looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.' Analysts say China also looms large in these talks, and the White House added that the two leaders would discuss the elevation of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Australia and Japan. 'The sharp deterioration in India-China relations after the 2020 Galwan Valley incident,' in which Indian and Chinese troops clashed over road construction in disputed territory, 'undoubtedly encouraged New Delhi to be more enthusiastic about its strategic partnership with Washington,' said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace. And India-focused analyst Rick Rossow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told VOA about India’s goals. 'As President Trump kind of initiates a trade war against the world, India's got bigger stakes than a lot of countries do in that, and they need to make sure that the relations remain stable,' Rossow said. 'So, they want to be here. They want to be in front. They want to talk about things they can buy from the United States. They want to talk about policies they can resolve and try to make sure that things remain on an even keel, because this relationship, it's important for us. It's vital for India.' VOA’s Paris Huang contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PCEdbDNTlv_q	2025-02-13T16:09:09-08:00	
No Deals Without Us, Zelenskyy Says In Response To Trump-Putin Ca...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reacted sharply to U.S. President Donald Trump's agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin negotiations to end the war with Ukraine, saying he won't accept any deals made without Ukraine's involvement. Trump's call on February 12 is seen as part of the White House's aim to move quickly toward ending the almost 3-year-old war, and 'certainly not a betrayal' of Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on February 13. But news of the 90-minute phone call between the two leaders sent shockwaves across Europe, where leaders bitterly complained of seemingly being cut out of the process. Zelenskyy said Ukraine cannot 'allow everything to go according to Putin’s plan' and cannot accept any agreements made without it. Speaking during a visit to a nuclear power station in western Ukraine, he said he wanted to 'articulate this very clearly to our partners.' Trump said later on February 13 at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia. Trump said again that he believes Putin 'wants peace' and would 'like to see something happen,' but Zelenskyy warned against putting any trust Putin's claims of readiness to end the war. The Ukrainian leader said he wanted the United States to agree a 'plan to stop Putin' before any negotiations. Trump also repeated his criticism that former President Joe Biden had invited the conflict by assuring Ukraine it would eventually join NATO. Trump told reporters that Putin was encouraged to invade Ukraine because he sensed U.S. and NATO weakness after the chaotic withdrawal of allied troops from Afghanistan in 2021. Trump also said Russia’s expulsion from the Group of Eight leading industrialized countries after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 was another key factor in forcing Putin’s hand. Russia's full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, is seen by the majority of nations in the world as an unprovoked and illegal act of aggression designed to grab land and and do away with the Ukrainian state and its democracy. 'I Think They Have To Make Peace' Trump announced his call on February 12 in a post on Truth Social that said he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.' He spoke further about his plans later at the White House, telling reporters: 'I think we’re on the way to getting peace.' In a blow to Ukraine's stated goals to join NATO and push Russia out of all parts of Ukraine it occupies, Hegseth told NATO allies in Brussels on February 12 that it is 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to revert to 2014 and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict. Trump also said giving Ukraine NATO membership would not be 'practical.' The comments are some of the clearest indications from the new Trump administration of how the president intends to fulfill his election campaign promise to swiftly end the war, but some observers said it was a poor strategy to lay the groundwork for negotiations by granting terms favorable to Russia. Oxana Shevel, a professor of political science at Tufts University, told RFE/RL that Ukraine had already reckoned that its hopes of joining NATO would be off the table in a negotiation process to end the war. But she warned that it would be a bigger deal if Putin tried to convince Trump to rollback NATO’s declaration on Ukraine's 'irreversible path' to membership. 'Putin would love to have that,' Shevel said, adding that she could not imagine that would go down well with the European NATO countries. Shevel also said it’s a 'bad negotiating strategy' to allow concessions even before talks begin but said, based on statements thus far, it’s too hard to know what exactly will be at stake. Speaking at NATO headquarters in Brussels on February 13 during a meeting of defense ministers from the alliance's 32 members, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said 'Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks.' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius added: 'For me, it’s clear … that Europe must be involved in the negotiations -- and I think that’s very easy to understand.' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters at a meeting at NATO headquarters on February 13 that any agreement must involve Ukraine and Europe. 'Any deal behind our backs will not work,' she said. Hegseth, who is also attending the meeting, was quick to defend Trump's initiative, saying 'there is a recognition that the whole world and the United States is invested and interested in peace. A negotiated peace.' 'That will require both sides recognizing things they don't want to,' he added. Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula, and its forces have been pushing forward in the eastern Donbas region for months, albeit at a massive cost, while pounding civilian targets nationwide. Hegseth, who is on his first foreign trip since being confirmed late last month, has stressed in recent days that Ukraine should prepare for a negotiated peace settlement and that Europe must provide the 'overwhelming share' of aid to Ukraine. A settlement can be backed up by international troops but, Hegseth said U.S. forces would not be part of any security guarantee in a peace settlement. Key Munich Conference Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is nearing its three-year mark later this month and diplomacy is heating up ahead of the February 14-16 Munich Security Conference, which Zelenskyy and senior U.S. officials plan to attend. In another diplomatic push, Zelenskyy met in Kyiv on February 12 with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss a potential deal on Ukraine's critical minerals and said he hopes the two countries can reach an agreement on the matter at the conference in Munich. Trump has said the United States wants access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals. Bessent presented Zelenskyy with an initial draft agreement and said a deal on the minerals could leave Ukraine with a 'security shield' once the war with Russia is over. Zelenskyy has stressed that strong Western security guarantees for Ukraine with U.S. involvement are crucial to any deal to end the war. Trump said that he expects to meet Putin, probably in Saudi Arabia, saying it would take place 'in the not too distant future.' He added that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would also be involved.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PBdQg8neiB2t	2025-02-13T16:04:06-08:00	
Calls Grow For US To Counter Chinese Control, Influence In Wester...	By Bing X Calls are growing in Washington for action to loosen Beijing’s influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over key infrastructure on the Panama Canal and other port facilities in the Western hemisphere. At a recent meeting of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, Chairman Carlos Jimenez warned that Beijing has 'a strategic position over one of the world’s most important waterways,' referring to the Panama Canal. He said this gives the Chinese Communist Party an opportunity 'to exert influence over commercial shipping, gather intelligence on American and Allied vessel traffic, and potentially restrict the mobility of our Navy in a time of crisis.' Almost half of the leading container ports outside of China have some Chinese ownership or operations, experts told the hearing. Panama has recently announced a government audit of ports owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has threatened Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino with potential American retaliation if his country doesn’t immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. 'While Panama has recently announced an audit of Hutchinson ports, that’s simply not enough,' Jimenez told the hearing. 'We don’t need an audit. We need action.' 'The United States cannot and will not accept the scenario where a foreign adversary, one that openly seeks to undermine our global standing, controls infrastructure critical to us, homeland security, military readiness and economic stability,' he said. He said U.S. allies should distance themselves from China, including from Chinese state-owned enterprises. While Mulino insists that the neutrality regime under the Panama Canal treaty has not been violated, two Panamanian lawyers have filed a lawsuit with the country’s supreme court, arguing that the contract allowing Hutchison, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings, to operate terminals in Balboa, on the Pacific side, and Cristobal on Atlantic side of the Panama Canal is unconstitutional, World Cargo News reported on Feb. 5. Dual-use military and civilian operations Experts told the Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 11 that there are concerns around dual-use military and civilian operations in any port with a Chinese corporate presence, not just in Panama. Chinese companies have established full or partial ownership of port facilities in seven countries in the Western Hemisphere: the Bahamas, Brazil, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru and the United States. China COSCO Shipping Corp. and China Merchants Group -- both state-owned conglomerates owned and controlled by the Chinese government -- hold eight of those investments, with Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison holds seven, according to testimony by Isaac Kardon, Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'China’s presence in U.S. ports presents unquantified but material risks to critical maritime and transportation infrastructure,' Kardon told the meeting. 'The more pressing concerns involve vulnerabilities introduced by Chinese made equipment and software embedded in port systems,' he said. 'Even facilities not owned or operated by Chinese firms, often rely on [Chinese-made] made technologies, for example, ship-to-shore cranes.' 'Under Beijing’s highly acquisitive data governance regime and comparatively high levels of control over [Chinese] firms, these systems enable intelligence collection and surveillance and may cause delay or disruption to the critical operations of us,' Kardon said. But he warned that 'unwinding it recklessly will do more harm than good.' Between 2010 and 2019, Chinese companies plowed US$11 billion into overseas ports and around US$130 billion into subsidies for its shipping companies $130 billion, according to a recent analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations. One distinctive feature, according to written testimony from Ryan C. Berg, Director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is that more than half of China’s ports tend to sit on major shipping lanes and strategic chokepoints. China-backed companies now operate port terminals in at least three locations in Mexico, the Hutchison Ports in the Panama Canal along with a recently opened megaport in Chancay, Peru, Berg said, citing plans for a deepwater port in St. John’s Harbor, Antigua and Barbuda. Almost half of the leading container ports outside of China have some Chinese ownership or operations, and 'Beijing intends to become a 'pier competitor' by setting up a string of dual-use ports that can serve as an extensive international network of infrastructure for People’s Liberation Army vessels,' he wrote. China’s military-civil fusion strategy could also bring commercial espionage and military security risks, including radar and GPS jamming, physical blockades, and even containerized weapon systems, Berg said. Threats to American security Meanwhile, former CIA analyst Matthew Kroenig warned that China’s port investments, including those in Peru and Panama, 'pose a number of threats to U.S. homeland security.' 'China could restrict or block access to ports, threatening American trade and economic wellbeing,' Kroenig testified. 'In the event of a crisis or war, China could hinder the passage of American naval vessels, undermining American war plans.' China could also use deep water ports to host People’s Liberation Army Navy vessels, enabling the projection of military power into the Western Hemisphere, warned, adding that Chinese-operated ports are already used to facilitate the shipment of fentanyl precursors to the United States. Kroenig called on Washington to put pressure on its neighbors to adopt a 'de-risking' strategy toward China, including 'hard decoupling' from China in sensitive areas like critical infrastructure, while providing them with viable alternatives. Berg called for a 'port buyback' scheme financed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and multilateral financial institutions 'to help countries terminate agreements early and entice more transparent operators to bid on concessions.' Cary Davis, President & CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities, also called on the United States to offer alternatives to Chinese investments. 'If we want to counter Chinese influence at ports and secure a safe and prosperous economic future, we must provide a strong, attractive alternative through robust American investment,' he told the Committee. Congress could also offer financial incentives to trusted allies to enable them to purchase cargo-handling equipment not made in China, he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PO6NLuv7Kb5m	2025-02-13T16:01:08-08:00	
Global Powers Must Support Africa In Climate Change Fight – OpEd	Climate change is not just an environmental issue, it is a global crisis with economic, social and security implications. Nowhere is this crisis more evident than in Africa, a continent that contributes a minimal amount to global greenhouse gas emissions yet suffers disproportionately from climate-related disasters. Reports from the World Meteorological Organization and the UN confirm that Africa bears an increasingly heavy burden from climate change, with adaptation costs rising and economic stability at risk. Global powers must recognize that helping Africa combat climate change is not merely an act of goodwill — it is an essential strategy for securing global economic and political stability. Africa’s vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by its limited adaptive capacity and reliance on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture. The continent has witnessed rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns and extreme weather events, including severe droughts, floods and cyclones. According to recent findings, these environmental changes are drastically affecting local ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions. Farmers in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are witnessing dramatic changes in their environment. Many have reported a decline in predictable rainfall, leading to poor harvests, food shortages and economic hardship. Some regions that were once fertile are now experiencing desertification, forcing communities to abandon their traditional agricultural practices. The consequences are dire. Water scarcity, declining fish stocks and land degradation are increasing competition for resources, often leading to conflicts and displacement. The UN estimates that millions of Africans will be forced to migrate due to climate-induced changes, leading to overpopulated cities, heightened social tensions and increased strain on already-fragile economies. According to the World Meteorological Organization, if effective measures are not implemented, more than 100 million people living in extreme poverty in Africa — surviving on less than $1.90 per day — could face severe threats from droughts, floods and extreme heat by 2030. But climate change is not just an environmental issue for Africa, it is also a major economic crisis. Many African economies depend heavily on agriculture, a sector highly susceptible to climate variations. As droughts have become more frequent and unpredictable rainfall has disrupted traditional farming cycles, gross domestic product growth in several African nations has slowed. Reports indicate that Africa’s economic growth, which is forecast to increase from 3.4 percent in 2024 to 4 percent by 2026, is under severe threat from climate change. Persistent droughts and floods are wiping out crops and livestock, devastating smallholder farmers who form the backbone of many African economies. The loss of agricultural productivity reduces food supply, drives up prices and increases hunger and malnutrition. Beyond agriculture, infrastructure damage caused by extreme weather events is imposing massive costs on African governments. Floods are destroying roads, bridges and power grids, while rising temperatures are stressing energy systems. The financial burden of rebuilding after climate disasters diverts critical resources from essential services such as healthcare and education, deepening existing inequalities. In spite of being responsible for only about 3.8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is bearing some of the worst consequences of climate change. This glaring disparity underscores the ethical and practical responsibility of global powers — especially high-emitting countries — to assist Africa in combating climate change. However, this is not just about fairness. The reality is that climate change in Africa has repercussions for the entire world. For example, the continent plays a crucial role in global food security. If agricultural production in Africa collapses due to climate change, food shortages will ripple through international markets, driving up prices and causing instability elsewhere. Moreover, climate-induced migration is a growing concern. As environmental conditions worsen, millions of Africans will be forced to seek refuge in urban centers or even abroad, increasing pressure on neighboring countries and Europe. If left unaddressed, climate-driven displacement could contribute to geopolitical tensions, economic instability and humanitarian crises beyond Africa’s borders. But Africa’s vulnerability to climate change is not solely due to environmental factors, it is also the result of economic limitations. Many African nations lack the financial and technological resources to implement large-scale climate adaptation strategies. In other words, the costs associated with climate adaptation are disproportionately high for African countries. A lack of access to climate financing means that many nations struggle to invest in crucial infrastructure improvements, such as better irrigation systems, renewable energy and disaster preparedness. While developed nations have the resources to buffer against climate shocks, African governments are often forced to divert already-limited funds from essential services to address climate-related damages. As a result, without external financial and technical assistance, Africa’s ability to cope with climate change will remain limited. Climate adaptation must be treated as a global responsibility, with wealthier nations playing a key role in providing funding, technology transfers and capacity-building initiatives. Global powers ought to understand that investing in Africa’s climate resilience is not just about charity — it is an investment in global stability and economic security. Supporting Africa’s transition to renewable energy, for example, will contribute to worldwide emission reduction targets while opening up new markets for green technology investments. In addition, helping African countries build climate resilience can also prevent wider economic crises. When African economies suffer due to climate disasters, the ripple effects extend globally, affecting international trade, commodity markets and financial stability. By fostering economic resilience in Africa, leading powers can help ensure a more stable and prosperous global economy. Furthermore, addressing climate-induced migration at its source — by improving living conditions and economic opportunities in Africa — can reduce the strain on global refugee systems. Instead of dealing with the humanitarian crises that result from forced migration, proactive investment in Africa can mitigate the root causes of displacement. In a nutshell, climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing Africa, disproportionately affecting its economies, food security and population stability. Despite contributing minimally to the problem, African nations are bearing the brunt of climate disasters and have limited resources to cope. Global powers ought to step up and recognize their responsibility in assisting Africa. Supporting climate adaptation efforts on the continent is not just about fairness — it is about securing global economic stability, preventing geopolitical crises and fostering sustainable development for all. In other words, by helping Africa, the world ultimately helps itself.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfscUGRkq78PCVDYOUiYon8	2025-02-13T15:59:09-08:00	
Philippine Agency Recommends Charges Against VP Duterte Over Marc...	By Camille Elemia The Philippines’ top investigative agency is recommending that Vice President Sara Duterte be charged for an alleged threat she made against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. by openly talking about having him and two others assassinated. The potential charges that the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed with the Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) are separate from the upcoming impeachment trial of Duterte, a former ally of Marcos and daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte. The Senate could convene as an impeachment court in July. It’s now up to the DOJ to decide whether to conduct a preliminary investigation and bring charges via the courts against Duterte – the first vice president in the Philippines to be impeached. Duterte committed one count of inciting to sedition and three counts of grave threats, the NBI alleges. If convicted of the potential charges, the vice president could face penalties, including imprisonment. 'The vice president’s threatening statements disrupted peace,' NBI Director Jaime Santiago told a press briefing on Wednesday as the bureau announced that it was recommending charges against Duterte, based on an agency investigation over the past several months. 'It is now in the DOJ’s court whether they will see merits in our findings or they will dismiss it,' Santiago said. In November, Duterte publicly said that she had hired someone to target Marcos as well as first lady Liza Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez – President Marcos’ cousin – in the event she might herself be killed in an assassination plot. Duterte later said that her statement was taken out of context. In response to the NBI’s announcement, Duterte said she was not expecting fair treatment under the justice department of the Marcos administration, as she pointed to the president’s recent statement describing her remarks as inciting 'criminal' acts. 'As expected,' Duterte said in a brief statement on Wednesday. 'You can see the President’s message, stating that he will not tolerate such criminal acts. This shows that the President’s pronouncements already carry a certain bias.' The DOJ said it assigned the case to prosecutors who would determine whether a case could go to court with a 'certainty of conviction.' 'The case will undergo case buildup as needed to assure that there is sufficient evidence and that the respondent is not unduly hauled to court,' the department said in a statement. Inciting to sedition are statements 'that pose a real and imminent threat to public order, regardless of whether actual unrest occurs' while grave threats refer to statements that create 'real and imminent danger to specific persons, regardless of whether actual harm occurs,' the DOJ said. 'The law does not require that an unlawful act be carried out – only that the statement was made with the intent to stir public unrest or disrupt stability,' it added. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Duterte for alleged constitutional violations, plotting to assassinate Marcos, corruption, and other high crimes. Duterte has denied any wrongdoing and blamed her political foes for the issues against her. If the Senate – sitting as an impeachment court – convicts Duterte, she will be removed as vice president and be perpetually disqualified from holding any office. Marcos, Duterte’s running mate in the 2022 national elections, has distanced himself from the impeachment proceedings against Duterte. However, his cousin, Romualdez, and his eldest son, Congressman Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, were among House members who endorsed the complaint against the vice president. On Monday, Senate President Francis Escudero said the impeachment trial could begin after Marcos delivered his annual speech before Congress on July 21. Congress is currently on a break ahead of the midterm elections in May, and will not resume sessions until June 2 – a month after new senators would have been elected. Half of the 24-member Senate, which will decide the vice president’s fate, is up for grabs in the May 12 polls. Duterte’s impeachment marked a dramatic turn. It blew up an already wide-open feud that doomed a once formidable alliance between the politically influential Marcoses and Dutertes during the 2022 general election. The alliance between Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte – both the children of ex-presidents – ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the government to allow an international investigation into the deadly drug war waged by Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. After an all-out feud broke out with President Marcos, Sara Duterte said she was planning to run for president in 2028.

Ukraine From ‘Win-Win’ To ‘Lose-Lose’ Scenario – OpEd	US Seeks Compensation for US Aid for Ukraine. Will NATO members providing aid to Ukraine also seek their Pound or Euro share? 'Ukraine ‘may be Russian someday'; Trump made the comment in an interview on 10th Feb with US broadcaster Fox News, as he discussed the three-year old conflict that has followed Russia’s full-scale invasion. America First : Rising President Trump also reiterated that he wants compensation for the aid the US has provided to Ukraine in the form of access to rare earth minerals.' And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500bn worth of rare earth.' Ukraine, meanwhile, has suggested it is open to an agreement that would see Washington compensated for continued military and financial aid. US National Security Advisor talked about the future of US support for Ukraine in a recent interview, during which he claimed, 'We need to recoup those costs, and that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians in terms of their rare earth, their natural resources, and their oil and gas and also buying ours.' According to a Reuters report on 10th Feb, the US also plans to push European allies to buy more American weapons for Ukraine ahead of potential peace talks with Russia! From 'Non-Refundable Aid' to 'Resource Swaps,' to 'Shared Responsibility' NATO members need to foot the bill. Meaning 'No Free Lunches' on its USAID Menu. The US policy of Resource Swaps that Ukraine offer rare earth minerals as a form of payment for financial support in the Ukraine-Russia is not new. US Senator Lindsey Graham had stated last year that the US stands to financially gain from Ukraine's vast agricultural sector and 'two to seven trillion dollars' worth' of rare earth minerals. 'This war is about money.' Ukraine is the richest country in all of Europe for rare earth minerals. The Truth, the former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken - while speaking in a joint Press Conference with Britain Foreign Secretary: 'If you look at the investments that we made in Ukraine’s defense to deal with this aggression, 90 percent of the security assistance we provided has actually been spent here in the US with our Military-Industrial Complex manufacturers for production, and that’s produced more American jobs, more growth in our own economy'. The Ukrainian Media has also claimed only a third of aid reaches Ukraine. Blinken calls 'US war aid to Ukraine a ‘Win-Win’ that we need to continue. War for Profit.' Victoria Nuland, former US Under Secretary of State said, 'We have to remember that the bulk of this money is going right back into this economy to make those weapons…' (CNN interview) Today, the US has openly put a price tag on its support for Ukraine, the 'US Aid' fully exposes its selfish nature. The US has not made any contributions to resolving the Russia-Ukraine war; instead, it has exploited the situation for its own benefits. Ukraine's rare earth resources and the Europe's arms orders have all become targets for US exploitation. The world is looking up to President Trump’s promise to end the war. ‘Trump Trend’ of ‘Quid Pro Quo’ : 'Seeking their Share' This ‘Trump Trend’ of ‘Quid Pro Quo’ set in motion 'Seeking their Share' will encourage NATO members also 'Seeking their Share.' for providing aid to Ukraine will expect economic returns. Most of the military and economic aid given to Ukraine has been in the form of grants, not loans. Countries like the US, Germany, and the UK have provided billions in military aid, equipment, and financial support without expecting direct repayment or benefits in return so far. NATO members looking at the long-term benefits: Defense Industry Gains: The US and European arms manufacturers are seeing increased demand, both from Ukraine and from NATO countries replenishing their own stockpiles. Reconstruction Contracts: Once the war ends, Ukraine will need massive reconstruction, and Western companies (especially from donor nations) will likely get major contracts. Geopolitical Influence: Strengthening Ukraine against Russia aligns with NATO's broader strategic interests in Europe, reinforcing alliances and deterring future aggression. Frozen Russian Assets: There’s also an ongoing debate about using frozen Russian assets (hundreds of billions held in Western banks) to help Ukraine. If that happens, it might reduce the financial burden on NATO countries. However, President Trump is not likely to endorse this idea. EU Membership: If Ukraine joins the EU, it will integrate more deeply into the European economy, benefiting investors and businesses from NATO nations. Trade, infrastructure, and energy partnerships could emerge, ensuring that supporting Ukraine pays off in the long run. NATO members may not be seeking an immediate 'Pound or Euro' return, they are definitely considering long-term economic, strategic, and political gains. Peace for Ukraine at What Cost? President Trump having spoken to both Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on 12th Feb, and Trump ordered top US officials to begin talks on ending the War in Ukraine. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth He covered the administration’s views on Ukraine’s future borders and defence assurances in Brussels. He made it clear that the US was shifting its focus towards its homeland and the Asia Pacific region, which meant scaling back in Europe! 'We will only end this devastating war – and establish a durable peace', Hegseth told fellow members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 57 countries militarily backing Ukraine, on 12th Feb. A 'Lose-Lose' Scenario for Ukraine: Military Stalemate & Attrition: Despite billions in aid, Ukraine has struggled to achieve major territorial gains. With ammunition shortages and manpower challenges, prolonging the war could weaken Ukraine in the long run. Western Fatigue & Political Shifts :The US and European countries are showing signs of aid fatigue. Political changes the Trump presidency in the US with 'America FirstPolicy' could further reduce support. Economic Strain: Ukraine’s economy is under severe stress, with infrastructure destruction, a declining workforce, and dependence on Western funding. If that support falters, Ukraine could face financial collapse. Russia’s Adaptation: Sanctions haven't crippled Russia as expected. Instead, its economy has adjusted, and its military has adapted to prolonged warfare, making a decisive Ukrainian victory harder. Diplomatic Isolation Risk: If the West US led NATO nations shift toward pressuring Ukraine into negotiations, Ukraine might be forced into a peace deal that doesn't fully restore its territorial integrity, security concerns will leave it in a weakened and vulnerable state. West the US led NATO having raised the bar of a 'Win-Win' situation for Ukraine appears to be leading to a 'Lose-Lose' situation for Ukraine with an interesting shift in the Ukraine conflict's dynamics. Initially, Western support framed the situation as a 'Win-Win' for Ukraine—military aid, economic assistance, and diplomatic backing were supposed to strengthen Ukraine while weakening Russia but it has taken a U Turn with the country devastated in all respects and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rightly has sharply criticized the US proposal to tie future military aid for Ukraine to access to its rare earth resources, calling the move 'Very Egotistic, Very Self-Centered.' Now it is a Wait and Watch Scenario for Zelensky and what future holds for Ukraine and their future is totally dependent on the Trump Administration policies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWegOKASpRXamMoUOrk3WyH_	2025-02-13T09:08:39-08:00
